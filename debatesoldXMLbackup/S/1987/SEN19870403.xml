    <P>Dear Cathaoirleach,</P>
    <P>We have, as you are aware, specially engaged an expert firm of consultants to advise as to how we should proceed in regard to the works that are required in the Senate Chamber.</P>
    <P>It will be some time before we have received the full report of the consultants but, even on the basis of a preliminary examination by them, our worst fears have been confirmed.  This is not merely the elimination of dry rot.  There are serious structural problems which have been inherent in the building for many decades and which have only now come to light as a result of the stripping of the plaster.</P>
    <P>Clearly, our initial hopes that the remedial work would be completed by October, 1987 will not now be realised.  I can give no indication at this stage as to when the work will be completed but it would seem advisable to expect that it will take a long time.  I hope to be in a position to indicate to you just how long when I have received a further report from the consultants.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>B.P. SCULLY,</P>
    <P>Commissioner.</P>

      <P>Arising from that very important letter, I feel that as outgoing Senators we should make preparations for the first sitting day of the incoming Seanad.  It will be an auspicious occasion for those who are re-elected and for the many new Members who will be elected. The facilities available in this House are not adequate for such an occasion and I want to make a formal suggestion by way of motion, or whatever, in the knowledge that I will not be present on that great day.  Because it is such a great day for the House, we should request the Dáil to facilitate the Seanad by making the Dáil Chamber available to the Seanad.  There are not enough seats in this room.  The first sitting day of a new Seanad is always an occasion for Members' spouses and families.  There are only two seats here <Col N="2053" /> for visitors.  I suggest to you, a Chathaoirligh, that the outgoing Seanad should agree unanimously to ask the Dáil, through the Ceann Comhairle, to facilitate us on a day suitable to both the Dáil and the Seanad so that the normal practices on such an occasion may be carried out.  The new Seanad will appreciate that as a final gesture from those of us who are leaving.</P>
      <P>I formally suggest to you, as Cathaoirleach of this Seanad, that you should make the necessary arrangements with the Dáil staff and with the Ceann Comhairle to have the Dáil Chamber made available to the Seanad on a suitable day, either a Monday or a Friday.  It is a very special occasion in the eyes of many people.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to hear that the worst fears of the Office of Public Works were realised.  That was not my initial reaction when I read the letter.  It was that our worst fears were realised. We vacated the premises for how long? More than twelve months?  Coming up to nearly two years?  At this stage, for them to be still assessing the amount of damage, assessing the size of the problem is quite unacceptable.  They are treating this House with total and absolute contempt. It is fashionable to treat the House with contempt, I may say.  As public servants, it is uniquely inopportune for them to do that.  I would like to take this opportunity to protest on behalf of past Members of the Seanad for the way in which the Members of the Seanad are being treated by those in authority, including the Office of Public Works. This is a most unsuitable Chamber.  There are tremendous difficulties with regard to it and judging by the way in which the <Col N="2054" /> work has been allowed to go over a period we shall be shortly into the third year before any work is done.</P>
      <P>The way in which we are being treated is disgraceful and I would not like the opportunity to pass without putting that on the record of the House.  The letter which we have received is a cynical attempt to put on the record of this Seanad something which can be quoted as in some way receiving the approval of this Seanad, so that they can say later they reported it to this Seanad.  As far as I am concerned, they reported it and their report was rejected.  Their explanation is quite inexcusable and unrealistic.  The incoming Seanad should be left in no doubt that the OPW have treated us and are continuing to treat us in a disgraceful fashion.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I wish to say on behalf of the Fine Gael group in this House that we accept this Order of Business.  I would like in doing so to make a comment in regard to the position of the House in meeting today.  It does happen because of the provisions of the Constitution, that the Seanad may meet after the election of a new Dáil.  I want to emphasise today, as has been emphasised both in word and in action in the past, that the powers of this Seanad are in no way diminished by the fact that a new Dáil has been elected.  In the past we have had the case of a Seanad whose time was almost spent amending legislation coming from a new Dáil and indeed has shown its wisdom in doing so in that the new Dáil accepted such an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> Accordingly, our attitude in regard to the business today will be on the merits of what is proposed.  In no way will we consider ourselves as being inhibited by the fact that at the end of next week a new Seanad will be in being.  Of course, in regard to ordinary legislation this is a proper attitude for the Seanad, that if a new Dáil proposes legislation and a subsisting Seanad which is about to pass into history disagrees, then it is entirely appropriate that that Seanad should ask the new Dáil to think again, as has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of Money Bills, there is perhaps less force in this argument.  What we have on the Order Paper today are a number of Bills and a number of orders arising from the budget and, therefore, arising in a financial context. I just wish to indicate on behalf of the Fine Gael group that in this regard we will express our opinions on these matters which will be the opinions we held before the recent election, and we will reserve our position in regard to any variations from the economic and budgetary programme that we put before the electorate during the last election.  It is not our wish in any way to obstruct the new Government but, because these matters come before us now rather than coming before us in two weeks time, they cannot possibly be allowed to inhibit our free discussion in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, let me take the opportunity to congratulate the new Leader of the House.  Before the election has taken place he has moved to the right of me.  I wish him luck and hope that he will have not just this week in that position but many years in the future.  We have always worked well together in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, Senator Cassidy obviously is not here.  If he was here, he would be asking why Item No. 12 is not included.  He asked me over a period of two or three years why that item was not being taken.  I asked the new Leader of the House to further our <Col N="2056" /> interests in this legislation, the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1985.</P>
    <P>Seriously, there is another Bill I ask the new Leader of the House to consider, that is Item No. 13 which had my personal commitment under another Government. Senator Ross will, I am sure, join me in trying to ensure that that legislation is brought forward as quickly as possible by the new Government.  I hope we will have a good, constructive debate in this House and that the vast majority of Members will support it.  The Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, 1984, as it stands on the Order Paper now is a Private Members' Bill and was previously a Government Bill.</P>
    <P>The members of the Labour Party in this House, in this outgoing Seanad, will also adopt a constructive attitude to any legislation that comes before us. However, there are items ordered for today which we will be opposing.  I refer to the question of increasing health contributions and amending the Health Act, 1970, to take account of new hospital charges.  These matters are fundamental to the Labour Party and have always been so.  For that reason I want to tell the Leader of the House that we will be opposing the Second Stage of each of these Bills and will be calling for votes on the various sections.  The Leader of the House would expect nothing less from the Labour Party.  We take a different view on disease eradication levies.  We will not necessarily be opposing that measure but we will be putting our views forward.</P>
    <P>I assure you, Sir, and the Leader of the House that we will be constructive today in dealing with the Order of Business. We do not want to obstruct the new Government in whatever programme they have to put before the people, but it is our duty to point out what we see as anomalies in the Order of Business as they will affect the ordinary people we represent.</P>

On a serious note, I wish to ascertain whether he would see Independent Members getting time to discuss items like No. 13 on the Order Paper which is the Bill dealing with the abolition of hanging which Senator Ferris has mentioned.  Does he see the House in need of any reform at all, does he see himself as following in Senator Dooge's footsteps and having 78 meetings a year and what does he see as the role of the Seanad?</P>

In particular, the Social Welfare Bill and the Health (Amendment) Bill have very serious implications for people.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House understands the constraints under which we are considering these Bills and the fact that we have been recalled on a Friday, but I would ask the Leader of the House, when he is responding to this debate, to indicate the proposed sitting hours.  I would assume that the House will be afforded an opportunity, between Second Stage and Committee Stage, to consider the question of tabling any recommendations to these Bills.  The issues are of extreme importance.  We must have an opportunity to consider fully what is proposed in these measures.</P>

Certain other matters on the Order Paper have been mentioned and I should like to draw attention to item No. 14, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983, which, as the Leader of the House will know, has been waiting around for a very long time and on which action by the previous Government was promised on many occasions.  Any actions to be carried out by that Government obviously have fallen and I should be most interested to know whether this matter will be dealt with rapidly by the incoming Government.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House about this.</P>
      <P>On the Order Paper there is that Bill, there is the Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill and the Freedom of Information Bill.  All three of those Bills were put forward by Independent Senators, and it is necessary to carry on with them. The Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill was already started on Second Stage. I should be interested to know how soon we may expect time to be given to these matters but, in particular, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 which has been before this House for a very long time.  The fact that it is not being dealt with is rapidly becoming a scandal.</P>

      <P>One of the advantages of having a new Leader of the House like Senator Lanigan is that he has expressed over the past few years a commitment to discuss in Seanad Éireann matters of current interest.  He has pressed very strongly for time to discuss matters when they were relevant in the outside world. Bearing in mind that commitment, which no doubt he carries across to the other side of the House, would the Leader of the House consider taking up the suggestion of Senator Robinson with regard to allowing a little time between Second Stage and Committee Stage?  It would allow time for the discussion of the widespread concern at the unfair methods by which the new Government introduced the changes in the housing grants.</P>

      <P>There are a number of people here who seem to be trying to get their names on the record for the last day.  Some of them were not too busy in the last session &mdash; I am not referring to Senator O'Leary.  Before I get to the Order of Business, I should like to say that it is intended to take items Nos. 1 and 2 together.  So as far as the points that have been made are concerned, I should like to give everybody the opportunity to discuss matters of current interest here today, but let us be quite straight about it, there is nobody here who can be sure of being in the new Seanad.  I am Leader for the day and I accept what has been said, by Senator <Col N="2062" /> Dooge in particular, as to the need for a responsible attitude to be taken in relation to legislation that it is necessary to put through.  It is not my intention and never will be if I become Leader of the House &mdash; that we should rush through anything.  This House has relevance despite some people outside thinking otherwise.</P>
      <P>If I am returned here and become Leader of the House I will ensure that adequate time will be allocated to all legislation coming before the House. The position today is that the Dáil passed the Social Welfare Bill on 2 April and we must take all Stages today so that the Bill can be signed on 6 April.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary mentioned the tardiness of the Office of Public Works regarding the refurbishment of the Seanad Chamber proper.  Probably we will see a little more action on that now.  It appears that the problems that arose in the building occupied by the Seanad have now been found in the Library and that that area will have to be vacated.  Since it has taken over 13 months to assess the problems in the Seanad area &mdash; and after 13 months the Office of Public Works feel things have gone out of control &mdash; it will be interesting to see how far the whole structure of this House is affected by dry rot.  The Library and its facilities will have to be moved elsewhere.  When the Library is moved it may transpire that this room will have to be vacated.  The occasion should not be allowed pass without an expression of a motion of no confidence in the assessors of the damage to this building.  We should not allow this opportunity to pass.  They were tardy about the matter and should now act hastily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall sit until business is completed. This does not suit many of us who have quite a number of counties to cover in being re-elected.  I can assure Senators who wish to make points that there will be plenty of time afforded them and that we will sit until business is concluded.  As far as breaking between the Second and Final Stages of the Bills, we will leave that open until we see what way the discussion <Col N="2063" /> progresses.  The Whips can meet and when we see how long the Second Stage will take.</P>
    <P>As far as matters of current interest are concerned, whereas I take the points made we will leave it to the incoming Seanad to discuss how best we can bring forward those matters.  I do not think we should get involved in that today.  The points made will be taken into account by the incoming Seanad.</P>
    <P>As far as the items that have been mentioned are concerned the &mdash; Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983, the abolition of the death penalty and Item No. 12 &mdash; Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1985 &mdash; perhaps Members would be lenient with us today.  I will endeavour to see that these matters will be brought forward as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As a <i>pro tem</i> Leader I should like to thank the outgoing Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, for the courtesy and consideration he showed me as Leader of the Opposition.  Equally I should like to compliment Senator Ferris, when in the Chair, for the courtesy he afforded our side of the House.  On numerous occasions when problems arose they were discussed in an open manner and the House benefited therefrom.  Since it is the Cathaoirleach's last day in the Chair I should like to thank him for the enormous amount of work he put into the smooth running of the outgoing Seanad.  I wish him a very happy retirement and, without plugging any particular body, I sincerely hope that the family name continues to adorn this House.  I should like to thank Mr. Jack Tobin who will be retiring.  He has given many years of service to this House.  I wish him well in his retirement. I know that he will be missed, fatherly figure that he is he made himself available to all of us.  Without mentioning all the other members of the staff I should like to thank them &mdash; ushers, official reporters and the press.  I can guarantee that <i>The Irish Press</i> will continue to be slated by me if they continue to ignore this House. I am not talking about the press generally, I am taking about <i>The Irish Press</i> group, which might not help me on <Col N="2064" /> Sunday if I am looking for a plug for my re-election campaign.

Indeed I hope that the family name will be represented in the membership of the next Seanad as well.</P>
      <P>It is an honour to address this House on this important motion relating to health contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsections 2 and 3 of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provide that the Minister for Health may vary the rate of contribution and the income <Col N="2065" /> ceiling which determines the amount payable by an individual in a particular contribution year.  Subsection 5 of section 9 of the Act requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It also requires that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft regulations has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations now before the House propose to vary the rate as well as the income ceiling.  The regulations shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1987.</P>
    <P>The income ceiling is at present £14,000.  It is proposed to raise this to £15,000.  It is proposed to vary the rate figure from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The income ceiling has been varied each year in line with increases in average earnings in transportable goods industries. The rate figure has remained at 1 per cent since the introduction of the income-related scheme in April 1979. Non-capital health expenditure in 1979 amounted to £505 million.</P>
    <P>This expenditure increased to £1,194 million in 1986.  The high cost of maintaining existing health services leaves me with no alternative but to propose the increases now before the House.</P>
    <P>All persons over 16 years of age, with an income, are liable for health contributions. However, persons who generally are held not to be able to afford the contribution are exempt.  Medical card holders are exempt.  Persons in receipt of a social welfare widow's pension, a deserted wife's allowance or benefit or a social assistance allowance as an unmarried mother are also exempt.</P>
    <P>I have taken into account &mdash; as required by the Act &mdash; the latest information available regarding changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries.  The latest information we have relates to June 1986. Average weekly earnings in June 1986, were £184.42.  This represents an increase of 6.02 per cent on the June 1985 figure of £173.94.  When this is applied to the current ceiling of £14,000, a new ceiling of £14,843 or say £15,000 emerges.  The <Col N="2066" /> effect of the increased ceiling is to increase the maximum amount of health contributions payable by persons with incomes in excess of £14,000 per annum. Persons with incomes of £14,000 or less will not be affected by this increase.</P>
    <P>These rate and ceiling changes will increase the maximum contribution payable from £140 to £187.50, an increase of £47.50 per annum.  While all contributors will be affected by the proposed rate increase, only those with incomes of £15,000 or more will pay the maximum increase of £47.50.  The additional charge on a person with an income, of say, £10,000 per annum will be £25 or 48 pence per week.</P>
    <P>These changes will bring in approximately £23 million in the contribution year 1987-1988.  Of this, about £13 million should arise in the financial year 1987. The remainder of the additional yield will come in the first quarter of 1988.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of current health contributions from all sectors. Health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from farmers for periods up to 6 April 1984.</P>
    <P>The total amount owed by farmers to health boards at 31 December 1986 stood at £6.4 million.  While the amount still outstanding is cause for concern there has been an encouraging response in recent years to the efforts of the health boards to collect these arrears.  Senators will be aware that health boards can retain these arrears, including any such arrears collected in future years, as additional revenue to be applied to local health service needs.  This arrangement will be of continued benefit to health boards' budgets.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the self employed, including farmers to ensure that their health contributions are fully paid without delay.  I need hardly remind members that these contributions represent extremely good value for money and are an essential element of the moneys required to maintain the existing high standard of our health services.</P>
    <P>I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free consultants' services.  I am <Col N="2067" /> not in a position as yet to say what this limit will be.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to make one suggestion to the House.  We will shortly have ample opportunity to discuss fully the charges for in-patient and outpatient health services which were announced in the budget.  Consequently I would suggest that discussions on the motion now before the House should be confined solely to health contribution issues.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has proposed in Items Nos. 1 and 2 today is, as he indicated, of somewhat narrow scope.  It is concerned with the question of the level of the health contribution and with the income limits.  Since these proposals were part of the Fine Gael proposals for a budget, on which Fine Gael fought the last election, it would be opportunism of the rankest kind for the Fine Gael group in the Seanad to oppose what the Minister is putting before us today.  Consequently we do not intend to oppose what he is suggesting here in Items No. 1 and 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few comments which I should nonetheless make.  It was with the utmost regret that the Fine Gael Ministers in Government and the succeeding Fine Gael Government came to the conclusion that in the dire economic situation in which we found ourselves such changes under the health code were necessary. This prompts me to pay tribute to the former Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, for his efforts over the past four years at a cost of personal unpopularity in order to try to ensure that value would be obtained for the large amount of money which was being spent on health services.  In what Deputy Barry Desmond has done the present Minister has a headline which he can well follow. It will not be easy and it was not easy for Deputy Barry Desmond and it will not over the next decade or so be easy for any Minister for Health to grapple with this problem of the vast amounts of <Col N="2068" /> money which are being spent in this area. We can agree with what has been proposed today because what the Minister is proposing is the levying of all for health purposes.  When the time comes to discuss the question of other charges which are not, strictly speaking, part of what is proposed today but which were mentioned by the Minister in his speech, we may well take a different attitude.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is true, but the story is often told that under an ancient Chinese custom one paid a fee to one's doctor when one was well and stopped paying the fee when one was sick.  In western civilisation we pay fees to our doctors when we are sick and not when we are well.  There is a great deal to be said for that Chinese attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as what the Minister is proposing to us today is a levy of all persons who are working, he is following, as it were, the Chinese philosophy in this regard.  I can say on behalf of the Fine Gael group that as long as he adheres to this Chinese approach to the problem, an approach adopted in the Fine Gael budget which was never carried into effect and which we propounded in the course of the election, he will receive our support but when he deviates from the Chinese custom, this may be a different story.</P>
      <P>The question of special levies on those unfortunate enough to be sick and on those unfortunate enough to require hospitalisation is another matter and nothing that I or any member of my group says today must be taken as approval of that. There is a tendency to think that what was brought in in the Fianna Fáil budget was almost completely proposed by Fine Gael, but there are essential differences. The charging of in-patients is one essential difference.  The question of housing grants raised earlier today is another difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome heartily the thrust of the budget of which these particular regulations are an outflow.  We welcome the determination with which the new <Col N="2069" /> Government have grasped the problems of the economy.  We only regret that the support which we offered them in this endeavour was not forthcoming from them as a party when we were grappling with the same problems.  There are significant differences between the budget Fianna Fáil brought forward and that which Fine Gael would have brought forward if returned to office but as the Minister has indicated this is not the time for them to be discussed.  There will be another opportunity.  I will not be here but others will be to put forcibly to the Minister our points of difference. Accordingly, in regard to the question of the increase from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent in the levy and the increase in the income limit, as far as the Fine Gael group are concerned there will not be opposition in this House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Leyden on his appointment as Minister of State in the area of health, a very important area which affects the lives of everyone.  It is certainly an area which will need a lot of attention in the years ahead.  I know that Deputy Leyden will give it his utmost in the years in which he holds the position as Minister of State in that Department.</P>
      <P>I wish you well a Chathaoirligh, in your retirement.  Senator Dooge referred to the word &ldquo;opportunism&rdquo;.  I should like to pay a very warm tribute to Senator Dooge for his work in the Seanad during the past few years.  Opportunism is not a word I would connect with him.  He seldom, if ever, seized an opportunity to embarrass or upset anybody on the Order of Business.  I found him extremely helpful and fair at all times and I wish him well when he leaves the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge said his party would not oppose these measures.  This is consistent with what we did when we were on the other side.  We did not like what was happening then and do not like what is happening today but who does?  We are in a very tough economic situation.  We know tough measures have to be taken in all areas of Government.  When I was spokesman on health the common <Col N="2070" /> denominator during the past four years was that we nodded through and supported the Government in increasing the ceiling every year.  If you examine the records you will find that is accurate.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister is endeavouring to increase the income ceiling from £14,000 to £15,000 and to vary the rate figure from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent. The ceiling has been raised over the years.  The hope this year is that these charges will bring in £23 million in a full year or £13 million in the financial year, 1987.  What would the effect be if there were no ceiling to this contribution?  Perhaps the Minister might give a brief reply to that.</P>
    <P>Obviously the collection of the money is important.  It is one thing to make the order, but it is another thing to collect the money.  Every effort should be made to get people who owe this levy to pay it. Up to April 1984, the responsibility for collecting the arrears was deemed to be part and parcel of the affairs and the administration of the health boards. Since April 1984 it has been collected through the Revenue Commission.  I understand that at present the arrears are over £100 million.  Are the Revenue Commissioners serious about this aspect of their new role?  Are they giving the same attention to the collection of this levy as to other levies and taxes.  Perhaps the Minister will reply to that query.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the exercise is to produce finance to help to maintain the existing health services.  Nobody in this room, including the Minister of State, is happy about this increase but the high cost of maintaining the existing health services is a reality of life and we are faced with the increases now before the House.  We do not wish to hold up unduly the passage of these draft regulations. We did not do so when we were in Opposition. My role today is to support the Government in their efforts.  When we were in Opposition we supported what the Government were doing in this area and knowing Senator Dooge as I do, I am sure his party will also support the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in wishing you, a Chathaoirligh, the best of health and happiness in your retirement. You are not going forward in the coming election and effectively, this will be your last day as Cathaoirleach.  I thank you for the courtesy you always extended to me and to the members of my party and the fairness with which you operated the business of the House as did Senator Dooge in his role as Leader of the House. It was a privilege to work with both of you.  The next House will be a poorer place because neither will be a member of it.  I also join with previous speakers in congratulating the new Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Terry Leyden, who is a very good friend of mine.  He will make an excellent Minister of State.  He has a very difficult task ahead of him because the Department are one of the big spenders and as such touch the lives of many people in our community.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister did not welcome his first task in bringing these unpalatable orders before the House.  We are discussing items No. 1 and 2 together but I take it we will be dealing with the two draft orders separately.  Consistent with what I said on the Order of Business we will have different attitudes to both drafts.  I will deal with item No. 2 first because other members of the Labour Party want to elaborate on our attitude towards increasing the level at which the cut-off in contribution takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Fallon said, we were used to an increase in the limits at which the levy was collectable every year.  This was normally carried out in conjunction with the consultants who immediately at the cut-off point &mdash; the point that was agreed and discussed with them &mdash; started to charge people for operative procedures in a hospital.  This was usually the point at which VHI took over.  The Labour Party have no objection in principle to having no limit to what a person may contribute to the health services through the PAYE and PRSI systems.  We feel that a good service should be paid for by people who can afford it.  People with incomes of £15,000 and over could help <Col N="2072" /> to pay for this service through the VHI system and the 1 per cent levy.  We would have no objection to raising the cut-off point on the basis that people who could really afford to pay for this service could pay for it without creating hardship.  This is why we adopt a different attitude to the raising of that cut-off point.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister admitted that, as of today, he has not reached agreement with the consultants on where they will start to charge people.  We do not know if the consultants are prepared to operate the system from a figure of £15,000 or whether they will insist on a lesser sum.  As soon as the cut-off point is increased the consultants ability to charge people is decreased.  When Brendan Corish, a previous leader of our party, was Minister for Health, he tried to bring in a health service for everybody. A difficulty arose because the consultants insisted on still having a category of people who they were entitled to charge fees over and above the normal hospital entitlement.  We will discuss this in the legislation which will come before us later today.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with Item No. 1 and put down a marker from the Labour Party that we could not support an increase in the contributions from 1 per cent of one's income to 1.25 per cent.  We oppose this on the basis that literally it is another form of taxation in disguise.  It increases the amount of money the PAYE sector will be paying into the coffers of the State for what will now be a diminishing service.  For the 1 per cent at least, they had a free hospital service &mdash; I will not go into that at the moment &mdash; but now they are paying more for a lesser service.  It is an imposition on the PAYE sector especially when we take that imposition in conjunction with the Minister's admission that arrears of the 1 per cent charge to health boards from the self-employed up to the date the Revenue Commissioners took charge of the collection amounted to the staggering figure of £6.4 million.</P>
    <P>Are we serious about maintaining a health service which we will require at some future date, and which we all aspire <Col N="2073" /> to provide for our people?  Do we recognise the problems health boards have faced in the past?  I was a member of a health board for eight or nine years and I lived from day to day trying to balance a fairly restricted budget from previous Ministers, including Minister Barry Desmond to whom tributes have rightfully been paid.  At least Deputy Desmond was specific when he pointed out areas in which savings could take place but I have my doubts that there has been a concerted effort to itemise specifically where these cutbacks in the health service will take place to balance the budget announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry on budget day.  In the budget speech the Minister said he anticipated that these charges would contribute £11 million extra to the Exchequer.  In the speech of the Minister of State today, this figure increased to £13 million for the rest of this year and there will be an amount even larger in 1988.  I seriously question the budget figures that have been given to us when a week later there seems to be a discrepancy of £2 million or £3 million which it is hoped will be covered by this order.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried that this will be an increasing burden on people, and that no serious effort has been made by this Government to try to collect outstanding money, in the region of £6.4 million, from people who owe it.  People who could have paid the 1 per cent have refused to do so or their farm leaders have advised them not to pay it, which is a tragedy.  Responsible farm leaders have created a situation where genuine farmers, wanting to pay their contributions for what they consider a good service, still owe £6.4 million to the Exchequer. Today we are increasing the take from the PAYE sector who have no means of avoiding payment because it is automatically taken by their employer.  We have washed our hands of the anomaly this will create and have worsened the urban/rural divide where the PAYE sector feel the self-employed can get away without paying the 1 per cent levy. The new Government, in trying to balance the budget, recommended an <Col N="2074" /> increase in the existing rate from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Everybody here is being co-operative today.  Senator Dooge has followed a consistent line.  He said the Fine Gael Government agreed to these figures as they felt they were part of budget.  It was on figures like this that the Labour Party were forced to leave Government.  How could I be consistent if I did not oppose the concept of an additional £13 million from the PAYE sector towards a diminishing health service?  I wish to be consistent and that is why I laid fairly in front of the Minister our reasons for opposing this measure.  We feel it is an additional tax on people who cannot afford it, who have no option but to pay it, unlike the private sector, and who are paying more for a diminishing service.</P>
    <P>I know there are efficient ways of running hospitals and health boards because I have been part of that process and have tried to contribute efficiently and constructively under four different Ministers for Health.  I always had difficulty ensuring that the service continued.  I know the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, will have major difficulties to face, but it is an easy way out for him to increase the contribution by 25 per cent in the knowledge that it will be collected directly from the PAYE sector, who cannot avoid it &mdash; and we all know they do not want to avoid it &mdash; while the private sector who have the ability to pay, decide not to pay their fair share towards a very fundamental service for all.  It is in everyone's interest that the service be maintained and that a hospital service be available, so that when people get sick they have some place to go.  I am against the principle of using the easy option to get money from the PAYE sector while the other sectors have not paid their fair share.</P>
    <P>The health levy is based on gross pay. The farming community objected to paying it on the basis that there was certain anomalies in the system and they could not write off capital investment as expenditure.  As chairman of a board at the time, I met farm leaders to explain that the system being used was the same <Col N="2075" /> as that for the PAYE sector, that is, that the levy was paid on a gross figure and that had nothing to do with income tax. I will be unable to convince them now to pay this extra levy because it is another form of taxation, an increase in taxation towards the health service for which they feel they have already paid.  I am unable on this occasion to support item No. 1 but I have no objection, in principle, to item No. 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of Health and hope that he will be very successful.  I also wish to join with the other speakers in wishing a happy retirement to all those who are not going forward for re-election to the Seanad. Now that they have got rid of the burden of this high office, I hope they will have a very happy retirement.  I also wish success to the many people who are contesting the elections.</P>
      <P>I know it would not be the Minister's wish to have to come to the Seanad on his first occasion looking for money, but everybody realises the problems facing the economy and know that health services, like the other services, cost a lot of money.  In order to maintain those services, and perhaps in some instances to provide new services, we have this motion before us for an increase in health service charges.  It is expected that £23 million will be taken in a year.  It will cost those with an income of £15,000 an extra £47.50 per annum and people with an income of £10,000 will pay an extra £25 per annum, or 48p per week.  It is not a great increase when you look at it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody likes to have to pay more for these services.  Yet, they affect the lives of all our people.  It is very important that those health services should be maintained and improved upon.  Over the years the outgoing Government were criticised for curtailing many of the services. Two that I can remember very distinctly are the opthalmic service and the adult dental service.  I hope that in the course of time the new Government <Col N="2076" /> will be able to reintroduce such services because there is a great demand for them at present.  There is quite an amount of wastage in certain sections and perhaps that could be looked at closely, particularly in the prescribing of drugs.  I have always considered that there has been wastage there and that many drugs have been prescribed and supplied to people and have never been used.  Those drugs are very expensive and something should be done to minimise the wastage in that area.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult job to run the services but I hope the Government will tackle it with the same determination that they have shown since they were re-elected to office.  In particular I hope they will tackle the problem on the £6.4 million in outstanding arrears.  It is deplorable that that situation should be allowed to continue. I hope the Government and the health boards will succeed in collecting that £6.4 million or at least the greater proportion of it, as that is a quarter of what they hope to take in a full year under these new arrangements.  Arrears, if they are legally due to the health boards or the Department of Health, should be paid.</P>
    <P>If people get away with the idea that they can get off the hook and that they will not be forced to pay those charges which they are legally liable for they are not going to pay.  It is up to the Government to show the same determination in collecting this £6.4 million as they showed towards the collection of the outstanding fees which were due from the ESB and others.  At the same time, I would not like to see any hardship imposed on anyone. Medical card holders are not liable for these charges and will be entitled to all of the services free of charge.  Those who can afford to pay for the services should pay.  As I said, my main point is that every effort should be made to collect the arrears of £6.4 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as I appreciate that we still have a good deal of business to get through.  First, I would like to join with other Members of <Col N="2077" /> the House in wishing you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Clerk very long and happy retirements.</P>
      <P>Turning to the business before us, I would like to begin by congratulating the Minister on his appointment and to wish him a long and fruitful sojourn in his office.  It is unfortunate that he has to come before us so soon in his new office with the proposals which are before us today.  I have to say that like other Members I cannot bring myself to feel that this is the right way to go about it.  No matter what you call them, these contributions are in effect a tax and they are quite clearly income tax.  They are the worst kind of income tax because there are no reductions or concessions to take account of ability to pay.  In fact, it is an income tax upside down.  There is no concession for people on lower incomes and the contribution stops at a certain figure.  This year it goes up to £15,000.  It is, as I said, the worst possible form of tax.</P>
      <P>When you also take into account that there is a similar type of arrangement operating for social welfare, PRSI and so on, along with the actual system which is called income tax, you can see that we have allowed a higgledy-piggledy revenue collection system to grow up over the years.  Not surprisingly, then, we find that overall our system of taxation and expenditure is riddled with anomalies and inconsistencies and therefore with all kinds of injustices to particular individuals and groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very short time since the new Government were elected they have not yet had the opportunity to tackle the question of fundamental reforms in the system but I would urge the Minister in discussion with his colleagues to think again from first principles about how he wants to go about these matters.  At the earliest possible date he should get rid of this kind of contribution.  If you want to collect money on the basis of people's incomes, do so but do so under the income tax code.  If you have to make special arrangements for the self-employed or farmers or any other group, do so but have only one tax collection <Col N="2078" /> system rather than have all these bits and pieces tacked on with various names.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked us not to discuss the question of the charges for in-patient and out-patient services but since I will not be a Member of the new House I will not have the opportunity of discussing them at a later date.  Therefore, very briefly, I would simply point out that the effects of increasing the contribution rate from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent and the rate of the income ceiling taken in conjunction with the imposition of a £10 per day charge for hospital services are bearing on a group who are most severely caught by the various pressures at present.</P>
    <P>Typically, you would expect that it would be many of the workers in these income categories who would have no VHI contributions.  The Government have indicated they will not operate this £10 charge until they have had an opportunity to introduce a special VHI arrangement but in effect what are you saying?  You are saying that under another name you are going to look for another form of contribution from this category.  Therefore, if you look at the way in which these changes in the health area are coming into effect you will see that they are hitting a group of people, income earners and so on, who are among the groups who are finding it most difficult to make ends meet at present.  That is unfortunate and it is an anomaly which the Government should set out to try to remedy at the earliest opportunity.  In other words, I do not think it adds up to a set of arrangements which are in any sense distributing the sacrifices in a fair or evenhanded manner.</P>
    <P>While we must of necessity go along with what is before the House today I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my disagreement and dissent to this type of approach and to urge the Minister, when he has the opportunity, to deal with this question from first principles, especially in the health area.  If there must be a drive towards economies I suggest that most of it should lie in the direction of trying to introduce direct charges for particular elements of <Col N="2079" /> the service such as the use of drugs and so on.  I do not wish to elaborate on that question today and I will have to avail of opportunities outside the House to debate some of these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ferris has said, the Labour Party will be opposing the increase in the rate of health contributions proposed by the Minister today.  Before going any further, I, too, would like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.</P>
      <P>I think all of us would agree that there is an inbuilt upward pressure on health expenditure not only in Ireland but in all economies and that the level of health expenditure is obviously a matter of concern to the Government as it would be to any Government.  I suggest that the way this problem can be handled best is by doing something which I am sure the Government would find ideologically not to their liking.  The way to bring about reasonable control over health care expenditure is by unifying the system, by moving towards a health care system which does away with the distinctions which now exist between public and private treatment, which withdraws all subsidy and support for private hospital care and which offers a unified option to the entire population.  Linked to that, if we are concerned with getting health care expenditure under control, we must move towards a salary based system of payment, particularly to doctors but to others, in the service.  I have no doubt that the system of payment on the basis of fee per item of service is a recipe by which the medical profession can write their own incomes, and they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From any economic perspective which would contain with it a sense of social equity, the way to bring health care costs under control is to move towards a unified single health care system supported by public funds.  If after that, any group of doctors, or individuals, wish to have an alternative health care system, of course, there is nothing we can do about that but we can ensure that not one penny of the public's money goes into that system. <Col N="2080" /> That is the alternative which the Labour Party offer to this question of spiralling health care expenditure.  It is the most socially just way.  I suggest also &mdash; and this is borne out by many economists who have written on the matter &mdash; it is the most economic way.</P>
    <P>The alternative being proposed today rather than tackling the fundamental problem of lack of control over health care costs and expenditure, represents a further dumping of the cost of this on the PAYE sector in particular.  What we are being asked to do is to increase the contributions which the PAYE sector will pay at a time when it seems not to be within the wit or ability of the Government to collect £6.4 million which is outstanding from farmers who, I suggest, are readily identifiable.  If they are not, it escapes me why they are not.  If they are readily identifiable, as I think, it escapes me why they are not brought to court and made to pay the £6.4 million which is outstanding.  It is, in many ways, an insult of the worst kind to those in the PAYE sector to say, &ldquo;we are not able or we do not wish to collect outstanding payments from the self-employed, including farmers, but because you are an easy touch and because we have a system in place we will instead collect the money from you&rdquo;.  That is outrageous.</P>
    <P>This type of approach is not confined to the health services.  What is being proposed today &mdash; Senator O'Donoghue is quite right in describing the health contributions as no more than a form of earmarked taxation &mdash; in so far as PAYE people are concerned in the area of health contributions cannot be divorced from other proposals.  For example, we know that the failure to increase tax bands, and tax allowances, in the income tax code will lead to an increase of 12 per cent in income tax take by the Exchequer this year.</P>
    <P>Now not only will the health contribution rise automatically with incomes as it has done every year since it was introduced but on top of that there will be a further percentage increase over and above the normal increase that will accrue through increased earnings.  On <Col N="2081" /> top of that again there will be a third tax which we will discuss later, a tax on being sick.  This is the height of madness, it is regressive, reprehensible and, as I said earlier, an insult to the PAYE workers. That is why it is impossible for any sensible person concerned with matters of justice to support this health contribution increase in the context of a massive increase in income taxation overall for the entire population this year and in the context of a third tax, a tax on being sick. I certainly would be voting against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to contributions, as Senator Ferris said earlier, is in terms of a ceiling on income and is something I would agree with, but the reality is that the Government are in the position of poachers becoming gamekeepers with a vengeance.  One of this morning's papers comparing Deputy MacSharry's budget with the one proposed by the Coalition said the Coalition wielded an axe but Deputy MacSharry wielded a chainsaw.  Unfortunately, the axe was was wielded by Fine Gael and Labour in Government &mdash; and I make a distinction between Fine Gael and Labour in Government and Fine Gael in Government on their own &mdash; caught more people in its swing than Deputy MacSharry's chainsaw.  The reality is that a demand will be made on the PAYE sector for increased hospital contributions on the basis that when a person pays them that person still will not get them.  I can understand why Minister Leyden asks us not to discuss in-patient or out-patient charges in conjunction with this measure: it is obviously embarrassing and inconvenient but one cannot look at this in isolation.  We are not saying to the workers, &ldquo;give us another 25 per cent and we will improve the health service&rdquo; but we are saying &ldquo;there is a Catch-22 situation here and if after you pay us the increased charges you are unfortunate enough to get sick and must go to hospital, you must pay again&rdquo;.  I do not think there is a country in Europe laying claim to social justice would concoct such a system.  Senator Dooge mentioned a Chinese philosopher but I suggest that if <Col N="2082" /> this legislation was introduced in Peking there would be wall posters the size of O'Connell Street condemning the Government.</P>
      <P>This is not just regressive, as Senator O'Mahony said but it is absolutely and totally fraudulent to demand more money from people who this year, despite all the bleatings of politicians in relation to the PAYE sector, will have to pay more money for a health service which they will have to pay for again.  Senator Fallon said something in his contribution which I took with a grain of salt.  He gave the impression that in the last four and a half years we had from Fianna Fáil a measure of benign neglect, that they allowed us to do this, that and the other. But in reality it was quite different. Deputy Barry Desmond was Minister for Health and people, in retrospect of course with 20/20 vision, paid tribute to his courage and his foresight in doing some of the things he did but when he made quite simple suggestions they were turned around by the then Opposition to be something quite different.  For example, there was a suggestion made by him when he was Minister for Health that administrators in hospitals rather than bringing people in for tests on Thursday and not being seen by a doctor until Monday should call them in on the day the hospital was ready to carry out those tests.  Fianna Fáil said in the Dáil and the newspapers, that now the position was that according to the Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, people could only get sick at a convenient time, especially in regard to weekends.  Everybody, including Fianna Fáil &mdash; they are not suddenly endowed now with a very fine intelligence &mdash; know then what the Minister was trying to do but rather than support him they took the completely opposite line.  Now the traps and snares of Opposition have been put away and the double barrel shotgun has been taken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not embarrass the member of the Government present by reading the statements made on the last Appropriations Bill not just in relation to health or the construction industry but on the <Col N="2083" /> economy in general, but the reality is that no-one can justify these increased contributions.  There is no element of social justice in this.  Fine Gael have yet to make up their minds whether they are to be totally invisible in Opposition or agree hook, line and sinker with what the Government are doing.  In the last few days Fine Gael spokesmen in the Dáil have attacked the Government about their budgetary proposals yet when it came to a vote on these matters Fine Gael took to the hills.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which to get money.  Senator O'Mahony mentioned one aspect, the vested interest of the medical profession, particularly consultants. Who are they to decide who they can treat?  They decide into what tier a person falls.  The old inscription on the Statute of Liberty was &ldquo;give me your poor and your sick&rdquo;.  The consultants say &ldquo;give me your sick but very wealthy and we will treat them&rdquo;.  The State carries the can for the rest of the people.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that Fianna Fáil will take on this group.  They have only been in office for a few weeks but there are already indications that they are looking for vested interests to bow to.  The abolition of the land tax is a good example of that.  In a leading article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> it was stated that massive fraud was uncovered.  Land had been vested in greyhounds and in children.  The 150 inspectors have discovered for the first time who really owns the land.  Who were receiving the farm grants?  We all know that it is impossible to find an area in farming which is not grant-aided.  In the Dáil the Minister stated that social welfare fraud was costing £4 million a year.  As a Government they do not appear to have their priorities right. There is massive fraud in the area of farm grants and payments.  We all know about their non-payment of health contributions. When the former Minister, Deputy Desmond, tried to make farmers pay no-one screamed louder than the people now in Government.  They said it was unfair.  The said a farmer's pockets <Col N="2084" /> would be checked while he was being taken into a hospital's accident and emergency unit.</P>
    <P>Why was a figure of £15,000 picked?  Is there a reason for that?  Why was it not £18,000 or £19,000?  Who decided on the figure?  The Minister said they would talk to the consultants.  Who will consult with whom?  Who will say at what level people should pay health contributions?  Will it be the Government elected by the people or a small band of privileged and powerful people?  We cannot accept fudge from anyone on this issue.  There can be no justification for any of the Opposition parties supporting this measure.</P>

      <P>The Senator said that the previous Fine Gael Government put forward these proposals and that in the circumstances they would not oppose them. Senator Fallon asked some interesting questions.  The additional amount raised by abolishing the ceiling would be minimal. It would only affect people with an income of over £15,000 and only that part of their income which was over £15,000. It was so marginal that we decided not to increase the level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator Ferris' point there is a difference between health contributions and eligibility.  Eligibility for free consultancy services will be adjusted from 1 June and regulations will be brought before this House prior to that date.  At that stage the Seanad will have an opportunity to discuss this matter <Col N="2085" /> again.  As regards outstanding arrears, the health boards collected £1.4 million arrears in 1985 and £1.1 million in 1986. They are continuing to pursue outstanding amounts.  The arrears collected go towards funding the health boards and will be of assistance to them in funding services.</P>
    <P>Senators Ferris and O'Mahony mentioned the overall cost of the health services. The level has not been increased since 1979.  Now it is being increased by 25 per cent.  The cost of services have increased from £500 million to over £1,100 million in 1986.  It can be seen from that that there was little alternative to increasing charges.  We had no choice because of the escalating cost of the health services.</P>
    <P>We have a health service equal to that of any other in the world.  It is second to none.  All the levels of health expenditure are currently being monitored and we are taking an indepth look at the overall cost of the health services.  We are extremely concerned about this.  Senator Magner made some political points about the budget.  The country is in a serious position. The previous Government were not <Col N="2086" /> able to deal with it.  The national debt has increased to £24 billion.  Someone has to take hard decisions.  It has been left to a minority Fianna Fáil Government to do so.  We are not shirking our responsibility. It is now left to a minority Fianna Fáil Government to take the hard decisions.  We are not shirking that responsibility.  That responsibility has been shirked over the past four and a half years when we were not prepared to face up to the realities of life.  It is a very difficult task for a minority Fianna Fáil Government.  We are putting forward these charges and other charges in an attempt to deal with the situation.  We would prefer an Irish Government to take those hard decisions rather than have them imposed on this country from outside. That is why we have to increase the charges from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent. We regret having to do that on this occasion.  However, we have no alternative but to grasp the nettle at this stage, to take the hard decisions and face the consequences.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to thank you for your good wishes.  I would like to return my good wishes to you and any of the Senators who are contesting the current Seanad election.  I believe that it is the most arduous and difficult of all election campaigns.  I would like at the outset to thank the House for its cooperation in having this Bill to implement the budget changes in social welfare services, debated at short notice.  I appreciate the pressures Senators must be under at the present time in the run-up to the Seanad elections and I would like to place on record my appreciation for their cooperation in considering this Bill today. As the House will know a number of provisions in the Bill are due to come into effect from next Monday and it is essential to have this legislation enacted this week.  It is a consequence of the budget being so late this year that there <Col N="2088" /> is not more opportunity to consider the Bill.</P>
      <P>Many of the provisions in the Bill have already been the subject of much debate during the long run-up to the General Election so Senators will be quite familiar with them.  We all know that difficult decisions must be taken in the interests of stimulating employment and creating a new base from which we can further improve our social services.  However, I am confident that, even in the present difficult situation we have succeeded in maintaining the real value of the basic social welfare payments protecting the interests of those most in need.  I hope that Senators will accept my assurances in this regard and look forward to constructive and favourable consideration of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The general framework of this Bill was already more or less fixed by the previous Government.  The following measures aimed at reducing social welfare expenditure in line with the estimates prepared by the previous Government were contained in their budget proposals:</P>
      <P>1.  The 3 per cent of living increase in the value of social welfare payments to be delayed until November this year;</P>
      <P>2.  Pay-related benefit for new claimants to be reduced to 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>3.  The duration of unemployment benefit to be reduced from 15 months to 12 months with a consequent loss of pay-related benefit also.</P>
      <P>4.  More restrictive conditions to be introduced for unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity allowances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  increase the number of waiting days for which a PRSI contributor does not get disability benefit, when out sick, from three to six days;</P>
      <P>(b)  introduce six waiting days for disability benefit claims which follow a period of maternity;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  increase the number of contributions required to qualify for disability benefit beyond 12 months and <Col N="2089" /> for invalidity pension from 156 (three years) to 260 (five years);</P>
    <P>(d)  increase the number of contributions required to qualify for benefit from 26 to 39.</P>
    <P>The previous Government were taking all the above measures to effect savings contained in the abridged Estimates for 1987.  The present Fianna Fáil Government, while accepting the need to contain the growth of social welfare expenditure considered some of these measures too harsh.  We could not accept the reduction in unemployment benefit from 15 months to 12 months or the increase in waiting days for sick PRSI contributors from three to six days.  We considered that the increase to five years in the contributions required to qualify for disability benefit beyond 12 months and for invalidity pension was too severe and we decided to increase this requirement to four years.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our commitments during the general election we decided that the witholding of the 3 per cent cost of living increase until November would involve undue hardship for widows, old age pensioners, the sick, the disadvantaged and the unemployed. Accordingly, we have brought this increase forward to July.  Before I discuss these measures in detail, together with the improvements in the family income supplement and the extension in treatment benefits to dependent spouses of insured workers, I would like to outline the general context in which the social welfare provisions in the budget must be considered.</P>
    <P>First, the need to address the economic problems which the country now faces is a priority for this Government.  There is a broad consensus on the strategy which must be adopted to tackle these problems. However, the achievement of the country's economic objectives in the years ahead will undoubtedly require sacrifices from all sectors of society.  We have to look very closely at all elements of Government expenditure to ensure that the resources available are directed in the most effective way.  At the same time it is of paramount importance that the <Col N="2090" /> burden of attaining our economic objective is not borne by disadvantaged groups in our society and we must have regard at all times to the need to protect these groups.  I believe that the measures contained in this Bill indicate this Government's commitment and determination in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to social welfare specifically, there are major issues to be addressed in the years ahead.  Many of those issues have been highlighted very clearly in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare published last year. These affect both the structure and the operation of the social welfare system. The extent to which we are able to address these issues will naturally be affected by the financial constraints under which we have to operate, but it is my intention to address them and to introduce such reforms as are necessary and feasible.  We must accept that there are limits to what it is possible to achieve in a given period and we will have to be realistic in setting our priorities.</P>
    <P>More than 27 per cent of our total social security budget is spent on unemployment payments.  This is an intolerable burden for the nation to bear and seriously reduces our capacity to improve and develop the social services we have. The problem in the short term is one of how to maintain income support schemes from a depleted pool of contributors.  Not only is this pool diminished because of our high levels of unemployment, but our high dependency ratio contributes also to our financial problems.  The level of unemployment is, however, the greatest single problem facing us as a nation and we as a Government are determined to come to grips with it.  In doing so we must find solutions within our own resources. By tackling our economic problems in a vigorous and effective way, we are laying the necessary groundwork for developments in the social policy area, developments which we all agree are urgent and necessary in a caring society.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Government have decided to launch an immediate national job search programme to assist the long term unemployed in their <Col N="2091" /> efforts to seek training and employment. This programme, which will involve the interviewing of some 150,000 unemployed persons this year, will be spearheaded by my Department in cooperation with the National Manpower Service and AnCO.  The necessary resources are being made available and over 40,000 National Manpower Service scheme opportunities have been earmarked for consideration by unemployed people this year.  In addition, some 12,000 job search places will be made available during the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>The job search programme is aimed at helping the unemployed to find jobs by giving them intensive coaching in job seeking techniques.  It is a feature of the process of selection for job search that participants receive an intensive counselling interview with a National Manpower Service placement officer at which the participant's skills and strengths are assessed and a range of possibilities discussed. Among the possibilities considered are the availability of suitable jobs, the chance of starting work on the enterprise allowance scheme, the possibility of a place on the social employment scheme, or on a suitable AnCO training scheme or, finally a place on the job search programme.  The job search programme itself involves intensive training in job-seeking skills and the provision of assistance and facilities to participants in the practical application of these skills in actually seeking jobs.</P>
    <P>To date six job search courses have been run in each of the pilot locations at Letterkenny, Limerick and Tallaght. Results to date show that the courses have been successful in helping the long term unemployed.  It is well known that the most damaging psychological effects of unemployment are, apart from loss of income, the lack of structure to one's day, the loss of self-respect and of a sense of identity.  The job search course is designed to help unemployed persons take a more active and better supported part in seeking employment and new skills and for that reason it deserves and <Col N="2092" /> will receive our fullest support and commitment. The programme can also have an indirect impact in helping to identify those who are not genuinely seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the Bill now before us, the general thrust of my approach is to ensure that the position of people dependent on social welfare payments and schemes is protected and maintained to the greatest possible extent.  With this in mind, Fianna Fáil could not agree to the provision contained in the previous Government's budget for deferring the 3 per cent cost of living increase in social welfare payments to November 1987 rather than July.  I am glad to be able to bring forward these increases to July 1987.  The additional cost involved is £18.4 million over and above the previous Government's proposal.  Including health allowances the total additional cost is £19 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>The other restrictive and cost-cutting measures proposed by the previous Government have been closely examined and, having regard to the overall budgetary situation, a number of them have been adopted either wholly or partially on the grounds that as well as achieving a needed saving, they also bring about a greater streamlining of the system.  I will be outlining these in greater detail later in this speech.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other restrictions, however, which in the Government's view would have involved severe reductions in entitlements to groups in need.  I would refer in particular to the proposal to reduce the period of entitlement to unemployment benefit from 15 months to 12 months.  This was, in the Government's view, a retrograde step which runs counter to most current thinking and one to which we could not subscribe given the present levels of unemployment.  The duration of unemployment benefit was, in fact, increased from 12 to 15 months in the seventies at a time when recession was only beginning to deepen.  Given current circumstances there is an even stronger case for maintaining the duration of payment of this benefit.  In fact, the Commission on <Col N="2093" /> Social Welfare recommended that the duration of unemployment benefit be extended for certain categories.</P>
    <P>Also, we are not proceeding with the proposal to increase from three to six the waiting days for disability benefit.  Apart from the very severe hardship it would cause to the many thousands of employees who form a majority of the workforce in the private sector and who are not covered by occupational pension schemes, this proposal would also be in breach of ILO and Council of Europe Conventions which set minimum standards and which were ratified by this country.</P>
    <P>The previous Government's proposal to pay a living alone allowance to long term recipients of unemployment assistance over age 45 is not being adopted. While I fully appreciate the problems faced by people in this category I do not see that the proposal in its present form is justified as it would create anomalies <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories of recipients. In contrast, the Commission on Social Welfare were in favour of abolishing anomalies rather than creating new ones.</P>
    <P>I would like now, to discuss the individual items of this Bill in some detail.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a 3 per cent increase in the weekly personal, adult and child dependent rates of social insurance and assistance payments effective from July 1987.  Bringing forward the date to July ensures that the increase in social welfare payments will match the increase in inflation and meets our election commitment. While accepting that 3 per cent is a modest increase, I would emphasise that it would always be the Government's wish to provide an additional increase over and above the cost of living where this is possible.  Given the current very difficult situation, I am glad that it has been possible to bring the general increases forward in the way we have.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions, for example, old age contributory and retirement pensions are increased by £1.65 with an additional £1 for adult dependants and 80p in the amount of the increase payable for a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to a pensioner.  A married <Col N="2094" /> couple with two children on disability or unemployment benefit will receive £90.20, as against £87.60 at present.  The rates of both long and short-term assistance are each being increased by over £1, and the rate for old age non-contributory pension goes from £45.75 to £47.10.  In providing for the general increase in rates, I have taken the opportunity in this Bill to make provision for the rounding to the nearest 10p of each of the weekly social insurance and assistance personal rates and increases for adult and child dependants.  This measure is desirable in view of the large number of payments now made and the difficulties in making computations of amounts less than 10p.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides for a similar measure in relation to payments of unemployment and disability benefit in respect of partial weeks.  Regulations will also be made to provide for the rounding of pay-related benefit and section 10 is designed to remove a restriction under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which would prevent this from being done.</P>
    <P>Regarding changes in social insurance conditions, the Bill provides for the imposition of stricter conditions for entitlement to certain social welfare benefits which formed part of the previous Government's budget.  A person will now be required to have a total of 39 weeks contributions paid at any time instead of 26 as at present for entitlement to unemployment, disability and maternity benefits.  The additional requirement for 26 contributions to be paid or credited in a particular year prior to the claim is also being raised to 39.  This latter provision will be made by regulation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a change in the contribution conditions affecting entitlement to long duration disability benefit and invalidity pension.  The contribution condition requiring three years of paid contributions (156) is being increased to four (208) &mdash; the previous Government had proposed to increase this to five years (260 contributions).</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that the earnings ceiling for PRSI contribution <Col N="2095" /> purposes be raised from £14,700 to £15,500 with effect from 6 April, 1987.</P>
    <P>Turning to charges in the Pay-Related Benefit Scheme, section 7 of the Bill provides for an increase from £58 to £62 in the earnings disregard, or &ldquo;floor&rdquo; for pay-related benefit purposes.  This change, which is a continuation of the policy adopted over the last number of years of progressively raising the &ldquo;floor&rdquo;, will affect only new claims from 6 April, where entitlement to pay-related benefit is involved.</P>
    <P>Another change which I am proposing in relation to the pay-related benefit scheme is the introduction of a single rate of 12 per cent instead of the current rates of PRB of 25 per cent for the first six months and 20 per cent for the following nine months approximately.  This will save £13 million this year and some £28 million in a full year.  This measure was also included in the budget of the previous Government.  The pay-related benefit scheme has now been in operation for some 13 years.  It was introduced as a supplement to a number of social insurance payments, including unemployment and disability benefit.  Since its introduction, the scheme has been subject to a considerable number of alterations in the limits and rates.  This further adjustment is being made at a time when any room for manoeuvre within the social welfare system is marginal and there is a vital and urgent need to ensure that resources are targeted to those who are most in need.  It must be remembered here that pay-related benefit is a supplement paid in addition to flat rate benefit payments which are already being increased to a level which compensates for inflation.</P>
    <P>With regard to improvements in the family income supplement, this supplement is a weekly cash allowance to help families on low incomes and to maintain the incentive to work for the breadwinners of those families.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for a more favourable method of calculating the amount of the family income supplement. Under these new arrangements <Col N="2096" /> the supplement is being increased to half of the difference between the family income and the prescribed upper limit instead of one-third as heretofore.  These changes will take effect from next July.</P>
    <P>The upper family income limit for eligibility for the family income supplement is being increased to £104 for a family with one child.  For a family with five children the upper income limit will be £192.  The maximum weekly supplement is being increased from £10 to £16 in the case of a family with one child and from £26 to £44 in the case of a family with five or more children.  This represents a real and practical increase in the level of assistance given to low income families. I might add that this proposal was also included in the previous Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>The effect of the increases is that from July the family income supplement scheme will make up 50 per cent of the difference between family income and:</P>
    <P>£104 in the case of a family with one child.</P>
    <P>£126 in the case of a family with two children.</P>
    <P>£148 in the case of a family with three children.</P>
    <P>£170 in the case of a family with four children and</P>
    <P>£192 in the case of a family with five or more children.</P>
    <P>There are limits on the maximum payments which can be made under the scheme but it will be possible to receive up to:</P>
    <P>£16 a week in the case of a family with one child.</P>
    <P>£23 a week in the case of a family with two children.</P>
    <P>£30 a week in the case of a family with three children.</P>
    <P>£37 a week in the case of a family with four children and</P>
    <P>£44 a week in the case of a family with five or more children.</P>
    <P>In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we stated that we would review the workings of the family income supplement, which is availed of by only a limited <Col N="2097" /> number of people at present and while these new measures may serve to broaden the scope of the scheme somewhat, I am still anxious to press ahead with an examination of this scheme which might yield some clearer definitions as to the relevant target group and their particular income needs.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to announce the extension of the treatment benefits scheme &mdash; that is free dental, optical and aural care &mdash; to the dependent spouses of insured workers.  October 1987 is the easliest date possible for the introduction of this measure, given the necessary preparations which have to be made in advance of its commencement.  I have been very conscious of the need for this measure for some years and I was very pleased when the Fianna Fáil Party included it in their policy programme.  It has often been put forward that women who work in the home had specific needs in this area given that, in many cases, they had no significant income of their own and that, where the family income was limited, the priority for treatment in these areas usually went to the children or to the major earner.  This inclusion of the dependent spouse of the PRSI insured worker in this scheme will mark a major advance for Irish families and will be a bonus to the PRSI full rate contributor.  I would also like to point out that the extension will apply to any dependent spouse, including a husband who is dependent on an insured wife.</P>
    <P>Regarding pilot schemes for the unemployed section 11 of the Bill provides that a participant in the part time job allowance scheme or the educational opportunities scheme will be able to resume his or her previous entitlement to unemployment payments without serving the usual waiting days in cases where the part time job does not work out or where they find themselves in a position that they have to back on to full time unemployment payments after a spell in the educational opportunities scheme.  These are two of three schemes aimed at helping the long term unemployed; I have already referred to the third scheme, the jobs search programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2098" /> The part-time job allowance scheme allows people who have been long term unemployed to take up part time work for up to 24 hours a week and to receive a flat rate allowance of £25 (single person) £40 (married) while doing so.  Earnings from the job will not affect the allowance. The scheme originally operated in five pilot locations and was extended to a further 12 locations before Christmas. While the numbers participating in it are as yet still small &mdash; some 50 persons &mdash; I am hopeful that as knowledge of the scheme spreads the numbers will increase.</P>
    <P>The educational opportunities scheme which is operating in Limerick and Tallaght allows long term unemployed persons who are over 25 years of age to attend a leaving certificate type course organised by the VEC.  Three classes have been organised and there are some 50 participants in this scheme.  An independent evaluation of the scheme is being carried out and I will be looking at the results of the scheme in all its aspects with a view to seeing whether an extension is worthwhile and feasible.</P>
    <P>Another initiative in the job creation area provided for in this Bill is the employer's PRSI exemption scheme. Under this scheme employers in the private sector who took on additional employees on a full time basis between mid-December 1986 and the end of January 1987, resulting in a net increase in their workforce, are exempt from their portion of the PRSI contribution for those employees for each week in the 1987-88 income tax year in which an increase in the workforce is maintained. Section 6 of this Bill makes the necessary provision to enable this to be done.</P>
    <P>Regarding the abolition of the provision of investment return, section 12 of the Bill is designed to do away with an anachronistic accounting procedure arising from the provisions of section 123 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981.  Each year the Exchequer is required to make payment to the social insurance fund of amounts due in respect of interest on expenditure incurred by the fund and its predecessor, the national <Col N="2099" /> health insurance fund in the building and equipping of Aras Mhic Dhiarmada.  The amount involved is in the region of £50,000 to £60,000 and the need for this separate provision is no longer relevant, having regard to the fact that the Exchequer in any event makes good each year the deficit of the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words at this point about a subject which has received much publicity in recent times, namely, social welfare fraud.  It is important to keep the issue of fraud in perspective in relation to the hundreds of thousands of families and individuals throughout the country who are in genuine need of the services of the Department.  At the same time, it is essential to strike a balance between providing a speedy and accessible service on the one hand and ensuring that the service is not open to abuse on the other.  That balance will have to be constantly adjusted in the light of ongoing experience.</P>
    <P>The only quantifiable indicators currently available of the extent of social welfare fraud relate to the actual statistics of fraud uncovered and recorded in my Department.  In 1985, the most recent year for which complete statistics are available, overpayments of benefit and assistance made by my Department amounted to £5.7 million of total expenditure of £2,291 million in that year.  Of that amount, £4.07 million of total expenditure is attributed to fraud on the part of recipients.  I have no doubt that many people believe that this does not represent the true extent of fraud in the system.  However, any other figures put forward must be viewed as speculative.</P>
    <P>To obtain an independent assessment of the extent of fraud in the social welfare system, a firm of international consultants have been engaged to carry out a security review of my Department's payment system and the level of fraud. Their findings will be a major input into further review of the controls and systems in operation in the Department to prevent fraud.  In addition to the work of the consultants, my Department will, on <Col N="2100" /> their own account, continue to develop measures aimed at preventing abuse and fraud.  Over the past number of years, various measures have been taken to tackle the problem.  Additional staff have been assigned specifically to anti-fraud work, new control procedures have been introduced, legislative changes have been effected and new improved computer facilities have been developed.  I am determined to do everything possible to improve the system of control on social welfare payments to ensure that the possibilities of fraud are minimised.  I will be taking whatever measures are necessary arising from the work of the consultants and my examination of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am also examining the question of fraud in its broadest sense in other areas. The State is paying out about £40 million in 1987 in respect of benefits and allowances for deserted wives.  I propose to examine the extent to which some of this cost could be offset by pursuing husbands who might be in a position to make some payments to meet their obligations.  The reality for many women who are receiving maintenance, under a separation agreement or a court order, is that payment of maintenance is often irregular and uncertain.  The NESC have recommended that the State should have power in such cases to award a deserted wife's benefit or allowance and itself pursue outstanding maintenance claims.  I am having my Department examine how arrangements can be made to pursue deserting husbands for the maintenance they should have been paying to their wives.  The Commission on Social Welfare endorsed this recommendation and I am having this matter examined.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an area in which I will be taking a special interest over the next few years.  This is the work of the Combat Poverty Agency which was established in September 1986.  When the legislation to establish the agency was being debated in the Dáil I was very critical of the delay.  I pointed out then the Bill was for all intents and purposes a replica of the National Community Development Agency Bill which I had <Col N="2101" /> introduced nearly five years previously.  I still maintain this view.  Indeed it has been confirmed by what I have learned about the agency since I assumed office.  As far as I am concerned, however, the important thing now is that the agency should get down to the work which it was set up to do.</P>
    <P>The new agency has now submitted to me a strategic plan of its activities over the next three years, as it was required to do under the terms of the Act.  From my examination of the plan, however, it is clear that the agency sees itself primarily as promoting community development as an approach to tackling poverty. This is in line with my views on the best way to make progress in this area.  I have always believed that an agency such as this, small as it is, can make a significant contribution to the elimination of poverty from Irish society by fostering and supporting the many activities which are already going on at local community level and by making available the results and experience coming from those activities.</P>
    <P>The provision which we are making for the Anti-Poverty Programme in 1987 is £1.3 million.  I will be concerned to ensure that these limited funds are spent in the best and most effective way.  I am pleased to see that the agency is approaching its task in an orderly and logical fashion by setting out in its strategic plan the areas in which it intends to concentrate its efforts over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the provision for grants to voluntary organisations in the social services area for once-off projects.  This scheme has been in operation since 1983 and provides worthwhile assistance to many voluntary organisations in the valuable work which they do with deprived and disadvantaged groups.  Up to the end of 1986 grants totalling some £2.5 million had been paid to some 470 voluntary organisations.  The sum of £750,000 has been made available for the scheme this year.  This is entirely separate from the allocation of £1.3 million for the Anti-Poverty Agency which will also be providing support and assistance to local groups and organisations.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on <Col N="2102" /> Social Welfare, since its publication in August 1986, has been the subject of considerable discussion and analysis.  I have the considered views on the report of many organisations and individuals who have a direct interest in social welfare.  I will be taking the report of the commission and all the views I have received on it fully into account in planning the reform and development of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I will be giving particular attention in this regard to the views of the social partners as expressed in the report of the NESC <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990.</i> The financial constraints on future social welfare developments in the period up to 1990 are clearly spelled out in that report.  These show that, given the projected demographic changes, an increase in expenditure of at least 14.3 per cent will be required in the next four years just to maintain real social welfare payments levels.  This Government have given a clear commitment in its <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to maintain social welfare payments in real terms.  Therefore, the degree of progress that can be made in relation to further general improvements in social welfare payment levels will, to a great extent, be determined by our success in generating real economic growth and, in particular, reducing the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>However, this does not mean that real social welfare reform will have to be tied exclusively to extra revenue becoming available from the benefits of economic growth.  We can start the process of remedying serious deficiencies, which have been identified, in the present social welfare system without necessarily incurring significant extra expenditure.  The Commission on Social Welfare have recommended that the present payment structure should be simplified, in particular, the rates payable to the various categories of social welfare recipients should be equalised.  This aim has been endorsed by the NESC and, within the present financial constraints, I will be looking at ways of achieving some convergence of social welfare rates in the coming years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2103" /> I consider also that a review of all social welfare schemes is necessary to see how effective these schemes are in meeting their objectives.  The schemes will be looked at to see how they interact with other social welfare schemes, with schemes administered by other State agencies and how they meet the overall needs of the individuals and families whom they are intended to serve.  Also, I expect such reviews to highlight where the conditions for entitlement give rise to anomalies or where these conditions can lead to abuse.  In particular, the reviews will be focusing on the various schemes for those incapable of work, for the unemployed, for one parent families and for children.  The overall outcome will be proposals for changes in the coming years that will make social welfare schemes as a whole more effective in meeting their objectives.</P>
    <P>In addition to the more effective use of existing resources there will be a need to look at ways of generating extra revenue that will not have a negative impact on the potential for economic growth. The NESC laid particular emphasis in this regard on broadening the social insurance base.  The Commission on Social Welfare also considered this to be a priority.  I will, therefore, be examining the implications of extending social insurance not just with the aim of generating extra revenue but also to bring Ireland into line with other developed countries, where all persons engaged in economic activity are covered by social insurance.  Such a development should lead in time to a decline in the numbers requiring means-tested social assistance payments. Reliance on such payments as a form of social security can have the negative effect of penalising enterprise and thrift.</P>
    <P>There is also considerable scope for reforms in the administration and delivery of social welfare services that will not have significant cost implications but will, at the same time, be of considerable benefit to social welfare beneficiaries.  There is a clear commitment in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to make the administration of the social welfare system <Col N="2104" /> more fair and efficient.  The major computerisation programme currently underway in my Department will be of central importance in achieving this aim.  I intend to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to enable this programme to proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Computerisation speeds up considerably the processing of claims and the provision of information to claimants on their entitlements and on the progress of their claims.  It also makes possible more efficient, secure and flexible methods for making payments as well as facilitating the localisation of services.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce and develop one-stop-shops for social welfare services so that, as far as possible, all the social welfare needs of clients can be met in one centre at local level.  This would include current information and advice on jobs, placements and courses which are available through the Manpower services together with social welfare information. It would also include on the spot assessment for qualification certificates for unemployment assistance.  Computerisation will make this feasible and this approach will be of enormous benefit to clients and will at the same time reduce significantly the cost of administering the social welfare services.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to mention a project that has been in operation in my Department for some time now and one which I intend to develop and expand in the future.  Last year a project was initiated where the work of the various people involved at local level in putting unemployment assistance entitlements into payment was brought together in a more integrated manner. The exchange manager who is responsible for making payments, the social welfare officer who investigates means and the community welfare officer who may have to decide on entitlements to supplementary welfare allowance in the interim, all operate as a team with the consequence that the average time taken to put unemployment assistance into payment has been reduced from weeks to days and, of course, this has reduced the cost of delivering the service.  It has also <Col N="2105" /> resulted in savings in payments of supplementry welfare allowance where these would be paid pending the processing of a claim.  Following the success of the initial project similar arrangements have been made in two further offices.  I intend to extend this to other offices where this is feasible and as suitable accommodation and facilities, including computer links, become available.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that this approach to the delivery of services is in keeping with the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare on the need to provide a comprehensive local service to social welfare clients.</P>
    <P>We also made a commitment in our election programme to simplifying the appeals machinery.  The commission in their report made a number of recommendations in this regard including the setting up of a separate executive office for appeals.  This matter was in the fairly recent past the subject of detailed debate in this House in Private Members' Time. Proposals for reform of the appeals system are under active consideration at present and I hope to be in a position to bring forward firm proposals on this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that in planning the major social welfare reforms to be introduced over the coming years the priority will be maintaining in real terms the level of social welfare benefits. At the same time I will be reviewing all social welfare schemes with a view to ensuring that the enormous resources both in terms of money and staff devoted to these schemes are used as effectively and efficiently as possible.  I am confident that the end result will be a social welfare system that will cater in a fair, efficient, and, above all, sensitive and caring way for the one million plus persons who rely on social welfare services.</P>
    <P>I have outlined what I see as the main priorities now facing me as Minister for Social Welfare.  As far as the provisions in the Bill are concerned I feel that those provisions illustrate the Government's commitment to people on social welfare <Col N="2106" /> and represent a considerable achievement in the light of the difficulties facing the Government at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to the Minister on his appointment and I wish him every success.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael group will not be opposing this Bill.  There are many measures here which we are glad to see being introduced. It is a matter of some satisfaction that even in very difficult times this Government and the previous Government made a genuine effort to alleviate the problems of the most under-privileged in our community.  We are all aware of the difficulties that confront the Government and the Minister because of high service charges on borrowed money, because of growing numbers of unemployed who have to be assisted and because of the recognised fact that the taxpayer is already contributing more than a fair share to the running of the State.  Taking all these things into account, it is with a good deal of satisfaction that I note that there are many measures in this Bill which show a caring approach to the problems of the social welfare classes.  Many people would like to see more being done but in our economic circumstances it is difficult to make a claim to have more done.  For that reason the Fine Gael group here will not oppose the Bill.</P>
      <P>A 3 per cent increase in a number of these payments would not measure up to what many caring people would like to see done but we have to see this against our economic background.  I understand from the tone of the Minister's speech that if conditions were better these payments would be higher.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive speech he has made, for the detailed way in which he covered different sections in the Bill and for his indications of a further examination of the problems and of how to expedite claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be satisfactory from the point of view of the taxpayer and the community in general if fraud could be totally eliminated from these schemes.  It may <Col N="2107" /> not be as serious as some people claim but while it exists it gives rise to dissatisfaction. It encourages attempts at fraud by people who are convinced that their neighbours are benefiting from fraudulent practices and it creates dissatisfaction among taxpayers who believe they are contributing to the upkeep of people who are getting far too much and who could quite well do without any assistance under the social welfare schemes.  As long as that kind of thinking prevails and as long as there appears to be justification for that kind of thinking it will create dissatisfaction among the paying sections of our community.</P>
    <P>The approach to this Bill in providing for social welfare recipients was more humane than the approach to hospital charges and housing grants.  In the circumstances the Minister has done a good job.  For that reason I welcome the Bill and would clearly indicate to the Minister that it is not the intention of the Fine Gael group to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Social Welfare.  It is a daunting task but I know the Minister will be confident and capable in his role.  Talking generally about social welfare, over the years I have found that in many ways the developments and the progress in social welfare have proved to be a barometer of progress and development.  For example, there were few, if any, new developments in the depressed conditions of the fifties. Economic growth abounded during the sixties and seventies and this proved conducive to developments in social welfare. In the difficult economic climate of the eighties it is difficult to be innovative; the opposite is the case.  We tend to cut back for the obvious reason that social welfare is the highest capital programme of all the Government's portfolios.  In excess of £2.5 billion per annum is spent on social welfare.  Something in the region of 40 per cent of the population are getting <Col N="2108" /> some form of social welfare.  As the Minister said, there are a million plus people availing of some social welfare scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred briefly to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. One of the saddest aspects of that report was the admission that unemployment will continue at a high level for quite some time.  If that is the case, obviously providing funding for unfortunate people who are joining the dole queues will be much more difficult. Hopefully, the policies and attitude the Government have adopted since they took office on 10 March 1987 will work and jobs will be there for young people and for people generally in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the anomalies in the social welfare scheme.  We all accept that the social welfare scheme is riddled with anomalies.  The Minister knows what is happening and he will be examining it in the period ahead.  The full extent of the abuse of the system through fraud has not been fully determined.  I am not talking about a person who, for example, might spend a few hours digging a garden.  I am talking about a person who collects money from exchanges in Dublin, Athlone and Galway.  We know this has happened in the past.  If large fraud situations exist they should be eliminated as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the computerisation of the Department.  They have been criticised over the years for late payments and so on.  Hopefully the computerisation system, if adopted, will help to improve that position.  The Government's social welfare portfolio is wide open for decentralisation on a pretty large scale.  I like to think that decentralisation and some form of computerisation will reduce the cost of the administration of the social welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that the starting date for the 3 per cent increase is July rather than November.  The Minister made the point that this will cost an extra £80 million but I feel it is necessary to match the increase in inflation which we agreed and <Col N="2109" /> which was promised as part of our election commitment in February.  The job search courses have proved successful in Limerick, Letterkenny and Tallaght and I am pleased that there is general agreement and approval for an extension of these courses.  We hope they will be successful and we await details with interest and concern.</P>
    <P>We were critical in the past of the failure of the Government to operate an extension of the free dental, optical and aural care to the dependent spouses of insured workers.  These have now become part and parcel of this Bill.  The Minister said that for administrative reasons October 1987 is the earliest day this can be introduced.  The Minister rightly pointed out that in many cases women who work at home have no significant income of their own.  They are now getting priority.  This measure will be welcomed by everybody, and most of all by the people who will benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute as the Minister did, to the various voluntary organisations for the great work they are doing in helping many deprived and disadvantaged groups.  In my own town, as in other towns in Ireland, young men and women in groups like the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Round Table and the Lions Club, work in their spare time to help unfortunate people who are poor, deprived and disadvantaged.  The Minister is right to put on record his support for and tribute to them for the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>How to raise revenue must always be at the back of one's mind with regard to any social welfare system.  Having read the report on social welfare and from what I know about social welfare, there is great scope for raising revenue through the broadening of the social insurance base.  The report makes the point that the total revenue accruing from the inclusion of the self-employed, the extension of the full PRSI to modified rate contributors and the abolition of the income ceiling contribution would be in the region of £226 million.  That is a sizeable figure. Can we abolish the ceiling?  When the <Col N="2110" /> Minister replies perhaps he might give us his thoughts in that area.  This has to be looked at and there have to be areas from which additional revenue can be brought into the social welfare system.  Doing what I suggest would not just mean extra finance for the Department.  The system would be seen to operate in a more equitable manner for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There are a few general points on social welfare which I should like to mention.  I will not be long because I know the Minister is anxious to have the Bill passed. The occupational injury scheme was started in 1967 and replaced the Work-mens Compensation Act, 1867.  This is a compulsory insurance scheme for employees who are in insurable employment. This scheme needs to be reviewed. It no longer seems to be attractive. Claims are made under a common law scheme rather than under the occupational injuries scheme.  The Minister may argue that this is the best way for the Department of Social Welfare but if we could get extra money and extra benefits it would be a worthwhile exercise to examine it further.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme has been the subject of a court action but it is a scheme which may be of interest in the future. The criterion used should have regard to the needs of the recipient rather than what social welfare grouping he or she belongs to.  I am throwing this out to the Minister in the hope that he might investigate it in the future.</P>
    <P>The idea of a benefit in kind rather than a cash payment should be further explored &mdash; for example, the travel scheme, the TV licence scheme and the telephone rental scheme.  The free travel scheme is rightly described as a model of a positive State response to the needs of the elderly.  This kind of concept should be further examined by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>Members of the House could talk at length on this Bill, but the Minister is anxious, as we all are, that the measure be passed as quickly as possible.  We must make sure our basic priorities are correct, that is to improve the level of payment <Col N="2111" /> for those on the lowest level who are dependent on social welfare, improve the family support schemes ensuring that the family and individuals are protected, and ensure that schemes are maintained to the greatest possible extent.  This is to be welcomed.  I am sure this is the Minister's intention.  As Senator Ryan stated, despite the tough economic climate, the Minister has introduced a humane touch as far as the disadvantaged, the poor and the people in need of social welfare are concerned.  I wish the Minister well in his portfolio, and I know that he will be a very big success.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has made quite a wide-ranging speech in introducing the Bill.  It is appropriate that he would do so because of the importance of the social welfare code to an increasing proportion of the population.  I also welcome some specific proposals in the Bill in comparison, with, for example, the proposals put forward by Fine Gael during the recent election. <Col N="2112" /> Overall I am disappointed that the Minister has not given firm commitments to accept the main recommendations of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. I will address some of the issues he raised on that front.</P>
      <P>The Minister's initial response is worringly vague and worrying in that it is linking any real reform to considerations of overall economic policy.  He must be prepared to lead with the significance of the main recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  It is important that a Minister for Social Welfare should understand and accept the values in that report and push those values in competition with other lobbies and other pressing interests but do so with great conviction as the Minister with responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>At the commencement of my contribution &mdash; which I assure the Members of the House will not be long &mdash; I wish to refer to what I regard as a notable omission from the Minister's speech, which also worries me.  The Minister made no reference to any steps which his Department propose to take to redress the unlawful discrimination against married women in entitlements to, and in payments of unemployment, disability and other benefits during 1985 and 1986. The recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the McDermott and Cotter case made it clear that as and from 23 December 1984, married women were legally entitled to the same benefits as married men.  Even though there was no provision in Irish law to that effect, they could rely on the Third Directive.  I should like to ask the Minister when replying to the Second Stage debate to indicate what steps his Department are going to take to redress this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably the Department have records of women who would have been in receipt of unemployment or disability benefits.  They would be in a position to make a calculation in relation to the default, to what the income and entitlement to those married women would have been in the years 1985 and 1986, up to the implementation in May 1986 in <Col N="2113" /> relation to unemployment benefit and disability of equality of treatment, and up to November 1986 in relation to entitlement to apply for unemployment assistance and also the adjustment of the adult and child allowances.  The Minister has a responsibility here.  It is clear that the thrust of the judgment of the court was that married women were legally entitled to those payments and, therefore, have been wrongly deprived of them.  Although individual women may seek to take certain steps in their own case, it is a clear situation where there is ministerial responsibility.  I believe I am correct in referring to the fact that the Netherlands Government, which had not initially provided for implementation of the directive in time, ensured that there was full retrospection to the women claimants who had been discriminated against contrary to the provisions of the directive.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister when replying to the debate will outline the kind of steps which the Department will take.  They are uniquely in a position to do so because they have the records.  They are in a position to contact every woman and tell her she had been paid £5, approximately, less as and from 23 December 1984 until whatever date the shorter period for payment ran out, that the Department will pay her £5 more for those months, that she is also entitled to be paid for the full 390 days, and that therefore she is entitled to an additional 78 days payment. That is a clear responsibility on the Government, and in particular on the Minister.  He is in a position to know from the records.  The easiest cases are those women who are unlawfully and wrongly deprived of the same rate as other categories of recipients for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It may be more difficult, but not impossible, to seek to redress the situation of the women who are signing on for credits, for example, in relation to their entitlement to unemployment assistance, and also ensure they get equal treatment with regard to the benefits which were available in comparable circumstances to married men.  This is a very <Col N="2114" /> glaring and worrying omission from the Minister's speech since he ranged over a number of broader issues in the area of social welfare which do not, strictly speaking, arise under the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, 1987.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the specific proposals in the Bill.  I welcome in particular the decision of the Government to introduce the 3 per cent increase in social welfare allowances and benefits in July this year, as opposed to the proposal of the Fine Gael Party to do so in November. I would like the Minister to respond to the point: the increase is to be 3 per cent but, as I understand it, the cost of living is already exceeding that.  I would welcome some guarantee or assurance from the Minister that a further adjustment will be made if, as appeared to be the case, the cost of living index continues to rise because that would have the effect that the 3 per cent increase would not ensure the maintenance of what are already in many cases very low rates of benefit and allowances.  While I welcome the fact that the date of July has been agreed and acceded to by the Government, I would like some assurance from the Minister that he will monitor the rate of inflation for this year to ensure that the level is maintained.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's rejection of the proposal to shorten the period of unemployment benefit, which would also have had an effect on pay-related benefit, from 15 months to 12 months.  That, again, was a proposal of the Fine Gael Party.  I am glad the Government have not adopted this course and have maintained the period of 15 months.</P>
    <P>Another specific proposal in the Bill which I would like to refer to is the extension of the free dental, optical, and aural care to dependent spouses of insured workers.  It may only be a small point, but I welcome the fact that, as the Minister pointed out, this will apply to dependent spouses of whichever sex, as appropriate. For most of us, this raises the very serious question of the lack of access to those services down through the years for dependent married women.  I warmly <Col N="2115" /> welcome the fact that the Government have introduced this provision.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the basis for the very strict changes in the social insurance conditions and the stricter conditions for entitlement to social welfare benefits.  These will require higher level of contributions.  These are set out in detail by the Minister in relation to entitlement to unemployment, disability and maternity benefits and also in relation to long duration disability benefit and invalidity pensions.  What is very worrying is that the threshold is being raised at a time when it is more difficult for people to remain in employment, when the jobs market is shrinking.  It seems to be a very harsh and unfair provision to be upping the threshold and imposing stricter conditions at a time when it is more difficult to remain in secure insured employment.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the reference in the Minister's speech in regard to the improvements in the family income supplement. The Minister expressed surprise that the family income supplement was availed of only by a very limited number of people.  I sensed from what he said that the view of the Department is that there is an under take-up of this supplement. I hope the Minister will reflect on his own surprise in that regard.  Why is that the family income supplement does not have a greater take-up?  Why is it not more widely availed of by low income families?  Part of the reason is that it has not been well-publicised and explained to people.  The social welfare code is becoming increasingly complex.  Low income families in particular are unlikely to have access to private advice.  Those who have the benefit and help of a social worker or a community care worker who will sort out their problems for them may become aware of their entitlements but too many low income families simply do not know that this is something which they should consider, something they might be entitled to.  I would welcome some concentration of attention on ensuring that this supplement is availed of in the kinds of case for which it was <Col N="2116" /> introduced.  The Minister's proposals will help a little towards increasing the relevance of the supplement and its accessibility for some families.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the various schemes for the unemployed, particularly the job search programme.  It is difficult until we have more evidence of how this works to assess what its impact will be.  I prefer to reserve my position and perhaps in the broader context of a debate on unemployment or on the provision of jobs we can come back to it when there is a longer track record to assess.  I do have certain doubts but I prefer to wait and see what the position may be.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the Minister's reference to the Combat Poverty Agency.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has not tried to score political points. For instance, he did not mention that it was similar to the agency set up by a previous Government.  I sensed in his contribution a strong endorsement of the work of the Combat Poverty Agency and I hope that is the case.  It is extremely important that the work of the agency is not only supported but understood because it is an agency which can help to create much more radical change on the ground in these areas if it receives the support.  In that regard, I am not satisfied that a budget of £1.3 million is the kind of support the agency should be receiving. Obviously, there are budgetary constraints, in all areas but that figure does seem to be a very small allocation, given the Minister's endorsement of the work of the agency, his recognition of their importance and the need on the ground for the work which is involved.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters in the Minister's speech which I want to refer to.  The first is the highlighting of the problem of social welfare fraud.  There is a tendency in any discussion on social welfare to focus at a fairly early stage on the problem of social welfare fraud.  In the area of social welfare, as in the area of taxation and as in most areas of Irish life, we have a problem.  Any of us who can get away with anything are probably three-quarters of the way, if not the full way, towards getting away with it.  There <Col N="2117" /> is an undue focus on social welfare recipients as though somehow they are the only people who are involved in any way in trying to fiddle things their own way. Very few of us can look into our hearts and say that we do not in one way or another try to take advantage of the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>In so far as there is a problem, it is of course one which should be redressed but I would like to make a comment on the step which is being taken.  Yet again, the Minister is employing a firm of international consultants.  At least the House should be made aware of all the details. How much are the international consultants to be paid by the Department to carry out the task allocated to them?  Will we get a copy of their report?  Will it be published?  It is important when international consultants are brought in in this way that we should know what the result is and that the House has an opportunity to comment on it.</P>
    <P>One of the areas the Minister focused on was the payment of benefits and allowances to deserted wives.  He pointed out that the State will be paying out about £40 million in 1987 in respect of benefits and allowances for deserted wives and he proposes to examine the extent to which some of the costs could be offset by pursuing husbands.  He referred to the NESC recommendation, that the burden of pursuing husbands should not be undertaken by the deserted wife who normally has a combination of cumulative problems arising from the desertion, from emotional, financial and other problems, but by the Department.  That has been put forward for a number of years by many people who are close to the ground and aware of the problems.  I recall having the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, in here on a motion on that point and he declined to accept the recommendation.  However, I am encouraged that the Minister appears to be prepared to examine seriously how this could be done.  It is the approach adopted in a number of other jurisdictions, in Northern Ireland and in England, to payments of this kind.  The pursuit of the husband is carried out not <Col N="2118" /> primarily or in many cases by the wife but at the behest of the agency making the social welfare payment to the deserted wife.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments to the effect that he accepts the need for reform in the administration and delivery of social welfare services, the need for overall improvement in the delivery of the services.  The Minister referred specifically to the introduction and development of what he called &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; so that all the social welfare needs of applicants can be met in one centre at local level.  He said this approach will be developed.  As well as improving and reforming the administration and delivery of social welfare services, there should be consideration of the fact that in relation to these services we are talking about people's legal entitlements.  It does not always seem that the Department are aware of the need for standards of fair procedures, proper access to information in relation to entitlements or to any reports on people.  It is not simply a question of providing for needs; it is a question of providing legal entitlements for people.  As the Minister, and his advisers are aware, increasingly cases are coming before the courts because proper standards have not been maintained.  It probably does not figure largely in any approach or consideration by the Department although it should.  The Department should consider taking legal advice on ensuring that any improvements in the delivery of services also comply with standards of fair procedures and with the rules of natural and constitutional justice because we are talking about legal entitlements.</P>
    <P>In that regard, in a further extension of this area, I also welcome the commitment of the Minister to reform and simplify the appeals machinery.  The Minister referred to the fact that there was a detailed debate in this House on the matter and said it was a debate in Private Members' time.  It was a debate on a Private Members' Bill, proposed by Senator Brendan Ryan, which is still on the Order Paper and will, if Senator Ryan is re-elected, be reintroduced.  I hope <Col N="2119" /> there will be an opportunity to hear the Minister on the specifics of either a Government Bill or a re-vitalised and revised Private Members' Bill to actually reform and structure the social welfare appeals system.  There was considerable support in this House for a proposal of that kind as there was in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to hear the new Minister for Social Welfare because his is an extremely important brief and Ministry, and I look forward to hearing him in reply.  I should like to thank my colleagues, in particular my Labour colleagues, for facilitating me in making my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister for Social Welfare on this his first visit to the House.  In my dealings with him in the past when he was Minister for Health I had a working relationship with him.  The Minister has brought before us a Bill which contains some of the proposals of the outgoing Fine Gael Government.  He has changed some of them slightly but the Labour Party proposals have not been adopted.  It has things that are good but not good enough and things that are bad but not as bad as they could have been.  In other words the Bill is a combination of all sorts, shapes and sizes of fundamental changes, particularly in the area of pay-related benefits which the Labour Party are very concerned about.  We will be unable to support the Bill on Second Stage and some sections of it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister said he was anxious to have the Bill enacted as quickly as possible because he wants some of the changes to come into force early in April.  Unfortunately, most of the changes he wants to bring in in April are changes we do not agree with because they alter the concept of pay-related insurance.  The good parts of the Bill, which are not good enough for us, would not normally come into force until July.  For that reason we suggest the postponement of the Bill as a protest at the <Col N="2120" /> way the Minister has played around with the social welfare code.  The provisions will not come into operation until July and that will give the Government ample opportunity to take the necessary steps to ensure that any benefits that arise will be paid on time.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Robinson I am surprised at the lack of comment on the recent decision of the European Court on entitlements for women in the period of office of the previous Government, particularly in regard to their failure to bring in equality payments in the area of social welfare.  I am amazed that the Government have not said what will happen later on in the year in regard to the balance of the EC equality measures which caused some trauma before Christmas.  I am glad the Labour Party members in that Government ensured that interim payments were made in specific cases of up to £20 per week to ensure that grave losses did not occur.  However, no provision is made in this legislation in spite of the Minister's protests about this issue when he was in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to note that in the Social Welfare Bill, 1987 no provision has been made reflecting the views expressed by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition.  Bearing in mind the attitude adopted by Fianna Fáil in the other House on the Christmas bonus issue &mdash; we all agree this is a very sensitive issue for people who are sick or unemployed and who do not know from one end of the year to the next whether the Government will pay a bonus at Christmas time &mdash; I hoped the Minister would have shown a little bit of imagination and made provision for a payment at Christmas 1987 in line with the commitments he gave when in Opposition. I look forward to his comments on that.  People want to know if this Government are prepared to do what they wanted to do when they were in Opposition, particularly in the very sensitive area of social welfare which has a total overall expenditure of £2 billion.  It is an area to which the Department of Finance will always look to effect economies and create efficiency.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner, in a contribution on <Col N="2121" /> an earlier motion, referred to fraud.  It is particularly relevant in the area of social welfare.  There is a feeling among people who are working that people commit fraud.  There are people in receipt of social welfare who are also working.  I assure the Minister that there is nobody on this side of the House or in the Labour Party who will condone in any way any evidence of fraud in this area.  I suggest, however, that the concept of bringing in outsiders from abroad to investigate an Irish system dealing with Irish people would be a major waste of money.</P>
    <P>There are two simple ways to ensure that fraud does not occur in this area. They were suggested by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition and by us.  One relates to unemployment benefit or assistance being paid to people who may be gainfully employed.  I suggest that the Minister should insist that the employers of such people sign a certificate to say that they were working for them, particularly when they have been found to be working by one of the departmental officers.  If somebody is found by one of the officers working and drawing unemployment assistance and if the employer of that person is not prepared to state he was working for him, from receiving social welfare payment, no action can be taken. All one can do under the existing regulations is to debar the person for that one day.  I doubt that there is very much fraud because, from my experience as a public representative, the vast majority of people I meet who are unemployed, and they are many, want to work.  This has been proven by the operation of the social employment scheme referred to in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>As regards fraud that might be perpetrated by people in receipt of disability benefit, I would make the employers responsible for the payment of disability benefit to their employees while they are still out sick.  They, in turn, could recoup it from the Department of Social Welfare. This would ensure that the person was sick, that the employer knew the person was sick, that a certificate was received by the employer confirming the sickness and that the employer was <Col N="2122" /> making the necessary contribution to the State to protect the employee in the event of sickness.  If it is felt that there is fraud in these areas, the Minister should apply himself to correcting it.  He will be agreeably surprised at the number of people who do not defraud the system.  There is a figure in the Estimates of over £4 million in savings as a result of the Minister's action in this area.  The Minister will be disappointed because he will find that people are not defrauding the system. In a way we are all to blame for this misconception.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Quinn, the previous Minister for Labour, who initiated the concept of paying people to do useful work through employment schemes, community welfare schemes, and other projects.  Many were given work by local communities, local authorities, county councils, urban councils and sporting organisations.  They were taken off the live register and were paid £70 per week if they were single and £85 per week if they were married.  I was amazed to find that the Minister for Finance intended arbitrarily to reduce this payment to £60. I do not know anybody who would accept a drop in their income.  I do not think it reflects any great credit on us to say that people who are employed under the social employment scheme will be able to go back onto the unemployment register. I would hope that if they did not obtain employment from the experience they gained under the social employment scheme, they would be allowed to sign on and not be penalised.  If they are penalised there will be no incentive for them to come off the live register and work under the social employment scheme. We know of many thousands of people who forfeited money to avail of that scheme.  They found a new way of life that they liked.  It also allowed them some time to spend working at home or doing other jobs on their week off without being penalised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has placed much emphasis on the Commission on Social Welfare. I am disappointed that the Minister has accepted the Fine Gael Government's <Col N="2123" /> changes.  Just because Fine Gael suggested them or the Minister accepts them, does not necessarily mean they are right.  We left Government because we considered this to be the wrong way to go about it.  Some of the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare were advocated by some Government spokesmen during the election.  It was stated that if elected, they would be implemented and the people would have a tremendous increase in their benefits.</P>
    <P>The one item which Fine Gael confirmed they were about to concede was in relation to single people on the dole over a certain age and living alone.  They do not qualify for anything.  Even that little concession was not accepted by this Government.  That was most unfair and is something which my former colleague, Mr. Joe Bermingham, would not agree with if he were still an elected Member of the House.  He made that issue the price of a vote at one stage because he felt so strongly about it and many of us joined with him at that time in trying to have that category of people taken into account.  Many of them are in low cost housing with no fires provided by local authorities.  They find it really very difficult to survive on the pittance they receive from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about changing the floor for pay-related purposes.  He said previous Governments had raised the floor.  There was opposition to it at the time.  The reason given was that there was no incentive to work and that the time had almost arrived when it paid somebody to stay at home.  The only reason the floor was altered was to ensure that an incentive was given to people to work.  This floor has reduced the amount payable from 25 per cent and 20 per cent to the new uniform rate of 12 per cent, a saving of £13 million in this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has written off for the first time the whole concept of the insurance element of pay-related benefit. Employees contribute to PRSI on the basis that, if they are unfortunate enough <Col N="2124" /> to lose their jobs or get sick while they are at work, in some way the income they receive from the Department will be related to their pay in the previous contribution year.  That whole concept was promoted by the trade union movement and accepted by the Labour Party.  The Labour Party felt it was a good concept because it acted as a buffer for families subjected to the trauma of being out of work or being sick.  Their income was related to the income they received up to the day they lost their job or got sick.  The Minister's comment on section 7 of the Bill, which reduces the income floor was made by the Minister in his budget speech.  Although that proposal was made by a previous Fine Gael Government it has been accepted by this Government.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of pay-related benefit has been thrown out the window forever. There is absolutely no justification for it now because it does not benefit recipients when they are in difficulty. After all, that is what an insurance scheme is all about, and that is why we changed from the concept of the old flat rate insurance stamp which were stuck on cards because at that time everybody got the same amount of benefit, irrespective of what they were earning.  Then there was a real disincentive for people in lower incomes to go back to work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the family income supplement scheme which was initiated by the Government's predecessors. For some reason it has not been taken up to the extent that it could have and should have been taken up. Senator Robinson mentioned that people are not aware of their entitlements in this area.  For that reason I welcome the Community Service Information Week during which people will be told of their entitlements under various schemes.  The Minister agrees with us that social welfare legislation and all its consolidation Acts are highly complicated.  Advertising on television or in the newspapers, whether the national dailies, the evening papers, or the provincial papers, does not get to the people at which it is directed.  Health Education Bureau research shows that <Col N="2125" /> most of the information they give, which is of vital importance to people, never reaches people that it is aimed at because they have no access to and no interest in the media.  It is a major job to try to convince people about their entitlements in this area.</P>
    <P>Of all the schemes this is the closest to the socialist view of an income related benefit from the State for the people who are at work, especially with large numbers of dependants.  People doing similar jobs get the same wages irrespective of their family demands.  The whole concept of the family income supplement was an attempt by the State to face the fact that some employers were unable to meet the greater demands of some of their employees, particularly those with five children or more.  I welcome the slight changes made.  They will be welcomed generally.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices and all the means at his disposal to ensure that people who do not know they are entitled to it will get the supplement.  The Minister will know from the computerised information at his disposal the type of people who are entitled to the FIS and this could be paid through their employers.  He has information from the employer under the pay-related insurance system and the tax system which are both linked together.  The Department know people's family commitments and their wages from the tax deduction card.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Department should not be in a position to advise employers that employee X, Y or Z is entitled to a family income supplement, based on the wages information available from the employer.</P>
    <P>I have one comment to make on the job search programme which has been highlighted in the budget and carried by the media as being an obvious answer to our unemployment problems.  I wish it well and hope it addresses some of the problems.  I ask the Minister through the Chair to outline the type of interviews to be held by the Manpower offices.  When people go to register with Manpower, they give their name, address, age, education and qualifications, where they are <Col N="2126" /> working, if the are working, what work they would like to do and what jobs they want to be considered for.</P>
    <P>When the National Manpower Agency was first set up the concept was to allow people to change from one job to another.  Now it is used by the Department as proof that somebody is looking for work.  The fact that they are signing for unemployment is not sufficient evidence for the Department.  If they are not registered with Manpower, I hope this is not a sinister move to try to flush out people who are not genuinely seeking employment, because it would be fraudulent to suggest that.  If the Department want to get that information there are other ways of doing it.  I hope the 150,000 people who will be interviewed over a period of years will not be misled into believing there are jobs available out there.  We understand there are 40,000 jobs waiting for these people.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say what kind of jobs they are?  Are 40,000 people or 12,000 people &mdash; a figure mentioned in another category &mdash; to be assisted to find their own jobs or to start up their own projects?  This is the philosophy behind the pilot schemes referred to.  We did not suggest that there are magic wands in the Manpower office.  Interview people and direct them to a job.  I hope this is not a sinister move and that people will not be under the illusion that because they are interviewed there are jobs at the end of the road.  If there are jobs the Minister should tell us what type of jobs they are. This is separate from social employment work, or Teamwork projects.  About 150,000 unemployed people will be brought into Manpower offices and interviewed with a view to getting work.  We are concerned about the quarter of a million people out there.  If this Government have a niche for these people, we want to hear about it.  We commend the Government if that is the case.  Since this budget was introduced people have been asking me daily about these jobs.  They are looking forward to them and I sincerely hope they can look forward to them.</P>
    <P>My final comments are in the area of <Col N="2127" /> appeal.  This was dealt with by Senator Robbinson and was dealt with in a Private Members' Bill by Senator Brendan Ryan. It is an area in which we have had many problems in the past under Governments in which the Labour Party were involved, and under previous Fianna Fáil Governments. It seems to be a never-ending problem particularly in regard to married women who are unemployed but who had been previously in employment and had made contributions.  In spite of the EC equality directive and the implementation of the Act, those women have had to go to the most extraordinary lengths to prove they were available for work. The appeals process has been anything but helpful to these people who believed that the EC and the Government who brought in the legislation were concerned about them.  When they were married, we produced evidence to show they had somebody to mind their children.  We produced documentary evidence to say that employers who had been approached said they had no work for them, yet some of the officers in the Department gave an opinion that they were not genuinely seeking work.  We almost had to have the managing director of a company leave his job and go with the social welfare applicant to prove that the person had come to him.  That is an example of the lengths people have to go to legitimately prove they were genuinely available for and genuinely seeking employment and had made contributions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look seriously at the appeals system.  People are well aware that they have paid into this insurance scheme and they are entitled to their legal entitlements.  I join Senator Robinson in saying that many of these entitlements are legal entitlements contributed to by the people concerned.  The State is only an agency to protect them. The State took the contributions in the beginning and, it should pass on the benefits to the people who are in need.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have set out many have reservations about this Social Welfare Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Minister brought forward the payments <Col N="2128" /> to July as opposed to the Fine Gael proposals to introduce them in November. I do not feel the 3 per cent will meet the increased costs to which these people had been subjected.  I suggest that the Minister take on board the suggestions of the Labour Party that should be a minimum of 4 per cent from July which would take into account some of the increases in the cost of living since the last increase.</P>
    <P>In the previous budget debate and on the previous Social Welfare Bill Fianna Fáil moved an amendment that all social welfare payments be made from April. Perhaps we might still see some light at the end of the tunnel, that the kind of philosophy the Minister had in Opposition might emerge now that he is in Government.  We would certainly be very supportive of the Minister if he adopted that attitude.  We had set up alternative projects for budgeting and financing.  We have not been reckless in our suggestions but we have been concerned about people in the lower income bracket.  We want to ensure that there are other moneys available which would help to fund social welfare schemes, a matter of concern to all of us, and particularly to the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Dr. O'Donoghue Dr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to the House and I wish him well on his appoinment.  I hope he will have the opportunity to become immersed in the work of the Department of Social Welfare and to undertake a number of reforms which I think all of us would agree are necessary even through we would not all agree on the particular scale or direction of some of the precise reforms.  My contribution will be brief because a number of the points have already been dealt with and I am aware that other Senators wish to contribute to the debate.  There are a few points which I think are relevant.  I welcome the fact that payment of the 3 per cent increase is being brought forward to July.  That is a proper move.  Whatever about being able in some later year to advance the date of payment to April, certainly it would have been unfortunate had it been <Col N="2129" /> necessary to postpone payment of any increase until November.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement is to be welcomed.  Because of the higgledy-piggledy nature of our tax and welfare system improvements have to be carried out.  Earlier when I was speaking on the Health Contributions Bill I made the point that that system is a tax and it should be regarded as such.  We should not cod ourselves that we are talking about insurance or anything else.  I have to say to Senator Ferris that all of the contributions in the social welfare area are effectively taxes.  It is not an insurance system.  It would stretch the meaning of insurance to incredible lengths to pretend to ourselves that we are operating a social insurance system.  We are not.  The vast bulk of the money comes from general taxation or, in so far as it comes through the PRSI system, is by way of a contribution from the employer and a small proportion from the employee.  Essentially in both cases it is a straightforward tax.  There is no obvious relationship between the contributions made by the people and the nature of the benefits they derive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement is one of the few ways in which we can try to cope with some of the poverty traps our system creates.  The Minister in his speech listed the way in which the improvement would work out, that you pay 50 per cent of the difference between the actual income and the limit which in the case of a family with children, would be £148.  In the case of a married man with three children who is working and earning £120 a week, under this improved arrangement he will now be entitled to a family income supplement of £14 a week. This will help to improve the family position. At the same time, the PRSI system is going to take away £9 a week by way of his contribution and if he has no other deductions under the income tax code the income tax system will take away £7 a week.  With one hand the Minister is giving £14 and on the other hand the Minister is taking away £16.  Let us take another case of a married man with five children who is earning £160 a week. <Col N="2130" /> With the limit he could get half the difference up to £192; in other words he would get £16 a week.  Again, his PRSI contribution could be £12 and his income tax could be as much as £20 a week.  In his case the Minister thinks he needs a family income supplement and gives him £16 but the two tax measures take away £32.  This illustrates the nature of the mess we have created down through the years by going at all of these spending and revenue-generating programmes on an individual departmental or activity basis.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and his colleagues now that they are embarking on a fresh term of Government to stand back from and consider many of these schemes.  If they are going to talk about reforms and introduce measures, would they please sit down and look at the way in which the whole set of tax and spending programmes affect families.  If the Minister is trying to take account of different families circumstances perhaps it could be done on a generalised basis and not have one part of the tax system contradicting other parts.  In that context it would be important to have regard to the effect of many of the housing programmes on social welfare, health and income tax and so on.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I am always fascinated to try to arrive at why you can end up with quite different numbers.  Earlier today we discussed at length why the contribution ceiling should go up from £14,000 a year to £15,000 and we are a couple of hours later solemnly discussing why the PRSI ceiling should go up from £14,700 to £15,500.  Could we not just pick one figure if we must run these different systems?</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon inquired of the Minister what would be the effect of abolishing the ceiling altogether.  The effect is quite simple.  Why not call it income tax and say that you want to raise the top rate of income tax from 58 per cent to 65.5 per cent?  Effectively that is what we would be doing if we abolished the ceiling.  If you are going to have an income tax system that is geared in some sense to people's ability to pay, use the income <Col N="2131" /> tax system and use it along for that purpose. Do not have three or four different Departments of State all finding around with their various attempts to take account of different personal or family circumstances.  That is the essential point I want to emphasise and to ask the Minister to take into account when he is seeing where we should go from here in the area of social welfare reform.</P>
    <P>A number of people keep referring to this report of the Commission on Social Welfare as a sort of blueprint for reform. I suggest strongly to the Minister that he be very cautious in using it as his guide or his model.  I regard it as a very unsatisfactory report.  It is very woolly and contradictory in places.  It treats some issues in the social welfare area very superficially and it goes into other issues in greater detail but in a rather selective way.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate two of the basic problems on which they appeared unable to make up their minds.  At some places they appear to be arguing in favour of universal, straightforward access and entitlement to benefits, with no sort of means tests or other indignities.  That is fine, but then they recognise the need and the importance, especially when money is scarce as we know it is, of targeting programmes so that they really reach those who are in need.  That is great.  Now let the commission make-up their mind as to which of those two horses they want to back.  They cannot have both.  I say to the Minister that I have no doubt in the prevailing circumstances, and what I imagine will be the circumstances for a number of years to come, we should be targeting.  We cannot pretend we can afford the luxury of some sort of universal treatment such as given elsewhere in the examples.  There was talk about having no means tests, there was the pretence it was an insurance matter where a person had an automatic entitlement, where people with quite large incomes were entitled to three or four sets of pensions or benefits and so on, while people very much lower down the income scale genuinely find themselves in extremely <Col N="2132" /> restricted or impoverised circumstances. Therefore I suggest that when the Minister is looking at the basic direction in which to go he should put the money on targeting rather than on universality.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the revenue side of it the commission at some points appear to be endorsing the idea of income tax as a very satisfactory source of revenue because it takes account of ability to pay, that you can give tax free allowances, you can distinguish between single and married and so forth.  When they get on to how to finance social welfare, for some peculiar reason they appear to accept the idea of the straightforward proportional PRSI.  If memory serves me correctly, they say that this is an expression of social solidarity or something like that.  I have forgotten the precise expression but it struck me as an extraordinary way of apparently endorsing something but not, apparently, recognising that there was a fundamental conflict between putting your money on a proportion of taxes and putting your money on progressive taxes.</P>
    <P>I give those two illustrations in order to let the Minister know that, while individual bits in that report may well be worth introducing, he should be extremely careful in regarding it as a satisfactory basis.  I suggest to him, especially knowing of his interest and involvement in many welfare activities and so forth over the years, that he bring his own approach to it and feel free to start from first principles and take whatever advice, guidance and expert support he needs in the matter and arrive at his own programme for reform.  I am confident that at the end of the day that will be a more satisfactory set of arrangements than those contained in that rather lengthy, detailed but ultimately very unsatisfactory document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is day four of the phoney war.  Nobody in his wildest dreams could classify this as a budget debate because nobody is debating.  Fine Gael are gone, and the Government are missing.  Yet, an impression seems to be abroad that a real hard-line debate is <Col N="2133" /> taking place in the Houses of the Oireachtas on this draconian budget, and everybody insists upon running around firing blanks.  One set of players are taking part: a junior Minister who preceded the Minister today here gave us a lecture about a strong, determined Fianna Fáil Government, a brave minority Government who are going to take on everybody.  Yet, for the first time in the history of the State the Government had a budget underwritten by the Opposition, not just by one Opposition party but by two Opposition parties.  We have a minority Government but they have the biggest majority in the history of the State because nobody wants to fight them and they give a pretence of bravery.  From what my spies tell me, I understand the Cabinet are having strong second thoughts about the construction grants, so we may well see some of the worst features of this Ministers legislation overturned in the next couple of weeks also. We would welcome that.</P>
      <P>This budget debate indicates that we are the closest thing to a national Government we will ever see; we have Fianna Fáil in Government and we also have Fine Gael and the contest is to see who can inflict the most pain.  One thing we can be sure of its that the Government will get away with it.  It is laughable when we are talking about social welfare fraud and bringing in international consultants &mdash; I was watching the Minister when Senator Ferris referred to these foreign consultants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suspect they are the Irish-based section of a foreign consultancy firm.  There is a reality the Minister should consider here in terms of fraud.  If £500,000 goes missing in social welfare fraud it is a crime, and nobody should stand over crimes of that nature. However, it strikes me as rather odd that so much attention is being paid to this, particularly when we look across the water.  We have similar systems here in terms of company law, the Stock Exchange and so on and we see that one <Col N="2134" /> guy in Britain can walk away with £5 million on his own.  One guy in the city of London ran away with more money than the entire amount lost in social welfare fraud in this country.  In that regard if Senator Ross were present perhaps he could enlighten me as to what happens on the Stock Exchange and other financial circles in Dublin.  We set up a special task force, an international team of consultants, to do what?  To find out what? If the Minister's officials on the ground cannot tell him who is ripping off the system and how they do it then he should get rid of them.  There are not very many ways in which the system can be ripped off.</P>
      <P>This continuous emphasis on social welfare fraud does one thing.  It puts up a smokescreen suggesting that the rest of society is lily white.  Everybody goes to great paints to make a fine distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Tax avoidance happens when you have enough money to pay £10,000 a year to a high flyer accountant who can keep you one millimetre inside the law.  Tax evasion is when you cannot afford the advice, you are too poor to seek advice, so you become a criminal.  The line is very thin.  I did not hear the Minister for Finance talking about bringing in a high powered team of consultants to check on every doctor to ensure that he puts down every £10 as part of his income instead of into his hip pocket to be forgotten about and on any lawyer who made a secret deal with a client, like 10 per cent of the compensationary sum, and did not declare that.  Where are the international team of consultants looking at those professions or at the engineers?  No, it does not happen.  There is one target in this Bill, the poor.  It is as simple and as basic as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This ministerial speech is also dishonest to some extent.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Many of the provisions in the Bill have already been the subject of much debate during the run up to the general election&rdquo;. Some of my colleagues here are on the Seanad trail and very familiar with the phrase &ldquo;We will look after that&rdquo;. In fairness to the Fine Gael crowd, they <Col N="2135" /> put up the hard options, but where was the debate?  All Fianna Fáil ever said when they were asked what they would do about social welfare or employment was &ldquo;We will look after that.&rdquo;  They did not say how.  Now it is known exactly how they will look after that.  Now the people know in great detail, indeed.  Now the construction industry knows that promises are not alone made to be broken, but that they will be broken within 24 hours of taking office.</P>
    <P>Among the many provisions in this Bill there is one called job search.  Senator Ferris asked an interesting question in this sense.  What new information will they seek?  Will they measure you, or weigh you?  Where is the new angle here? What is happening here of course &mdash; and Deputy Woods will be aware of it because there are many cries against his predecessor in the House, Deputy Desmond, about monetarism, Thatcherism and so on &mdash; is that job search is like a scheme that was run in England.  The whole idea is to frighten the life out of you so that you will sign off if you are doing any little jiggery-pokery.  As we all know, some of the people defrauding social welfare would quality for the family income supplement if they only knew how to apply.  It struck me very much that if the job search programme was a genuine attempt to talk to people who were actively seeking work, why not ask people to volunteer?  Why look to interview 150,000 because the Government have not 150,000 jobs.  The most the Government can offer is 40,000 jobs, so why not ask for 40,000 volunteers and then if they did not get them, I would support the Government in bringing them all in.</P>
    <P>The philosophy behind this is quite different from job placement.  This is finding out in what places they are working. The reality is that if the scheme were designed for job placement, you would first of all ask people to come in and have such discussion.  The interviewing of 150,000 will not happen in the lifetime of this Government, I can tell the House &mdash; even if the Government last for a full <Col N="2136" /> year &mdash; because it is not possible.  The staff would have to interview about 4,000 people a week.  I understand there is a Public Service recruitment embargo as well.  So if a man or woman employee in a Manpower office goes sick, things come to a standstill.  The thing is not ill-thought out; it is a bit of a scab and the great scandal is that Fine Gael are part of this scab.  Their very actions demonstrate that.</P>
    <P>With regard to deserted wives, there is a sound rationale behind ensuring that people with responsibilities live up to them.  The reality for a deserted wife is that if the husband disappears the marriage has been such, particularly where violence is concerned, that she hopes to God nobody will ever find him.  In many cases, local authorities try to assist people like that by moving them from their address in order to protect them from their husbands.  The wife is now going to have the Minister for Social Welfare producing the husband whom she does not want.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give this very careful consideration, in conjunction with the Department of Justice. There is a very laid-back approach by many of the gardaí in relation to the enforcement of barring orders, which is the first line of protection.  If the Minister is intent on finding the husband she does not want to be found because of fear, then the Minister will want to make absolutely sure his counterpart in Justice gives full cognisance to the fact that people need to be protected.  That is a point I hope will be taken on board.  It will be a very difficult job.  There were occasions in the Dáil when the then Minister, Deputy Desmond, could have done with his active assistance and it was not forthcoming but I am sure that Deputy Desmond, being a generous man, will afford that backing and support to the Minister Deputy Woods, in regard to good legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>As most of the speakers have said so far, there is no doubt that the provisions contained in this Bill are an improvement on the provisions <Col N="2137" /> suggested by the Fine Gael Party in their budget prior to the last election.  In that sense, and in that sense only, the Bill before us can be given some degree of welcome.  The bottom line about the Bill &mdash; and it is a bottom line which is shared by Fine Gael with Fianna Fáil &mdash; is that it constitutes a radical attack on the social welfare system as it has been constructed under pressure from the Labour movement over many generations.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not increase flat rate benefits in line with inflation in the current year.  The decision to cut pay-related benefit from the present rates of 20 and 25 per cent to an average rate of 12 per cent is a radical undermining of the whole pay-related concept as introduced in the mid-seventies. The provision whereby the contribution conditions for a number of benefits have been increased, seems to suggest that we are witnessing the beginning of the dismantlement of the welfare system as we have known it.</P>
      <P>All of these things have been proposed now at a time when neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael appear to be prepared to do other things which are obviously and self-evidently necessary; that is, they do not appear to be prepared to widen the tax base, as has been suggested over many years by all of us who understand and believe in the notion of social equity. In the area of social insurance alone, they do not appear to be prepared to go any further than indicating that they are looking into the prospect of bringing into social insurance those categories of the workforce at present outside the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill constitutes a direct attack on welfare recipients, indeed on the system itself.  The Minister referred to fraud in the social welfare system.  As Senator Ferris and others have said, none of us condones the fraudulent taking of benefits from that system.  Let me point to the real fraud in this provision.  The real fraud is that at a time when pay-related benefits are being radically curtailed there is no indication of an intention on the part of the Government to radically reduce pay-related social insurance contributions. When pay-related benefit was <Col N="2138" /> introduced here in the mid seventies pay-related social insurance contributions were also introduced to pay for it.  Now that the Government are in the process of dismantling the pay-related benefit side of that equation they could have had the decency to set about reducing the pay-related social insurance contributions workers at present pay into the system.</P>
    <P>In what is taking place it seems to me there is a very significant political lesson to be learned and it is this: the centre right parties in this country through their economic policies over the past ten years have brought the country virtually to a halt, certainly to the point of major financial crisis.  When it comes to sorting out that crisis there is no way they will look at those things I have mentioned, such as widening the tax base or extending the social insurance system, both of which could be done forthwith if the will were there.  Instead they zone in on the weakest in society and on those services designed to help and protect them.</P>
    <P>The measures I have indicated which appear to me to constitute the beginning of the dismantlement of the social welfare system today must be viewed in conjunction with other measures before us, such as taxing the sick at out-patient clinics, taxing the sick if they have to remain in hospital overnight, measures of that kind, and failing to extend the tax base. Sooner or later what working people will have to realise is that they are now being asked to bear the brunt of the failure of policies over which they have had no control for the past ten years and which have put this country in its present state.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention two further matters.  In relation to the job search programme, perhaps the Minister would indicate whether the 40,000 National Manpower Service opportunities, to which he referred in the course of his remarks, are new opportunities in new services or schemes or whether they represent an accumulation of existing Teamwork schemes, social employment schemes and work experience schemes of one kind or another.  Are they the same schemes about which we are talking or <Col N="2139" /> are they new schemes, new jobs, new opportunities?  Senator Magner is correct, this job search concept is designed to do two things only, to frighten off the live register people who may be abusing the scheme to some extent.  Many of us are aware that it is impossible to live on existing social welfare payments, particularly families, on a flat rate benefit of one kind or another.  Undoubtedly there are some people who take up the odd piece of extra work in order to survive financially.  No doubt this measure is designed to terrify them, get them off the live register.  Beyond that, unless there is something in it the Minister has not yet indicated, the scheme is a major con job on young people in particular and indeed on the unemployed generally.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Minister will know from his constituency &mdash; which is close to the one in which I happen to be involved &mdash; anybody who is now unemployed, certainly in the city of Dublin &mdash; and I am sure the position cannot be all that different outside it &mdash; is doing everything he or she can possibly do to find employment. They are signing on at Manpower offices, being interviewed by Manpower staff, are applying for AnCO courses and getting on such courses whenever they can and are taking up work experience programmes.  They are doing all of these things already without the need for interviews by social welfare staff or staff of the National Manpower service.  This is the only specific question I wanted to ask the Minister this evening: can he tell us in what way the job search programme will be different from the combination of existing services being widely utilised? As we know, certainly in Dublin, the difficulty is that there are not sufficient social employment schemes or Teamwork schemes available.  Therefore, in what way is this new system different from that obtaining?  Can the Minister indicate precisely how it is intended to interview 150,000 unemployed people this year?  What kinds of interviews are involved?  What will be their purpose and where will such people be interviewed?</P>
    <P>The substantive point I want to make <Col N="2140" /> basically is a political one, which is that the centre right economic strategy pursued here over the past ten to 15 years has been a failure.  We are in the most serious economic crisis of any European country.  Yet, when the crisis finally arises, when those same parties which brought about that failure, must face some form of reality at the end of the day, the burden of resolving that crisis is automatically, almost without thinking, directed at welfare recipients, at the unemployed, at the sick, precisely those people who cannot take anymore.</P>
    <P>While the measures in this Bill are better than those proposed by Fine Gael in their budget strategy, and in that sense are to be welcomed, nonetheless they constitute an attack on the welfare system and on those for whom that system was designed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for a wide-ranging, interesting and, in many respects, informative and searching debate this afternoon.  We could spend much time discussing the points raised. Indeed, I could see quite a convergence of views on the issues raised.  We can tease out many of those questions on another occasion when I am sure we will find much common ground in our approach to them.</P>
      <P>In examining this Bill and its provisions one must remember the position in which the Government found themselves.  For example, bringing forward the 3 per cent increase to July cost an extra £19 million. That amount had to be found and it was provided.  It would have been nice to have brought the increase forward to April but that would have cost an additional £20 million which was not feasible in the circumstances prevailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Senators referred to the family income supplement, a very important scheme which has not been sufficiently publicised.  I agree entirely with what was said about it.  This Bill involves a 69 per cent increase in the supplement at the maximum level for a family with five or more children.  A family on £5,400 would get a supplement of £2,200 and it reduces <Col N="2141" /> down to a family on £10,000 getting nothing.  This is a very important measure. I am surprised that many of the people who comment on poverty outside this House are not saying more clearly that this is a good thing, that it will substantially help the people on low incomes if it is taken up.  I will do my best to ensure that it is taken up.</P>
    <P>Senators will know that over the years a number of us have been keen to have dental and other benefits extended to the spouses of the full rate PRSI contributors. That is included in the proposals which we have here and is a considerable achievement in our economic circumstances.  It represents approximately a .2 per cent bonus for the PRSI contributor.  We are inclined to forget that.  I looked at this in 1982 and I was anxious to achieve it.  It represents the equivalent of a .2 per cent bonus, or 40p a week at the £200 a week level, which is the level of the average industrial wage.  That was not achieved when there was a lot of money about and it should have been.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment benefit, the reality is that the abridged Estimates and the budget took credit for the reduction in unemployment benefit to 12 months.  We are extending it back to 15 months and that costs money.  That is important.  About one million workers are affected by it.  That is something I have achieved for them under the present negotiations.</P>
    <P>There was also the proposed extension from three to six days in the sickness benefit waiting period.  This year that would have affected 144,000 people going on sickness benefit but it would have affected over 500,000 people who would have lost benefit if it had gone through, because the majority of workers are not covered by other schemes. Senator Ferris suggested that there should be compulsory schemes to cover everybody but there are not, and the reality I had to face as Minister was that if that measure went through more than 50 per cent of employees would not be covered if they became ill.  That proposal <Col N="2142" /> would have been in breach of the minimum international standards as set out by the ILO and the Council of Europe to which we are signatories.</P>
    <P>The other question is that of the increasing contribution conditions.  The only paid contributions are the 26, now increased to 39 contributions, when one is originally entering the scheme.  They can be accumulated over a period.  The subsequent contributions are paid or credited so the only people affected by this are people going out of the scheme completely who do not have paid or credited contributions in the previous year.  If they were unemployed for part of the year they would get credited contributions and that keeps them fully involved for any of the benefits.  It is important to make that point.</P>
    <P>This was a very interesting debate. Senator O'Brien very magnanimously welcomed many of the measures in the Bill and was glad to see a genuine effort to protect the position of those dependent on social welfare.  The Senator was particularly concerned about fraud, as were other Senators.  In that connection, the consultancy work has been going on since the middle of last year.  One Senator was correct in saying that these consultants, whom I did not bring in, were an Irish firm with an international wing.  They have been working in two phases.  The cost of the first phase was £50,000 but the cost of the second phase is another matter about which I would rather not talk at this time.  I was asked if we would report the findings.  I will make the findings available to both Houses in the normal way as far as I can.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon asked about broadening the base, bringing in the self-employed and abolishing the upper ceiling. Senator O'Donoghue mentioned that this would effectively turn it into a tax, but 92 per cent of all income is currently included at the £15,500 level.  If we abolished the ceiling completely this year we would get an extra £13 million.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about the free fuel scheme.  I will be reviewing that out of necessity because of some of the problems that have arisen there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> Senator Robinson expressed surprise and amazement that I did not refer to the McDermott and Cotter case and give the Department's views.  I am sure Senator Robinson knows that that matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  There was a finding going back to the High Court, and the Department naturally will not pre-empt the findings or investigations of the High Court and will await the results of the High Court deliberations.  Senator Robinson said it was a glaring and very worrying omission, but I find that very strange language from a Senator who is very much aware of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the cost of living index and asked whether the 3 per cent increase was adequate.  On an estimate the 3 per cent to July 1987 and to July 1988 matches inflation.  By bringing this increase back to July it matches inflation but had we left it at November, it would have been equivalent to only a 2 per cent increase this year rising to 3 per cent thereafter.  Various people asked about the Combat Poverty Scheme.  Senator Robinson suggested that £1.3 million was not enough.  I was very glad to come out of the deliberations with the £1.3 million intact.  If Senators look all around they might find that perhaps I did very well to keep that intact.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the question of deserted wives and welcomed the pursuit of the husbands. Senator Magner referred to this also and I want to make it clear that it is not a question in any way of the involvement of a wife.  Basically, when a deserted wife's benefit or allowance has been awarded, subsequently the wife is not in a position to pursue the husband for many reasons, some of which Senator Robinson mentioned.  That should be taken up by the State.</P>
    <P>The growth in the cost in this area has been considerable.  It is approximately £41 million this year.  In 1982 there were 6,698 beneficiaries of deserted wife's benefit and allowance costing £16.6 million; in 1986 there were 10,600 beneficiaries costing £38.5 million and the estimate for 1987 is £41.8 million.  Senators will realise <Col N="2144" /> that the figure is a worrying one in relation to the total funds available to the Department of Social Welfare.  This is one aspect which I hope to pursue.  I want to make it quite clear that I am talking about the pursuit of the husband.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris said he would prefer postponement to July so as to get everything right.  The first problem with this is that income is postponed.  If I postpone the income of the Department of Social Welfare, I will be in much more serious trouble when I get to July.  The figures are based on the income from 6 April as against the expenditure increases from July.  I am sure when the Senator reflects on that he will realise the position in which I would find myself.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris also mentioned the Christmas bonus and said that as Minister I had shown no imagination and made no comment on this.  I should like to point out to the Senator that I was the Minister who introduced the Christmas bonus originally.  Naturally, I would have been very happy to be in a position to include the commitment and the financing for it at this stage but it will be considered later in the year, as has been the case each year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that will be considered. I dealt with the single over 45 allowance in my speech.  This would have created another anomaly.  Senator Ferris mentioned that it was a pet subject of the former Deputy Bermingham.  It would have created an anomaly, the kind of anomaly the Commission has suggested should not be created.  There might be cases which would take precedence if you were to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris spoke at great length about pay-related benefit and the 12 per cent rate.  I understand his concern in this area.  He felt that this was a very unusual step and that the whole concept of the benefit was being affected.  In the 1983 Coalition Government, in which the Labour Party were fully immersed at that stage, reduced the rate from 40 per cent to 25 per cent, then to 20 per cent the <Col N="2145" /> level at which it is at now, because the cost was too high and it could not be met. That was the reality at that time.  Senator Ferris will be aware that in the United Kingdom pay-related benefit has been abolished.  He will realise that as Minister for Social Welfare I will have to face this option because it is one that will be raised.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris also talked about the floor level.  In January 1982 the floor was £25; in January 1983, £32; in April 1983, £36; in April 1984, £43; in April 1985, £45; in April 1986, £58; and in April 1987, £62.  The Senator will realise that in effect only a minimal increase in the floor is taking place.  What I stated in my speech is true; it has been raised consistently each year, particularly in recent years.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that this is an insurance scheme and to that extent I differ from Senator O'Donoghue.  The employee, the employer and the State all contribute to it.  The figures for this year are that the employee will be contributing £310 million, which is 23 per cent; the employers £640 million, which is 47 per cent; and the Exchequer £417 million, which is 30 per cent.  It has always been on the basis of the employer paying roughly twice what the employee pays and the Exchequer contributing 20 to 25 per cent. One can see the difficulty for the Exchequer in having to find 30 per cent at this stage.  There are a reduced number of contributors and there is an increased burden to be met.  This is the position in relation to pay-related social insurance.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to the job search programme.  Senator Ferris wanted to know what sort of interviews would be carried out and what was going on in this area.  I have already appointed a job search supremo &mdash; an assistant secretary who has moved to my Department. He will be heading up our efforts in this area.  I am also getting a number of other high level staff.  The job search programme is new and there is a large commitment of resources to it.  Senators would want to change gear in relation to the job search programme.  It is not a question of going back to the same staff <Col N="2146" /> and the same situation; it is being undertaken on a large scale.</P>
    <P>I fully accept what the Senators said in relation to this but they may not fully appreciate the extent to which resources and staff are being committed to it.  The resources and staff of Manpower, AnCO and my Department are being directed towards the people on the live register to give the maximum support and attention in efforts to place them in jobs, schemes, and Manpower placement areas.  This is the nature of the job search programme. These people will receive priority in Manpower placements.</P>
    <P>As Senators may be aware, an additional 1,500 Manpower placements are being created in the social employment scheme.  Manpower will give priority to 40,000 placements.  There will be genuine placements for those people. I will ensure that that will be the case.  I accept fully that an indirect effect may be to discover people who were not genuinely available for work and who may not want to go onto these schemes or take up a job.  This is an indirect aspect of the job search programme.  As Minister for Social Welfare I will be directing the whole operation.  I will have high level staff looking after it specifically and I will ensure it is used as an aid to those on the live register rather than as a means to hassle them or raise difficulties for them. From that experience I hope we will build new systems and improve our approach.</P>
    <P>The interviews will be longer than the interviews which take place at present. Some of the 12,000 job search places will be on specific programmes of three to four weeks duration in AnCO centres.  In the Department we have carried out pilot studies which have shown us the way to go.  It is important to note that this Government are committing many resources to the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a distinct programme, although it is of a similar nature, building up skills to seek employment and so on. The second period would be spent seeking employment and we will make resources available to them &mdash; funds, postage and so on.  As I said, 12,000 extra job search places are being provided.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that when Senators look at a measure like this and hear of pilot studies being carried out they may ask how this can lead to such a large undertaking, but as Minister for Social Welfare I could not have reached that stage if the Taoiseach and the Government had not supported me because it meant bringing resources from different agencies together to help those on the live register. In that sense, this is a particularly interesting development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various comments were made on the <Col N="2148" /> report of the Commission on Social Welfare. I have not had much time to deal with this up to now, but I will give it my attention when these matters are cleared. Senator Magner raised the question of consultants and I have already covered that, point.  Senators mentioned the overemphasis on social welfare fraud and I tried to put that into perspective.  Senator O'Mahony suggested there should be reduced contributions from workers because of the decision to reduce pay-related benefit.  I have mentioned the financial problem which exists in this area and the bonus of approximately .2 per cent on the benefits.  That too can be taken into consideration.  I mentioned the contribution levels and the fact that the State will contribute 30 per cent towards the fund this year.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered a reasonable number of the Senators' queries.  I have found the discussion very interesting and searching.  I have kept exentisve notes of the points they raised and I will refer to them in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the reason the amount of reckonable earnings is increasing at a faster rate than inflation?  I accept this Government, as well as the previous Government have had to raise additional finance and I recognise this is one of the ways in which they thought it appropriate to raise finance but I never had an intellectual commitment to support 100 per cent anything the last Government did.  The Minister will not be surprised to know that I do not have an intellectual commitment to support 100 per cent anything he does either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; the amount of this maximum is being increased by approximately 7 per cent at a time when inflation is running at 3 per cent.  It represents an escalation rather than leaving things as they are.  I recognise the difficult budgetary situation this Government and the last Government faced.  The real solution to these problems is to reduce the amount of money the State is spending, not to increase taxation.  Whatever way one looks at this it is an increase in taxation.  The increase from £14,700 to £15,500, an increase of £800 or an increase of approximately 5 per cent or 6 <Col N="2150" /> per cent at a time when inflation is running at under 4 per cent, represents an increase in taxation.</P>
    <P>I am against this proposal for two reasons.  First, I do not think it is a fair kind of tax and, secondly, I do not think we should be increasing taxation at all.  I understand that the State finances are in a dire situation but the Minister should tackle the problem by reducing expenditure but not in the social welfare area and not by increasing taxation.  Will the Minister tell us why this ceiling under this Government and previous Governments has been increasing at a rate faster than inflation?  This is a very worrying trend and one I certainly do not support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several reasons for the increase from £14,700 to £15,500 which was, of course, part of the Fine Gael budget proposal.  There is another problem in relation to this.  If the books and ready reckoners and so on that relate to this had not already been circulated at this stage one could not implement anything from 6 April.  That is another restriction on either increasing or reducing that level or changing the previous proposal.  The figure represents a 5.4 per cent increase and that is broadly in line with projected increases in average earnings over the period as distinct from the 3 per cent to which the Senator referred in regard to social welfare.  One of the problems is that it is necessary to keep the social insurance fund solvent.  As the Senator was not here when I mentioned the figures before I should like to tell him that the employees contribution to the fund this year will be £310 million and the Exchequer contribution will be £417 million.  The employers' contribution will be £640 million.  This means that notwithstanding this increase from £14,700 to £15,500 the Exchequer is still having to put 30 per cent into the fund.  They are the practical considerations.  The money is needed.  I appreciate the Senator saying that it should be found somewhere else. That goes along the lines suggested by Senator O'Donoghue, that there is no such thing as a fund, that it is really all a <Col N="2151" /> tax in any event.  That is a different matter.  There is a fund so far as I am concerned as Minister and it is one which is operated for the beneficiaries, the PRSI contributors.  The existing position is that the State, through the Exchequer, will be providing 30 per cent to make up the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that it is a matter of Government policy? I am not impressed when he says that this was the previous Government's policy because if it was another Minister who was present I would say precisely the same thing to him.  Is the Minister saying that he has, as a policy, a limit on the State's contribution to that fund?  Is it the policy that that will be 30 per cent or whatever percentage the Minister would like to indicate to the House?  Has he a further policy as to what the proportional contribution between employers and employees should be?  If the Minister helps us in that regard might it explain why there seems to be a disproportionate increase in this ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There should have been the same cut-off point as in the previous legislation because there is a certain element of confusion now.  Apparently there is an administrative reason for it.  I should like to dwell for a moment on Senator O'Leary's comment about the State's contribution bringing in £417 million. Obviously, that was a set Government decision.  It is possible for the Government to decide to wave some of the contribution from employers and that may prove an incentive for them to employ more people.  That can be varied up and down.  The level of employees' percentage at 23 per cent is not varied, although the benefits can be undermined and have been undermined by this Bill. The level of percentage by employees because it is not indexed means that it goes up which makes it another system of taxation.  The Minister's answer to a question about this worries me.  He has already had ready reckoners printed to send out to employers to bring in this <Col N="2152" /> money and he has said that if he did not have it done by now he would be in difficulty.  That is a frightful insult to this House.  I warn the Minister never to presume so far as this House is concerned because it can, even with the vast majority he is likely to have after the election, express very strong views on certain elements of legislation coming from another place.  Legislation has had to be amended in this House on numerous occasions; otherwise it would have been bad legislation.  The Minister should never print or publish ready reckoners in anticipation of being able to walk into the House and get legislation through, ignore what we have to say about it and then walk out again.  The last reason in the world that he should put forward is that there are ready reckoners printed.  I am sorry if I sound cross about this but I do respect this House and the contribution it makes to legislation.  I would not like any Minister to presume what we might do on any section of a Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be frank with the Senator, we are faced with a decision made by our predecessor which, had they not made it, could not be implemented next Monday.  That is what the rush is about and there is no point in us playing games with one another here.  It could be cancelled entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make it correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be cancelled entirely as a Senator suggested and left until July with no income for those on social welfare, the old age pensioners, the sick and the widows whom I am looking after.  There is no point in me pretending to Senator that that is not the reality.  I would be hypocritical if I did not say that the decision to prepare that documentation, those computer programmes and those books had to be taken a month ago.  It could all be scrapped if both Houses decided not to go ahead with this legislation.  An election took place about the time a budget should have been going through the House and I wish that we did not have that happening again.  It throws <Col N="2153" /> all the State's administration into chaos including the collection of funds which are essential particularly for the weaker sections of our society.</P>
      <P>That is the reality.  I am not blaming anyone.  That is how it turned out this year.  I cannot send my officials out tonight to get the computer programmes organised around the country for next Monday.  I am sure Senators realise that. However, we could tell people to cancel it and keep the money.</P>
      <P>As regards the amount of the increase, under section 10 (2) (b) the Minister is required, when making regulations, to take into account any changes in the average earnings of workers in transportable goods industries as recorded by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary asked about the 30 per cent.  If we go back a few years we will see that the State would not have gone above 20 per cent because of the burden on the taxpayer.  Gradually because of the increase in unemployment and the greater numbers involved the percentage increased.  It represents a substantial contribution in historical terms from the Exchequer's point of view.  This fund is a very important one for the beneficiaries. They benefit substantially and that is why I would not be in favour of some of the suggestions which are made from time to time that the fund should be regarded as a tax and done away with. The fund is an excellent one from the point of view of the worker.  If a worker dies, Senators and Deputies are very glad to be able to say that there is an automatic contributory pension available from this fund.  When workers fall ill or become unemployed there are benefits available for them.</P>
      <P>These are difficult times.  The difference between this level and the level of the health charges is one which perhaps in the future will be overcome.  Now that they are so close together it is difficult to see why there should be such a difference between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the extension of the scheme which previously operated with regard to additional employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an excellent scheme and I congratulate the Minister for extending it.  It is a positive contribution towards additional employment, which is important.  The enactment of a scheme like this creates a cost on the fund by way of the contributions which are foregone. Is that contribution to the fund made good by a special subvention from the Exchequer or does the shortfall in the fund fall to be divided in the three ways to which the Minister referred.  What we are saying is that we think it is good from the point of view of the policy of the State for certain employers to be given exemptions from making their full contributions in respect of additional employees.  As a result there is a shortfall in funds.  Is there a special subvention from general taxation or does the cost of this scheme fall upon the fund itself?  If it does, the cost of the scheme is borne by the insured workers rather than by the general body of taxpayers.  Is it proposed that a special subvention should be made from general Exchequer funds to the social insurance fund to offset the shortfall which will result from the implementation of this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this.  It had a beneficial effect on unemployment figures and was taken up by employers. It was an incentive to them to employ additional workers.  Any legislation which would encourage employers to give employment must be welcomed.  In the event of employees who are taken on by employers under this scheme qualifying for unemployment or disability benefit, will they be guaranteed their full rate of benefit from the fund?  In other words will the fact that the employers did not pay their contribution for them count <Col N="2155" /> against the employee?  The employee should not be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last point first, they will be as fully entitled as if they had made a contribution in the normal way. As regards Senator O'Leary's point the cost is £500,000.  That is taken up by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  When the Minister speaks about 30 per cent being given by the Exchequer, I am anxious that a special and identifiable contribution should be made in respect of this scheme so that it does not distort the percentages being paid by the various parties to the fund.  Would the Minister consider in the administrative operation of this scheme or some future scheme, the identification of a separate contribution, clearly identifiable, as being the State's contribution to the scheme rather than just including it as part of the State's residual liability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's point.  Since the problem is that the State acts as the residual contributor it is difficult to identify a separate contribution. It would be up to the Minister for Social Welfare to make clear that the separate amount should be identified.  The percentage varies each year so it is not as simple as saying that such and such is the percentage and that is the situation. However, I take the Senator's point in relation to an identifiable contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the comment that the fund provided certain guarantees to insured people in respect of their being eligible for these schemes but would he not agree that we have reached a point where, while the fund is there, in practice the Government <Col N="2156" /> can change the contribution or eligibility conditions or change the rate of payments? Despite the fact that employees are paying their social insurance contributions any Minister can bring in legislation stating that pay-related benefits will be effectively halved that is from 25 per cent to 12 per cent.  Let me ask the Minister whether he envisages the situation next year where public finances would be roughly in the same financial difficulty as they are this year where the pay-related benefit element social insurance benefits might well be eliminated altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We disagree fundamentally with this section.  We feel there is no longer a real benefit in insurance terms, or pay-related terms to the beneficiary because of this final movement to the floor situation.  This can be judged from the figures announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day.  This provision which admittedly had been proposed by the outgoing Fine Gael Government is expected to save the Exchequer £13 million.  The Labour Party contend that that £13 million is being taken out of the pockets of people who could be and would be beneficiaries under a pay-related scheme to which they have contributed and to which there is no reduction in the rate of contribution. Their concept of pay-related is fast diminishing. We find ourselves totally in disagreement with this section.  I do not want to disturb the House with another vote, but if the Minister persists in continuing with the section I would like the Chairman to record on the record of the House that the seven Labour Party Senators dissent from this section if that is allowed by Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Mahony mentioned the question of the Minister having the power to change the provision.  It is only the Houses of the Oireachtas that can change it.  I appreciate the points made both by Senator O'Mahony and Senator Ferris.  I would just point out for your information that an interesting point arose when I came to look at this because <Col N="2157" /> I can assure you that I went into all of this in great detail because I would value it greatly for those who would become unemployed.  Nevertheless I am aware of the fact that it has been done away with in Britain.  As regards the question of the future position, as far as I can recollect the Commission on Social Welfare suggested that if the levels were brought up sufficiently then it would not be necessary. That is a long way down the road, as you will understand from the general economic situation.  But the interesting thing when you look into it is that people on the lower earnings of £120, £130 and that sort of figure a week are not affected by the removal of the pay-related benefit because they never got it.  They did not get it because of the wage stop at 85 per cent.  If you like they were caught in a Catch 22 situation, because of the 85 per cent limit on their take home pay they could not actually benefit from it.  Even on the average industrial earnings, of £210 a week for a married couple with four children, the wage stop applies and they would lose £10.30 on PRB as against the present situation.  It is mainly the people on the higher incomes, £300, for instance, where the difference is greater &mdash; it is £15.80 at that level.  That gives an idea of operation of PRB at present. Certainly this measure is only being taken because of the overall economic situation, the vast number of people who are in need of support in this area and the difficulty experienced by the State in providing the additional funding which would be required to maintain the present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the low income earner does not benefit from pay-related benefit is of course a problem of low incomes, rather than of the pay-related benefit system itself necessarily. As the Minister will know the whole concept of pay-related benefit is to cushion workers who are made redundant or become unemployed from a very dramatic fall in their living standards in the first 15 months of unemployment, the expectation being that they may well be <Col N="2158" /> in a position to find alternative employment over that 15 month period.  It is designed to cushion them, from a dramatic drop in income.  Of course workers pay the contributions to the Social Insurance Fund on the basis of their income, so it would in those circumstances be expected that the higher the income the higher the pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if it has come to the point where pay-related benefit now is only 12 per cent of reckonable earnings, that it is virtually nonexistent and if we interfere with the system &mdash; and I am not being again personal to the Minister; I am talking about Government or the Legislature &mdash; to the extent that pay-related benefit is almost eliminated, we really are dismantling in a very radical way a social security system which was built up over many years and under enormous pressure and concern on the part of workers and their representatives to set it in place.  I think the Minister implied that depending on economic circumstances next year, despite the fact that we are talking about a social insurance fund, it is quite conceivable that the remaining negligible 12 per cent pay-related benefit which remains after this Bill is passed can be eliminated altogether and I was interested to hear the Minister say that was not beyond the bounds of possibility and that he would have a difficult task to try to protect what remains of pay-related benefit.  But I wonder if the Minister can give us any insight into what is likely to happen in relation to pay-related benefit in the next 12 months, because it seems to me that we are really at the point where we are threatening to dismantle the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back over the old ground.  The Senator is aware of the fact that in 1983 the level was reduced under difficult circumstances, during the Coalition Government period from 40 per cent down to the 25 per cent followed by 20 per cent.  Another point that I would like to make clear at this stage is that while the saving which <Col N="2159" /> Senator Ferris referred to is there &mdash; and I referred to £13 million in my speech there is £30 million altogether; the fund gets £17.3 million in this year from the Exchequer, the balance of the £30 million goes to the assistance schemes.  The other point is that the maximum pay-related benefit is still a £19 supplement.  A supplement of £19 a week still applies.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Mahony referred to the position one finds one's self in when one is unemployed.  At present for a married couple with four children the income would be £131.20 on average industrial earnings of £210, the position on 12 per cent would be £120.90 and that is the £10 difference.  If you take a person on £120 a week it does not matter how many children they have.  It is the same in both cases, it does not change.  There is a drop at the higher level but there is still a £19 maximum supplement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify the last figures the Minister has kindly given us and which his party were not prepared to give to the public at large before the last election.  It seems, and I suppose it should be repeated because it may well be of interest to people outside, that a spouse with four children who previously had been earning the average industrial wage of £210, were he or she to become unemployed at present would benefit to the extent of about £131 per week.  Following the enactment of this Bill, unless there is a time stop on it and I do not think there is, that person will face a cut of £10 a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in the case of new claimants.  It does not affect existing claimants.  I should point out in my own defence, at this stage, that it was proposed to put that down to 12 months instead of 15 months.  I am now going for 15 months and I regard that as something of an achievement.  I am in agreement with Senators in relation to the need to maintain an adequate level of income for people who become unemployed and to <Col N="2160" /> give them an opportunity over a reasonable period to find some other employment. The Commission on Social Welfare talked about continuing that beyond the 15 months.  My first task was to get it back to 15 months which I have achieved, and that is the position now. There will be 12 per cent for 15 months and it will affect only new claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a similar type proposal, admittedly with the difference that the Minister has correctly retained the 15 months provision for pay related benefit compared with the 12 months proposed by Fine Gael, would he not accept that, as the electorate decided, in the way they voted on the Fine Gael proposal to cut pay related and other social welfare benefits to reject that proposal, it behoved his party in Government to observe that mandate and to leave intact the welfare system?  Fianna Fáil did not indicate, prior to the election, that in the case of a worker with four children who was a new claimant and who had been on the average industrial wage the benefit would be reduced by £10 a week.  Something similar was said by Fine Gael and it was rejected.  Would the Minister not agree that there was no mandate for that decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator were to be present at one of our Parliamentary Party meetings, he would find that we are a very big group now, that we have quite a number of extra seats.  You have to accept that we removed some of the harshest elements from the proposals. One of the steps taken was to bring forward the 3 per cent in any event.  That is a very important step.  You would have to go back to the foundation of the State before you would find pension increases, and other increases, being applied from as late as October, never mind November. In the current circumstances it was <Col N="2161" /> not easy to bring forward the date because it meant finding an additional £19 million.  In addition we have been able to take some steps in relation to pay related and unemployment benefit by restoring the 15 months and the three to six waiting days provisions.  I am surprised that the Labour Senators did not come out stronger on the Fine Gael proposal in that respect because it would have had a major impact on many working people.  I had to make it one of my personal priorities because I realised that many ordinary working people would be very badly affected by a change to 12 months.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves we have done a reasonable job overall to soften some of the harshest elements in the package we found before us.  I hope the Senators appreciate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Minister thinks I do not appreciate what he has done in regard to the three to six days period I want to put it on the record that I do appreciate that change because to have fiddled around with the number of waiting days would have cost recipients about £5.5 million.  On the other side of that section, because you rescinded the decision of the outgoing Government, you expect to save a further £1 million pounds in 1987 through adjustments in the sick pay schemes operated by State and semi-State employers.  We have not been told anything about that.  How is the Minister to get that other £1 million? I presume if it is to be done through the employers, the employees, or the beneficiaries, will suffer.  In applauding the Minister on the £5.5 million perhaps he would now tell me what he is doing about the other £1 million, where it is to come from and who is going to lose it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we can discuss that another day or another night at great length.  Where employees are covered it could be reasonable to have an extension to six days if they were to get the full compensation in that period.  Basically that is the thinking in that area.  As the Senator is aware, many employers pay the full amount to the employee and then <Col N="2162" /> recoup from this fund.  If an arrangement could be reached whereby they would leave it at six days instead of just three days that would obviously benefit the fund but that is a matter for negotiation and discussion.  It is not part of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 makes additional requirements on employees in that the Minister is substituting 26 weeks for 39 contribution weeks so that people would benefit.  Subsection (2) also amends the number of contribution weeks from 156 to 208.  This section represents a substantial saving for the Exchequer and as a result of that I am extremely worried that the people who suffer this £5 million cut in social welfare will be the people we had hoped would be covered under any Social Welfare Act.  Therefore, in changing the number of contribution weeks in subsection (1) and (2) the Minister is making it much more difficult for people to benefit in future and, as a result of this section the Exchequer will get £5 million extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This first subsection deals with entry into the scheme.  The 26 contribution weeks are the paid contributions for entry to the scheme.  Those contributions are for entitlement to benefits. In the circumstances and with the pressures on the funds it is reasonable to require 39 paid or credited contributions for entry into the first fund.  The second is the long term benefit &mdash; the five years which we have reduced to four years. Obviously, I had to make sure money would be found elsewhere to cover difference. Currently it takes three years' contributions to get long term disability and invalidity benefits.  The proposal was to increase that to five years.  We have gone back to four years because we regarded the increase from three to five as being too harsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions for entry can take account of contributions paid at any time. <Col N="2163" /> In my introductory speech I said &ldquo;at any time&rdquo;.  It looks peculiar but it is a technicality, because they can be paid at any time.  They can be paid at different times but once you have 39 contributions you are into the scheme.  Certainly it is a change from 26 to 39, but in all the circumstances and with the pressure on the fund generally I do not think that is unreasonable.  It was, of course, part of the proposals.</P>

However, I hope he appreciates our position.  We are dealing with a section of the people for whom we have responsibility because they are part of our electorate.  They may not necessarily vote for us.  Probably they voted for the Minister's party and now he has done this to them.  We realise the responsibilities he has in his ministry, but I hope he will appreciate that there are fundamental sections in the Bill to which we could not agree.

    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> That, pursuant to subsection 2º of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad Éireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Social Welfare Bill, 1987, on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions contained in the Social Welfare Bill, 1987, are to come into effect on 6 April 1987 and it is necessary, therefore, that the Bill become law by that date.</P>
    <P>Article 25.2.1º of the Constitution contains the general provision that a Bill presented to the President for his signature shall be signed by him not earlier than the fifth and not later than the seventh day after the date on which it is presented to him.  Provision is also made, however, for requesting the President to sign the Bill in advance of the fifth day. The present Social Welfare Bill could not have been passed by the Seanad earlier than today and this does not allow the full interval of seven days, prescribed by Article 25.2.1º of the Constitution, to elapse before 6 April when certain of the provisions contained in the Bill are to come into operation.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided, therefore, that the prior concurrence of Seanad Éireann should be sought pursuant to Article 25.2.2º of the Constitution in a request to the President to sign the Social Welfare Bill, 1987, on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill will be presented to him.</P>

    <Title>Health (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity for the second time today to come before the Upper House of the Oireachtas and seek its support for the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which provides for the amendment of section 56 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>This amendment would enable the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to impose charges in respect of out-patient services as defined in the 1970 Health Act.  The Bill seeks the powers to enable the Minister for Health to make regulations setting out the charges to be made and the categories of people to which they will apply.</P>
      <P>These regulations, when made, will be laid before the House.  Today, I should like to set out what is proposed in relation to the content of those regulations.</P>
      <P>As you see from the Bill, the following exclusions will apply:</P>
      <P>1.  Medical card holders and their dependants.  Approximately 37 per cent of our population are holders of current medical cards and they cover approximately 1.2 million of our population.</P>
      <P>2.  Children suffering from diseases and disabilities of a permanent or long-term nature;</P>
      <P>3.  Children who require attendance on an out-patient basis in respect of defects which have been noticed at a health examination provided in accordance with the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" /> Also excluded by the regulation will be:</P>
    <P>A.  All women in respect of motherhood;</P>
    <P>B.  Infants up to the age of six weeks as already provided for under the 1970 Act;</P>
    <P>C.  Persons receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of certain infectious diseases prescribed under the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>Finally, and most important, the chief executive officers of the health boards will have the discretion as provided in the 1970 Health Act, to exempt people where there would be an obvious case of hardship if the charges were imposed.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the circumstances in which the charges will be made.  A charge of £10 will be made for all out-patient services but only for the first visit arising in respect of a particualr medical condition.  That is to say, return visits in respect of that condition will not be liable for the charge.  The £10 charge will also be made in respect of attendances at casualty departments of hospitals.  I would like particularly to comment on that charge.</P>
    <P>In all parts of the country it has been traditional for generations for people to use casualty departments of hospitals to receive treatment which could just as appropriately be provided by there general practitioners.  As things stand at the moment, this service is being provided absolutely free of charge.  There are two points I should like to make with regard to this situation.</P>
    <P>First, I suggest that the use of casualty departments of minor ailments is a misuse of that facility.  It is a misuse, because instead of these departments being allowed to gear themselves for the treatment of real emergencies, a very sizeable part of their time is being taken up by the treatment of non-emergencies. Anybody who has visited a casualty department will see ample evidence of this.  The second point I would like to make is that, irrespective of a person's <Col N="2168" /> ability to pay for the services, these are provided as I said free of charge.</P>
    <P>A visit to a general practitioner at the moment costs in the region of £10, so charging a person £10 for service in a casualty department, given the exemptions I have already mentioned, has to be regarded as reasonable.  The House should also note that the £10 charge will be made only in respect of the first visit arising from a particular condition.</P>
    <P>The House should be aware that for some time now a number of health boards have been collecting contributions from patients in respect of out-patient services. I have had personal experience of this myself.  These contributions are being made in respect of every visit.  In my own health board, the Western Health Board, I have had the experience of visiting the out-patients' department of the Roscommon County Hospital where I was charged for 12 visits at the sum of £5 a visit which was quite reasonable.  Over the last few days some people have made quite an issue of the charges now proposed. Those people seem to have conveniently forgotten, or perhaps were not aware, that similar type charges are being made in a number of areas at present. Therefore, the proposed arrangements cannot be seen as something totally new and unacceptable.  I wish to clarify that there is a £10 charge for a particular ailment.  The situation is that if somebody has an accident and breaks an arm the treatment for that breakage would be covered under that £10 charge on an out-patient basis.  He or she would not have to pay a further £10 for each visit.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make it clear that in applying the new arrangements, a person presenting for out-patient services suffering from more than one condition will be liable for only a single £10 charge. Likewise, a person who at the first visit requires an X-ray or pathology service will also be liable for a single £10 charge only, which includes the X-ray and the pathology service.</P>
    <P>These then are the proposed arrangements for making charges for out-patient services.  The House must agree that in drawing them up, the Government have <Col N="2169" /> been extremely conscious of the need to ensure that the vulnerable and disadvantaged will be exempt from the charges. I believe this has been comprehensively achieved.</P>
    <P>Having explained what is involved in this legislation, I should now like to go on to make some comments on why it is considered necessary to introduce these charges.  Everybody is aware that the cost of providing health services in this country has risen dramatically in the last decade or so.  For instance, from 1974 overall expenditure on non-capital health services rose to the order of £1.3 billion, or approximately 7.5 per cent of GNP in 1986.</P>
    <P>In that period there has been a significant improvment in the standard and quality of care which is highly desirable. However, we have now come to the situation where we must take stock of the reality of the current economic position. Within that, we must assess what should be expected from our health services, the cost of that expectation and how the costs should be funded.  This reality has been made perfectly clear over the past few days.  It was made clear without any of the fudging which was a hallmark of the previous administration.</P>
    <P>As far as the health services are concerned, this reality means that the resources that can be made available to them from the Exchequer, that is through taxation, will be limited.  Given that limitation we have to ask ourselves the question: how do we maintain the essential levels and standards of care required?</P>
    <P>One option is that we simply cut the services to meet the available resource. Another option is to find alternatives to Exchequer funding to alleviate the consequences of limited resources.  This Government consider that such a course of action is perfectly justified in the present circumstances.  Therefore, it has been decided, in certain circumstances, to impose a charge for the delivery of certain services.  But within that the underlying principle must be that only those who can reasonably afford to make additional contributions should be expected to do so.  Conversely, this <Col N="2170" /> means that those who cannot afford to make such contributions should not be expected to do so, and will not be expected to do so by this Government.</P>
    <P>That is the basis of the Bill before the House for the imposition of out-patient charges.  The same basis will apply in relation to the imposition of charges for in-patient hospital services which have already been indicated.  Even in respect of those people who will be required to pay both out-patient and in-patient services, arrangements are being made with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board so that they can insure themselves against charges at minimal cost.  Negotiations are at present taking place between the VHI Board and my Department regarding the bringing forward of a very attractive scheme which I believe will be supported by the people in the categories which will be affected by the proposed out-patient and in-patient charges and will impose no hardship whatsoever on them.</P>
    <P>Since the intention to introduce out-patient charges and in-patient charges was announced, there have been a number of quite misleading comments made on the proposals.  It has been alleged that the charges are aimed at the most needy in our society.  It has been alleged that they are going to cause considerable hardship.  I must say that I find these comments, particularly when they are widely reported, especially disturbing. These comments are being believed by many people who are very worried as to how the proposed measures will affect them should they fall ill.  I have already detailed the categories of people who will be excluded from charges.  I will repeat that only those who could be expected to pay without hardship will have to pay.  I am personally very concerned to get this message over and allay people's fears.</P>
    <P>I will also continue to point out that the measures which we are proposing are infinitely preferable to the kinds of charges which the previous administration threatened to impose.  In particular, a charge on prescriptions for general medical services patients was proposed, at the rate of £1 per perscription, which would <Col N="2171" /> have imposed tremendous hardship on the least well-off members of our society, the present medical card holders, 37 per cent of the population or approximately 1.2 million people who benefit from the conditions applicable to holders of medical cards.  We are exempting them from what we regard as a very heavy charge in respect of that service.  This would be a charge on those people who, by definition as medical card holders, cannot provide services for themselves or their families without incurring hardship.  It would be incomprehensible that, when they are in most need, they should be faced with that kind of savage charge.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but there are difficult times ahead as far as the health services are concerned.  The level of resource which we would all like to have is just not available.  I am sure there will be many demands for increased funding, just as there will be similar demands from other sectors.  But, in making these demands, people must ask themselves where the additional funding is going to come from.  Are people prepared to face a considerable further increase in taxation across the board?  I would not think so.  Therefore, it is necessary that all our people consider carefully what they expect from a health service; to what extent they are prepared to pay for that service; and especially how they would wish to have the service used.  The Bill before the House today is just one measure being proposed to protect the fabric of our services.  I believe it is a reasonable measure.</P>
    <P>This Government have taken a very courageous stand since the introduction of the budget.  The Government had no alternative but to introduce such a budget bearing in mind the very difficult position with which we were faced when we assumed office some weeks ago.  We are prepared to take hard decisions for the sake of our people.  We are prepared to grasp the nettle, to take unpopular decisions, because, if they are not taken by us then they will have to be taken by others on behalf of our people.  We are not prepared to accept such a scenario. <Col N="2172" /> Fianna Fáil, in Government will take the right hard decisions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also wish him a courageous and constructive period in office.  However, I hope his ministry will be short one because if what we have experienced is anything to judge by, then it would be preferable for the Irish people that his term of office be brief.  I do not mean any personal disrespect to the Minister of State personally. Hard decisions must be taken and I am glad the Minister has been converted to that belief.  However, it is only right that our people be shown courage, honesty and clarity in the taking of those decisions.</P>
      <P>I resent the remark by the Minister in the course of his introductory remarks when he stated:</P>
      <P>This reality has been made perfectly clear over the last few days.  It was made clear without any of the fudging which was a hallmark of the previous administration.</P>
      <P>Certainly the outgoing Minister, Deputy Desmond, brought our people to a sense of understanding of the problems and how the health service should relate to them.  My worry is that I cannot have faith in this administration in tackling the health services because of their inability to understand those problems over the past four years, their failure to see the need to clip back certain areas of the health services and even more so their approach in the recent general election campaign.  In so far as the health services are concerned, that election was notable for fudging, and was marked by something far from honesty or clarity.  The people were not presented with the true facts by the then principal Opposition party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much resent the fact that the Minister of State has come into this House and accused the previous Government of fudging on these essential issues. The one thing we did not do was fudge which was what the Minister's party did. <Col N="2173" /> Indeed that same lack of clarity, I would contend, was one of the reasons we had a change of Government.  Having said that, I welcome the Minister because, in Opposition, as a member of a health board, he showed considerable concern for the need to ensure that the health services were administered in a realistic fashion.  I hope he will ensure that that attitude will prevail.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party cannot disagree with the underlying principle of this Bill, that health boards should be empowered to charge for certain out-patient services and in Government we made suggestions along those lines.  In farming the budgetary proposals in the early part of this year we made certain suggestions along those lines.  Of course those suggestions were pilloried by the people now holding office, having trotted into power on the basis of the unreal fears they created among the electorate during those tense few weeks.  Nevertheless, I am glad to note that the Minister has been converted to the type of realism we outlined in those same weeks.  Even though we may have lost power we were honest and presented the facts as they were to the electorate. I am glad we have achieved that conversion on the part of the people now holding office.</P>
    <P>The financing of the health services was a matter we faced realistically and honestly having again presented the position fairly to the electorate.  However, in so far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned.  I have certain reservations. The fact that I have reservations does not mean that I should vote against the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will outline my reservations.  The Bill, in effect revokes subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of section 56 of the Health Act, 1970.  The Bill doe not in any way affect the definition of out-patient services.  On the face of it, it does not affect the exemption currently existing for medical card holders and for children who suffer from certain diseases prescribed by the Minister. My basic worry is that whereas the Minister says that regulations will be made to deal with certain circumstances, this Bill has the effect of revoking the vital provisions in subsections (2), (3), (4) <Col N="2174" /> and (5) of section 56 of the 1970 Act. Presumably, therefore, it revokes the regulations which we made under these provisions and if we enact this Bill, we will merely have an enabling section without regulations.  If that is the case, I would be extremely unhappy.  There will be no regulation to govern children who may suffer from permanent or long term disabilities referred to in section 1(3) of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Without being personal, I find it difficult to accept any undertaking from the Minister's party in relation to the health services by virtue of the undertakings which were given in the recent past and which were broken.  I am in extreme difficulty as far as this Bill is concerned because there will not be regulation to govern the cases to which I have referred. Will the Minister consider amending this Bill for the purpose of providing that the regulations which currently exist will remain in force following the passage of this Bill, unless otherwise revoked?  It is important that the Minister should consider amending the Bill tonight.  If he does so, I will support such an amendment. This is, after all, the place where we try to improve legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is urgent, but I am sure the Dáil can be recalled to deal with an amendment from this House.  Will the Minister address himself to that because a lacuna will exist unless the matter is remedied.  I agree with the principle underlying this Bill but it contains a technical defect which must be remedied if the weaker sections are to be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Today, we had two sets of draft regulations&mdash; on the health services and on the Social Welfare Bill.  We have now this Health (Amendment) Bill.  It is all part and parcel of the budget provisions which have been passed.  A common denominator for all of these items is that the economy is on its knees and drastic action is necessary.  The Departments of Social Welfare and Health are very high spending Departments and we must look at those areas with a view to reducing expenditure.  At the same time, we must make every effort <Col N="2175" /> to maintain the services and the level of care required.  We could cut the services but a more humane way is to find new finance to fund them, hence this Bill and the charges it brings.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to spell out, as the Minister did, the very many people who are excluded, for instance, medical card holders and their dependants.  As the Minister said, they represent 40 per cent of the population.  Also excluded are children suffering from diseases or disabilities of a permanent or a long term nature and children who require attendance on an out-patient basis in respect of defects which have been noticed at a health examination provided in accordance with the Health Acts.  There are other exclusions too.  It is very important that hardship cases which may arise later can be exempted by the CEO.  The Minister made the point that, within the underlying principle, only those who can reasonably afford to make a contribution should be expected to pay.  There is a definite hope that if hardship presents itself such a case can be dealt with humanely.</P>
      <P>In regard to the paying of charges in other areas such as for water, sewerage services and to the local authorities, we tend to be slow to pay but in the end we pay.  I assume that about 65 per cent of people required to pay these charges will pay them, but I see problems in relation to administration.  It is not just a straightforward situation.  One could argue that this is a new layer of bureaucracy and I wonder how much of the money raised will go on administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, it is not a new charge.  There were charges under the health boards before this Bill was introduced. The press have highlighted somewhat inaccurately the whole approach to these charges.  There are difficult times ahead for the health services.  Everyone accepts that.  The health and social welfare services are in many ways a barometer for the economy.  In the fifties, a time of depression, there was little if any, expansion in the areas of health and social <Col N="2176" /> welfare, but in the sixties and the seventies when we had great economic growth, the health and social welfare services expanded.  In the eighties we are again in difficult times.  The Government and the Minister are concerned that we are spending too much on health.  That is regrettable.  The Minister and the Government are forced to introduce this Bill.  While none of us likes the idea, we are forced to the conclusion that we must support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have no mandate for what they are proposing in this Bill.  Not only have they no mandate but on two occasions the electorate decided against hospital charges for out-patient or in-patient services. The Minister and the House will remember when Fianna Fáil first introduced charges for out-patient services in 1982 the people promptly and quite definitely put them out of office.  During the course of the recent general election campaign the Fine Gael Party also proposed out-patient charges, admittedly at a lower level, and that proposal was rejected by the electorate also.  The electorate have spoken twice on this matter and despite this the Government have decided to go ahead with charges.  It is regrettable that the Government did not have the honesty, as Senator Durcan stated earlier, to tell the people in advance of the kind of measures they were proposing, such as the one before the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The proposal to introduce a £10 charge for out-patient services, when taken with the proposed £10 per day charge for in-patient services, is nothing less than a radical attack on the gains made by our people over many years towards achieving a hospital service which was based on need rather than ability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous Minister in the House this evening, when talking about social welfare, said that the British Government under Mrs. Thatcher had abolished pay-related benefit.  Even Mrs. Thatcher has not so far had the temerity to introduce charges for in-patient services in hospital, despite the fact that she has managed to dismantle most of the welfare state.  That <Col N="2177" /> is because decent people everywhere recognise that hospital services must be based on need and cannot be based on ability to pay.</P>
    <P>It is important to call a spade a spade at this stage.  What is being proposed this evening is no less than a tax on being sick; there can be no other definition. That tax on being sick cannot be hidden under any other guise or name.  The Government have argued that these charges are necessary to cut down on abuses of out-patient and in-patient services in hospitals but I submit that there is no truth in that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I want to digress, very briefly into the area of in-patient treatment even though it is not directly before the House.  As any sensible person knows, it is the consultant in the hospital who determines the length of stay of a patient.  Therefore, the introduction of a charge on a patient for attending on an in-patient basis in hospital would have no effect one way or the other on the length of stay of that patient, and therefore, no effect on the alleged abuses operating in excessive stays in hospital.  In so far as there are excessive stays in hospitals &mdash; and I submit that these are becoming less than has been the case in the past &mdash; they are determined either by decisions of consultants or by maladministration in the hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter directly before the House this evening, I do not think that anybody with sense would suggest that people would be prepared to stay and queue for half a day in many cases in out-patient departments of hospitals to receive treatment which they do not need.  That defies logic.  I do not believe that this happens to any marked extent.  If people are attending out-patient services in hospitals unnecessarily, it is happening either because they are referred to hospital out-patient departments unnecessarily by GPs, in which case it is not the patient's fault, or because those patients cannot afford to pay GPs for services which they might render to them.  In either case the proposal, as a solution to abuse of the out-patient service, will not work.  The only <Col N="2178" /> consequence of it will be that many people who at present are forced to out-patient departments by virtue of not being able to pay GPs because they are outside the income limit for a medical card will be deprived of health care.  This is what is going to happen in the areas I know in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>We need to knock down once and for all the argument that charges diminish abuses in health care expenditure.  As I said in relation to another matter before us today, we are all aware that health care expenditure in Ireland has risen rapidly over the last 15 to 20 years as is the case in most countries.  Any serious economic analysis of how to curtail expenditure increases in a way consistent with delivering an effective health care system to people would suggest the way to do it is by putting effective administration systems into hospitals, in particular, into the health care system as a whole and by unifying the whole system so that the distinctions between public, private and semi-private care are eliminated.  A unified health care system, and in this case we are talking about a hospital care system &mdash; which is based on salaries for the staff who work in that system if accompanied by effective administration &mdash; and let us remember that in many hospitals there is no administration; each individual consultant runs his own operation and nobody runs the whole business &mdash; would lead to effective reductions in the rate of increases in health care expenditure while having the additional benefit of developing a hospital care system whereby people are clearly treated on the basis of need and queue jumping and the things now associated with our hospital care system would be eliminated.  The argument that charges are in some sense a deterrent to abuse is nonsense on the face of any evidence that I have seen except in cases where patients attend because they cannot afford to go to their GPs.  This cannot be described as abuse but rather a necessity.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the hospital care system it is interesting to note that it is paid for in the main through general taxation paid by the entire population.  It <Col N="2179" /> is paid for in addition by the 1 per cent income levy for hospital care which is paid for by all those in gainful employment, although in most cases it is not collected from farmers.  One would have thought that imposing charges on the entire population for a hospital care system for those who are sick would be enough, but additionally we are going to impose a third charge on those people when they are sick.  This is one of the most regressive decisions we have ever had to debate.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill that sets a limit of £10 per out-patient visit for all time; this amount can be increased by regulation at any point in the future when it happens to suit a Minister for any reason.  If we go down that route we will simply be dismantling all of the gains such as they are which have been made in relation to the provision of health care on the basis of need as opposed to the basis of ability to pay.  It is only since the sixties that we began to make serious progress towards the idea of health care on the basis of need as opposed to ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that not long ago &mdash; in the sixties &mdash; we began to make serious progress towards the idea of health care on the basis of need as opposed to ability to pay.  Now it seems we are about to dismantle all that and this is being proposed by a Government with no mandate to do so.  Were they to contest an election today or tomorrow on the basis of this proposal, they would be roundly defeated in my view.</P>
    <P>Much has been made by the Minister of State and the Minister for Health that exceptions will be made on grounds of hardship.  I thought we had managed to move away from this discretionary notice of access to hospital care free of charge on grounds of hardship.  I thought we had managed to do away with the situation where a person who has not a medical card because his income might be above the income limit but who is not wealthy would have to go cap in hand to the CEO or to a health board official and argue his <Col N="2180" /> case, revealing all his circumstances, in order to get into a hospital without paying the £10 out-patient charge.  I thought we were now dealing with matters on the basis of entitlement and not arguing the toss with a health board official and revealing every detail of one's life before one was given the right not to pay this £10 which the person might not be able to pay.</P>
    <P>Since there is no sign of the regulations &mdash; and Senator Durcan has made a serious argument this evening about these regulations &mdash; I wonder if the Minister could tell us what are the likely criteria the CEO might take into account in determining hardship in these cases.  I understand there are hardship provisions in most legislation dealing with the delivery of services, but what are the likely criteria for hardship that one would reasonably expect a CEO to take into account when it comes to deciding whether somebody should pay either £10 a day for in-patient treatment or £10 for an out-patient visit?</P>
    <P>I wonder about the method of payment. Is it suggested that we will get to the point &mdash; and I believe it is &mdash; where one will not get hospital treatment unless one puts the money up front?  That is the case in the United States system of hospital care.  If one introduces a system of charges for hospital care on an out-patient or in-patient basis, does one not speedily move to the point where one says no entry without putting money on the table?  What is the method of payment envisaged under this Bill?  Will people have to pay in advance?  Will they be billed after the event?  If so, will they be pursued if they do not pay?  If half the hospital going population have to be pursued, will the Minister not find it desirable to move towards payment on demand?  I suggest that that is the way we are going and that is a retrograde step. I believe this system is inoperable but so far as it can be operated, it will do enormous damage to the concept of treatment on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.</P>
    <P>I am the first person to speak for the Labour Party and I wish to formally tell <Col N="2181" /> the House that we will be opposing this measure, as we will be opposing the more regressive measure of charging people three times for in-patient treatment &mdash; through income tax, the health levies and daily charges.  The whole thing seems nothing short of farcical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to distinguish between two aspects of the Bill before us.  First, this Bill enables charges to be made.  This was in the Fine Gael proposals and is something to which the Fine Gael group in the Seanad cannot object, but this Bill is doing this in a particular way.  Senator Durcan has already outlined the misgivings of the Fine Gael group to the way this is being done.  Earlier today we passed the Social Welfare Bill which the Fine Gael group did not oppose and I would like to draw attention to section 10 (2) of that Bill which reads:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, regulations made wholly or partly under section 76(1)(b) of the Principal Act before the passing of this Act and in force at such passing shall continue in force until revoked.</P>
      <P>If there had been a similar provision in the Health (Amendment) Bill, which we are now discussing, the views put forward by Senator Durcan on behalf of our group, and drafted by him, would not have been necessary.</P>
      <P>Early in his introductory speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks the powers to enable the Minister for Health to make regulations setting out the charges to be made and the categories of people to which they will apply.</P>
      <P>These regulations when made will be laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durcan pointed out that in the interval between this evening and the time when those regulations are approved there will be a lacuna, there will be no regulations, and there will be no categories defined.  I think Senator Durcan has made more than a <i>prima facie</i> case for the retention of the existing <Col N="2182" /> regulations until the Minister makes the new regulations which he proposes to make under this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts Senator Durcan's point of view and the amendment which proposes that the existing regulations remain in force, there is nothing in this Bill to prevent the Minister from changing those regulations in any way he thinks fit.  But I think there is a very substantial case, as in the case of the Social Welfare Bill, for the categories to be left exactly as they are in the interim.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is open to the Minister to change those categories and to change the degrees of entitlement in regard to those regulations.  Those regulations must come before the Dáil and before the Seanad to be elected next week.  They can give their judgement on them but we, as a subsisting Seanad, still have our duty to perform.  Senator Durcan has persuaded me in what he has said tonight. To be quite frank, he did not persuade me earlier today but he has persuaded me now that this subsisting Seanad has a duty to maintain the existing categories until the categories are altered by the enactment of new regulations.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, say to the Minister in all seriousness that he would be very well advised to accept this amendment since the Bill can only be implemented by regulation.  In fact, acceptance of the amendment will not delay to any substantial extent, in all probability will not delay it to any extent, the implementation of the regulations which the Minister wishes to impose.  This is the clearcut way of approaching this particular problem.  The Minister in the course of his speech made a remark with which I do not agree.  He said that the reality &mdash; he was referring to the reality of our situation &mdash; has been made perfectly clear over the past few days and it was made clear without any of the fudging which was the hallmark of the previous administration.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression it was the refusal to fudge the issues that removed the Fine Gael Party from office.  Therefore, I cannot agree with what the Minister says in this regard but I can appeal <Col N="2183" /> to him that if he is critical of what he saw as fudging in a previous administration to avoid at all costs any fudging in regard to the legislation he is now proposing to the House.  If he does propose to us legislation which repeals previous legislation and regulations made under those Acts, there is an element of fudging involved. I am speaking here in all responsibility and in support of what the Minister seeks to do and I ask him to think most carefully on what he is going to say in reply to this debate with regard to the existing regulations which define categories.</P>
    <P>I said at the opening of business today that the Fine Gael group would not obstruct the Government in regard to the business they wished to push through but I want to say now in regard to this particular issue that if we were to press our amendment on Committee Stage we would not be obstructing the Government. We would be helping them to avoid a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is possible for Fine Gael to assist the Government any more than they have been doing since last Tuesday.  However, I am glad to say we are making some progress.  I am sure the Minister in his wildest dreams never thought he would be coming into this House proposing this legislation &mdash; not even in his worst nightmares during the election campaign did he think that. In his speech he said that infants up to the age of six weeks are already provided for under the 1970 Act.  I want to thank him on behalf of all the six-week old infants in the country and now I want to talk to him about all the seven week old infants who fall out of their cots.  That infant is caught for the £10 charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that he will not get the money.  It is as simple as that.  A successful politician spends very little time in the casualty department of hospitals. Perhaps they may in the future but until now they have not and yet the Minister of State says that the use of casualty departments for minor ailments is a misuse of that facility.  That is a very subjective judgment, because what is a <Col N="2184" /> minor ailment?  Traditionally, the casualty departments of hospitals have been used by people who fall or by children who cut their legs and have a wound that requires stitching.  Is the Minister serious when he says that that person can call on their GP at 1 a.m. to have a wound stitched?  The reality is that GPs today have almost forgotten to practise.  They have not stitched wounds since they left medical school.  It is not done any more. Now it is being reintroduced by Fianna Fáil.  Maybe the job search programme is to send all those GPs back to school for a couple of weeks so that they can stitch people in the future.  This is crazy legislation.</P>
    <P>Look at who you have got in casualty departments.  On a Friday or Saturday night all over the city of Dublin you have men carted in by ambulances of the fire brigade and the health boards.  Where are they going to get £10?  They will not pay it.  The people the Government are trying to catch do not use these services.  The reality is that the Minister is not going to get the money.  He is also creating another bureaucratic monster.  For instance, a person will pay the one £10 for the first visit arising from a particular condition.  That means the person will have to get a receipt stamped and duly authenticated because if he goes to another hospital which, might be nearer they may want another £10.  This legislation is for the birds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>They will stamp the wound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably.  The Minister must look with envy at his old portfolio as spokesman and how nice it would be to be talking about RTE.  They have given him a crown of thorns.  He said as far as the health services are concerned that given the limitations we must ask ourselves how do we maintain the essential levels in standards of care and that one option was that we should cut the services to meet the available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government talked about a crisis in the public finances and about how difficult it was to hold the <Col N="2185" /> system together.  Nobody got more abuse in the other House than Deputy Desmond who tried to make reasonable economies while, at the same time, maintaining the integrity of the health services. Who comes into this House tonight to blow it away?  A young progressive tiger from Fianna Fáil.  As I said, he must be living through a very bad period after just a week in office &mdash; and he has my sympathy &mdash; but nobody deserves it more than his good self.</P>
    <P>There are options to funding the health service but they are options which neither Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil were prepared to take up.  There is a huge category within the medical service who actually own it, and it is for them, not for the patients, it is for the GPs and consultants because that is where the money is.  Earlier we were told of a 25 per cent increase in health contributions.  I do not have first hand knowledge of this but I am told there are clubs in London who operate the same system as the Minister, when you pay the first time and you think you are in, you are not, but you must go through another door and pay again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator might even vote at the end of all this and break a habit in a week.  The reality is that 25 per cent of an increase was imposed today and we still do not have a health service and the people must pay again.  Has the Minister considered the other category, the person who goes to hospital, must pay £10 a day for the week's stay and on being discharged is told to report to the out-patient section?  Has that person to pay another £10?  I agree with what Senator Durcan said about regulations, that there should be clarity and lack of <Col N="2186" /> fudge.  Nobody knows what is going to happen to this legislation except, and this is definite, that it will not be paid by the majority of people.</P>
      <P>It is heartening in a way to know that what the country, and the Government of the last four years, understood to be a crisis was discovered by Fianna Fáil last Tuesday.  The books were open to everybody, except Ministers of State.  I am sure that if Minister of State saw the books and knew the Department, he would have had a different conversation with the Taoiseach.  This legislation will die. It will not get out of this House tonight with the assistance of the Labour Party. Of course, it may get out with the assistance of Fine Gael despite the huffing and the puffing that they are not going to vote for it.  Their problem is that around the country their councillors will have to decipher where they stand on this issue. The Government will get the Bill but only with the help of Fine Gael.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  The last time he was Minister of State he did an excellent job in the Department he was in.  He was one of the successes of the last administration.  I wish him every success.  Anything I have to say is not directed at the Minister or the commitment which I know he has to whatever job he gets from the administration of which he is such a loyal and efficient member.  I can understand the position of three groups of people here but there is a fourth group I cannot understand. I can understand the position of the Labour Party because they made their position in this matter quite clear. They were against charges of this kind, they went to the people and got a mandate. I was interested to hear what Senator O'Mahony said about mandates. A party do not only get a mandate by getting a majority of seats; they get a mandate even if they only get one seat; they get a mandate for whatever the party's policy is.  The Labour Party stood on the basis that they would not support this kind of legislation.  They have that mandate and I respect their position in voting consistently.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael also have a mandate and that is where Fine Gael are different. Fine Gael have a different mandate. They have a mandate in respect of supporting charges even though charges like this are subject to a lot of the criticisms and the reservations expressed by other Senators.  In so far as we get our authority indirectly from the people, Fine Gael have a mandate to support this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have no such mandate.  I can understand the position of the Government in this matter because they are faced with the reality.  I can see a chasm opening up between the Government on the one hand and the Fianna Fáil Party on the other.  I recognise, understand and appreciate it.  Of all the positions to be in during the course of that opening chasm the worst position is that of Minister of State with one leg at each side of the chasm and as it gets wider and wider being in a more uncomfortable <Col N="2188" /> and impossible position; an extremely dangerous position.  That is the problem for the Minister of State.  It is only a man of his considerable ability who will be able to perform the necessary physical gyration to maintain a foot in both camps during the course of the oncoming holocaust.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have no mandate to introduce this policy or any other policy to which they have been lately converted. We all understand that policy issues arise in health and in other areas and that Governments have to adjust for those policies and make up policies on issues that did not arise at all before the election. This is not one of those policies.  The Government, in respect of their attitude towards health, are trying to perpetrate on the Irish people a fraud, a political fraud.  They are trying to fight an election on one set of policies and implement another set of policies.  If anything has caused problems in Ireland it is parties doing that.  I am not excusing the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party from that position in the past.  Tonight all I can talk about is what is happening now.  What is happening is that the Government are overtaking the policy of the part from which the members of the Government are drawn.</P>
    <P>Do Senators remember the slogans all over the country about health cuts and who they were damaging?  It is no wonder that the Minister is having such poor support from his side of the House on this. That is just one of the difficulties in having a party policy which is totally at variance with a Government policy when the Government and the party are one and the same party.  At least on the previous occasion there was the opportunity of blaming the other party but Fianna Fáil cannot even do that.  They find themselves in the position where the political policy of their party is being turned on its head by the Government.  The vengeance which the people visited on Fine Gael and Labour will be chicken feed compared with what they will visit on Fianna Fáil when they go to the country on a divided and contradictory policy.</P>
    <P>The Government have no mandate for <Col N="2189" /> this or any other policy which they did not put before the people.  On the other hand we have a mandate for it.  My good friend Senator Magner gloried in the fact that we lost 17 seats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

      <P>What the Labour Party are quite right in objecting to is the fraud which was perpetrated on the people by a party promoting a series of policies which, without any change in circumstances, they jettisoned as soon as they achieved power.  That is a recipe for the destruction of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let no one be under any misguided notion; we will support our policy.  As my colleagues have said, we are entitled to improve the policy further.  We are certainly entitled to have a joust with the parliamentary draftsman &mdash; I am not speaking of the individual but the service which has helped to draft so much defective legislation.  The Minister cannot pretend &mdash; I am sure he will not because he is a reasonable man &mdash; that an amendment passed by the Seanad cannot be approved <Col N="2190" /> in the Dáil next Tuesday.  In the meantime he can work away on his regulations. He can work away in County Roscommon and be busy over the weekend writing out the regulations for further orders. He can have the regulations ready when the stamp of approval is given to the amended legislation.</P>
    <P>I support my colleagues in their acceptance of the thrust of this.  As regards the merits of the suggestion I recognise the difficulty of physically collecting the money.  We have experience of charges like these being difficult to collect.  The warnings which Senator Magner has given should be taken seriously.  The Minister must ensure that he has administrative procedures which will be flexible enough to deal with emergencies and which will be firm enough to ensure people pay their fair share.  Senator Magner made a valid point in that regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the administrative matters concerning the second and subsequent visits, the vast majority of them could be handled in a relatively simple way.  What comes through clearly is that in areas like health, better value for money is a better way to go about it rather than introducing charges.  I leave it to the Minister to investigate how to get the best value for money in the health service.  Any additional charge, even one which has the support of the section of the community which voted for Fine Gael, has limited use in breaching the yawning gap opening up in the health area between the resources available and the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>This is an interim measure proposed by the previous administration and ratified by the people in so far as they supported Fine Gael.  Obviously in so far as they did not support Labour or Fine Gael it was not ratified.  I have dealt with the extraordinary position in which Fianna Fáil find themselves regarding its implementation but that is a matter for them.  I warn them that the vengeance of the people on those who mislead the electorate with regard to their policies can be a very destructive and potent force.</P>
    <P>As it is regrettably necessary and <Col N="2191" /> because it is consistent with our previously announced policy the Minister will have no difficulty in getting support for the principle of this legislation from Fine Gael.  I have no doubt that in return for such support the Minister will consider such reasonable amendments as Fine Gael may consider necessary to protect properly the interests of those we are elected to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was pleased to have a second opportunity to be in the House today.  I am sure he now regrets having to bring this legislation before us.  What the Minister is suggesting is in line with what our colleagues on this side were honest enough to tell the electorate they intended to bring in. The Minister will realise that we are being consistent in opposing the concept of charging people for services to which they are entitled by law.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time Fianna Fáil have suggested charging for out-patient services.  A charge of £5 was suggested before.  Under the 1970 Act the out-patients service was provided free of charge because people had contributed to it through the PRSI system or had medical cards.  The guidelines are reviewed from time to time and from year to year by a group of hospital administrators and chief executive officers.  I must say with all due respect to the Minister that there is no way this type of legislation, necessary as he will try to convince us can be operated in the hospitals and the out-patient departments irrespective of what he and the Government want to achieve in this regard.  In the Minister's budget speech he confirmed he had hoped to save £6.7 million in the Health Estimate by creating a charge like this.  I honestly feel it is impossible to achieve and I will try to explain the reason to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a health board from 1973 to 1985, I know any effort to change the hospitals admission system, whether it be casualty or general practitioner referrals, was resisted always by staff, who, as the Minister will agree, are <Col N="2192" /> already overworked.  Most hospitals are understaffed.  There is no level of administrative staff available in the hospitals, particularly at out-patient departments, who will be geared to apply this charge or indeed will try to collect it.  How does the Minister propose to define a first visit or a second visit?  What privacy will be available to people when confronted by a member of the administrative staff to do a means test at the out-patient department?</P>
    <P>The important announcement of the Minister, that CEOs would have an area of discretion, presumes immediately then that this charge will be collected after the event has happened, after the person is dispatched home from out-patients. Chief executive officers sit in a central office  up to 20 acute hospitals and fifty or more district hospitals or other semi-acute hospitals in their region. I respectfully suggest that if there is an area of discretion available to a CEO. Patients in an out-patient department will use this section to avoid payment and then the health board will have the greatest difficulty, if not the impossible task, of trying to collect it afterwards.  We suggest that any legislation that can be abused like that is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had come before us today and suggested to us as a responsible House that he intended to charge persons outside the hospital services card bracket he would have had our co-operation because already they are considered to be in the higher income bracket of £15,000 or more.  If they were availing of an out-patient or an in-patient service at public ward level we would have no objection to that concept because they are already paying consultants' fees and they are paying VHI to cover them for private wards.  However, to have a blanket charge for people in the categories above medical cards and still with a hospital services card is unfair.  It is unfair to expect the support of the Labour Party in this House for reducing hospital services. I suggest that it is inoperable because there is no staff structure I am aware of geared towards or agreeing to collect this amount.  I foresee confusion <Col N="2193" /> when people arrive at an out-patient department.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in out-patient departments there are people with minor ailments.  He said that non-emergency cases were using the facilities to a large extent.  I suggest to the Minister with all due respect that nobody arrives at an out-patient department who is not a casualty or has not been referred there by a GP. I do not know of any out-patient department in any hospital in this country who accept people off the road so to speak &mdash; apart from casualty cases &mdash; without a referral from a doctor or a GP.  The Minister will accept that the previous Minister's efforts to collect money that was outstanding from the self-employed, when he brought in a £100 fine for those who had not paid their health contributions excluded people who were subject to trauma or a tragic accident on the road.  People, because their life was at risk, would be admitted without the £100 fine even if they had not paid their health contributions.  Now we are talking about charging people who not alone have paid their health contributions but have contributed through PRSI and taxation and all the other things.  Today after increasing the level of that charge the Minister is making an additional charge.  I suggest this is probably illegal and unconstitutional. If the PAYE sector were as well organised as the IFA this would finish up in the High Court because there will be cases where people will have to pay three times for the same service which, in fact, is now a diminishing service.</P>
    <P>Over the past four-and-half years in particular, and indeed from 1974 onwards there were many Labour Party Ministers involved in the health services.  I am pleased the Minister acknowledged that although the service costs have risen to a staggering £1.3 billion, in that period there have been significant improvements in the standard and quality of care which is highly desirable.  During Deputy Desmond's period in office I never heard one word of praise from the former Opposition Members who are now in Government about the standard of health <Col N="2194" /> care he delivered and the positive way he grappled with a major health bill while trying to keep the structure of the health services together.  He tried to achieve economies in a specific way.  He outlined to health boards by way of letter or recommendation areas to which they could address themselves, and major economies were effected over those periods.  I was part of that process; we had a limit with regard to our health board allocations.  When we got less than we wanted we called it a cutback: that is politics.  We realise that the intricate structure of the health boards and services we had to deliver at county and regional level were protected by a previous Minister without the triple charges for services to which people are entitled. Their contributions were deducted by their employer.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or his colleagues in Government were serious about collecting the money outstanding from people who could and should have paid these contributions, these charges on the most yulnerable would not be necessary. I would query also how he can implement a charge for children of six weeks and upwards.  Will people have to produce birth certificates at the casualty department? I am pleased pregnant mothers are exempt.  I think every Health Act so far exempted maternity cases and pregnancy cases from all charges.  Of course we have always excluded people with medical cards or people suffering from permanent illness, whether psychiatric illness or congenital illness.  That is quite right.</P>
    <P>We feel there will be tremendous problems analysing the eligibility of people as they arrive at an out-patient department. If the Government are trying to achieve a saving of £6.7 million they should address the problem of the person who sends the patient there in the first instance, namely, the GP.  If the general practitioner decides that somebody needs to go to an out-patients department for more elaborate tests than he could give in his surgery, or in the case of a casualty somebody should be there.  If we want to address the problems of the hundreds of people who are out-patients on a weekly <Col N="2195" /> basis, on a twice weekly basis or on a daily basis in many acute hospitals consultants will have to be asked to stop recalling people to out-patient departments.</P>
    <P>Having performed a normal appendicitis operation, instead of dispatching the patient to the general practitioner, which would normally be the case, they say: &ldquo;You are doing well but I want to see you again in a month&rdquo;, and immediately the whole system falls into place.  A nurse notes that he has to be seen again, another visiting card is written out, an ambulance is sent out, or transport is made available, simply because the consultant wishes to have another look at the patient.  He deals with hundreds of cases per day and spends literally two to four minutes looking at the patient and says: &ldquo;You are doing nicely and I will see you again in two months&rdquo;.  If we are to address the problem of the abuse of the out-patient departments &mdash; and there are some abuses &mdash; it must be addressed by the professional people whom we have to trust to make a decision on whether people should be there or whether they could be dealt with effectively by the general practitioner.  I am quite sure the vast majority of general practitioners would prefer that the person would be referred back to them.  The first evidence that a general practitioner had that one of his patients whom he had referred for an operation had the operation, was when he saw him walking down the street.  Patients are still being referred back to the consultant instead of to the general practitioner.  This is an anomaly that is putting stain on the health services and health budgeting.  We must not charge people who cannot afford to pay.  They may be just above the medical card limit.  I shall confine myself to those two areas because I am extremely worried about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not be able to collect this charge.  It is a window-dressing effort to stop people from going into out-patient departments.  The Minister meets these people as regularly as I do at our clinics which are free.  Very few of them want to go into an out-patients department or, <Col N="2196" /> indeed, into a hospital bed unless they really have to, It is one of the most traumatic moments in people's lives when they are told they have to go into hospital. Let us not penalise them.  Let us not dissuade them from going in.  Let us not enact legislation to make people neglect themselves.  This is a retrograde step and I am disappointed that the Minister is trying to get it through the House.</P>
    <P>As my colleagues in the Labour Party have said, we will be opposing this Bill. We feel that the amendment suggested by Senator Durcan is worthy of our support and we will be supporting it if we get to that section.  We will be opposing the section as it stands.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be thinking that the new Seanad will be more forthcoming. He will certainly have more problems on his side of the House.  We know the electorate and we can determine the number of seats Fianna Fáil are likely to get.  Having said that, I wish good luck to all those who aspire to be Members of this House.  Irrespective of numbers, the Minister will always find this House very constructive in dealing with legislation and will not oppose it for the sake of opposing it.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this Health (Amendment) Bill because it is against the concept of everything we have ever stood for.  We always hoped there would be a free health service for everybody and that the consultants would agree to that and would be paid a salary by the State to provide it.  Mr. Corish found this was impossible and we finished up with a two or three tiered health system: the medical card, the hospital services card and the VHI system.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister is putting in another tier for people who have already contributed to this service and I am sorry about that.  I understand the economic reasons, but economic reasons do not always justify the end result and we feel that the wrong people are being attacked in this way.  Their incomes are at risk and we are putting a further tax on them for a service which, up to now, they were entitled to receive free of charge.  During the election campaign these placards and <Col N="2197" /> publicity posters caught my eye: &ldquo;Who suffers from health cuts?  The poor, the old, the sick, the underprivileged&rdquo;.  Many people in this category, just above the health card limit, are still quite poor.  If you are married and earn just over £100 a week, you do not have a medical card. Generally speaking there are fairly stringent levels for deciding when a medical card is given and these have been tightened up because all Governments are trying to curtail the cost of the health services.  It is fairly tight when you have a medical card.  To go a step further and exclude those people is not justified and for that reason we cannot support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation for the contributions of Senators in this Second Stage debate.  Before I refer to Senator Durcan's amendment I should like to mention some of the contributions made generally to this debate.  Senator Fallon, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health, contributed to the debate and made some useful points about the legislation. Senator O'Mahony made some points to which I would like to refer.  He made a point about the use or so-called abuse of the out-patient services attached to hospitals and clinics.  It is generally accepted by those who administer the service that there is an over use of the service, and the casualty departments in particular, and that some people attend at those clinics instead of going to their general practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to make the point to the Labour Party members that there was a charge in existence in the Western Health Board, North Eastern Health Board, and perhaps other health boards, of £5 per visit.  I was required on one occasion to pay for 12 visits to the local hospital because of an accident in my home when a boiler exploded.  The service is in operation and was in operation under the former Minister, Deputy Desmond, and he did not seem to have any objection to it at that stage.  When did <Col N="2198" /> the Labour Party discover that these contributions existed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister want an answer?  Deputy Dr. Woods introduced them and health boards who were politically motivated maintained them, but they were illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party put forward the proposal in their budget which was put before the electorate and, as far as I can recall, during the election campaign we never made any commitment to withdraw the £10 out-patient charge.  In fact, it would have been extremely beneficial for us to do so but we did not use that proposal in the campaign so it is quite consistent for us to bring this charge forward particularly as we are aware and conscious of the massive cost of the health services.  We have to do something to assist in the payment of the health bill.</P>
      <P>Referring to further points raised by Senator O'Mahony, the actual estimated revenue from the out-patient charges for the remainder of 1987 is approximately £6 million and about £9 million in a full year.  We hope to have in place, in cooperation with the VHI, a very attractive package which will be available to the people who will be affected by this charge.  The actual package will be so attractive that I feel the majority of people who would be in the categories affected by the proposed charge will be covered and will have coverage by the time this comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the important hardship clause which I mentioned in my Second Stage speech.  Section 45 of the Health Act, 1970, provides that the CEOs of the health boards have the discretion to deem people who may find it difficult to pay eligible for the services.  That discretionary power is contained in the existing Acts and applies to this charge, but I must make it clear to Senators that it is a once-off charge for a particular ailment. It is not an ongoing, repetitive charge for that ailment, whereas the GP service carries a repetitive charge for each time <Col N="2199" /> the patient visits his doctor.  It is a reasonable request for a contribution in the very difficult circumstances which we are facing in the health services.  The alternative is a further major cut in the health services to the people.  That is what we are facing.  We either make this charge or face a further serious drop in the level of service in the health services.  We are not over-enthusiastic about having to impose this charge.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and cover 1.2 million people approximately in the overall population.  Nearly 40 per cent of our population are covered by medical cards, so it is the 40 per cent who would be affected by the £1 prescription charges. That will not arise because we have decided not to bring forward that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator O'Leary's point regarding the collection, I agree with him that it is possible to arrange for a straightforward administrative system to collect the charges.  These are already in place in some of the health board areas and I have had personal experience that it is for the best when it comes to the health services. The bill was sent, but one was not charged at the point of entry and no one will be refused hospital services as a result of this £10 charge.  I want to assure the Seanad that this will be the case in reality, that where services are required they will be <Col N="2200" /> provided and we will have to work out a system then to arrange for the collection. The system will be very easily worked out with the health boards for the collection of the £10 fee from people using the facilities at out-patient departments. Coupled with that we will have in place the very attractive VHI system which will cover the out-patient charges for those who will be in that system.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let us not exaggerate the administrative areas.  We must look at it in a positive way and realise that a system will be in operation and is in operation for the collection of the charge.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris made the point that he had no real objection to the £10 for those over the £15,000 category.  I think I am not misrepresenting the Senator's point of view by saying that.  Let me point out that this applies also to that category and strangely enough, that category were availing of the free services which was being provided by the State and it was available to them.  This £10 is a small contribution to make to assist in the continuation of the hospital services.</P>
    <P>I come to the amendment which has been tabled by Senator Patrick Durcan. The provision of subsection (3) differs in only one respect from the original subsection (3).  The change consists of the deletion of the words &ldquo;not included among the persons referred to in subsection (2)&rdquo;.  The reason for this change is that since 1979 the entire population is included in subsection (2).  The Bill now before the House substitutes subsection (3) for the original subsection (3).  The legal advice which I have received is that the diseases and disabilities prescribed by the Minister under the original subsection (3) continue in force on the enactment of this Bill.  The necessity for the amendment does not, therefore, arise.  That is the legal advice which has been given to me by my Department and I wish to assure the Senators that the amendment is not required in the circumstances.  That is why the parliamentary draftsman in drawing up the legislation did not include this provision.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Senators for raising the point.  I want to say if I may, aside from the issue involved, that I have tremendous respect for the Seanad.  This is my third occasion to address it as Minister of State.  I spoke here as Minister of State in the 1982 administration.  Those who object to the Seanad and the continuation of the Seanad would be wise to come here and <Col N="2202" /> see how it operates.  It is an effective and very economic part of our Oireachtas system and affords an opportunity for Ministers to discuss with the Senators reservations which they may have.  In this case the matter was not referred to, as far as I am aware, in the Dáil and certainly not in greater detail than here this evening.  I want to assure the Senators that I am very conscious of the amendment which they propose, but I am giving them a categorical assurance, with the legal advice which is available to me from my Department, that this amendment is absolutely unnecessary.  In the circumstances the amendment should not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>The regulations, which are in draft form and which I am not in a position to enlarge upon, were mentioned in my speech.  I assure the House that they will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas will have an opportunity, as is required under the law, if they wish, to have those regulations debated within 21 days thereafter. Those regulations will be placed in the Library of the House, and will be available for inspection there.  In my Second Stage speech I have given an outline of the exclusions and I assure the Senators that the amendment is not required.  That is the advice given to me by my Department.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank again the Senators who have so able contributed to this debate. It has been a pleasure for me to have been here this evening to have this very good debate in relation to this Bill.</P>

    <Title>Health (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, regulations made wholly or partly under this section before the passing of this Act and in force at such passing shall continue in force until revoked.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is one which, if passed by this House, will have the effect of inserting a new subsection into section 1 which, in turn, is a substitute section.</P>
      <P>Section 56 (3) of the Health Act, 1970 provides that a health board shall make available outpatient services without charge for children not included among the persons referred to in subsection (2) in respect of diseases and disabilities of a permanent or long term nature prescribed with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 1 of the Bill before the House at present proposes, among other things, to repeal that subsection.  I would submit that, if that subsection is repealed by the Bill before the House, then the regulations made under that subsection will automatically fall as the basis for the coming into existence of those regulations will have ceased to exist.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself would appear to recognise this fact when he said in the course of his remarks in the House this afternoon:</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks the powers to enable the Minister for Health to make regulations setting out the charges to be made and the categories of people to which they will apply.</P>
      <P>It is obvious, therefore, that if this Bill is enacted in this present form the regulations already in existence will cease to exist and, until the Minister makes new regulations, we will enter a twilight zone where nothing but the enabling legislation will exist.  I regard that as a very unsatisfactory position.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the legal advice tendered to the Minister of State.  Nor can I accept the categoric assurance the Minister has given in relation to these matters.  In the course of my Second Stage remarks I said that the Minister and the Government gave many assurances in relation to the public health service.  They have now adopted an approach fundamentally different from that spelled out by them in the course of the election campaign.  Whereas I agree with the principle underlining this Bill I believe there is a difficulty to be overcome &mdash; one of the nature I have outlined &mdash; and it can be if my amendment is accepted by the Government.</P>

      <P>I might reiterate that the amendment put down by Senator Durcan is not necessary.  I might say that subsection (3) differs in one respect only from the original.  The change consists of the deletion of the words &ldquo;not included among the persons referred to in subsection (2)&rdquo;.  The reason for this change is that, since 1979 the entire population <Col N="2205" /> is included in the provisions of subsection (2).  The Bill before the House substitutes subsection (3) for the original subsection (3).  The legal advice I have been given is that the diseases and disabilities prescribed by the Minister for Finance under the original subsection (3) continue in force on the enactment of this Bill. Therefore the necessity for the amendment does not arise.</P>
      <P>I might repeat what I said earlier, that we will be placing in the Oireachtas Library the regulations which will state clearly the exemptions from this charge. I want to repeat &mdash; and these will be contained in the regulations &mdash; that the following exclusions will apply: medical card holders and their dependants, children suffering from diseases and disabilities of a permanent or long term nature, children who require attendance on an outpatient basis in respect of defects which have been noticed at a health examination provided in accordance with the Health Act.  Also to be excluded under the regulations will be; all women in respect of motherhood, infants up to the age of six weeks, as already provided for under the provisions of the 1970 Health Act, persons in receipt of services for the diagnosis or treatment of certain infectious diseases prescribed under the Health Act, 1947.</P>
      <P>I might reassure the House further that I shall be discussing with my officials and legal department the questions raised by Senators Durcan, Dooge and O'Leary in relation to the amendment they are proposing and which we have been assured by our legal advisers is totally unnecessary.  But if there are any doubts or questions raised in the course of further discussions I will have no hesitation in placing those regulations before the Oireachtas or the Library again.  Therefore Senators need not be worried about this section.  The matter is covered within the regulations.  We are not repealing any of them and we are quite satisfied that there is no need for the amendment. Therefore we would recommend that the amendment would not be pressed.</P>

The question I asked was quite specific and I do not expect the Minister to answer it off the top of his head.  The Minister can take whatever advice he wishes.  Are there regulations in existence which are stated to be regulations made by virtue of the power which exists in section 56 (3) of the Health Act, 1970?</P>

I cannot understand that.  Is the Minister suggesting that if we abolish the Health Act, 1970, altogether, regulations made under that Act would continue to have a life of their own?  Effectively that is what he is saying.  How could regulations made by virtue of section 56 (3) continue to exist if section 56 (3) is gone?  I cannot understand that.  I am only very simple-minded about those things and no doubt the Minister will tell me.</P>

I do not follow the legal advice given in this case bearing in mind the legal advice which was apparently given to the Minister for Social Welfare when he came in here today to put to the House the Social Welfare Bill, 1987.  In a similar type of section, section 10 of that Bill, we had a subsection (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, regulations made wholly or partly under section 76 (1) (b) of the Principal Act before the passing of this Act and in force at such passing shall continue in force until revoked.</P>

      <Col N="2208" /> It would appear that the legal adviser in the Department of Social Welfare is giving different advice from the one in the Department of Health.  One can accept that legal advisers can give differing advice.  That is what makes life in the law so interesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One of the things I know from my engineering is that if you want to <Col N="2209" /> design something properly you must build in a certain amount of redundancy. To say that something has necessarily been done may be sufficient for a lawyer but it is never sufficient for an engineer. That is my approach to this problem.  If the Minister gives us a categorical assurance in the House tonight that when the substitution is made, as I understand it, when the President signs the Bill that he will re-enact on the following day the regulations as they now stand, a lacuna will be avoided.  The concern of this part of the House is to avoid a lacuna.</P>
      <P>Reasonable legal argument has been put forward in regard to the validity of regulations if the statute law under which they have been made falls.  That is a question which could go right to the Supreme Court.  It is not for us to deal with probabilities. We would like to deal with certainty. If the Minister would give us a categorical assurance that on the day following the signing of this legislation by the President he will re-enact the existing legislation with the full freedom to bring in further regulation at any time in the future.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, which is designed to secure a financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.  The need to adjust the rates arises from the Government's decision to increase the funding for the schemes to £30 million in 1987 and to require farmers to contribute more fully to the cost of the schemes.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to disease eradication in 1987 is to restore the impetus to the bovine TB eradication scheme which was lost following cutbacks in funding in 1986 and to continue the drive towards final eradication of brucellosis. Arrangements have been made to begin a new testing programme on 21 April which will consist of a monitor of the national herd coupled with special testing programmes in badly affected areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new rates from 20 April will be 1.1 pence per gallon of milk processed and £6.50 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live.  The expected yield from <Col N="2213" /> the levies this year is £19.4 million, i.e., the same as provided for by the previous Government.  The unavoidable delay in introducing the new rates of levy means that somewhat higher rates than originally envisaged will have to apply.</P>
    <P>On the question of how the levies are used, I want to make it clear that the levies go to finance the running costs of the schemes, the two biggest items being the fees paid to the veterinary practitioners for testing, and reactor and depopulation grants to farmers.  Expenditure on these two items alone is expected to come to about £24 million in 1987, a figure well in excess of the anticipated revenue of £19.4 million from the levies.  Taking into account other running costs for supplies, equipment, travelling etc., the Exchequer's contribution to the schemes in 1987, apart from administration, comes to £10.6 million.  This is a significant amount especially in the current difficult budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>As regards expenditure on administration, it should be understood that the published figures represent the cost of the entire range of veterinary activities of the Department of Agriculture which, in addition to TB and brucellosis, covers controls at ports, implementation of legislation on growth promoters, the service provided by the veterinary research laboratories, animal welfare, and regulating other diseases such as sheep scab, leptospirosis, warble fly, etc.  There is, of course, no question of disease levies being increased to cover any extra cost of administration.  When all relevant costs are taken into account, it is estimated that the projected income from the levies covers about 50 per cent of overall expenditure.  Having regard to the severe financial constraints facing the Government, and the benefits of the schemes to farmers, I do not believe that the contribution being asked of the farming community is excessive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and I wish him well in his new assignment.  I have no doubt that with the reputation he has brought with him to the <Col N="2214" /> House he will apply himself to this area with dedication.  I hope he will be successful.</P>
      <P>I have had an interest in this scheme from the very first day a pilot scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and later brucellosis was initiated in my native village of Bansha by Fr. Hayes under the old voluntary eradication scheme.  So, since 1954 I have had an interest in the efficient operation of this scheme.  I served for many years on the Animal Health Council who advised the Minister and previous Ministers in four different Governments on how to apply themselves to these major scourges, tuberculosis and brucellosis, both of which are compulsory eradication diseases on which the State has invested a considerable amount of money in the past.  Thankfully, through the dedication of the staff in the Department and the veterinary profession and the facilities at the laboratories for testing blood we have come to grips with brucellosis.  We have achieved the status of OBF which we have been trying to achieve for years.</P>
      <P>That is a welcome development and shows that the investment of the State in the past has been justified.  Even if the animals belong to the farmers, there is no doubt in my mind that the State has a responsibility to protect and certify the disease status of our national herd.  Under EC regulations only the Department of Agriculture have the responsibility of certifying the national herd as brucellosis or tuberculosis free.  That must be done if we are to achieve free access to the markets both inside and outside the Community for our cattle when we export them.  For that reason and as a member of the outgoing Animal Health Council representing the general Council of Agricultural Committees I welcome any move that can be made to step up the programme of testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that I consider additional funding necessary. Unfortunately, a three year programme designed by the council to test the national herd &mdash; owing to the economic climate which curtailed the input of the <Col N="2215" /> previous Government &mdash; had to be curtailed in the year just completed and as a result some damage has been done to the programme.  The value of our documentation and our research into the progress or otherwise we had been making has been disturbed in such a way that it could take us two further years with additional funding to return to where we were before the restrictions on financing came in.  In the last budgeting year I was involved in, in applying funds to the scheme we were short about £4.5 million of national input to bring the total cost of programme testing to about £32 million. Therefore the sum outlined by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of £12.7 million to be raised from farmers by way of levies will more than adequately fund the programme in the way I would consider it necessary for it to be carried out.  In saying that the Animal Health Council were of the opinion that farmers were prepared to make funding available provided they would have an input with the experts in the Department into how the scheme would be desinged in the future.  As a result of this increased funding from the farming community they probably will require more of an input with the Department into how they should progress.  Being responsible for providing additional funding, farmers will probably be now more aware of the total cost to themselves of the scheme and the total cost to the National Exchequer to date of the scheme...</P>
    <P>If there is an awareness on all sides of the importance of trying to eradicate tuberculosis in our national herd and now that farmers will be putting in a major contribution by way of levies, an air of urgency will attach to this scheme.  I hope the Minister will have the goodwill of the farming community in trying to achieve an inspection of the national herd which begins next month.  I wish the Minister luck and I hope sincerely in all our interests that this inspection and the testing that will arise from it will be successful. There will be no future for our cattle trade unless we can achieve the standard required in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> I have worked closely with the officials in the Minister's Department on the scheme and as the old council have ended their term of office I want to take this opportunity to thank each one of them individually, those who are here tonight and those who are not, for the efforts they made in trying to design a scheme that would rid our farming community of this scourge of tuberculosis which is an incubating disease and one that can easily be transmitted from animal to animal by lateral spread and carelessness.  That is what makes the efficacy of the scheme all the more urgent.  We cannot stop until we have come to grips with this national scourge of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I hope the scheme will be successful and that the farming community will accept the Minister's reasons for increasing levies in the process.  No one wants to see anybody paying more than their fair share towards anything, but in this case the Minister will find goodwill on the part of the farming community in regard to stepping up the programme of eradication of this deadly disease which has caused widespread hardship in the past to farmers.  They have never made money out of the scheme.  They have lost money and have had their herds either totally wiped out or reduced.  It has been a most traumatic experience to try to come to grips with this disease.  It is a pity the impetus in testing should be slowed down because the disease, without being checked, can continue to spread laterally and otherwise.  I hope any money that is not being used in the testing programme will be devoted to epidemiology which is an integral part of any research into how this disease is spread from animal to animal or from wild animals in particular. That area should not be neglected in any future programme that the Department, and the Minister, are responsible for.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment to the Department of Agriculture and hope his term of office will be very successful.  I know he will have the interests of the farming community <Col N="2217" /> at heart and will do everything possible to promote their interests.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, one of the Minister's first duties this evening is to impose additional levies on the farming community. That is something we all regret but we realise that in the present economic climate it is absolutely necessary. This levy of 1.1p. per gallon of milk processed and £6.50 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live is required in order to proceed with the bovine TB eradication scheme.  We have been tinkering about with this scheme for 25 years or longer and it has cost the taxpayers millions of pounds.  Unfortunately, we find that in certain parts of the country bovine TB is greater now than it was 25 years ago.  I cannot understand why that should be the case or why we have not put more money into research to try to find out how TB has increased in our national herd.  I understand that in every other European country bovine TB has been reduced radically and yet we seem to be having a constant struggle to contain the disease.  I do not think that is right because after all the money that has been spent on it and our experience over the past 25 years we should have some knowledge of what spreads the disease which seems to be worse in some areas than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard last year of the high incidence of TB in parts of Longford and Westmeath.  Have the Department of Agriculture who are monitoring the scheme found out the reason?  We are told that badgers are the cause of spreading this disease in some areas.  Has anything positive been found about the badger?  There is a difference of opinion between certain veterinary surgeons as to whether the badger is a carrier of the disease but surely it should be possible to find out if this is so and if it is to do something about it.  Our national herd is very important to the national economy. It is important that we should have a healthy herd; that we are able to compete on the European markets with other members of the EC and if we cannot come to grips with the problem of bovine TB we are going to get a bad name in <Col N="2218" /> Europe.  For that reason I hope the Government will tackle this problem with determination.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see tests being called off like they were last year because if that happens we will not be able to monitor the disease and pick out the cattle affected by it.  Why are the laws that exist not being implemented?  We still have tags being switched, dirty lorries being allowed to convey cattle to and from marts and reactors being left on farms for too long.  Tanglers &mdash; I can call them nothing else &mdash; are being allowed to buy reactor cattle from farmers and transport them from one place to another before they finally reach a factory.  That should not be allowed to happen under any circumstances. I would like to see the law tightened up and enforced because there is no reason why this should be allowed to happen if our national herd is so important to us.  Why are farmers being allowed to sell cattle that have not been tested? That is known to happen.  The Department of Agriculture officials should see that the law is obeyed to the letter.  There is no point in spending £30 million per annum or £1,000 million of taxpayers' money over the last 25 years if we are not serious about getting rid of the disease.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are asking farmers to contribute to this fund and I know they will willingly do so if they see that the Department, and all interested parties, are serious about getting rid of the disease once and for all.  Every time this topic comes up here we hear of the same problems. We are getting no nearer to the day when we can say that our herd is free of TB.  I would love to see that day and I know every farmer in Ireland would but it is a long way off yet.  We all know of the hardships that are being created by small farmers who are unfortunate enough to be affected by this disease. They suffer a complete loss of income. The dairy farmer whose cows are affected by this disease is closed down for maybe a full 12 months.  He is not compensated by the Department of Agriculture, or anybody else, for that loss of income. The same applies to the dry stock farmer. I hope compensation, better than what is <Col N="2219" /> available at present, will be made available to those people who suffer a loss of income because their herd is affected by tuberculosis or brucellosis.  I wish the Minister luck in his efforts to eradicate this disease once and for all from our national herd but unless the Government show determination, and unless they enforce the laws they will not get rid of the disease and we will continue to have tinkering with it for the next 20 years. I hope we get the co-operation of the farming community, veterinary surgeons and the Department to eliminate this scourge from our national herd once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. Coming from Louth I have no doubt he will do a great job because he has experience in the farming field.  There is little for me to say on this topic because Senators Ferris and Hussey have covered the ground very well.  There are some things that I feel I should add my voice to.  Having been involved for years with the Animal Health Council, along with Senator Ferris, and having been involved with some of the health committees in my own county of Louth, I am not quite sure if we are any nearer solving the problem today than we were some 10 or 15 years ago.  That is the worrying thing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of the day have decided to a step further than the previous Government in as much as they have imposed a higher charge of £6.50 per animal, which Senator Hussey believes the farmers will gladly pay.  I am inclined to disagree with him because if we take, for example, the profits on livestock, particularly cattle, this is a severe blow.  One has to take into account that we must continue with testing and, as the Minister said tonight, there have been some slight hiccups over the past few years.  I am not quite sure if we are getting to the root of the trouble.  Coming back to the charge of £6.50 per animal, a man fattening 100 cattle in the summer of the year has the sizeable sum of £650 to pay <Col N="2220" /> in disease levies.  That is a big sum of money today, no matter what way we look at it.  If we take haulage and all the other charges involved in sending an animal to the factory, it is very often the best part of £20.  I have some experience in that field and often there is not that sort of profit at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of it is that we have tended down through the years to blame everybody.  We have cowboy farmers and cowboy vets and we look around us for somebody to blame.  The real truth is that we were never able to lay the blame fairly and squarely on anybody's shoulders. Senator Ferris will probably agree with me.  Many a day we sat from early morning until midnight discussing this.  I often wondered how we could manage to did, once a month, for years.  At the end of the day I often wondered what we were all talking about.  We were talking and that is all were doing.  We were to nearer to solving the problem, although many experts came with possible solutions.</P>
    <P>The disappointing and worrying part about it all for many people throughout the length and breadth of the country is that in some herds which people have watched and carefully managed down through the years, where they did not buy in animals and where there has never been an outbreak, this has happened over the past couple of years and we have not been given any acceptable explanation as to how or why this should have happened. Some people tell us that it comes from a badger and some others will tell you that the disease can live in old walls for 100 years.  Senator Ferris will agree that those are the types of explanations we have heard in the past.  With all the explanations and experts we have, we are no nearer solving the problem.  This is what is worrying me.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this £6.50 charge will be accepted by farmers &mdash; certainly not the way Senator Hussey has put it &mdash; as a charge they should have to pay to get rid of disease.  Most people accept that we are going backwards.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to lay the blame fairly <Col N="2221" /> and squarely on the shoulders of any Government.  All Governments have fallen down on this job in the last number of years.  We have said from time to time that there are certain farmers who withhold some of their stock and do not present them all for testing.  The reason for this in some cases, especially with young stock, is that the compensation was never adequate for young stock.  I think the Minister will agree with me on that.  There was always a feeling among farmers when presenting young stock that if they had reactors the compensation was the most miserable you could ever think about.  I see Senator Ferris nodding his head in approval on that one.  We know many farmers &mdash; I know them myself as chairman of my own committee at home in Louth &mdash; who took young stock to the factories and there is no doubt that they did not get suck calf prices for them.  This might have been the reason down through the years that stock were being held back and not presented for testing.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say today that testing is going ahead again.  A new look must be taken at this problem.  The Minister will have to bring all farming leaders together, including the livestock producers, and discuss this whole problem with them.</P>
    <P>We know that the vets from time to time give the impression that they are very concerned about the disease.  Others will tell you that they are very concerned about the money they get out of it and many of them are certainly very rich.  We can truly say that.  The administration cost of £10 million in relation to this scheme is certainly a shocking amount of money.  I believe there could be some cheeseparing there.  The Minister should take a look at that.  I hope it will not be a case of pouring money down the drain and making no progress.  That cannot continue.</P>
    <P>My main concern is this savage increase up to £6.50 per head.  Haulage and many other expenses amount to the best part of £20 per animal and I do not think the farming community and the beef industry can stand up to that.  I would <Col N="2222" /> appeal to the Minister to do something about this issue.  It is coming near midnight and I do not want to labour it.  The Minister's job does not finish tonight by getting this House to agree to this increase of £6.50.  I believe there will be a severe backlash by the farming community unless they see that something positive is to be done at the end of the day.  They will not continue to pay £6.50 per head if they feel they have co-operated in the past in trying to eradicate the disease but that somebody somewhere else is to blame for this disease being as rampant as it is today.  In my opinion all the experts who have been dealing with this disease for so long have failed to get to grips with it.  I suggest that perhaps we could have a new scheme over three years to deal with the problem.  Our approach so far has failed and failed miserably. Some assurance will have to be given to the farmers if they are asked to pay £6.50, which as I quoted before is £650 for a man with 100 cattle.  That is not a large number of cattle to fatten over the summer.  That amount of money is quite considerable because at present there is not much profit in beef at the end of the day.  I think the Minister knows that very well.  As long as I am here and on the home front, I will continue to fight as hard as I can.  The Minister has not heard the last of my voice in trying to get something more done than the Government telling people they are now financing a new scheme or, rather, than the farmers are paying for this scheme to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank those who have spoken for their kind words of encouragement. Indeed, the three Senators who contributed to the debate are people whom I know have a deep involvement with the agricultural industry in this country. They have contributed immensely to its development over the years on different committees and at different levels.  I sincerely hope that that involvement and that contribution will continue for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disease control and the elimination of <Col N="2223" /> brucellosis and TB from our national herd is absolutely vital.  The importance of our livestock exports to the overall well-being of the economy cannot be overstated.  In this day freedom from disease is vital in respect of products we are selling to very discerning consumers.  The health and the well-being of our national herd is vital to the future of the economy. We must give it priority.  We must ensure that the necessary finance and organisation is made available to ensure that the ongoing programme of disease eradication is accelerated.</P>
    <P>While from time to time commentators and critics of the disease eradication programme tended to see the less positive side of the story, the reality is that from the earlier years there has been a reduction from 17 per cent to 3 per cent of TB incidence in our national herd. Undoubtedly the last push, as it were, to eradicate the disease is always the most difficult one.  Certainly that has been the experience in other countries.  Some of the speakers referred particularly to the involvement of the badger in the spread of the disease.  While various opinions have been expressed as to its involvement &mdash; obviously we must keep in mind that its movement around can be a factor in the spread of the disease &mdash; it would appear that the main cause is the lateral spread from bovine to bovine.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has been any direct reference to one particular black spot in Ireland in County Longford but Members may be interested in the progress that has been made in disease eradication in that area.  I understand that the number of infected herds has been reduced by 100 over the last four months to the present figure of 278.  There is a continuing and ongoing intensive programme of testing in the area to ensure that the number of infected herds will be drastically and dramatically reduced in the immediate future.  The results of the investigation into the badger's contribution to the spread of the disease has been very mixed.  The net result is a slow but steady improvement.  We know that Longford <Col N="2224" /> will be a number one priority for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Members who have spoken referred to the present margin of profit in dry stock. As one who comes from a farming background, I am more than aware of the difficulties of farmers who are solely dependent on dry stock for a livelihood. We must realise it is vitally important that the necessary finance is provided to ensure that the ongoing programme of eradication is accelerated.  The economic fact of life today is that unless the finance is available for these programmes the rate of progress will not be what it is.  Over the next few years we will see a dramatic improvement in the disease levels.  We will move rapidly towards the ultimate objective of the complete eradication of the diseases involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to the importance of having farmer input in the area of disease eradication.  I tell the House that next Tuesday the Minister for Agriculture and Food will meet a delegation from the IFA to discuss the future of the TB scheme.  I am sure all the different aspects can be considered at that stage. At this hour of the night I think perhaps it is time we brought the discussion to a conclusion.  Over the next year or two I hope we will move towards the objective of the complete eradication of TB and brucellosis in our national herd.</P>

      <P>On a motion that we adjourn <i>sine die,</i> as a Senator who will not be here on whatever that particular <i>dies</i> happens to be, I feel an urge within me to move an amendment that the Seanad do not adjourn in order to prolong my membership.  Before we enter on the full debate on the Adjournment, I would like to say a few words based on my experience in this House since 1961. I do not want to draw comparisons with <Col N="2225" /> other places; I merely want to state what has been my experience here.  It has been an experience not of conflict but of comradeship, not of confrontation but of an attempt to reach consensus.</P>
      <P>I have many happy memories of this House, of being a fellow Senator as were Senator MacDonald, Senator Willie Ryan, Senator Eoin Ryan with those who were responsible for the establishment of the State, Senator Michael Hayes who was the first Ceann Comhairle, and Dr. Jim Ryan and Gerry Boland who passed a short time here after their long service as Minister.  We have had the privilege of listening to the glorious Irish of An Seabhac in the Seanad.  These are memories that will remain with me all my life. I feel impelled to move an amendment to the motion before the House that this should not end &mdash; but all good things must come to the end.</P>
      <P>I hope those who will be returned next week to Seanad Éireann and to succeeding Seanaid will experience as much pleasure as I have from service in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief at this hour of the night.  It would be remiss of us if we did not record our appreciation to those Members of the House who will not be coming back &mdash; most of them by their own choice.  They have served long and well here and made our service with them all the more pleasurable and beneficial. All of us have learned much from the people who have been referred to by Senator Dooge.  I would put Senator Dooge in the category of great persons who have worked in this House.  He fulfilled many roles from Cathaoirleach to the Leader of the House.  He used this House to his utmost under the last Government.  Many Bills were initiated here.  He was loath to adjourn the House <i>sine die</i>.  We always had business to do. We always ensured that the Government used this House to the fullest extent and we always adjourned the House to a date we agreed amongst ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach paid tribute this morning to those who had been successful in elevating themselves to another <Col N="2226" /> House.  Many of us would consider that that is not an elevation in legislative terms.  To Deputy Michael D. Higgins, Deputy Howlin, and Deputy Michael Smith who is now a Minister of State in the new Government, Deputy Michael Lynch, Deputy John Ellis and Deputy Jim Higgins we wish happiness and as much satisfaction in the new House to which they have aspired as they had in this House.  Senator Durcan is not seeking re-election.  To our new Members, Senator O'Toole and Senator Nuala Fennell we wish luck in their short term in this Seanad and we hope they will be successful in the next Seanad.</P>
    <P>We wish the Cathaoirleach well.  He has a long family tradition of service in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As Senator Lanigan, the new Leader of the House, said we hope your name will be continued here and that the opportunity will arise during the next few days to ensure that. That would meet the wishes of many Senators on all sides of the House.  To the outgoing Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, I wish many happy years in retirement. He has served the State well.  It was a pleasure for us to serve with Senator Dooge.  There are many other Senators whose names I should put on the record of the House now because this will be my last opportunity in this session.  I aspire to future membership of the House but that is in the lap of the electorate at present.  We can only hope for the best. We have Senators Andy O'Brien and Luke Belton who have served many years with us.  Senators Helena McAuliffe and Timmy Conway because of other situations, find themselves without an electorate to re-elect them; this is possibly one of the reasons they may not be going forward.  I know they contributed well and ably while they were here.  Senator Eoin Ryan has had many long years of service here and has been a peer to many of us.  We always looked upon him as a fatherly figure in the House and he always made excellent and sensible contributions. Senator Martin O'Donoghue participated fully today with us.  I pay tribute also to a very dear colleague of <Col N="2227" /> ours, Séamus de Brún who was nominated and finally elected by the closest of margins, but was considered by everybody to be a gentleman.  I hope Séamus and the organisation he represented will prosper for many years and that he will have a long and happy life in his retirement.</P>
    <P>Senator Mark Killilea, who is not with us just now, was a great blustering boisterous Senator who has gone to greener pastures as a member of the European Parliament.  He was not slow today to let us have the sharp end of his tongue, which most of us enjoyed very much.  Senators Pat Magner and Stephen McGonagle, have not offered themselves for re-election. Both of them were nominated by the then Taoiseach on the recommendation of the then Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.  Both brought a dimension to this House which is to be welcomed.  Senator McGonagle, in particular, from across the Border, with his vast experience in the trade union movement, and as an ombudsman with so much involvement in the North of Ireland will be missed in this House.  His two colleagues, Senators Brid Rogers and John Robb, made major contributions and for the first time we had a kind of cross-Border dimension which is important to us all.  Last but not least, we have Senator Seán O'Leary who is not offering himself for re-election.  I have no doubt that somehow, some time Senator O'Leary will be back in the benches again.  If not, it would be a tragedy because he was magnificent in his contributions towards the betterment of legislation and he had his own way of doing it.  I hope that people in that category who offer themselves for re-election will be successful.  Indeed I hope that all those seeking re-election will be returned.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Government I would like to join in the tributes that have been so ably and deservedly paid to the Senators who are finishing their sojourn in this House tonight and who are not seeking re-election.  All of them have played a noble part.  They <Col N="2228" /> have served their country well.  They have served this House well and they have served well the various committees of which they were members during the years they were here.  I thank them for all the work they have done.  I mention in particular Senator Dooge, because he has been the Leader of the House since I came here.  He has been very courteous and helpful to all the Members, and particularly to new Members who did not know the run of the House.  He has been a trojan worker and has set a record regarding the number of sittings of this House during the past four years.  I wish Senator Dooge and all the other Members who are not seeking re-election every success and happiness in their retirement.  Knowing those men as the workaholics they have been, I know that they will be active in other spheres and I wish them success.  We will miss their service in this House.  We will miss their words of wisdom but I am confident that they will continue to serve their country and their party in other spheres.  I hope they will enjoy many happy years.</P>

      <P>I join the other speakers in their tributes and, like them, I shall refrain from mentioning names, with the exception of a couple of people to whom special tribute must be in order.  First, I mention you, a Chathaoirleach.  You were elected to the Dáil at the same time as I was elected to the Seanad.  In the past 25 years, whether as a Deputy or a Senator as well as Cathaoirleach, you have given distinctive service.</P>
      <P>In the past four years here you have been most fair to all sides of the House. Indeed, we are sorry that you have decided to call it a day and retire.  I have known you for many years.  I met you only a short time after you were elected a Deputy and I a Senator; we were staying in the same hotel during a by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay a very special tribute to the Leader of the House for the past four years, Senator Dooge.  I have been Whip here since 1973.  The last four years were my happiest years here because Senator <Col N="2229" /> Dooge never changed business or anything else in this House without acquainting me of the fact.  I often got telephone calls from him from as far away as Warsaw.  If there was only the slightest change to be made in business he contacted me.  During that four years there were no rows about the Order of Business as happens elsewhere, and I will not say where.  Senator Dooge was elected to the Seanad on the same day as myself, 25 years ago.  I regret that he too has decided to call it a day.  Another Senator who was elected on the same day, Senator McDonald, is not calling it a day yet.</P>

      <P>We were in Opposition for the past four years.  When we return here after the election of the new Seanad, I hope that the same co-operation will obtain.  A great deal has been said about this House by people who do not know much about it.  They say that it should be abolished and so on.  Senator Dooge, in his term here, has uplifted this House.  We sit almost as often as the Dáil.  Bills are discussed and teased out here much more than in the other House, where they are rushed through.  We take our time at them, otherwise we would not be here now, at midnight.  I hope to be back here after the election, and I hope this House will remain as long as the Dáil exists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that it is getting late but as one of the rookies who came in here four years ago, I would like to pay tribute to many of the people who have done so much to make my four years here such an enjoyable experience.  In thanking you, a Chathaoirligh, for the way you conducted business, for the jovial way in which you <Col N="2230" /> dealt with many a serious problem and the way in which you treated us who helped you out on occasions, I wish you every success in the many years, I hope, left you to enjoy away from the hustle and bustle of serious politics.  In the absence of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Tras Honan, who is obviously trying to pick up more votes than she needs, I want to thank her for looking after us so well, and I wish her well in the election.</P>
    <P>Referring to my own side of the House I want to say it has been a privilege for me to have worked with Senator Dooge, who with his wonderful clarity of thought and speech has set a standard for us that many of us envy but will never reach.  I thank him for the leadership he has given us.  Senator O'Leary has at all times shown that he has a wonderful intellect and at times a wonderful tongue in which to take people apart if they try to tell him where he is going wrong.  It has been a pleasure for me to work with him.  It has been a pleasure too for me to have shared the experience of our Northern Ireland colleagues, Senator McGonagle, Senator Rogers and Senator John Robb, not alone for the way they expressed their views so fearlessly but for giving us the views of people who share experiences that some of us are sheltered from.  I regard it as a privilege to have worked with them.</P>
    <P>To my colleagues across the House in Fianna Fáil I want to say that people down the country think that politicians are always tearing one another apart.  It has been a pleasure to be here with people, to have different views, to argue cases here but at least to be extremely civilised and friendly.</P>

    <P>I wish every success to those from Mayo who have left us, Jim Higgins who has gone to higher levels whether for better or worse, and to Senator Durcan who is taking a rest and who I hope will be back shortly as he has much to contribute.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of joining in the very fulsome tributes that have been paid to yourself.  Sir, on your retirement from public life and to the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge and all my colleagues who are not contesting the election. It has been a great experience to work here.  We can make a good deal of progress here perhaps by virtue of the fact that this House is not as political as the popularly elected assembly.  The Seanad carries out a constitutional role. It has been a great success.  We can see the progress that has been made and the effects of full co-operation.  I wish you and my other colleagues very sincere good health and happiness in retirement. Perhaps it is because the numbers of the House are very small that we get to know our colleagues better than in other larger assemblies.  We have to rely on one another to get the business through.  That perhaps is one of the reasons that so many people enjoy their membership of the Seanad.  To all of you who have been so kind to me over the years my very sincere thanks.</P>

Senator Jim Dooge taught all of us much and I, in particular, perhaps learned more than most from him.  I always marvel at his tremendous ability to return from abroad and discuss with us, his colleagues on the then Government side, complex legislation and immediately grasp and know precisely what has to be known and what was relevant for us in a tactical parliamentary sense.  I remember one day him saying to me, when we were dealing <Col N="2232" /> with the Dentists Bill: &ldquo;If you want to learn something about parliamentary procedures, then get stuck into this Bill&rdquo;, which I did and I think other people did, too.  It was certainly one Bill which taught many of us much about the role of Parliament and how we could mould legislation here.  I want to thank Senator Dooge for that and for his many personal kindness to me and to every Member of this House during our period here.</P>
      <P>I should also like to thank Senator Mick Lanigan, the Fianna Fáil leader in this House, with whom I had a fair amount of contact. I say in a very affectionate and fond way that I have always regarded him as being the Flurry Knox, as it were, of the Seanad.  There was always a certain unpredictability about him, which was in the best sense of Irish parliamentary tradition.  I hope he is returned and that he leads the next Seanad for Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I want in a special way to thank tonight the Clerk of the House, Jack Tobin, who is not here and who will be retiring in the next few months and also his present assistant and former assistant.  His office made available to me and to all Members a great fund of knowledge, a tremendous courtesy at all times and a great willingness to help in every way.  With that, I want to couple my thanks to the staff of this House.  Speaking as somebody who is not seeking election I can only marvel at the tremendous help and assistance every member of the staff of this House gave to me during my four and a quarter years here.  It is something which I appreciate and for which I want to thank them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, to those who try to demean the role of this House publicly, in my view this House has a very important role to play.  If one examines the way in which we looked at legislation over the past four and a quarter years, one will see that in terms of hours we spent as long dealing with legislation as did the Dáil.  I believe we had a far greater input into legislation than the Dáil did and I do not say that in a critical way of the other House.  If the record of this House over the past four <Col N="2233" /> and a quarter years is examined, its relevance will be seen.  Certainly, there is need for reform of certain aspects of the Seanad, but I think this House has a role and a role which must be confirmed for the future.  With that, I wish to thank you, a Chathaoirleach, to wish you well and to thank everybody associated with this House.</P>

      <P>I certainly should like to be associated with all the remarks that were made here tonight.  I should like, in particular, to wish you, a Chathaoirleach, well although I have a feeling at this stage you would rather I was wishing you goodnight.  However, there are things that should be said, no matter how late it is.  I should like to wish you many happy years in retirement.  You have given many years to politics and yours is a respected and honourable name in politics. It is very difficult to start singling out people.  Senator Dooge is, of course, a person about whom one could speak quite a lot.  He is a very gentlemanly type of man.  As a Senator he was selected by the Taoiseach of the time to be a Minister, which is a great honour.  It has not happened many times; as far as I know it happended only three times.</P>

He brought great dignity and honour to politics and to the Seanad. To Senator O'Leary, who is not contesting, and Senator Durcan I wish both of them well.  I got to know both of them very well.  Senator O'Leary's contributions were excellent.  I am sorry to <Col N="2234" /> see men like that not being here.  The only other Senator for mention, then, is Senator Séamus de Brún.  If I were asked to describe Séamus de Brún I should describe him as a beautiful man and I think all of you would agree with that.</P>

      <P>This is the first time in the course of this Seanad that I have got up to say anything nice about anybody.  I am not going to make a habit of it, I can assure the House.  There are a few people I should like to mention.  I would like, first of all, to mention Dr. Garret FitzGerald who did me a great honour by nominating me to this House.  Secondly, I would like to mention you, a Chathaoirleach.  You come from a family with a long tradition of public service and you have lived up to that in the best possible way.  Senator Dooge, who I have known for many many years, from the time he lived in Cork, is an excellent man.  Senator Eoin Ryan&mdash; what can I say about him?  Lastly, I shall mention one other person, Senator Tras Honan.  During the period of time when I had difficulty in this House Tras Honan was very good to me and I appreciated it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of my two colleagues from the North, I think I must assume the position of speaking on their behalf and to thank you, a Chathaoirleach, for your wonderful chairmanship during this period of time. I thank Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and, above all, the Labour Party Senators.  I want to thank all the political parties in the <Col N="2235" /> Republic &mdash; all, I said &mdash; for their contribution to the democratic evolutionary position as distinct from the revolutionary. That must be said tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>Reason must take over.  Intelligence shows that reasoning is the way to do it.  From the North, I have to say it, that you are going about it the right way.  There is a challenge and it is a challenge to democracy.  It is not a challenge to Fianna Fáil, it is not a challenge to Fine Gael, it is not a challenge to The Workers' Party, it is not a challenge to any political party, as such and that is not a contradiction.  It is a challenge to democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from the North we feel this. We feel that this traumatic experience we are now going through in Ireland must be faced.  Reason and intelligence must take over eventually.  We cannot have the gun and the bomb.  It is not reasonable, it is not reasoning and it is not intelligent.  I must assume I am speaking also for Senator Robb and Senator Rogers when I say that you in the Republic have made a great contribution to the democratic principles involved in seeking a solution to terrible problems.  I have had a wonderful experience during all the time I have spent in the North trying to wrestle with whatever problems the Northern majority felt they had.  They are sincere in their belief that there are problems for them.  James Connolly said, &ldquo;Ireland means nothing to me without her people&rdquo;.  The unification of Ireland, that loose phraseology, should be identified this way: it is not territory about which we are bothered, not green fields but people.  I believe sincerely that the people in the Republic have made a powerful contribution, in their popular democratic style, articulated in the Dáil and Seanad, in appealing to the Northern people with reason and intelligence.  It is the reasoned and intelligent approach that must win. It will take a long time to do so but time is on our side.  I believe that eventually the people in the Thirty-two Counties will <Col N="2236" /> accept the democratic principle so that the people of Ireland will be able to reach, not a compromise, but an accord or agreement on the basis of acceptance of all the traditions in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to all the political parties in the Republic on their reasoned and intelligent approach to this problem. That approach is crystallised in the Anglo-Irish accord.  I am not saying that the Anglo-Irish accord will provide a solution; I have never said that.  It is just a step in the right direction.  I insist that time is on our side but I insist also that the use of the bomb and the bullet must be regarded as offensive, unintelligent and unreasonable.  I believe that the Irish people, North and South can come to the position of unity eventually.</P>
    <P>The traumatic experience of the past 20 years must have made an impression on the youth of this country but the youth, North and South, will make the necessary changes within the democratic context; they are bound to because they are intelligent, much better educated than those who have gone before them and they understand.  There may be radical changes which many of us will not like but they will make the changes and before too long, eventually establish a new relationship with their friends in Great Britain.  That is what the Anglo-Irish accord means.  It is part of the aspiration for unity.</P>
    <P>The accord has to be reviewed.  I would like to think that such review will take the form of our young people: where do we go now?</P>
    <P>I pay a great tribute to you, a Chathaoirleach, as Chairman of this Seanad.  Over the past four years I have always felt very privileged to have been here at all.</P>

      <P>I would like to wish all those Members seeking re-election the best of luck.  As somebody said, unfortunately there will not be seats for them all.  To the people retiring, myself included, the best we can wish each other is the best of health; if we have that we will be happy.  I, too, would like to pay <Col N="2237" /> tribute to the Leader of the House, Professor Dooge.  I have worked with him for the past four years, together with Senator Lanigan, Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, and Senator Michael Ferris, Leader of the Labour Party.  I always had difficulty in finding out who was Leader of the Independents; most frequently I thought they were all Leaders.  I must say that the Leaders of the three parties and the three Whips were most helpful and kind to me at all times.  I should like to pay special tribute to the three Independent Senators from Northern Ireland who honoured their obligations to this House. I thank them very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank also the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Honan, who unfortunately is not with us today. Senator Honan was most helpful to me during my four years as Cathaoirleach.  I should like to extend my thanks also to the Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Jack Tobin, and the three Assistant Clerks we have had during the four years &mdash; Mr. Martin McMahon, Mr. Kieran Coughlan and now Mr. Deirdre Lane.  Just this morning we had the experience of Senator Charles McDonald submitting a motion that was late and of Standing Orders unfolded something which permitted me to accept the motion.  The three of us talked and argued about it &mdash; I will not give the opinions of the other two people &mdash; but we decided to take the motion.  That was the procedure followed every time we had a motion submitted about which there was any doubt.  The Clerk, assistant-Clerk and I met.  We talked about it and cleared it with the relevant Department. No matter how many motions were submitted I always accepted the first received, the second being second and so on.  The Clerk and the Assistant-Clerk knew that and that there was no way I would break that rule.  I hope whoever succeeds me will engage in the same practice because it relieves many problems encountered in the arrangement of our business.  Miss Josie Briody I should like to thank also whom we tended to see only when we are in trouble.  She has been most efficient, courteous and helpful to <Col N="2238" /> everyone.  That lady proved most helpful to everybody.</P>
    <P>The Official Reporters were most kind to Members of the House and I thank them for that.  The press were in our favour on occasions but against us on others.  One often wondered what side of the road they were on but, however, I was never too particular about that and I do not think other Members were.  The Ushers we met here and around the House were most helpful to us.  The gardaí were always helpful to Members and I convey our thanks to them.</P>
    <P>Above all, I thank Members who acted as temporary chairmen, particularly those who acted in that capacity when I was ill.  I was absent from the House through illness for almost three months and there was never any problem because a number of Members acted as temporary Chairmen.  To them I must express sincere thanks.  I wish the Taoiseach, the members of his Cabinet and his junior Ministers the best of luck.  They have a hard road ahead of them but I can assure them of my co-operation.  I am one of those people who was fortunate, or unfortunate &mdash; I often think I was more unfortunate than fortunate &mdash; in that I was born into politics.  I did not even have a choice in the party I joined.  Both my parents were Members of the Dáil.  I do not think there is any person in the country who can make the same claim yet.  I was a member of Leitrim County Council for 45 years, for 15 of which I was chairman of that body.  I was a member of the Dáil or Seanad for 26 years and I enjoyed every moment.  When it comes to the end of the trail a look back often brings tears to one's eyes but that is the way life is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The speeches which have just been made are very hard to follow with such a serious matter as the political decision taken by the new <Col N="2239" /> Government to dismiss 132 young agricultural graduates from their employment as farm assessors with the farm assessment office, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service.</P>
      <P>An unprecedented procedure was adopted on this occasion.  These 132 men with professional qualifications were just given a verbal instruction that their employment would be terminated in one week and this communication was issued some time after the news had been broadcast by RTE.  These graduates had legal contracts of employment.  Some of them had been working in the office since it was set up two years ago and they were told summarily that they were dismissed without regard to their contracts of employment or their prospects for alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Have the Government any plans for the redeployment of these young graduates? As far as I am aware there are no employment prospects for these 132 young men nor are there prospects for the 80 people due to graduate this summer at a time when the farm development service prospects are on the wane as are prospects in all areas of agricultural development.  These young professionals have just been told to go home and no account has been taken of how they are to survive.  Even graduates with the full two years service do not qualify for redundancy payments or social welfare benefits.  The Government's one week's notice failed to take into account any commitments these young people were obliged to enter into on leaving university. They were obliged to provide themselves with a car and with living accommodation.  They needed a much longer notification of termination than the one week which they received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now over 150 years since the Griffith valuation was carried out.  the work the farm assessors office undertook over the past 20 months in assessing 1,033,852 acres and 629,979 adjusted acres up to 31 August last year was commented on favourably by the farm tax commissioners last October when he said he knew of no <Col N="2240" /> other professional arm of the State which would equal such production or would even approach it, as part of a communication he sent to the inspectors in charge of the 19 offices of the farm tax service.  To date over 6,000 holdings have been assessed.  Four hundred holdings per month were assessed and that is between 85,000 and 90,000 acres which adjusted down to roughly 50,000 acres per month.  If the tax system was brought into operation it would yield an additional £50,000 per month in revenue. Of the 10 million acres to be assessed, 1.7 million acres have been assessed to date.  Some time ago the IFA castigated the Department for assessing only 2,200 farms in their first year of operation. Looking at the first report of the farm assessor's office, this represents 1.2 million acres in all.</P>
    <P>According to an OECD report, we must make greater use of professional and technical skills.  This Government propose greater encouragement for horticulture and have appointed a Minister with special responsibility in that area. Should one not expect proposals from the new Government to redeploy the 132 graduates in order to further the Government's aims and proposals to emphasise this new development?</P>
    <P>Farm classifications should continue regardless of the tax issue, because we do not know how many farms or holdings are in the country.  A replacement of the Griffith valuation should be used to develop an equitable system of means testing for health contributions, higher educational grants, medical cards or farm grants.  Many farmers are clearly getting an unjust deal under the out-dated Griffith valuation which was carried out in the 1830s.  We need classification because it gives credence to the farm profiles being submitted for farm income tax and it should be used for health contributions and so on.  I understand there are 19 regional offices and the budget allocated £1 million for the decentralisation of some of the services.  That system could be used to assist in implementing that part of the Government's programme.</P>
    <P>I understand that the net pay of these <Col N="2241" /> 132 assistant farm assessors amounts to a little over £900,000 per year and this should not be taken as representing a large imposition on the finances of the State.  In view of the unprecedented nature of the breaking of these 132 contracts of employment, will the Minister give a commitment that discussions will be held with the Union of the Professional and Technical Civil Servants before these graduate civil servants are dismissed.  I ask the Minister to undertake a review of this decision in the light of the necessity to update or replace the old Griffith valuation system.</P>
    <P>This represents a very small problem to the country as a whole but it is a frightening prospect for the 132 young graduates and the class of approximately 80 who will graduate this year.  The Government having laboured the problem of the scourge of emigration in the process of gaining power some weeks ago, are we now to officially see 132 young graduates plus the entire class of the coming year being forced to emigrate because there are no prospects of education in the agricultural sector either in the service sector serving agriculture or in the production sector.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider in what way the skills and the expertise of this professional body of young people with much to contribute to the evolvement and the development of agriculture can be utilised. Is there any way in which their skills and their expertise can be used in the benefit and development of our agricultural industry?  It is now acceptable procedure to let civil servants go at a week's verbal notice and will this be the order of the day in the future?  I hope that this is not so and that the Government will find ways and means of reversing the present trend.</P>
    <P>As a farmer I am rather shocked at the idea that ACOT and An Foras Talúntais appear to be under severe constraint to wind down their activities at a time when surely there is a need for the greater development of agricultural service.  If I have any criticism of the Department of Agriculture it is that their main input at present into Irish agriculture would <Col N="2242" /> appear to be the extension of the disadvantaged areas and the securement of additional grants in that fashion towards agriculture.  There must be room for improving the output of agriculture and trying to combat the necessity this country appears to have to import between £40 million and £50 million worth of potatoes and vegetables.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McDonald for dividing his time with me.  Up to this week the principal exports from this country were doctors and bullocks but now we are adding graduates to that export drive.  I am not competent to talk about the farm tax or land tax but I am competent to talk about man's inhumanity to man when somebody is dismissed from a job by the State with a week's verbal notice given over Radio Éireann.  If an employer in private enterprise wishes to dismiss somebody, under EC Regulations he has to give three months notice to the person.  Why are State employers in the privileged position that they can turn off the tap and get rid of somebody at a week's notice and yet private enterprises have to give three months notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These young graduates had to have a motor car for their job.  Their parents could not provide them with this tool of trade so they committed themselves to hire purchase agreements, to bank loans and various methods so that they could buy their cars.  They now find they are left high and dry.  This is not good enough.  It is a brutal decision.  I do not think any human being could make this decision &mdash; it must have been made by a robot.  Are there more robots in the Department; how many more robots will be employed and how many more will dismiss people in employment in this country at a week's notice?  I appeal to the Minister to do something and not put these people on the scrap heap or the export ship.  Alternative employment <Col N="2243" /> should be provided for them.  If they are not given a chance then there is no future in educating young people in this country because they will only be educated for export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Senator to the announcement on farm taxation which was made by the Minister for Finance in the course of his Budget Statement on Tuesday.  He said that it was the view of the Government that farmers should be taxed in the same manner as other sections of the community, that is on actual income.  It had been decided, therefore, to discontinue the farm tax from 1987 onwards and legislation to this effect will be introduced shortly.  He also said that farm tax liabilities due and unpaid in respect of 1986, which total approximately £5 million would be pursued by the local authorities and that there can be no question of an amnesty.  In consequence of the abolition of farm tax, the farm classification office is being closed down.</P>
      <P>The classification office had engaged a number of graduates in agriculture science to assist the permanent inspectorate in the classification of agricultural land, that is to determine the adjusted acreage of agricultural holding by reference to the criteria set out in the Farm Tax Act, 1985.  The total number of officials involved &mdash; known as assistant farm assessors &mdash; is 130.  They were employed on a temporary basis.  The contract of service which was signed by each assessor clearly provides that the appointment is to a temporary unestablished non-pensionable position and that the appointment may be terminated at any time by either side in accordance with the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  For the people concerned this means one week's notice.  A notice of termination of employment on this basis will be issued within the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I regret very much that this <Col N="2244" /> decision has to be taken, I think Senators will appreciate that the Government have no choice in this matter.  It is a logical consequence of the decision to close down the farm classification office.  Once the farm tax goes there is obviously no point in continuing with the classification of land and, as soon as a number of transition problems have been resolved, all other activities associated with the farm classification office will cease.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with a couple of points Senator McDonald made.  He said these people were being dismissed by word of mouth.  The people involved will get letters notifying them of the termination of their employment in accordance with the terms of the contract.  This notification will issue at the beginning of next week.  The point that the farm classification office should be seen as a replacement for the Griffith evaluation is reasonable but the farm classification was designed for farm tax purposes only. Given the state of the public finances the Government could not justify retaining the classification office purely to provide a substitute for Griffith evaluation.</P>
    <P>On the question of more unemployment the Government are concerned about the problem.  Senators will agree that the thrust of the budget last Tuesday was to get control on public spending and to create the conditions and economic environment which will promote the area of industrial development thereby creating much needed jobs.  I fully appreciate the commitment and dedication displayed by these officials in the course of their work but I must point out that there is no question of a breach of faith with them.  The decision taken by the Government is unavoidable and the assessors were fully aware from the beginning that their employment was temporary and subject to termination at short notice.</P>
