      <P>I have notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to establish a National Technological University, consisting initially of two constituent colleges, the existing NIHE at Limerick and Dublin, but with the capacity in time to include other constituent colleges.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Health to ensure that funds supplied by his Department to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are used for the intended purposes.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to clarify the position regarding the future of Baggot Street Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ryan and Doyle as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ryan's motion and it will be taken from 8 o'clock to 8.30 p.m. or <Col N="328" /> earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senator Doyle may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Kennedy is not suitable for discussion on the ground that legislation would be necessary.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I would first like to ask the Leader of the House when he hopes to take the Committee Stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill; secondly, with regard to Item No. 35 on the Order Paper &mdash; an all-party motion dealing with the plight of the Jews in the Soviet Union &mdash; will he consider giving time to debate this in some special way next week because of the reports of the worsening position of Jews in the Soviet Union, much of which has been hidden behind the so-called policy of glasnost; and, thirdly, does he have any report for us on proposals to set up further committees as requested last week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that this House does not appear to be living entirely in cloud cuckooland, may I ask the Leader of the House not if but when he proposes to allow us Government time to discuss the extraordinary proposals which emanated yesterday from the Government which he supports and which will tend to devastate the less well off, the poor and the marginalised in our society in order to pacify the market place and the stock-broker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You can ask a question of the Leader of the House but you cannot make a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just coming to the question.  As I said, in order that we can explore Fianna Fáil's conversion to the stockmarkets, when will the Leader of <Col N="329" /> the House give us time to discuss Government economic policy in this House in an open-ended debate where we can discuss the issues that are now most relevant to the Irish people?  All the reforming legislation in the world will not get us away from the realities of what this Government are now doing.  I ask the Leader of the House to give us ample time to discuss these issues in detail and at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan in his request.  Senators are aware that this is a very different situation.  To continue our normal business as though we were not faced with very serious decisions in which this House should play its part would be to undermine some of the emphasis Senators have placed on the role of this House in recent months.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Ryan in asking the Leader of the House to set aside a day at least for a full debate on the proposals of the Government.  This House has a contribution to make and should be afforded an opportunity to make it.  I specifically ask that a Thursday be allocated, and the sooner the better, for a full debate.  It is extremely important. There are Members of this House who are specialists in particular areas.  There are six university Senators with a particular interest in education.  There are others with a substantial contribution to make.  It would make this House relevant if, either this week or next week, we set aside Thursday for a debate on the proposals in relation to the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being accused also of making a speech I would like to say I agree with Senator Manning.  The item he referred to, No. 35, is very pertinent just now and all sides of the House <Col N="330" /> would welcome an opportunity to set aside time to deal with that Private Members' Motion.  On the item raised by Senator Ryan.  I agree thoroughly with him and with Senator Robinson.  When estimates are published by the Government which indicate a figure of about £500 million to be taken out of the economy, it is appropriate that this House should have an opportunity which would not normally be given to us because we would be confined to the Appropriations Bill at the end of this year which refers to all expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to you, a Chathaoirligh, I am asking the Leader of the House a question and, if you will permit me to continue, it is relevant to the every day life of all of us and those we represent.  As public representatives in this House of the Oireachtas we should be given the facility to discuss a traumatic cutback of £500 million in public expenditure. The Leader of the House is sufficiently aware of the problems and I hope he will be forthcoming and generous about allocating special time.  We are prepared to sit to discuss this matter as we feel we do not have that facility at the moment.</P>

      <P>A question is one thing; the contribution you are now making is more than a question.  I appreciate how serious it is, as does everybody else in this House.  If Senator Lanigan does not answer you, then we will see.  In fairness, and I hope I am fair in this Chair, I do not think any of us is unaware of that has happened in recent hours or days.  I am trying to clear the Order of Business today, Senator O'Toole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If you say the Leader of the House is aware of the fact that he has done everything from upsetting the pupil: teacher ratio in every primary school in Ireland that may well be the case but I will wait for his reply and I will take your word on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Senator Manning's questions first.  It is intended that the Committee Stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill will be taken within the next three weeks.  I would not like to give a commitment that it will be taken next week.  I think it could be taken the week <Col N="332" /> after, but I will not give any further commitment than that.  On Item No. 35 there should not be any great difficulty in accommodating the House.  If the Whips get together we may be able to take it next week.  There is no possibility of taking it this week because time will not allow it.  It is a motion that deserves attention in the House.  On the question about further committees I have no additional information on further committees.  Further committees will be set up and as soon as I have information on them I will report back to the House.</P>
      <P>The other interventions that were made have nothing to do with the Order of Business.  I assure Senator O'Toole that I have not been asleep over the past number of hours.  I have as good a knowledge of what happened as he has and I understand the implications as well as he does.  I can guarantee to Senator O'Toole that everybody on this side of the House is as concerned about what happens to this country as he is.  However, I will not allow the House to be used by him to push any point which is not relevant to the Order of Business.  The Order of Business is as I have read it out.  The question of setting aside time to discuss what happened in the past 24 hours can be considered in the future when everybody has had a chance to read the Book of Estimates.  I do not think anybody in this House has gone into the implications of it fully and it may be be possible in the future to discuss what the Book of Estimates contains.  However it has to be said that this year's Book of Estimates is out at least three months in advance of the production of any other Book of Estimates. This gives everybody an opportunity to have a look at this Book of Estimates and see what is going to happen next year.  During the period of the previous Government the Book of Estimates was not produced until well into the New Year which did not give the Government of the day an opportunity to do properly what should have been done during the 12 months covered by the Book of Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying last week before the debate was adjourned, part of the legislation before us today emanated from a report of the Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism of which I was member.  During the course of the committee's meetings, especially <Col N="336" /> when customs officers were giving evidence, I became familiar with terms that were new to me at the time &mdash; greeters and meeters, swallowers and pushers. After a short time it became obvious to members of the committee that people who come into the country by aircraft or boat can, in a very professional way, pass on to someone who meets them the illegal drugs they are carrying.  Under existing legislation customs officers have not got the authority to search, detain or arrest the other person involved.  In fact, the customs officers' authority extends only to those who pass through the customs barrier.  The customs officers in their evidence before the committee stated that it will be necessary in order to strengthen their ability to apprehend drug pushers for power to search, detain and arrest to be extended to persons on the other side of the customs barrier.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill now gives that necessary power to customs officers.  It must have been very frustrating in the past for customs officers to see people breaking the law in this fashion and passing on drugs they were carrying to people they were not in a position to apprehend under the existing law.  Another problem which customs officers had to face was the recent trend among drug smugglers to conceal on or in the body drugs they were carrying.  These people are referred to as swallowers or stuffers and have created and continue to create serious problems for the Customs and Excise service. The committee stated in their report that the legality of the searching of such persons' bodies requires the fullest examination and the establishment of guide lines for officers involved.  Similarly the duration of such searching, presumably until the suspected concealed substance is discovered requires clarification.  Indeed, the committee were advised that it could take up to five to seven days in some cases for such concealed substances to pass through the body.  I regret to say that on some occasions it proves fatal for those people carrying such drugs in their bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was quite correct <Col N="337" /> when he drew the attention of the House to this matter and the anxiety it is causing to Customs and Excise officers.  The whole question in relation to the searching of people who are carrying drugs in their bodies requires clear guidelines.  I suggest that the Minister might consider bringing in regulations with this Bill to cover this aspect because what we have in the Bill is not very clear in relation to the question of carrying substances in the body, how long people should be detained and the method of detaining them etc.  As in other Bills, regulations would be very helpful and would give the necessary guidelines to the officials involved.</P>
    <P>The committee in their report were satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are very conscious of their role in controlling the supply of illegal drugs and that their senior staff are fully committed to their efforts to deal with the problem.  However, it appeared to the committee that no officers are assigned full time to this task.  The committee went on to consider the setting up of a small drugs unit within the customs service as an immediate and essential requirement. I am pleased to note from the Minister's speech that the committee's recommendations were implemented in 1985 and that five officers are now employed full time in such a unit on drug related work.  Every member of Customs and Excise engaged in the examination of passengers and goods at the point of entry to the State is given special training specifically in relation to drug smuggling and 70 per cent of all officers have that training.  From the huge increase in the level of drug seizures by customs officers which the Minister referred to in his speech it appears that this training is having a significant impact on the effectiveness of the customs service.</P>
    <P>The committee were also of the view that, if the customs service was to have a realistic chance of tackling successfully the drug smuggling problem, not alone must the necessary legislative changes be made but adequate resources must be provided.  One of the recommendations <Col N="338" /> of the committee was that sniffer dogs should be provided and would be a considerable asset to customs officers in detecting drugs.  When the committee made their report one dog had been in training for this work and I hope the number has been increased since.  In his reply the Minister might indicate how many sniffer dogs are now available to the Customs and Excise service.  The committee also recommended that adequate physical resources should be made available to customs officers to allow them to discharge their duties effectively. They pointed out the need for the provision of covered examination bays with pits, ramps and heights to enable the vehicles to be examined.  Also they suggested that X-ray and other specialised equipment should be made available to customs officers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the progress made and I am more than pleased that the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism have now found their way into legislation.  Like many other Senators I believe that, while there has been some success in the past in dealing with the drug problem, it is still a major problem in our society.  The Garda, customs officers and the public generally should exercise all the powers at their disposal to eradicate this problem from our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill which gives extra powers to Customs and Excise officers to tackle the problem of drug smuggling and which also gives them powers to detain and search without warrant and to arrest a person or persons found to be smuggling.  With regard to drugs and the smuggling of drugs into this country I want to say at the outset that drug pushers, dealers, smugglers and anyone connected with the selling of drugs in any shape or form must be looked upon as a very low, detestable inhuman type of person.  They must be looked upon by all decent law abiding people with a certain amount of hatred and anger.  Any mother or father who has a family growing up today has a great fear that, when those children grow up, <Col N="339" /> leave home and go to college or out into the world to work, regardless of a good upbringing they could get into wrong company and become drug addicts. Nearly all of the drug addicts I have seen interviewed on television or radio and, indeed, those interviewed by newspaper reporters, all started in a small way and eventually got hooked.  With help a small percentage will probably kick the habit but, generally speaking, the majority of people hooked on drugs die at an early age.  We must strengthen our laws to ensure, before it is too late, that drugs will be got rid of in this island.</P>
      <P>The drugs that make people drug addicts to the best of my knowledge are not manufactured or grown in this country. They come in from sources outside. It seems to me that over the past ten years the smuggling of drugs into the country has escalated.  Even giving these extra powers to our Customs and Excise officers together with the Garda Drug Squad, are we still at a big disadvantage in preventing the smuggling of drugs? There are only three ways drugs and, indeed, other goods can be brought into this country, that is, by air, sea or road. The Border separating us from the Six Counties is definitely well protected.  It is one of the best protected borders in the world in relation to manpower and cost. There is a 24 hour a day customs check on both sides, a Garda and Army presence to check every person, vehicle, bus or lorry passing through that frontier going North or coming South.  We must assume that it is almost impossible for large scale smuggling to happen on the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to our airports and landing ports.  If our assumptions are wrong it is time we pulled up our socks and rectified the problem.  We have a frontier which is well protected but it is my belief that the coastline from Donegal around to Louth is, to a certain extent, also a frontier.  Are there not hundreds of piers and harbours along that coastline which have no presence whatsoever of customs officers and are probably remote from Garda stations?  There are isolated piers in the back of the beyonds which <Col N="340" /> are frequented throughout the year by foreign fishing vessels and yachts.  Surely it stands to reason that people trying to smuggle in goods or drugs need not take the risk of crossing the Border, or coming by boat to our main ports, or by plane to our main airports where they know that security is rigid with the presence of customs officers, gardaí and security police.</P>
    <P>The bulk of drugs which are smuggled into this country must be coming through small ports and landing places that are not wholly protected.  There are certain rules, regulations and clearances required by any boat coming into these small ports in order to legalise their entry, but the smuggler pays little heed to rules and regulations.  A greater effort could and should be made at most of these landing points to ensure that smuggling does not occur.</P>
    <P>In my part of the county throughout the summer there was a great presence of holidaymakers coming from foreign countries in their yachts.  These people are most welcome to our town and country because generally speaking they are holidaymakers enjoying a good sail and coming to our country because they like it.  My hope is that many more of these people will come to Ireland but is it not possible that any one of these yachts coming from Europe or elsewhere to Dingle or other ports like Dingle around our coastline are landing without any proper check?  Is it not possible that these boats sail from their home country to a destination somewhere along our coast without any check either in their home port or in their port of landing here? During my 12 years as a harbour commissioner on the Dingle Harbour Board on two occasions only, to my knowledge, was there a request by telephone to us in advance to have customs officers waiting at the pier to clear two yachts and to legalise their entry.  I often wonder where all the rest of the yachts that frequent our coastline get customs clearance, if they get customs clearance at all.  This is a major loophole and some effort must be made to close it.</P>
    <P>There is also a large number of foreign fishing vessels fishing around our coast <Col N="341" /> and in the winter months they come into our bays and harbours for shelter.  They also come in to our waters and fish during the day or night.  They process and freeze their fish and then go back out to fish again.  This is not an uncommon sight.  In fact, I have photographs which I sent a couple of years ago to the then Minister for Fisheries of up to 100 boats varying in size from 100 ft. to 300 ft. anchored all together in Brandon Bay, Smerwick Harbour and Ventry Harbour.  The fishermen and sailors &mdash; the people in charge of these boats &mdash; come ashore possibly for refreshments and groceries etc. and there does not seem to be any proper check or even knowledge that they are there.  Surely there should be some check on these boats and on their crews when they come ashore.</P>
    <P>We have a very able Navy presence around our coast but their powers too are very limited.  I believe they do not have the power of arrest in the case of drug smuggling and they are powerless if they come across a drug smuggler unless a customs officer or a garda is present. Additional powers should be given in this area if what I say is correct.</P>
    <P>A large number of sailing yachts &mdash; forgive me, a Chathaoirligh, I am just bringing this up in a slightly different vein &mdash; often have their pet dog on board.  On one occasion in Dingle I challenged a yachtsman who was going up town for groceries.  I knew he was a foreigner and had come from a foreign country.  I challenged him about landing his dog on our soil.  Because we are a very small board each commissioner is issued with identity cards and each of us is authorised to deal with events like that if we are down at the pier which we nearly always are.  The yachtsman was very annoyed when I challenged him and told him to get his dog back into his boat or I would have to call the gardaí, which I did afterwards and was proved to be right.  The dog was an illegal imigrant, if you like.  So far this country is free from rabies but we must be ever vigilant because one pet dog infected by rabies coming off a boat or yacht belonging to a holidaymaker is all we <Col N="342" /> need for rabies to spread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In Kerry &mdash; and I am sure the same applies to other coastal counties &mdash; we have what is known as harbour constables. A harbour constable is appointed in every little pier by Kerry County Council. These people normally live within sight of the pier or the landing place. They are paid a small annual wage by the council and they carry out certain small duties &mdash; or are supposed to carry out certain small duties &mdash; such as ensuring that the pier is clear at all times and that there are no nets or pots to block somebody else using the pier, to ensure that there is a lifebuoy in place and that if there are lights on the pier they are lighting, and so on, and to check for any damage done to the pier.  If these harbour constables were given slightly better remuneration they could keep a daily log of all foreign boats that anchor, berth, or come into the pier in their jurisdiction. They should have the authority to check the papers of visiting foreign boats to ensure that they have got customs clearance. If such clearance is not available they should take the name, number and general description of that boat and immediately inform the nearest customs officer or garda.  This would go a long way towards at least keeping a check on the boat's movements and would also act as a deterrent to would-be smugglers.</P>
    <P>I agree with other speakers who mentioned small unpoliced airports and landing strips.  I am convinced that a better effort should be made.  There is no great difficulty in landing undetected in a number of these airstrips in remote parts of the country.  I cannot see the point of barricading our front door and leaving the back door wide open.  The illicit drink or poitín maker does not present the same threat as the drug smuggler because he is much more restricted.  He is manufacturing his brew within the confines of our country and the gardaí are ever vigilant in their spread throughout the country, even in many remote parts.  The poitín maker does not have the same chance of avoiding detection because in <Col N="343" /> rural Ireland everybody knows everybody else's business.  It would be almost an impossibility for the poitín maker to get away for a long time with his illicit business.  Generally over the years good control is kept over the situation.</P>
    <P>There is one group of people who should be far more vigilant, that is, the general public.  They should be far more forthcoming with information to the Garda regarding offers made to them by people trying to get rid of smuggled and stolen drink and goods.  The goods that are stolen and smuggled and the drink that is stolen and smuggled are being sold somewhere in this country.  The general public must have a good knowledge of where they come from and even possibly get offers to buy some of this stuff.  This is big business.  It stands to reason that the drink and the other goods are offloaded to publicans and shops at a reduced rate.  Better investigations should be carried out in bars and searches made regularly to find out who are the people who are buying this drink or other goods which they know are either smuggled or stolen.  If you stamp out the market automatically you will get rid of the illegal dealers.</P>
    <P>About two weeks ago on my way home I was amazed that from Newlands Cross for at least three miles on the left hand side of the road going out there were caravans with up to 20 to 30 televisions for sale on the side of the road.  There are a couple of remarks I would like to make about this.  First of all, where are these televisions and radios coming from? Secondly, these people, more than likely, are not paying VAT on these goods and they are not paying proper taxes on them. They were openly selling their wares on the side of the road for at least three miles.  If there was one thing on the side of the road there must have been a couple of thousand in all shapes and sizes: radios, audio equipment, everything else, and they had buyers.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum, under the heading Financial Implications, says that the proposals in the Bill will not involve the recruitment of additional staff <Col N="344" /> or give rise to additional expenditure. This will require additional staff.  If additional staff are recruited and additional finance made available the return to the country's finances would be tenfold.  I fully support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot but feel sympathy for the motivation which prompted Senator O'Toole to raise the matter which was discussed earlier on the Order of Business.  I hope the Leader of the House will bear in mind that Senators want to discuss the more important issues affecting the country at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I share the concern expressed in the House about the necessity for greater efficiency and greater strength in the legislation controlling the importation and dissemination or the pushing of drugs in this country.  I have decided to contribute to the debate on this measure because I am particularly concerned about the nature of the Bill for reasons I will explain.  The Bill, of course, as the Minister for Finance made clear when he introduced it, is identical to a Bill which had been tabled by the previous Government. Therefore, it is a measure which is supported, in effect, by the previous Administration and by this Administration. What concerns me is that it comes before this House as a Customs and Excise measure.  Its precise title, as the House will see is the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  It is brought before this House and conducted through it by the Minister for Finance and his Ministers of State.  If this Bill were to be entitled the Criminal Justice Bill and if it were the Minister for Justice who came into this House, there would be much closer attention to the small print of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my submission, it is necessary to look very closely at the small print of this measure because it proposes to broaden <Col N="347" /> very significantly the individuals, the personnel, who can exercise on behalf of the State very important powers: the power to arrest without warrant; the power to detain for a certain period in undisclosed places; the power to search; the power to apply for a search warrant; the power to enter premises forcibly, if necessary, to exercise those powers.  These are powers which hitherto we have considered should be placed under the direct authority of the Garda Síochána and, indeed, in placing them in the hands of and under the authority of the Garda Síochána we have been concerned, and I think properly concerned, to ensure that there are very strict controls over the exercise of those powers.</P>
    <P>Those controls are necessary both for the authority and responsibility of the gardaí concerned and for those against whom those powers will be exercised or directed.  It is fundamental to a democracy that there are very serious checks and balances in the exercise of any such powers.  This Bill comes before the Seanad without any public attention.  I would say there are very few people indeed who are aware that this Bill is being discussed in the Seanad at the moment.  There are very few people who are aware of the powers it is proposed to extend to public servants through this Bill.  Very little attention has been paid to the implications for civil liberties in this country and for proper standards in relation to arrest without warrant, detention, applications for search warrants, forcible entry, if necessary, into premises for the purposes of search.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear, I am not ambivalent or ambiguous on the need to control drugs.  I support in the strongest way the necessity for controlling and having adequate powers.  I am not satisfied about the need for this very broad extension of the kind of personnel who will be involved in exercising those powers.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply to the debate can explain why he feels it necessary to broaden the net in this way, but I certainly would require an explanation. At the moment I do not see the necessity <Col N="348" /> for the kind of blanket extension proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning to the precise text of the Bill, it is clear that it bears out the description I have been giving.  First, in section 1 there is a very broad definition of what will constitute an officer of Customs and Excise.  That can include a member of the Garda Síochána but it also extends to, and I quote:</P>
    <P>any person in the public service who is for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.</P>
    <P>It may be somebody who is a full time officer of the Customs and Excise or it may be somebody &mdash; and I think we will see this increasingly &mdash; diverted from some other Department, redeployed from one of the State boards that are being wiped out almost on a daily basis, or whatever.  Any person in the public service could potentially be a person exercising the kind of powers we are talking about under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Those powers are, as I say, very widespread. If we look at section 2 of the Bill we see that an officer of the Customs and Excise, as so defined, could be a Garda Síochána, an existing full time member of the Customs and Excise, or any other member of the public service for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  Under section 2 that person has powers of search in relation to controlled drugs.</P>
    <P>If we look at section 2 (1) (i) we see that that person can search an individual and, if he considers it necessary for that purpose, detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out the search.  What is &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; in relation to detaining for the purpose of the search?  I ask that question in all seriousness because the section itself talks about a number of different searches which can be carried out.  There can be a search of the person which is the search referred to in that paragraph. There can be searching of vehicles, vessels or aircraft.  There can also be the examination of other items.  What is the <Col N="349" /> reasonable period in which a person can be searched in this manner?  The real scope of it is that when members of the Garda under criminal justice legislation arrest and detain somebody, even under the most recent Criminal Justice Bill, there are very serious immediate consequences and very serious standards apply.  It is not at all clear that any of these standards would apply to a person detained for the purposes of section 2 of the Bill.  It is necessary for the Minister when responding to the Second Stage debate to give very full particulars of the way in which the power will be exercised.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Bill it is proposed that an officer of Customs and Excise, as so broadly defined, will have power to apply for a search warrant in relation to controlled drugs.  Again it is necessary to ask why it is felt to be appropriate and apparently desirable that it should be an officer of Customs and Excise who would have this power?  If the application for a search warrant is being made to a District Court or to a peace commissioner, time will have elapsed. This is not something that has to be done at the point of entry by an officer of Customs and Excise.  It is something that requires a second stage or a follow-up stage.  I am not against this second stage. Obviously, like any Member of the House I can envisage circumstances where it would be necessary to obtain a search warrant.  Why is it considered to be appropriate to extend the power to apply for the search warrant to the broadly defined public servant?  In section 3 (3) it is clear that the Garda may not be involved at all in this.  There may be several public servants coming to act on the search warrant and if necessary forcibly enter a person's house without any involvement at all of the Garda Síochána. Section 3 (3) provides:</P>
    <P>A search warrant issued under this section shall be expressed and operate to authorise a named officer of Customs and Excise, accompanied by such other officers of Customs and Excise and such other persons as may be necessary, at any time or times within <Col N="350" /> one month of the date of issue of the warrant, to enter (if need be by force) the premises or other land named or specified in the warrant...</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell the House why it is framed in such a way that it can exclude any involvement of the Garda. A month afterwards there might be a situation where officers of Customs and Excise are forcibly entering premises on foot of a search warrant without any involvement of the Garda.  It brings home just how broadly we are casting the net of powers to be used and potentially, therefore, powers which can encroach upon the civil liberties of citizens.  It is important that we understand the broad scope being given and that we ask questions as to why an officer of Customs and Excise would not at least have to have with him a member of the Garda Síochána. Why would he not be required to have with him a member of the Garda Síochána if he was intending a month later to forcibly enter the property of somebody?  Surely that would be an appropriate and necessary safeguard.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (4) provides:</P>
    <P>Where any premises or land is entered pursuant to a warrant issued under this section, the officer of Customs and Excise named in the warrant may do either or both of the following&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) arrest without warrant any person or persons found on such premises or land for the purpose of searching him or them,</P>
    <P>(b) so arrest any such person or persons and keep him or them as may be appropriate, under arrest until such time as such of the powers of search or examination as he wishes to exercise pursuant to the warrant have been exercised by him.</P>
    <P>Again without any necessary involvement of the Garda Síochána this officer of the Customs and Excise can arrest without warrant and can hold such a <Col N="351" /> person for an undefined time in the pursuit of that.</P>
    <P>One might ask, for example, if we are taking about a sufficient lapse of time to go to a justice of the peace, or a peace commissioner, for a search warrant.  Why not also require that a warrant be obtained for arrest?  Why extend an arrest without warrant power in the circumstances if it is not necessary that the Garda themselves be involved in this.  I particularise the kinds of powers that are envisaged here because I think it is extremely important that we are vigilant in this House, and hopefully in the other House and we do not allow legislation to slip through brought in by the Minister for Finance which would get a much more vigilant and strict scrutiny if it happened to be legislation introduced by the Minister for Justice.  There is a completely different approach.  It is not appropriate for Members of the Dáil or Seanad to say: &ldquo;Oh, well, we did not really notice; we did not really perceive.&rdquo;  We must be just as strict and just as demanding of the Minister when he replies to this debate as to why he feels it necessary to have these powers, to extend the scope of these powers and to do it in a very open ended way with a lack of definition.  Obviously that is something that can be looked at on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have two other relatively brief points to make on the Bill.  The first is in relation to section 12 where the Minister proposes to both confirm and extend power to make regulations specifying Customs and Excise controls which would apply generally to Customs and Excise.  This is not necessarily in any way related to the problem of drugs.  It is a broad section applying across the board.  I would like to ask the Minister when he is replying to the debate to confirm that the powers which are referred to here are compatible with our membership of the European Community?  I say that because it does seem that section 12 (2) (b) and (c) are very broadly cast.  Section 12 (2) (b) would allow the Minister by regulation to:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Prohibit the importation into or exportation from the State by land of all goods or any classes of goods except by such routes within the State or at such places on the Land Frontiers, and on such days and during such hours, as may be prescribed,</P>
    <P>That could be a quantitative measure, or measure having an equivalent effect.  It could be a restriction which would not be empowered under Articles 30 to 34 of the European Economic Community Treaty. Why does the Minister want to have power by regulation to regulate the place of entry, time and the days for particular types of goods?  It may be that there is every good reason for that but it seems to be very broadly cast as a power.  On the face of it it seems to be a power that would infringe the principles of the free movement of goods which are part of our obligations under the European Community.</P>
    <P>Under section 12 (2) (c) it is provided that the Minister can:</P>
    <P>Prescribe the places where, and the form and manner in which, the entry of goods imported into or to be exported from the State by land should be made and the duties and taxes on such goods shall be paid,</P>
    <P>If it was provided that goods could only be imported into the country through some obscure port where there was no good connection by land onwards, that would seem to be a quantitative restriction on imports such as would be challengeable under the European Community.  It is a very broad power.  It seems to empower the Minister to do that if he so chooses.  I would like an explanation of why that section is drafted as broadly as it is.</P>
    <P>The other section I wanted to comment on briefly is section 19 which is substituted for section 29 of the Finance Act, 1971.  It relates to persons who enter the State and do not declare what they bring with them.  Section 19 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Any person failing to declare any thing or to produce any baggage or thing as required by this section shall be liable to a penalty of three times <Col N="353" /> the value, including any duty or tax chargeable thereon, of the thing not declared or of the baggage or thing not produced, as the case may be, or £100, whichever is the greater; and any thing chargeable with any duty or tax which is found concealed or is not declared and any thing which is being taken into or out of the State contrary to any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force with respect thereto shall be liable to forfeiture.</P>
    <P>I want to query the wording of that because it seems to be a provision imposing a strict liability.  The provisions as to what an individual can bring into the country changed quite substantially over the years.  Whether it is an Irish person returning to the country or a visitor to the country, it is very often difficult to ascertain when coming into the country precisely what the personal allowance is.  Sometimes at Dublin Airport there is quite good literature available but at other ports of entry it is not so easy to ascertain exactly what the personal allowance is.  I simply ask whether it is intended that there should be a very strict liability &mdash; it seems to be implied by the wording &mdash; or whether the Minister accepts that the offence is committed where a person knowingly brings in goods of a value which exceeds the personal allowance.  If not, and if it is intended to impose and to continue a strict liability in that matter, more steps need to be taken at the ports of entry to make it perfectly clear what personal allowance a person can bring in. However, that is a detail in comparison to the importance of the other provisions.</P>
    <P>I propose to table amendments in relation to the sections on the powers to be exercised by officers of Customs and Excise but in the meantime I will await a fuller explanation from the Minister of why these powers are sought in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, the main purpose of which is to give additional powers to Customs and Excise officers which will enable them to tackle more effectively the problem of drug <Col N="354" /> smuggling.  The additional powers which are proposed in the Bill were recommended by the Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and they are basically similar to the powers which were conferred on the Garda under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984.  Officers of the Customs and Excise must, as the Minister said, be regarded as forming part of the first line of defence against the illegal importation of drugs.  Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that every possible way of strengthening the first line of defence should be considered.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that a five member full time drugs unit is already operating within the customs service. The establishment of such a unit was recommended by the committee and I welcome the fact that this recommendation has been implemented.</P>
      <P>I was also pleased to hear the Minister say that all members of the Customs and Excise service who are engaged in the examination of passengers and goods at entry points to the State are given special training specifically in relation to the detection of drug smuggling.  Together with other speakers I sincerely hope the the additional powers provided for in this Bill will result in an increased number of detections and seizures of illegally imported drugs.  Until such time as we succeed in curtailing the supply and availability of these substances, the incidence of abuse and addiction will continue to grow.  Apart from the tragedy of drug addiction for the individuals involved and for their families, I would be interested to know if any serious attempt has been made to quantify the cost to the State of drug related crime and the cost to the health service of dealing with the problem and the consequences of drug abuse in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as providing additional powers for Customs and Excise officers in relation to drug smuggling, the Bill makes a number of other amendments to existing Customs and Excise legislation.  Some of these amendments are of a very technical nature but some are of general interest.  For instance, the Bill provides for an increase in a number of penalties, <Col N="355" /> including the penalties for illicit distillation, and it also provides for a strengthening of the law in relation to smuggling generally.  As far as the increased penalties are concerned the only question to be asked is whether they have been increased to a level which will ensure they have an effective deterrent value.  I gathered from the Minister's statement that he will be proposing increases in some of the penalties on Committee Stage.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill to provide for some strengthening of the law in relation to smuggling generally are also to be welcomed.  As the Minister pointed out, smuggling damages local retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers and robs the Exchequer of vital revenue.  In recent years many businesses have suffered very severely and some have been forced to close down as a result of the extent of cross-Border traffic in certain commodities. Businesses involved in the electrical goods area have been particularly hard hit.  While the 48 hour restriction which was contained in the budget has had very beneficial effects for small businesses in the Border areas, the problem of commercial smuggling of certain goods is still widespread and is doing untold damage to the economy.  Any positive steps which can be taken to deal with this problem are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I conclude by echoing the reservation expressed by Senator Robinson on section 3 of the Bill.  The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the issue to, and execution by, an officer of Customs and Excise of a search warrant authorising him to search premises or land for controlled drugs which were illegally imported or intended to be illegally exported, or for documents relating to such drugs.  The section also empowers the officer who executes the search warrant to arrest any person found in the place being searched and to search that person.</P>
    <P>I can see cases where it would be desirable that customs officers would have such powers but I believe that such <Col N="356" /> powers should be exercised only by Customs and Excise officers in exceptional circumstances and, wherever possible, such officers should be accompanied by members of the Garda.  The powers laid down in that section should be exercised by members of the Garda.  If at all possible we should avoid involving customs officers in cases which could be dealt with by members of the Garda.  Those are the few points I wish to make on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am opposed to the powers in this Bill.  The views I am about to express are not necessarily the views of the Fine Gael Party.  I was delighted when the Garda got extra powers because the Garda and the Garda Drug Squad are the most dedicated body of men. They work round the clock every day. They have done a great job and are to be highly commended for it.  I am sorry I cannot say the same about the customs officers because the customs officers are an irresponsible body who should not get any more powers as they abuse the powers they have.  A few years ago for the first time ever the customs officers went on strike.  The Garda and the Army cannot go on strike but the customs officers went on strike.  We are told that to strike is the workers only weapon and in certain circumstances I would not be against strikes.  The Customs and Excise strike was so serious that they left the ports without any guard whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst feature was that they notified the media a week in advance of what days they would be on strike telling all and sundry that there would be no customs officers on duty.  Enough drugs could have been brought in while they were off duty to do this country for the rest of our lives.  They could have been stored and we could have had the biggest supply in the world.  I do not know whether or not they came in.  Many customs officers must be family men and they must realise that the drugs brought in could be used by their own children. How a body could be so irresponsible as to go on strike, thus opening the floodgates, and to indicate by way of public <Col N="357" /> advertisement on radio and in the newspapers that they would not be on duty on certain days for certain hours is beyond me completely.  To give those people any more powers would be ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I may be told that a similar Bill was brought in by a Fine Gael Government but it did not get through in our time.  If this Bill had been brought in while we were in power I would have had the same objections to it and I would have said the very same things.  There are a few things I cannot understand about it.  Under section 2 the customs officer is given the power to stop and search.  Customs officers have this power already.</P>
    <P>I was at an evening race meeting in Dundalk.  I went for a meal afterwards and stayed with some friends. I was on the main Dundalk-Dublin road at about 2 a.m. and it was by the grace of God that I did not kill two of those people.  They were out on the middle of the road waving a flashlight.  There was no sign saying: &ldquo;Prepare to stop&rdquo; and I could have killed them.  If I had killed them I do not think I could blame myself because the only notice I had was a flashlight about 100 yards away from where I was.  They told me they wanted to search my car.  They asked me where I was coming from.  I told them I was coming from Dundalk.  They said they had stopped a number of other people coming from the races who told them they had not made any money.  I told them I had not made any money either but that I had a few bookmakers' tickets as evidence. They then told me to open the boot of the car.  I did so and there was nothing in there.  They then told me to go on home. I know that a number of Members of the Oireachtas who were coming from a funeral in Monaghan were also stopped. They had to take their baggage out of the car so that it could be searched.  This is going on constantly.  I am not objecting to this because of the smuggling that is going on between the North and the South.  I am, however, objecting to people looking for powers which they have already or else these people are carrying out these searches illegally.  It is <Col N="358" /> one or the other.  To give these people extra powers is crazy.</P>
    <P>Like many other people I am against drugs in any shape or form.  There are things in the world which I like and things I dislike, things I love and things I hate but I despise drug pushers and drug dealers.  I do not think any penalty is hard enough for these people.  I would not like to say anything that would be of any help or encouragement to such people.  But I object to customs officers being given any extra powers or being put on a par with the Garda who are dedicated and devoted to their job.  The Drug Squad and all other members of the Garda Síochána are trained to exercise these powers.  As Senator Robinson said there could be deployment from other Departments in which case spare civil servants might be put in and given these powers.  It is a shame and I do not think they are entitled to extra personnel because they are already doing things they should not be doing.</P>
    <P>I know of a case in which a customs officer seized property without checking whether it was brought in through the ordinary channels or whether duty was paid on it.  When the owner of this property discovered through a note from the customs officer that his property had been taken in his absence, he telephoned the higher customs officer in Limerick.  He told him the date on which it was imported and gave him the numbers of the invoices and receipts.  He was told they would not be accepted over the telephone. The customs officer could have lifted another telephone and found out whether these were in order but he did not do so.  He had to get a photocopy of them.  He then informed the owner of the goods that he would have to collect them himself within the next few weeks or they would be sold.  If customs officers can engage in such activity without authority, if they do not check out what they are supposed to check and if they will not accept the evidence of the documents of their own Department over the telephone, I think we have too many customs officers.  Therefore, I am opposed to these people being given extra powers <Col N="359" /> because I believe they have too many powers already which they are abusing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that very much. My contribution will be brief.  I will start by taking this opportunity to relate the story of a trans-Border brush with the Customs and Excise.  About three or four months ago I was telephoned by a very distressed schoolmaster in the town of Ballymoney, a very responsible citizen who has a part time hobby of making safes.  You may very well think that the making of safes in Northern Ireland could be a risky business.  It may be a risky business in Northern Ireland but it is an even more risky business to happen to have one of the safes in which you have an interest sitting in the back of your car when you try to penetrate the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This unfortunate individual was telephoned on 24 August last year by the manager of a football side in Belfast and asked if he could obtain a special safe as the football club had been ransacked.  He said he would do his best.  He went to inspect the situation and found that an under floor safe would be suitable.  He understood that it was possible to get one in the town of Cookstown.  He set off with his wife intending to go to Cookstown and then go on to Monaghan to spend some time with an old friend who had recently suffered a stroke and with whom they spent a week nearly every year of the <Col N="361" /> summer holiday.  He saw this safe in Cookstown.  It did not have a lid but he said he would take the safe anyway and he paid £80 for it.  He noticed that on the side of the safe there was a label which said the value was either £185 or £158 &mdash; he cannot remember which &mdash; plus VAT had it had the lid attached.  Being a handy person and having spare lids he said he would put it in the back of the car and take it back to Ballymoney that night, fit it and take it to Belfast the following day. His wife asked him if he was wise to take it in the car going across the Border but he said there would be no problem because if he could not take it across he could leave it at the Border or, if they insisted, he could take it to a house nearby and leave it there.  He eventually arrived at the Border post near Midleton and a young customs official came out and asked him if he had anything to declare.  He said he did not wish to take anything into the Republic of Ireland which he was not permitted to take.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson alluded to the difficulty of knowing what is permissible and what is not permissible.  I do not think it is reasonable to expect an ordinary member of the public to have in his head the list of what should or should not be directly declared.  The safe was sitting in an open boot, painted blue which could be clearly seen from both sides of the car along with some tools he intended to use when he went back to install it the following day.  He got out of the car and the young customs official asked what it was and he said it was a safe and told him the story.  He said he would have to speak to the boss.  My friend thought that was reasonable.  He was then called in to see the boss.  The boss got out some papers, started writing into them and said: &ldquo;Your car and your safe have been seized&rdquo;. Blunt.  He thought this was a joke.  He said he had explained his situation to the young customs official.  He said he could leave it there and that he was prepared to put down a sum of money, if they wished, as a token of intent and he would collect it on the way back, that he could go back into the North and leave it in the house, or he could return to the North <Col N="362" /> straight away but that there was no question of it being smuggled.</P>
    <P>To cut a long story short the key was taken out of his car, the safe was lifted and he was told he would have to pay £80.  He produced his cheque book to pay the £80 as a good Northern citizen obeying the law although he felt fairly aggrieved, and he was told they would not accept his cheque as they wanted it in punts.  He then had to walk to a shop &mdash; and I thought it was a very funny side to the story that in a sweetie shop the punts were readily available for a Northern cheque &mdash; and he returned with his punts which he handed over.  That is the state of play at the minute.  That man went back to Cliftonville football club in Belfast and installed the safe and I have a letter from the manager of the club to say that was done.</P>
    <P>I had intended to raise this with the Customs and Excise.  I tried to get an appointment some weeks ago but it was difficult.  I am raising it now because I believe it exemplifies two things: one the importance of the discipline, training and approach of Customs and Excise officers but, more important at this very sensitive time, the way in which people travelling across the Border are going to be treated and understood.  I believe if that man had taken the case to law it would have been a difficult one for Customs and Excise to have sustained.  I say that to put it on the record.</P>
    <P>I have travelled across the Border, or what is called the frontier by some Unionist politicians, as often as anybody in this House and the standard of performance there varies enormously.  I do not think one can blame the individuals because the task is incredibly complex.  If you come via Dundalk you will invariably find a large number of cars and sometimes almost an equal number of lorries, and you will see one foreign customs official doing his best but &mdash; and this reflects on the training &mdash; not always giving the impression of an efficient, alert, disciplined service.  That is a personal impression and totally subjective.  On the other hand, the task is so vast for the individual that it would be very surprising, <Col N="363" /> indeed, if it could be faced on a cold morning in the rain with any great degree of enthusiasm.  Every now and then there is a sudden burst of enthusiasm and you are out of the car at the drop of a hat and the boot is being searched.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I was coming to Dublin with a little history of the north channel which connects Scotland and Northern Ireland to give to a few people or I had hoped even to sell to a few people.  As I approached the Border I thought &ldquo;Heavens, what is going to happen to my car, to the pamphlets in the boot and to my £80?&rdquo;  For once the man did stop me and asked if he could look in my boot and whether I had anything to declare.  I said no.  I opened the boot and I said: &ldquo;There are some booklets which I have written and which I will certainly not be selling in the Republic&rdquo;.  Nor did I.  I took them back to the North.  I offered him one and he took it and I hope it was a good read for him.  At present because of the way in which it is managed I do not think it is possible to have an efficient, sensitive service for the ordinary traveller.</P>
    <P>Now I will come to the main issue of the Bill.  Huge lorries come down that road.  They park on the main street because there is not enough room for them in the parking allotted.  How the people of Dundalk who live in those houses along the street where the customs offices are put up with those huge lorries daily, with all the noise associated with them, parked alongside their front gardens, I do not know.  The whole area of Customs and Excise needs a very sharp fresh look at.  It is in that context that you get a feeling that the task is almost beyond the capacity of the service.  I stand to be corrected on that; it is just an impression.</P>
    <P>Is it right that:</P>
    <P>Where any premises or land is entered pursuant to a warrant issued under this section the office of the Customs and Excise named in the warrant may do either or both of the following&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) arrest without warrant any <Col N="364" /> person or persons found on such premises or land for the purpose of searching him or them...</P>
    <P>I would ask what they mean by search because anybody smuggling drugs can have them in the most intimate part of their anatomy.  The question arises as to whether we have started a debate about where the fine line is to be drawn between violation and detection.  If you take violation as the penetration of one human being by another against his or her will I think you can understand the problem.  It goes on to say that that person can:</P>
    <P>so arrest any such person or persons and keep him or them as may be appropriate, under arrest until such time as such of the powers of search or examination as he wishes to exercise pursuant to the warrant have been exercised by him.</P>
    <P>First of all, if we are dealing with a serious drug problem and it involves a drug smuggling ring, what support does this unfortunate Customs and Excise officer have?  How fearful will that man be when he goes to knock on the door of a suspected drug running operation? Again this comes back to the question of the association of the customs officer and the gardaí.</P>
    <P>I am approaching it now from a different angle &mdash; the actual support and protection of the officer.  Senator Robinson and Senator Daly have already dealt with the need to protect the right of the individual but can one honestly believe in this day and age, when there has been so much organised crime associated with the drug problem, that customs officers in the context of this section will really feel confident about approaching people who are involved, perhaps, in international drug smuggling which brings me to my next point, the relationship between the Customs and Excise officer and the Garda.  If I were a trained member of the Garda Drug Squad I would feel somewhat aggrieved if there was another section of Irish society dibbling in the same area because it is a very specialised <Col N="365" /> area involved in understanding the motivation, the networks, the effects and the distinction between those who are organising the drug rackets and those who are peddling the drugs and the unfortunate people who have become dependent as users.</P>
    <P>Somebody paid tribute &mdash; and I would like to add to that tribute &mdash; to the Garda Drug Squad and the Drug Squad of the Royal Ulster Constabulary who have made enormous strides in understanding as well as in detection.  In a sense is there not a little bit of meddlesome interference implied in this by another section of the State service, namely, Customs and Excise doing their own independent thing in relation to these very important matters?</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the right to inspect under suspicion any books or documents found therein, that is, in someone's private dwelling, and to seize and carry away all or any such books or documents. Granted, it goes on to say &ldquo;reasonably believed&rdquo; but can I get an assurance from the Minister, when we use those terms in relation to the Customs and Excise, that the people are as well disciplined and as well informed and equipped, trained and educated in this matter as the Garda because, if not, it could be a monstrous intrusion into the freedom of the individual particularly in his own dwelling.  It is a very difficult area.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we are saying we are all committed to trying to detect drug smuggling and drug racketeering and to diminish the drug problem.  We cannot, to use the term, pussyfoot about it or quibble about the semantics and find that the drug smugglers are having a grand time as a result of our quibbling.  On the other hand we have to be very conscious of the rights of the individual and the freedom of the individual in a free society with all the risks that entails, the need to have our Customs and Excise officers highly trained, well equipped and doing a job which is appropriate to their training.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am not in a position to know whether this is, in effect, already the case and it may very well be so.  I <Col N="366" /> stand to be corrected but I think these are important questions to ask if only to allay our fears by having them responded to and finding that we were wrong in our assumptions.  It is necessary to hear from the Minister that we are wrong or, if we are not, what qualifications he makes in his response to the questions we posed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a very good starting point on this whole question, which is a difficult and complex one, of dealing with the onerous task of finding an effective deterrent against smuggling.  What worries me about the Bill, apart from some of the remarks made by Senator Robinson and Senator Robb, is the fact that we appear to be looking for a job to be done on the cheap. I say that having regard to the remark that there is no extra cost involved.  I cannot imagine how you can extend or heighten your activity and broaden it and, at the same time, not get into a cost factor.  I am a little bit worried about that.  On the one hand, we are giving the Customs and Excise officers some stronger powers and greater support and, at the same time, we are not providing the most vital ingredient of the lot, the extra resource in the shape of extra manpower. I wonder how the provisions of the Bill can be satisfied and be done on the cheap, and I doubt that they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill deals with the question of smuggling and much more than just drugs, it is quite understandable that most people should come to the point when dealing with the question of drug smuggling because we are talking about a million dollar business and, not only that, but a business that leaves behind thousands of ruined lives, serious medical problems such as pulmonary disorders, heart damage, brain damage and countless deaths.  Therefore, it is quite right that the widest possible scope must be given to those responsible for the detection and prevention of smuggling of all sorts but in particular of drug smuggling. Drug smuggling is aggravated in two ways, by the spin-off crime that arises out of the actual smuggling and the cost <Col N="367" /> factor on society as a result of that spin-off and it brings us into the area of whether we have sufficient regard to the question of AIDS.</P>
    <P>I say that in the sense that we are giving more powers to prevent smuggling of all shapes and sizes and at the same time we are not giving the facilities.  The whole concept should be prevention, or a deterrent to people smuggling drugs which lead to other crimes and which, in the ultimate, lead to an increase in AIDS etc.  The position of Customs and Excise officers must be supported.  I believe it would be rather difficult, as Senator Robinson pointed out, for people to go into certain areas to try to give effect to their warrant without a sufficient back-up service.  On the other hand, if they are to get Garda support and back-up and if they cannot get it immediately when they want to serve the warrant they could be left naked for want of support.</P>
    <P>The Bill is well intentioned and it is there to tackle the desperate task that the Customs and Excise people have in the prevention of smuggling.  The question of the heightening of the activities cannot be emphasised enough, and I am seriously concerned about the fact that no more money will be spent on it.  I know we are going through difficult times but there is a necessity for certain action.  I appreciate the difficulty the Minister is in but, measured against the saving factor in the prevention of spin-off crimes, etc. the mathematics are not right.  Consequently if the Bill is to be true to its word somebody will have to explain in a much more definite way how this extra activity can be undertaken on a wider scale.  At the same time we expect less than 700 men to take on this added responsibility and duty, not alone at the Border but also at the ports of Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Rosslare, etc, and at the airports. This is coupled with the other duties the Customs and Excise officers have to do, as was explained in the course of the debate.  They have to deal with the question of public health.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke about people bringing animals ashore, immigration and other <Col N="368" /> matters.  They have a very onerous job and the Bill attempts to get it done cheaply.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the civil rights of people with Customs and Excise officers taking on more of the role of the Garda.  I am in a dilemma about where the individual right ends and the collective right begins.  Consequently I am not too sure about that aspect of the Bill. I agree that there is a need for greater vigilance and that the powers of the Customs and Excise officers must be extended but because their powers are extended there should be a provision such as the one in the complaints against the Garda Bill where people can complain against the Customs and Excise officers. While we are protecting them and giving them more responsibilities, there is no provision in the Bill to ensure that their obligations to the individuals they deal with regarding search warrants, power of arrest, etc.; are carried out properly. There is a procedure to deal with gardaí who do not treat people correctly but there is no similar provision in this Bill to deal with Customs and Excise and this should be considered.</P>

      <P>It is bouncing off the back of my neck.  I noticed there was something coming in but I am not too concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though we are not just concerned with drug smuggling it is the aspect that does the greatest damage in the final analysis and, therefore, it is right that greater emphasis should be put on it, particularly having regard to the situations that develop in many inner city areas.  Drugs are destroying the lives of many young people from about the age of 15 to 24 years in the inner cities.  Therefore, we must conclude that greater powers must be given to the Customs and Excise officers.  Their role is preventive in the first instance.  We should do nothing to impede them but, at the same <Col N="369" /> time, there should be some supervisory activity that would ensure that their powers are exercised properly and that people have redress.  Customs and Excise Officers have an excellent record not just in the area of smuggling.  They make a very good contribution to keeping down the crime rate overall and curtailing the drug problem.  That is a major contribution. Having regard to cause and effect people will agree with that.</P>
    <P>I do not know much about other types of smuggling.  For example I am not sure how a milk lorry with four chambers in it can cross the Border to the North and come back with the four chambers full of petrol.  Somebody spoke about television sets being sold by travelling people along the side of the road.  What is the story there?  Can further equipment be supplied to the Customs and Excise officers so that they can detect whether a JCB is hiding seven or eight television sets or whether milk lorries that bring milk into the North come back full of petrol?  We are not only dealing with smuggling; we are also dealing with the loss of revenue due to the State through the evasion of VAT, and other taxation.</P>
    <P>The problems that concern me are outweighed by the overall content of the Bill.  It is a very good step in the right direction.  I say so having regard to the number of indictable offences in 1983 as distinct from 1979.  During that short period of time the number of offences grew from 64,000 to 102,303.  We are not talking in small numbers.  A major portion of indictable crime is connected to drug smuggling because drugs have to come in illegally.</P>
    <P>I do not know what can be done about the smaller ports along our coastline.  In wartime people were alert and awake.  I do not want any blood to flow but I went into Italy when it was occupied by the Germans.  I landed on an isolated part of the coast and left again within a few hours.  If it is possible to do that in wartime it must be possible for people to land anywhere along the Irish coast where there are no search lights beaming out and where people are not on their <Col N="370" /> toes.  We are not in a wartime situation. In fact, the only people who are at war nowadays are the politicans and, of course, the supermarkets.</P>
    <P>We should not overlook the role played by the RUC and the customs people on the other side of the Border.  They play a part in the prevention of smuggling and we have a spin-off effect from it.  I do not know how this Bill ties in with the powers of the Customs and Excise officers on the Northern side of the Border but it would be nice to know if they have the same powers as Customs and Excise officers here and are in harmony.</P>
    <P>We need these prevention barriers. The Bill presents me with some dilemmas but these are not in relation to tackling the problems of smuggling, evasion, etc., which will make a contribution towards the prevention of crime in general.  There may be some outcry from civil rights people about the extension of powers to the Customs and Excise officers into the area of the Garda.  So far the only people who seem to be kicking up a row are some Senators.  I am trying to balance that against the unquantifiable social cost that occurs through lack of resources to deal with the problem of drug smuggling, etc.</P>
    <P>I have no experience of dealing with swallowers and stuffers.  I am just copying somebody else's terms because I never heard them used before.  Could they be supervised correctly?  Do the present staff have the expertise necessary to supervise these people or would they need extra training?</P>
    <P>Another question comes into my mind in relation to the word &ldquo;vicinity&rdquo;.  I am concerned about the use of the word &ldquo;vicinity&rdquo; in the Bill.  What is the vicinity? For example, a lorry driver who works in Dublin might have some of his patch 20 miles away which could be described as the vicinity.  What is meant by the term vicinity in that instance?</P>
    <P>A worry which has been voiced in relation to the giving of extra powers to the Customs and Excise officers is that the Garda are a disciplined force and they know what reservations to exercise in certain situations but there is no way of <Col N="371" /> assessing whether or not the Customs and Excise officers would measure up to this task.  I am in a dilemma about this.  On the one hand I want the activities of smuggling curbed.  I want the State to be well protected and I want the Customs and Excise officers to be given greater strength.  However on the other hand I am concerned about the right of the individual. It is a question of where the individual right ends and the collective right begins.  I hope I will be able to overcome this dilemma.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Bill.  I listened to the Minister for Finance when he referred to the Customs and Excise officers and the Garda as the first line of defence.  This is an important area and one to which a public representative should give his total and maximum support.  It is a very difficult area to legislate for and it is difficult for parliamentarians to draft legislation because it has to be based on experience and the scene is changing every day.  It is a difficult area and one that is very important to the State.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to this Bill.  It seeks to stop or cut down drug trafficking as far as possible.  None of us should under-estimate the abilities of those who are hell bent on bringing drugs into the country.  Whether they bring the drugs in by air, sea or land, it is a fairly remunerative business.  People are prepared to take big risks and go to any lengths to import drugs.  After making a cool and calm assessment of the type of people who are involved in drug trafficking you wonder how drug trafficking and dealing in drugs can change an individual.  They become very hardened criminals.  It is very hard to draft laws and regulations to prevent people from importing drugs. The Government are doing their best to improve the legislation and I am sure this improved Bill will contain measures and give more powers to the Customs and Excise officers on the ground and those who are involved in drug detection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public have got to be aware of the dangers and the damage <Col N="372" /> which drugs can cause.  We have to support the Garda and the Customs and Excise officers totally because, if we do not, then they will not succeed.  I live near a customs post.  I have to cross customs barriers on two occasions before I arrive at this House.  Therefore I claim to have a good general knowledge of the present day methods of smuggling.  I am in touch with and making representations on behalf of people who have been apprehended on smuggling charges.  It is a vast area and if the general public do not support the Customs and Excise officers and the Garda, the success rate will be minimal.  They are dealing with people who are highly sophisticated, highly organised and who use radios to keep in contact with each other so that they can import drugs and other goods that are profitable.  If there is an announcement about restrictions or cutbacks on customs personnel many people know that Saturday or Sunday would be a good day to cross the Border.  I heard it said locally that if you want to take something across the Border it is best to wait until it starts to rain because the customs officers might not come out to search a vehicle.  All of these cunning measures have been tried out.  I am sure the Customs and Excise officers are very well aware of how difficult their task is.</P>
    <P>There are a few aspects of the new regulations which are important.  As I have already emphasised, the general public must support totally the Garda, the Drug Squad and the Customs and Excise officers in their efforts against smuggling.  This new Bill would give power to the Customs and Excise officers to use some discretion and make decisions on the ground.  I have a good deal of experience in dealing with people who have been caught taking a piece of carpet, a second hand range for their kitchen, or some other small household goods across the Border.  All too often I have found that if they had got a VAT receipt in the North, produced the VAT receipt and had it recorded, they could have reclaimed the VAT when they came into the South or else they could have paid the VAT here and reclaimed it <Col N="373" /> where they purchased the goods in Northern Ireland.  A large mumber of people who were involved in cases of this kind did not want to get wound up in the difficulties and the red tape of filling out forms and going about things in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>There are a number of these cases and I hope we can find the machinery to deal with them rather than going through the channel of submitting reports to the Revenue Commissioners, making representations and writing reports.  This would take much time at senior personnel level and cost more than the financial amount involved.  I suggest to the Minister that he should examine the possibility of setting up a structure to deal with the amateur, if I can term him as such. Perhaps it will be hard to get the message across that there are a number of amateurs these days.  There should be a separate method for dealing with them. There should be machinery to settle genuine cases.  For example, a farmer who brings in parts for his tractor, a tyre for his car, or something that can be seen should be dealt with on the spot.  As far as possible the necessary machinery should be set up to have on-the-spot fines and to resolve those types of cases without having to resort to months of correspondence and a very substantial input by senior people in the Revenue Commission.</P>
    <P>We have a reasonably good standard of personnel in Customs and Excise.  I have travelled by car in most European countries, from Germany to Holland, and I believe the standard of detection here is reasonably good.  The latest initiative by the Minister for Finance and the Government to restrict the wholesale importation of goods has been welcomed by those who are in business in the Border counties.  This has been a very successful measure.  I trust the Minister will encourage the Customs and Excise officers to continue to support those who are finding it difficult to stay in business in Border counties.  I trust that the Minister will continue to encourage the Customs and Excise officers to be vigilant on the <Col N="374" /> ground because if they are they will save jobs and small businesses.  If those measures had not been taken a large number of small businesses would have had to close down.</P>
    <P>There was a difference in the price of petrol between the North and the South. It was a source of encouragement for people within 25 miles of the Border to get into their cars, drive North and fill up with petrol because they could save £10. Many housewives went into the North to buy goods such as biscuits and washing powder because they were cheaper. However, they would finish up buying other goods such as school bags and hardware. When they came back home and added up the bill they found there was no substantial saving at all.  This was brought home by the implementation of stricter laws by the Revenue Commissioners.  I hope that vigilance will continue because it will help many people along the Border to stay in business.  The encouragement that has been offered to these people by the implementation of these laws has had a very marked effect on their determination to compete with businesses in the North.  I take this opportunity to welcome that initiative and the effort to protect those in business along the Border.</P>
    <P>It is difficult these days to have machinery to control the Border.  There is a very large land frontier and there are many mountainous areas along the Border.  The authorities in the North blame the security forces here for not co-operating and taking an interest in apprehending or catching those who are responsible for acts of violence in the North.  Those of us who know the terrain along the Border realise that the Border is an unnatural one and plays havoc with our security.  It is very hard to police, whether against the paramilitaries or the importation of drugs or other goods.  It is a very difficult area in which to implement the law.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on taking the initiative to introduce improvements. Our Customs and Excise officers will respond to these improvements.  They are already doing a good job and this Bill will be an encouragement to them.  If we are lacking in our support for the Customs <Col N="375" /> and Excise officers, the battle will be lost. The Bill is timely and I trust that the measures will be improved from time to time because circumstances can change. Every time you defeat a smuggler or drug trafficker he will take another route or change his method of smuggling.  I hope this measure will help to stop and restrict the trafficking that is going on at present. However, it will have to be reviewed fairly often if we are to succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to apologise for not being here earlier for the debate.  I was at a committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Much can be contained in a fairly innocuous title.  Nobody would disagree with the objective behind the powers being given to customs officers, particularly in the area of search and arrest. There can be few more repulsive things in a society than the supply of addictive and life threatening drugs to people and, in particular, the supply of addictive and life threatening drugs to young people. That has been said so often that it is almost a cliché.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of things need to be said. As one who has something of a reputation of being a critic of the Garda, I believe we should compliment them on their successes in this area.  I think of the operations of the Drug Squad in Dublin because, in truth, I know more about that than I do about the Drug Squad in Cork which may be a compliment to their efficiency or may be a reflection of my lack of awareness of what they do.  I know their extraordinary effectiveness in dealing with the purveyors of drugs on a large scale and I know &mdash; I hasten to add, not through direct personal experience, but through contacts I have had &mdash; their capacity to be sensitive and sensible in dealing with young people with whom they come in contact who may have been experimenting with the less harmful forms of drugs and their obvious willingness not to put a young person's entire life and career at risk by imposing the full rigours of the law on them.  The combination of efficiency, severity and expertise where required with a good deal <Col N="376" /> of common sense in dealing with individual young people has developed a very good and successful record.</P>
    <P>It was distressing in recent years to hear allegations that the capacity of the Drug Squad and of the special units associated with it to operate it was being restricted.  This legislation and other legislation that has as its purpose the ending of the scourge of drugs and drug abuse can only be as effective as the resources that are available to enforce the law.  Otherwise we end up with the law being made to look ridiculous, or, worse still, perhaps with over stretched personnel having to enforce the law in a very patchy way and perhaps being tempted, understandably, to cut corners because of the lack of support, resources and assistance.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we are to deal with a problem such as the misuse of substances &mdash; we will call them drugs for the want of a better word &mdash; we also have an obligation to create a society and a culture in which the climate, attitudes, values and the life experiences of people do not leave them open to being misled in this way.  There is not much in evidence in the consensus view about how Irish society will develop in the next two or three years that would lead one to be optimistic in that regard.  There is ample evidence that we are going to create a youth sub-culture of idleness, poor educational opportunities, poor training opportunities, poor employment opportunities and poor income, whose view of their future, whose view of the worth-whileness of their existence, whose view of the role they might have to play in Irish society will be overwhelmingly negative.  If people have no incentive and no belief in their value in society no amount of preventive legislation, however well intentioned, no amount of increased powers will prevent them doing things they want to do because of a sense of hopelessness and despair.</P>
    <P>A problem such as drug abuse cannot be dealt with simply by dealing with the suppliers.  I hasten to add that I fully support severe penalties for people who <Col N="377" /> are involved in the sale and supply of drugs.  I have a view that the problem with prison in our society is that most of the people who go to prison for crimes come from a background where going to prison is no great disgrace.  Most of the people who do not go to prison for crime are the people who should go to prison because they come from a background where going to prison would be a disgrace. Effectively we lock up the wrong kind of criminals and let the other kind of criminals go free.  The drug barons who are wealthy and who enjoy extremely pleasant facilities and lifestyles are the sort of people for whom prison and the possibility of a long prison sentence will be a major deterrent because they have something to lose.  Large numbers of the people we lock up in our prisons have nothing to lose in our society.  The high rate of recidivism in Ireland suggests that they do not find prison any deterrent. The evidence is there if anyone wants to confront it.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; and it was a recommendation of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism in the other House &mdash; that, if the court can reasonably adduce that the assets of a person convicted of drug sales were accumulated largely or in great part through the sale of drugs, those assets should be forfeit.  If our Constitution makes that difficult we should change the Constitution.  Illegally acquired assets, whether they be acquired through tax fiddles or through drug sales, should not be able to be retained simply because we have developed a cocoon of constitutional protections around the right of and the right to private property.</P>
    <P>Any law enforcement alone approach to the problem of misuse of drugs which is not linked into a programme of education, support and recreation for at risk groups will at best only reduce the incidence of abuse and at worst may be ineffectual. What we have got to do is create a society where the feeling and the perception of young people is that there are better things to do in our society, more worthwhile things to do and a more worthwhile future available to them than <Col N="378" /> that which is offered by the mindless use of drugs.  In our fulminations, and quite rightly so, about drugs we fail to address the question of why otherwise very often people like ourselves, from backgrounds like our own, people who are literate, intelligent, very much aware of what happens in the world, take the risks involved in the misuse and, in particular, the serious misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is good enough simply to say there are those nasty drug barons out there, although that is part of it.  I do not think it is good enough to condemn people as somehow depraved because they take drugs.  I do not think it is good enough to end it simply in a kind of a judgmental way.  One area of drug abuse with which we are all familiar is the abuse of alcohol.  To call alcohol a drug creates a certain sense of misgiving amongst people because there is a feeling that somehow it is different.  It is another chemical which people take to stimulate themselves and which is capable both of abuse and serious damage and even of inducing death.  It is, therefore, a socially acceptable drug.  We know there are very complex reasons why people become addicted to alcohol.</P>
    <P>It is strange that we tend to understand perfectly well the problems of a person who is addicted to alcohol.  We understand often as a society in a very generous way the misuse of cars by people who have too much alcohol taken.  We understand and the Judiciary and the courts tend to understand fairly well this sort of thing.  The minimum penalty is usually the one that is imposed.  We do not understand the reasons somebody ends up taking heroin, for instance.  When you know that heroin abuse is an almost certain route to decay and to death and is probably now also a certain route to AIDS, you have to ask yourself: what we are doing with our society that we are creating people who have such a sense of hopelessness?  I do not think any of us has yet appreciated what sort of a society we are beginning to create.  In terms of fundamental values &mdash; and many of those are now under threat; the fundamental values I am talking about, I hasten to add, <Col N="379" /> are not the fundamental values certain religious organisations have talked a lot about in recent time &mdash; the assumptions about what is worthwhile in our society are being challenged.  I say that not because I disapprove of tightening up the law in the area of drugs but because I disapprove of pretences that the law on its own and the enforcement of the law can deal with a problem that is rooted more in the changes in attitudes, priorities and perceptions by people of their position in society.</P>
    <P>On the question of drugs in our society and the law, there has been too much of a kind of illiberal fulmination about the concerned parents.  I regret, in particular, the fact that the relatively small role that a particular not very nice political party had in the work of the concerned parents group has been too easy an excuse to be used by people to condemn the concerned parents group.  The concerned parents group have achieved some of their own purposes in a remarkably restrained way.  I could give no guarantee that I would be as restrained as they are if I knew who had supplied drugs to one of my children.  I could give no guarantee on that.  I am both publicly and privately a Christian and I would hope therefore that the response I would have would be that of a Christian.  I know how I would feel.  I think, therefore, that while they may have acted in ways that would not be entirely consistent with the law the Sinn Féin association has been too easy an excuse for many of us, particularly in politics, to condemn all of their activities.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Bill, I have to say that giving anybody the power to arrest another person is a very risky area of law.  Giving people that power who do not have the training the Garda Síochána have seems to me to be an additional risk. Giving people that power without the controls, without the regulations, without all of the things that are now stitched together in the case of the Garda Síochána seems to me to require both considerable justification and elaboration.  I am unhappy with a definition of an officer of the Customs and Excise which includes <Col N="380" /> any person in the public service who is for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  It seems to me to be an extraordinarily broad definition, a definition of convenience I would say, which does not require the sort of precision proper legislation ought to contain. I am unhappy in particular not just with the power of arrest and search but with section 3(4) (b) where it is stated:</P>
    <P>That an officer of Customs and Excise named in the warrant may:</P>
    <P>so arrest any such person or persons and keep him or them as may be appropriate, under arrest until such time as such of the powers of search or examination as he wishes to exercise pursuant to the warrant have been exercised by him.</P>
    <P>Until such time as the powers have been exercised; not even until such reasonable time as the powers have been exercised, or until such time as it might be practicable to exercise the powers, but simply until such time as such of the powers as he wishes to exercise pursuant to the warrant have been exercised by him.  We sat here and went through the Criminal Justice Bill, as it was then, now the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, line by line with a Minister who was both resolute and reasonable.</P>

      <P>The nub of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and the reason many <Col N="381" /> of us resisted it was not that there was any new power of arrest in that Act, because there is not, but that subsequent to arrest the gardaí under clearly described circumstances were to be allowed to detain people for questioning, among other things, in a particular place in what were meant to be controlled circumstances. So great was the concern and the controversy about the Gardaí being given those powers that the then Minister for Justice, at the instigation among others of the then major Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, agreed not to implement it and wrote into the legislation ultimately a proviso that the controversial sections of that Act could not be implemented until both a Garda Complaints body had been set up and regulations for the welfare of persons in custody had been brought before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That did not satisfy me because, as you know, I am not easily satisfied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We did all of that to circumscribe the powers of that agency of the State which we regard as traditionally having the power to arrest people, the Garda Síochána. They are trained.  We talked at the time when you, amongst other people, a Chathaoirligh, said one of the problems was that the Garda were poorly trained. The Walsh commission accepted that the gardaí were inadequately trained for the job they had to do.  We accepted that much of the accommodation was inadequate. We also accepted that many other things were wrong and needed to <Col N="382" /> be put right.  Powers are now being given &mdash; and I particularly identified section 3 (4) (b) &mdash; which are almost of limitless latitude.  I know the courts of this country will not allow that to be operated within this latitude.  If an officer of Customs and Excise were seriously to abuse that power and the person were to pursue it through the courts, the courts would quickly circumscribe that by what they would regard as reasonable interpretations.  Our courts, by and large, have a very good record in the area of draconian powers being given by the State to any of the agencies of the State.</P>
    <P>This was evidenced during the famous state of emergency declarations in the seventies when the Supreme Court wrote in a series of conditions which would, incidentally, have made the British Prevention of Terrorism Act &mdash; if they were implemented in Britain &mdash; a far different piece of legislation because of the rights a detained suspect was supposed to have and which, I am quite certain, the Supreme Court would also find if that clause remains as it is.  That is not the issue.  The issue is not that perhaps the Supreme Court will interpret this but that a power like that should not be conveyed on somebody because it happens to be convenient.</P>
    <P>No matter what the objective is &mdash; and the objective is admirable and right &mdash; to give somebody a power who is first untrained, who is secondly not necessarily a full time official of Customs and Excise &mdash; because the definition does not mean the person is a career grade person in Customs and Excise; it is any person who for the time being is employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods &mdash; could incidentally involve members of the armed forces.  I do not know whether it could or could not but it seems to me as it stands that it could as it is so loosely worded. Part of the problem is that this Bill is being handled not by the Department of Justice but by another Department and perhaps the same critical scrutiny that provisions from the Department of Justice would be subjected to have not been applied in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> I appeal to the Minister to think again about these powers.  As to what should be done, the only power customs officers ought to have should be to detain a person until such time as it could be reasonably expected a member of the Garda could be brought to deal with the person.  The principle ought to be that arrest and detention, where permissible in our society, ought to be a power of the Garda only.  It is a fact that the armed forces are not allowed to arrest people. The power of arrest, in many areas, is reserved for the Garda.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about people in the vicinity of any port, airport or land frontier.  One of the things that is true about a port, airport or land frontier is that for security reasons, at present, there will almost invariably be a Garda presence in the vicinity also.  In any area where there is any major activity by the Customs and Excise there will be a Garda presence.  Therefore, it seems to me that the maximum needed should be the right to detain a person and insist that that person remain in a position until such time as a member of the Garda Síochána can be called.  He would then have to have reasonable suspicion as outlined here and then ought to have the power to arrest.  Then, under the Criminal Justice Act as we understand it, the person would be liable to be detained for a period of six hours and for another period of six hours as required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to me to be reasonable, practical and consistent with the objectives of this legislation.  I confidently suggest that if this legislation goes through as it stands it will have considerable difficulties in the Supreme Court.  I cannot see our Supreme Court &mdash; given their history and their record &mdash; extending powers of arrest and detention to a body like the Customs and Excise without heavily circumscribing that power with a series of rights for the defendant which could well undermine the objectives of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be contained in some <Col N="384" /> previous legislation, there is no reference in this to the age of a person who could be arrested or detained.  It may be contained somewhere else in customs legislation in which case I will be happy to be corrected but, as I see it here, there is no reference to age of any kind and I have no doubt that children could be used and perhaps have been used in the importation of drugs but because children are used does not necessarily mean that we have any right to pretend they are not children.  If children are intended, special provision for children ought to be written into this Bill.  If children are not intended, that should be written into it as well.</P>
    <P>By children I do not just mean people under 16 years.  It must be remembered that, under the criminal law of this land, anybody over the age of seven is liable to criminal prosecution.  What we could have here is a well intentioned customs officer &mdash; I will add that presumption for the time being though we might talk about it in a second &mdash; suspecting that a parent was using a child to bring in drugs or to hide drugs and deciding to exercise these powers.  I know people who have a stronger law and order bent than I would say: &ldquo;Do you want kids to be used to import drugs?&rdquo;  I do not want kids to be used to import drugs but neither do I want kids to be abused by the State. Children are children and the fact that an adult misuses them will not justify another adult from the State side misusing them.</P>
    <P>Children are children and they have rights.  The first right they have is to be treated with the sensitivity a child deserves whether or not that child shows all the characteristics of a sensitive child. In this context some children can be tough, hard and experienced but they are still children.  There is a duty on us as a society to recognise that fact.  Children are children irrespective of what they do. If we give up on the prospect of liberating children from crime we have given up on the sort of values we have as a society.  I find it very difficult, therefore, to understand why no reference to children is made unless there is provision elsewhere <Col N="385" /> to exclude children from this legislation. I very much doubt that there is.</P>
    <P>The other reservation I have is that, having complimented the Garda Síochána in the past, there is not an unblemished record in the area of the use of powers of search, arrest and detention. There is a motion in my name and in the names of five other Independent Senators about the use&mdash;to be charitable about it&mdash; of the Offences Against the State Act. The numbers of persons arrested under that Act increased almost by a factor of ten in the past 15 years, but the proportion of the people arrested actually charged with an offence dropped quite dramatically from about 80 per cent to about 10 per cent in the same period.  I do not understand how in 1972 &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; meant an 80 per cent chance of prosecution and in 1987 &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; means a 10 per cent chance of prosecution.  That seems to be a very elastic definition of &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is also true that arrest and detention under the Offences Against the State Act can be a convenient way of finding out something about offences which are not covered by the Offences Against the State Act at all but which may be facilitated by arrest and detention under that Act.  One would wonder, therefore, if customs officers who have a suspicion that contraband, other than illegal drugs, was being imported or an attempt being made to export it, might be tempted, being human beings, to use these provisions to enable them to be more efficient in other areas.  After all, if you say you suspect somebody of importing drugs and then search them and find they have other items in their possession, nobody is going to quibble any more about it.  Regrettably, in my view, in recent times the Supreme Court ruled that the Offences Against the State Act can be used in a fairly liberally interpreted way precisely to meet that objective.</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep the House for an unnecessarily long time.  The objective of restricting access to drugs is, of course, <Col N="386" /> one we all share.  The facts are that, as we create what is becoming an increasingly unfair and unequal society, those at the bottom with despair and no hope are increasingly going to move beyond the sort of values the rest of us subscribe to. The evidence is there already and will continue to become visible to us.  In that context extra powers are not necessarily a solution.  Even if they were, there are so many uncertainties, so many risks and so many areas of abuse that the sections of this Bill dealing with powers of arrest and detention ought to be severely and seriously re-thought out and re-written. In particular I ask the Minister to make it clear whether children are excluded from this legislation and by children I mean people under the age of 16 years. I am interested in the age group between seven and 16.  Children under seven cannot be prosecuted and, therefore, cannot be suspected of a criminal offence.  But between seven and 16 is a large spectrum of ages and of children.  I do not think we as a society can justify giving anybody the power to detain a child under the wording of that section until such time as such of the powers of search or examination as he wishes to exercise have been exercised by him. That is an unacceptable way to treat anybody. It is a particularly unacceptable way to treat children.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing amendments to have that section of this Bill re-written in a way that protects the rights of the citizen adequately while, at the same time, continues to attempt to protect our society from drugs.  I hope the Minister will also look at the powers that he as Minister for Finance needs to deal with people who have acquired large amounts of wealth because of their dealing in drugs.  If it turns out that the Constitution is an obstacle to the seizure of those goods, the Constitution should be amended.  This is a matter to which the Government might address themselves also.</P>
    <P>The Bill is well intentioned but it needs extremely careful line by line scrutiny in this area.  I look forward to doing that on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Senators for your indulgence during my absence in the Dáil.  First, I would like sincerely to express my thanks to those Senators who contributed to this Second Stage debate.  I found all of the contributions helpful and I was gratified by the general welcome which was extended to the Bill.  The criticism voiced by individual Senators was clearly offered in a constructive spirit and, while avoiding the level of detail which we will undoubtedly encounter on Committee Stage, I would like to take this opportunity to reply to a number of the points raised.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators including Senator Loughrey, Senator O'Toole, Senator Bulbulia, Senator Robinson and others expressed concern about the possible abuse of the new powers of search by customs officers in relation to drugs as set out in section 2 of the Bill and the threat that these powers might constitute to civil liberties.  In response I would like to make one point very clear.  The availability of powers of arrest and search to the customs service will not be a new departure.  The customs service have had powers to arrest and search travellers for more than a century.  The chief purpose of this section is to deal with a gap in existing legislation whereby persons who are not themselves but are termed meeters or greeters cannot be searched by a customs officer.  Such people are the first and often the weakest link in the chain of drug distribution and so it is vital that the customs service should be empowered to detain and search them.  It is always necessary to ensure a proper balance between the freedom of the individual and the duty of the community to protect itself.  This is done in section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the liability to search here provided for is one which any concerned citizen will be prepared to accept weighed against the havoc which drugs can wreak in the community.  I do not think these powers will be abused by the customs service.  On the contrary, I strongly believe that customs officers are viewed by the community as doing a difficult job with courtesy and efficiency.  Of course, <Col N="388" /> a number of people will say they have been abused and unnecessarily delayed, checked and so on, and of course we get many complaints like that.  I think that in general it has to be said that the Garda and customs officers do a very difficult job with courtesy and efficiency.  In support of this view I cite in evidence the report of the Ombudsman for 1986 from which it is apparent that, from a total of 2,434 complaints against the Civil Service fully dealt with in 1986, only six related to the customs service.  I am informed that none of these complaints related to abuse of powers.</P>
    <P>In response to a number of queries from Senators I should like to offer further clarification on what the exercise of the powers proposed in section 2 will entail.  First, normal life on the Border will not be affected.  The powers of search here sought already exist in respect of travellers.  Secondly, the nature of searches at present administered to travellers suspected of smuggling drugs or goods will not be altered in the application of section 2.  It is not proposed to use X-ray machines to search a person and, indeed, I would not advocate the assignment of compulsory powers of X-ray search of the person to any enforcement agency of the State.  In the normal course searches will be carried out by customs officers under the guidelines established by the Revenue Commissioners.  On a point made by Senator Lanigan that the search of persons for drugs entering rather than leaving ports or airports should be provided for, I can confirm that section 2 provides such powers and it is intended that, upon enactment, they will be used in the manner envisaged by the Senator.</P>
    <P>It is important that we are able to deny the use of our country as a staging post to international drug traffickers and so suspected exporters of controlled drugs or their associates will be liable to search. These are matters that can be dealt with more fully on Committee Stage.  The issue of penalties for drug smuggling was raised and I would like to say that the penalties for drug smuggling <i>per se</i> are not set out in the present Bill.  They are set out in the Misuse of Drugs Acts, <Col N="389" /> 1977-84.  Section 7 of the 1984 Act deals specifically with the importation for sale or use of controlled drugs and prescribes penalties in relation to such importation ranging from £300 to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In more general terms I am grateful for the acceptance by the House of the terms of the Bill and my proposal to increase certain of the penalties set out in the present text.  It is entirely understandable that the debate should have focused on the proposed new powers in relation to drug smuggling.  Reference by Senators to other measures in the Bill were also helpful and constructive.  These measures are designed in the main to strengthen the hand of the customs service in relation to smuggling generally, to clarify or remedy possible defects in existing customs and excise legislation, to apply customs and excise controls to oil found onshore or to goods generally produced on the Continental Shelf and to increase the level of penalties for certain offences under existing customs and excise law.</P>
    <P>As the House has recognised, these are also worthwhile and necessary new measures.  I do not expect that these new powers will place an undue or insupportable burden on the existing resources of the Revenue Commissioners.  In the present financial climate all State agencies must face up to the need to become more cost-effective.  The days are gone when fresh resources could be allocated without hesitation.  The Government are confident that the powers contained in this Bill will be exercised by the Customs and Excise service with courtesy, efficiency and application and without any risk or threat to the civil liberties of the community.</P>
    <P>Further points were raised on the clarification of section 12 by Senator Robinson. The purpose of this section is to put on a firm legal footing the existing land frontier regulations.  These provisions are not in breach of our European Community Treaty obligation but merely serve to remedy a possible technical defect in the legal basis for the regulations. The Senator also raised questions on section 19.  This section is intended <Col N="390" /> to lay an obligation on any traveller to declare to customs prohibited or restricted goods identical to the obligation which already exists in respect of dutiable or taxable goods in excess of the existing traveller's allowance, no more and no less than that.</P>
    <P>There were references by a number of Senators to the question of the training and equipment of customs officers, particularly in relation to drugs.  The drugs unit of the customs service receives intensive training, but every customs officer undergoes a period of training which includes training in respect of drugs.  Periodic refresher courses are run for selected officers and customs officers already have a variety of equipment to enable them to discharge their functions. The quantity and quality of this equipment is under constant review and I am happy with the Revenue Commissioners' use of the available resources.  I should like to conclude the Second Stage debate by thanking the Cathaoirleach and Senators for their concerned, informed and helpful contributions which I have listened to and read with great interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with some sections of the Bill, but I would like to make inquiries on other sections. Section 40 provides that an insurance broker must keep a separate bank account.  It seems to be idealistic to keep a separate client account.  If an insurance broker keeps a separate client bank <Col N="391" /> account is he entitled to take out money for overheads, to pay staff, or can the money be touched?  If the money cannot be touched except in dealings with an insurer, it is an interference in the running of a business.  It is a good idea, but it may not work realistically.  Section 41 deals with insurance agent's qualifications. I agree with this but I would also like to see added to it the same requirements for recognition of insurance brokers contained in the Third Schedule. It is important that agents should be covered by the same principles basically as the insurance broker.  Section 41 seems quite loose compared with the requirements for insurance brokers.  It is imperative that a watchdog body should be set up to look into how an insurance broker or an insurance agent is running his business. It is fine for the Minister to have all these powers, but the Department cannot be expected to implement them effectively. A body should be set up under the Minister's direction and given specific powers to find out how people are looking after their businesses.</P>
      <P>I would like to make one final comment on how building societies deal with insurance.  The previous Government and, in particular, Deputy Boland then Minister for the Environment, provided legislation to stop an unfair system being used by building societies.  For example, when a client applied for a loan from a building society the society stated that he must insure with a certain company. What happens now is that if a client is insured with a different insurance company from that recommended by the building society, the client is asked to pay a £25 reading fee to look at the insurance policy.  That is very unfair and the Minister should look into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long awaited.  It has been described as the most important Bill for the insurance industry since 1936. I would like to think the results of this Bill will be of benefit to the policyholder, the intermediaries, the Government and all who have an interest in bringing the industry forward from strength to strength in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> Basically the Bill refers to three areas: (1) the Minister is seeking additional legislative powers in regard to the supervision of insurance companies which is proper and correct; (2) the regulation of commissions which I will refer to at a later stage in this contribution; and, (3) the regulation of insurance intermediaries. While that is very important for the insurance industry, the man in the street is not very much concerned about it.  He is concerned about the availability of cover, whether he can get cover at the right price, and whether he can trust the insurance company or the broker, which is very important.  That is his main concern in this area of insurance.  As a nation we are very much aware of our legal rights.  We are living in a litigious environment. I have seen claims in the recent past which have amazed me.  Claims against public liability which I thought could never be followed through were followed through and were successful.  I can remember some 20 years ago investigating a claim with Athlone Urban District Council.  A young boy broke into the abattoir, stole the humane killer and the bullets and injured his eye.  He received an award.  I would have imagined that could not have happened at that time, but it is happening more and more at present.</P>
    <P>We are living in a very legalistic and litigious environment which has a direct adverse effect on insurance costs which the public at large have to pay.  There may be some savings for the policyholder as a result of this Bill.  The Courts Bill which will come in this session, the establishment of a book of quantum of damages to be used as a guideline in addition to the abolition of the two senior counsel practice and the implementation of the Barrington report should create a greater awareness on the part of the public.  All of these things should help to bring premiums down.  We can say with certainty at present that our system of awarding compensation to injured people is slow, inefficient and unfair.  Anybody who goes to the High Court and listens to a case will find very quickly that there is no such thing as liability, whether there is liability <Col N="393" /> or not.  It just does not count.  An award is made, full stop.  It is very expensive. While all of these things are for another day, it is of no harm to refer to them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Employers liability cost for manufacturing industry in Ireland is now £30 million higher then comparable costs in Britain.  Funds for manufacturing and, indeed, for trade generally which might be used to create more jobs or to increase output are now being used for increased public liability and employers' liability insurance.  I would like to make this small point, but a valid point.  Last year in Westmeath County Council we almost had to have a second estimates meeting because of the increase in our public liability and our employers' liability premiums. Where that exists, people are concerned; the Government are concerned, and understandably so.  The whole insurance scene has changed dramatically over the years.  I can remember years ago when insurance brokers &mdash; and large ones in particular &mdash; could get credit on the basis of six, eight or ten months. Business was canvassed on the basis of the length of credit available but, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, the year of fiscal rectitude has arrived with a bang. Credit is certainly limited; commission is reduced; and the whole insurance industry has changed dramatically in that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government rightly in this Bill have attached a lot of importance to the question of the examination of insurance companies' affairs.  I was not aware until quite recently that within the Department a number of companies were selected for study by outside consultants in regard to the examination of their annual returns.  I welcome this.  I can remember saying at the time of the PMPA collapse that, had the people who investigated the Vehicle and General in England, a large insurance company with £25 million motor insurance at the time, investigated the PMPA, they would have been asked to stop trading years before it actually happened.  Therefore, it is right and proper that the Government should <Col N="394" /> involve themselves in this area and involve themselves in a very real and practical way.  It is right that the Minister, as he does in section 15 of the Bill, should take unto himself power to intervene in the running of the business of an insurer which has encountered financial difficulties, or which is known to have encountered financial difficulties.  Very often within the business it is known what is happening long before it reaches the desk of the Minister, or the Government become aware of it.</P>
    <P>Although not perhaps a matter for insurance brokers, one aspect of the Bill which I welcome is the fact that I believe the kiss of life might well be given here to the industrial branch of assurance.  It is a business that has been with us for perhaps 100 years.  The penny policy has buried many an Irishman.  It was the cornerstone of the development of companies like New Ireland and Irish Life. The Minister knows it has been a neglected area of life assurance over the past few years, which is a pity.  Certainly, when you consider what that type of industrial branch assurance did for the companies I referred to and the type of money Irish Life took in in the last single premium bond which they advertised and which was so successful &mdash; hundreds of millions of pounds &mdash; and compare it with the good old days or perhaps the bad old days of the penny policy, it is certainly a contrast.  I am glad it is not neglected in this Bill.  I am glad it is being revived and getting the kiss of life.  It certainly needed to be revamped in a real way and that seems to be happening in this Bill. Change in industrial branch assurance is necessary.  We know that the value for money of industrial assurance has declined but, nonetheless, the changes which are now being made will be for the benefit of that type of business within the life assurance field.</P>
    <P>We might well ask: why should the Minister have an interest in commissions? As he explained, it is the policyholder who will pay eventually for commissions but, at the same time, I have to make this point.  For a broker, operating as he does, with a staff, an <Col N="395" /> office and heating, paying 5 per cent on commissions is crazy.  I would like to think that, when the Courts Bill is enacted and we have a better insurance climate, a more profitable insurance climate, the Minister, rather than perhaps taking commissions away, may decide that an over-riding commission of 5 per cent or 7½ per cent, or whatever, might well be desirable.  In the future brokers might look for more commissions for their business.</P>
    <P>The whole area of bonds &mdash; and I am not referring specifically to any section &mdash; has caused some concern.  I always felt it was unfair to ask for a £100,000 consumer bond from a broker with, say, £½ million of a turnover and the same bond from a broker with £10 million of a turnover.  That seems wrong.  Therefore, naturally I am pleased that the Minister has indicated that this might be dealt with in another way.  I welcome this change which I hope he will make on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The position of insurance agents and brokers is well documented in the Bill. That is a worrying aspect of the Bill because the treatment of tied agents as against the treatment of brokers is somewhat discriminatory.  First I will talk about the tied agent.  While many people have different ideas of what tied agents are, I have no doubt that in the future the Bank of Ireland will have their bank managers purely as tied agents.  Any of them who give business to Irish Life or Abbey Life or Standard Life will have to suffer the consequences.  Obviously they want the business for themselves, which is reasonable and fair.  I am not talking about that type of tied agent.  If I wanted to I could advertise in the area of life assurance and earn £10,000 in my spare time.  I could then bring in housewives, Army personnel, and so on, give them a crash course in insurance and let them loose on an unsuspecting public selling large single premiums, mortgage protection, endowment policies and so on and they would be paid a commission. That is not doing the industry any good.</P>
    <P>When I did my ACII examinations the <Col N="396" /> most important principle I found was <i>uberrima fides</i>, of utmost good faith. Utmost good faith must still continue to be the very basis of all insurance contracts. Unless people and agents have a love for the industry and have an awareness of the industry, we will have cowboys and that is what is happening in many cases.  We have to look at that tied agent. It is wrong that people like that should be let loose to take premiums in the manner I have described.  The question of broker <i>versus</i> agent within the Bill is obviously a matter for debate.  I regard myself as a typical country insurance broker with an interest in the business, with a love for the insurance industry because I realise what it means to industry generally.  It is regarded as being very important in the whole industrial life of this country and of the world.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as it stands without amendment, would cost me a lot of money. There is the professional indemnity bond and there is a certificate of solvency. There is the consumer bond and membership of an insurance brokerage body.  I accept that I do not have to be, but if you are an optician and there is an opticians' society, you like to be part of that society. If you are an ophthalmic surgeon and there is an ophthalmic surgeons' society, you like to be a member of that ophthalmic surgeons' society.  Therefore, brokers like to be part of their organisation and help to build it up and run it. The tendency will be &mdash; if people remain brokers &mdash; to try to remain members of these brokers' associations.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill refers to fees which are not defined.  I must conclude that if a brokers' organisation has, say, 200 members the Minister for Finance can say he wants £500 a member.  That would be put onto the insurance broker.  It will cost the small, average, country broker a lot of money before he writes one single form.  Compare that with the agent who has no responsibility within the Bill.  He is looked after clearly by the insurance company.  There ought to be a greater differentiation.  I anticipate that many of the insurance brokers I have referred to <Col N="397" /> will cease to operate as brokers and will go back to being agents.  They will have none of the costs we are talking about and will trade merrily with four companies. They might well be able to do it.  I would like a closer look to be taken at the role of the agent and the number of agencies an agent can actually possess.  My own view would be that it should be one life and one general.  Otherwise, he is prone to the accidents of any broker.  He is prone to professional indemnity.  He still has the same problems.</P>
    <P>An effort must be made to control and make as small as possible problems an agent can create for himself, for the policyholder and for the consumer.  The question of an agent, whether it be one life and one general, having a bond or PI is a matter for debate but, one way or the other, if they do not have it, and it is not required within the Bill, the company who appoint these agents will have to give very strong guarantees that they will take over the full liabilities of the agent and if there are misdemeanours that they will be honoured by the insurance company. Otherwise they should be treated in the same way as the broker and have the professional indemnity and the bond and all that goes with it.</P>
    <P>There are other sections in the Bill which we can talk about on Committee Stage.  The Explanatory Memorandum &mdash; which I find quite excellent &mdash; reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Section 31 prohibits commission payments being made in the form of benefits-in-kind or loans.</P>
    <P>This I agree with totally.</P>
    <P>It also prohibits any commission being paid until the premium has been received by the insurer.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is meant here.  My own definition &mdash; and I have read it twice for many weeks of the year &mdash; is that the normal way for commissions to be paid is on a net basis.  In other words, if the account of company X is for £5,000 &mdash; and let us assume it is a 10 per cent commission &mdash; that is £500.  The insurance representative or the company <Col N="398" /> get £4,500 rather than getting £5,000 and are paid back £500 by the company.  That is something we can look at on Committee Stage.  There is a lot in the Bill that we can talk about on Committee Stage.  As I said at the outset, we have waited for this Bill for a long time.  It is reckoned to be the most important insurance Bill since 1936.  Therefore we must not rush into it.  We must take our time on Committee Stage.  We must examine the Bill in great detail and hopefully we can produce a Bill which will give the insurance industry confidence, give the policyholder, the Minister and all the interested parties confidence that they can go forward for another 50 years in the knowledge that they have a worthwhile Bill which we can all stand by.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is the first time I have been here when he was in that chair. As he was my colleague in the constituency and I hope will be again, I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate I have noticed that the same points, which are predictable, are being made by most speakers.  Possibly I will go over ground covered by other speakers on the last day of the debate.  In introducing the Second Stage of the Bill the Minister mentioned in the preamble the abolition of juries in personal injury cases.  This is something which has been debated and discussed for quite some time.  Most people will welcome a change.  I know it does not arise on this Bill but it is appropriate to make a change in it.  It will reduce the tendency which has developed to have huge awards made by jurors who have been motivated more by emotion than by logic and common sense.  It will also help to reduce the legal costs which I believe amount to approximately 20 per cent of overall settlement costs in third party motor claims for personal injuries which have done much to drive up the cost of motor insurance.  The existing practice of a junior and senior counsel and a multitude of legal persons involved in setting up and handling cases for both the defendant and plaintiff will <Col N="399" /> presumably be unnecessary.  While this will not be welcomed by some sections of the legal profession, it should nevertheless get an almost universal welcome.</P>
    <P>In our desire to reduce costs we must, of course, make sure that victims of personal injury obtain justice.  This means adequate and fair compensation which the jury system was, in theory, designed to deliver but in practice jurors, ordinary, unqualified but worthy people, 12 just men and women, are unable to assess damages fairly.  It is to be hoped that, under any new arrangement, adequate and workable safeguards will be incorporated and qualified assessors will be available to advise a judge in a case and help him in assessing the extent of injuries and arriving at sensible and fair compensation on a basis that makes sense. Handling out large cash sums to victims in personal injury cases, most of whom are not used to handling large sums of money, has often resulted in the past in cash being frittered away by bad investment, whereas the payment of an annuity adjusted to a rise in living costs and changing health care needs would be a better solution.  The present situation has given rise to certain cases where a victim, perhaps suffering from paralysis as a result of an accident, has been helped to an early grave by relatives and indeed friends anxious to get their hands on the award money.  This has been achieved by turning the unfortunate person on to alcohol and providing an almost endless supply of it with inevitable and tragic results.</P>
    <P>Regarding the abolition of jury awards and the overall system of compensation I recommend the Minister and everyone else in the House to read the excellent O'Connor report on the Commission of Inquiry into Motor Insurance which appeared in the seventies.  This report made some very worthwhile recommendations on the subject of paying compensation and discussed various methods which would be an improvement on the present arrangement.  The commission report details the practice in other countries which I believe have merit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Turning to the Bill before the House, the life insurance and general insurance industries represent two of the major financial areas in our economy.  I welcome the motivation behind the introduction of this Bill but I feel that in some respects the Bill does not go far enough in consumer protection as it would seem merely to put financial burdens on reputable intermediaries.  It does not take the opportunity, which is so readily afforded, to introduce rules and sanctions which would protect the public against wrong information and dishonest selling.  I believe these could easily have been written into the provisions of this Bill.  I also feel that some of the restrictive provisions in the Bill will actually work against the consumer's interest in the long run by restricting freedom of choice.  I will elaborate on these two points when I deal with the appropriate sections.</P>
    <P>The sections which deal mainly with giving the Minister extra powers to supervise insurance companies are to be welcomed and are long overdue.  Dealing with section 22 which refers to industrial insurance policies I am somewhat concerned about various abuses which take place in this area.  It is generally agreed that industrial life policies are bad value from the client's point of view.  This is due to the very high cost of servicing this business.  While the amalgamation of the ordinary branch and industrial branch funds increases financial stability, it may introduce the danger of the ordinary branch business subsidising the industrial branch business which would not be to the benefit of ordinary branch policyholders. I know that the operation of an industrial branch is a marginal activity with some companies who, I suspect, would be quite happy to divest themselves of that portfolio.  The Minister might examine the possibility of encouraging a merger, a takeover of this type of business by companies who wish to do so.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, all of the companies which operate industrial branch accounts also carry out ordinary branch business. There is no doubt that the value for money offered by ordinary branch is <Col N="401" /> infinitely superior to the industrial branch from the consumer's point of view.  An important opportunity now presents itself to incorporate in the Bill regulations which would insist that purchasers of ordinary branch insurance should also be shown the benefits under the ordinary branch policy for the same overall annualised premium when industrial branch representatives are selling policies.  This regulation could be easily enforced by making it mandatory to have a declaration signed by purchasers confirming that benefits had been fully explained to them under both forms of insurance and a declaration to this effect could be either held in the insurance company's office or contained in the industrial branch policy book.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the insurance compensation fund set up at the time of the PMPA difficulties and also called upon at the time of the difficulties with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  It appears that the purpose of this section is to introduce a very significant reduction in the present levels of protection offered by the compensation fund.  I hope that in the future a situation will not arise where an insurer operating in the State will be insolvent.  But if it should occur, it would seem to be unfair to limit the compensation which claimants will be paid to 65 per cent of the amount of unsatisfied claims.  It is hard to understand why such a move should be taken and it would seem to be against the public interest.  I hope the compensation fund will be open to all.  I would be glad to hear the Minister's view on this matter.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, sections 30 to 36, deals with the standardisation or regulation of commissions paid to insurance intermediaries.  The emphasis would seem to be on controlling the earnings of intermediaries rather than controlling their behaviour.  Most insurance brokers are decent and honourable business people.  It would be very worthwhile to introduce some safeguards into the Bill which would protect the public from inflated and over-optimistic claims in the field of investment.  Possible malpractices could be significantly reduced by a system <Col N="402" /> whereby the official illustration or quotation form of the appropriate insurance company whose rates are being quoted must be used and that a copy of this quotation, signed both by the purchaser and the intermediary, should be sent to the insurance company accompanying the proposal form and other documents. A facsimile of this copy should be then incorporated in the policy which would be sent to the client.  By this method the insurance company could police the activities of brokers and the practice of hyping up figures would be stopped.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate to include some regulations regarding advertising by insurance brokers particularly in the life insurance investment field.  At present and for many years some brokers have placed newspaper advertisements quoting returns which, while accurate for short periods of say one or two years, were potentially misleading for medium or long term investment purchasers.  In this connection I know that the Irish Insurance Federation recently brought out recommendations binding member companies.  These are to be welcomed because they make it mandatory that unified growth rates be used in illustrations. However, the extension of this type of approach would control the type of advertising which insurance brokers engaged in.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to reiterate the concern expressed by Senator Hogan and other Senators that this Bill will affect the smaller brokers.  This legislation could either put them to the wall, with a loss of jobs, or set them thinking about becoming agents.  This Bill does not take sufficient account of the professionalism and integrity of numerous brokers who are decent, fine people and give a good service.</P>
    <P>The broker is, in the vast majority of cases, a professional man or woman who knows the products he or she is selling, who realises that to mislead the client &mdash; and it is quite easy to mislead people because insurance business is a very complex, technical area &mdash; is a very shortsighted approach to their business.  They are experienced in selling a cross section <Col N="403" /> of products and yet this Bill maintains the role of agents.  They can be bank managers, building society managers or auctioneers, people whose main vocation in life would be far removed from studying and understanding the insurance industry in general.  These people cannot be and are not equipped to deal comprehensively with clients.  I regret that no measures were taken in the Bill on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill because, like Senator Fallon, I have some knowledge of the insurance business.  In fact, my first permanent job was as an agent with the New Ireland Assurance Company. I was very happy with that job until I was lured by the bright lights of Dáil Éireann in 1969.  I thought I was going to make my fortune but I found that the lads who stayed behind in the insurance business became far wealthier than I did.</P>
      <P>The whole situation has changed in the meantime but I have a certain grá for the insurance business and would like to see it prosper.  The founding fathers, the people who went out in the early days and sold insurance, who built up the industry when it was very hard to collect the premiums and very hard to sell the business, deserve great credit.  They had a difficult job.  They did the job in rural areas on their bicycles.  They deserve great credit.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Bill, 1987, which we are now discussing has three principal objectives: one, to introduce new supervisory arrangements for insurance companies; two, to empower the Minister to regulate the commissions paid to intermediaries; three, to institute a system of regulation of insurance brokers and agents.  Those are objectives with which we can all agree.  Recent experience has shown that it is very necessary for the Government to monitor the insurance business and satisfy themselves that the interest of the insuring public is protected at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance industry in Ireland constitutes a crucially important part of the <Col N="404" /> overall financial sector and thus of the economy as a whole in terms of employment and investment.  There are 5,000 people employed in the insurance industry. Our entry into the EC and the passing of certain European Community legislation which gives foreign companies the right of establishment in this country brought about changes in the insurance industry.  There are about 30 foreign companies operating in Ireland at present. Some of those companies have huge resources and are in a better position to stand up to bad claims than their Irish counterparts.  Approximately 50 per cent of non life premiums at present are going for foreign companies.  There is a danger under the new directive which allows companies to operate here without being established here that that 50 per cent will increase further.  There is also the danger that those companies can offer reduced premiums for certain risks, thereby forcing other companies operating in Ireland only to compete with them in order to hold on to their premium income.  This could have the effect of destabilising some companies which would not have the necessary resources to withstand such an onslaught.</P>
    <P>This was one of the things that forced the collapse of the PMPA and ICI.  For a few years before they collapsed they were offering rates which were unrealistic. Other companies had to do the same in order to compete.  This meant they had a few years in which no profits were recorded.  Then, because of the PMPA debacle we had the 3 per cent levy imposed on all policyholders in an effort to get that company on to a sound financial footing once again.  This, of course, is adding to the cost of insurance.  The insuring public have a right to know when they can hope to see the end of this levy.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has contributed more than anything else to the high cost of insurance is the high cost of claims. Our claims record must be the worst in Europe.  Our awards of damages are twice what they are in the United Kingdom.  Our legal system and the two senior counsel requirement in High Court cases is adding considerably to the cost <Col N="405" /> of claims.  It should be possible for the legal profession to bring about change in this system.  They should be able to do so and they should have done so without the Minister having to draw their attention to it and wave the big stick over them. I understand that will be changed in a subsequent Bill coming before this House and we should all welcome that.  If it contributes to the reduction of premiums it is to be welcomed by anybody involved in the business.</P>
    <P>In many cases the legal costs are higher than the actual claims.  The jury system is another cause of criticism and has been for many years.  I am glad that is going to be abolished.  I hope that will happen before too long because we know that when it comes to a jury awarding damages against an insurance company the sky seems to be the limit.</P>
    <P>Small claims, what we would call minor incidents, can cost an insurance company up to £40,000 or £50,000 with legal costs. I have seen quite a few of those.  All of this has the effect of increasing the premiums on the unfortunate policy holder.  If an insurance company show a loss at the end of the financial year, they have to go to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for an increase in premiums. The Minister usually grants the percentage increase based on the losses the company can show over that year.</P>
    <P>Another bone of contention for a long time has been the high cost of motor insurance particularly for young people. Part of this may be attributed to the irresponsible attitudes of many motorists to driving and indeed to the law.  Part of it is also due to the large number of motorists driving without insurance.  It is said that 25 per cent of the motoring public are driving without motor insurance.  I do not know whether that figure is correct. Perhaps the Minister would have a better idea than I about it, but this is the figure being bandied about.  That is very serious. It is bound to have repercussions on the industry.  It is bound to make insurance that much more expensive for the people who diligently insure their car every year.</P>
    <P>There are people who genuinely want to insure their car but cannot get <Col N="406" /> insurance.  I refer in particular to young drivers.  Many young drivers have knocked on my door &mdash; I am sure Senator Fallon can say the same thing &mdash; looking for insurance and it is impossible to get an insurance company to take them on. These are young people under 25 years who are fortunate enough to have jobs in these times and who require a car to travel to work.  In most cases an insurance company will not quote insurance to a person if he or she in under 25 years of age, even if he or she has a full licence. There may be one or two companies which will quote but the vast majority will not quote for such a person.  Here we have a person who has a job, who has purchased a car, who requires a car to travel to his job and who finds he cannot get insurance to cover his car.  Something should be done about that because there seem to be a different regulations and conditions as far as insurance companies are concerned.  Some insurance companies will take drivers if they are over 25; other insurance companies will not take drivers if they are under 28 and so on.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem regarding occupations. There are certain occupations which insurance companies will not quote for.  Insurance companies are very slow to quote for insurance to mechanics, barmen and vets.  That is unfortunate and something should be done about it.  Even if they do take on those people, there are loadings because of their occupation. That is wrong.  Many of those drivers, even if they are under 25 years, are good and careful drivers.  Just because they are in a certain age group, which according to the insurance companies' records is the age group in which they have the biggest number of claims, they are all branded with the same brush and they are not accepted for insurance.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with every section of the Bill.  I am picking out a few sections that are of interest.  Many of the other points can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I am particularly interested in Part IV of the Bill because it deals with the regulation of insurance intermediaries and sets out certain conditions a broker has <Col N="407" /> to comply with in order to stay in business. He has to be a member of the Insurance Brokers' Association; he has to have a bond of £100,000; he has to have personal indemnity insurance and a certificate of solvency.  These are all very necessary requirements for any person who is involved in that kind of business and who is accepting money on behalf of clients.  It is only right that he should have proper cover.</P>

    <Title>Local Authority Funding: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the indiscriminate and unplanned cuts in Local Authority funding and calls on the Government to indicate in detail how it proposes to finance, secure and maintain services and employment for 1988.</P>
      <P>It is very appropriate on two accounts that Seanad Éireann should be debating this motion tonight.  At present city and county managers together with their staff are preparing a set of estimates which will come before the elected members in the next month or so.  Yesterday the Government published the Book of Estimates, one section of which deals specifically with the amount available for salaries and expenses in the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to local authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the rates on domestic dwellings were abolished in 1978 and the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, was passed liability for paying rates was transferred to central Government.  Unfortunately, the increase in the rate of poundage fell considerably below the rate of inflation.  In 1983 the limit on poundage increase, which had been imposed from each year <Col N="408" /> from 1978 onwards, was lifted by virtue of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983.  The State was formally authorised to make a grant of an annual amount payable by reference to the domestic rate valuation.  By 1987, the pertinent facts as regards rates as the source of income for local authorities were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>While the rate poundage had increased by a certain percentage in the period since 1978 the rates support grant had increased by a much lesser percentage.  In the present year there was a cutback of 3 per cent in the rates support grant to local authorities and next year local authorities will find themselves, according to the Book of Estimates, with a cutback of 12 per cent in the rates support grant which amounts to £31 million.</P>
      <P>I am sure that during this debate Members will speak about the problems they fact in their own local authorities.  I can only speak on behalf of the local authority which I represent and the problems we face in relation to the cutbacks in the rates support grant and the effect that will have on services and employment. The impact on the rate support grant for the city of Dublin amounts to £4.7 million and, when inflation is added, it will be well over £5 million.  The local authorities have not been given any clear guidelines on how to deal with this shortfall in local authority funding except to increase service charges or cut back on services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the 1985 local elections Dublin Corporation were imposing &mdash; as I am sure other local authorities were &mdash; service charges to help finance the necessary services and keep people in employment. The service charges were passed by the city council against the total opposition of the Fianna Fáil group.  Indeed the leader of the Fianna Fáil group at that time stated publicly that he was not prepared <Col N="409" /> to pay his water charges and incited the public to do likewise, which I thought was a most irresponsible position to take.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in their local election manifesto of 1985 said they were totally opposed to the system of local charges and on returning to office would abolish these charges and repeal the legislation under which they were imposed.  They also promised to introduce new legislation which would end the present unsatisfactory position and put local finances on a sound basis.  I ask the Minister: where is this new legislation to put local authority finances on a sound basis? Unfortunately, we will find that the very opposite is the case if we examine the Book of Estimates carefully in relation to the Department of the Environment. The manifesto went on further to state that the legislation which I am speaking about would provide that local authorities would receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each year from the central Exchequer and this contribution would be sufficient to provide for a satisfactory level of necessary services.  It went on further to say that the new legislation would eliminate the present uncertainty whereby local authorities could not anticipate what the grant from central Exchequer each year would be and this compelled city and county managers to impose a new unacceptable level of service charges against the wishes of the great majority of the local communities.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that every seat which the Fianna Fáil party won in the local elections in 1985 was won by a process of deception.  Now in Government they once again deceive the people.  In view of the position which the Fianna Fáil group in Dublin Corporation took prior to the 1985 local elections it is now impossible for that local authority to impose service charges even if they wished to do so.  The only alternative is to cut back services and employment.  We saw an example of this already this year. The estimates prepared by the city manager provided for an income of £3½ million from service charges.  The Fianna Fáil group who control the council were totally opposed to it and examined each <Col N="410" /> estimate in detail and reduced them by the necessary £3½ million and by doing so cut back on services.  This has already started to cut back on employment.  It is not good enough for the Fianna Fáil leader on Dublin Corporation to say, presumably with his party's authority, that the reintroduction of service charges will not be allowed and that every job within Dublin Corporation is under threat.  This mean, in effect, that every service currently being provided by that authority is equally at risk.  If it is at risk in the current year, how much more will it be at risk next year when in this year's estimates we have to find an extra £5 million?</P>
    <P>When local authorities cut back on services they cut back on employment.  As I have stated previously, when we cut back on employment in the first instance we cut back on those people who are carrying out the maintenance work in the different departments of the local authorities, people working in the front line, the maintenance workers and the unskilled. It is the manual workers who will go first. This will leave the local authorities with top heavy administrative and professional staff with a much reduced labour force to carry out their work.</P>
    <P>There are other unsocial aspects of the present cutbacks in local authority funding, especially in relation to the library services.  I am sure this affects every other local authority the same way as it affects Dublin city and county.  I understand that this year in County Dublin libraries had to close for one month because they could not afford to pay the staff.  I know that in Dublin Corporation where we have always prided ourselves on providing an excellent library service and made capital expenditure on building libraries &mdash; especially the central library in the ILAC centre which is the pride of Dublin Corporation &mdash; we now find that we cannot employ staff or buy books to run that library as we would like to run it.</P>
    <P>The figures the Government have produced in the Book of Estimates will have one serious effect.  They are by their very nature deflationary and will cause unemployment. The Government should be providing a climate to prepare people for <Col N="411" /> the increase in unemployment.  The past Administration provided in the Estimates funding for amenity services and amenity grants for local communities. This was reduced last year from £6 million to £4 million and next year it will disappear. Where there is unemployment in a community it puts pressure on society. If there are people within the community good enough and willing to give their time to help with community projects, the Government of the day have a moral responsibility to support these organisations. Amenity grants to provide community centres and other facilities in society are essential.  I ask the Minister and the Government to consider the line they have taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>New house grants, house improvement grants and the £5,000 surrender grant have all been scrapped.  This has led to the inevitable and vastly more costly consequence of a build up in the council houses application lists.  This represents potential extra capital and maintenance expenditure on the State and on the taxpayers. It is a move that defies any rational explanation.  These grants are still in operation in the Gaeltacht designated areas.  If the scrapping of these grants nationally is right &mdash; and I am not saying that is so &mdash; it must be wrong that they should continue for one section of our population.  The opposite is equally valid.</P>
    <P>In their 1985 manifesto Fianna Fáil stated that they would raise the annual housing output to 30,000 that this greatly expanded housing programme was designed to meet the real housing needs of the growing population and would provide a major boost for employment.  They further stated that 50,000 unemployed building workers and their families and the 35,000 families waiting for homes could look with confidence to Fianna Fáil to meet their needs.  How hollow that sounds now. Deception again, complete deception on the most vulnerable people in our society. This is the Year of the Environment.  An Foras Forbartha, the body charged with important environmental and pollution <Col N="412" /> control and monitoring facilities, are not to be strengthened but abolished and this at a time when pollution in our lakes and waterways has reached an amazing level.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Book of Estimates in relation to rates on Government property.  In the past the Government have made payable to local authorities rates in respect of property owned by the Government in each local authority area.  That amounted to £13 million last year.  Dublin Corporation would be the greatest beneficiary because the majority of Government buildings are in this area.  In the commercial grant area that amounted to £7 million.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something that has come to my attention.  When local authorities increased their commercial rate last year they did not receive the compensating increase from the Government in the rate payable on Government property. When we examine the Book of Estimates this year we find that the same provision in the Estimates for rates on Government property amounting to £13 million is provided.  If local authorities increase the commercial rate again this year, they will not be compensated by central Government for that increase on Government property.  This is a very indirect way of reducing the revenue of local authorities and it is another way of increasing the amount that has been reduced on the rate support grant.  It is very unfair that this should be happening.</P>
    <P>While speaking about the commercial rate it is improtant to draw attention to the fact that local authorities derive a certain income from the commercial rate. Indeed, some authorities do far better than others.  In Dublin the amount from the commercial rate is something like £51 million.  If we do not continue to provide services for the business community there will be a reluctance by them to pay the commercial rate.  As everyone will appreciate, business is difficult at present and there is a growing feeling among the business community that they are not receiving from the local authorities the services they deserve.  With the cutbacks in local authority funding I find that not alone will we not be able to provide the <Col N="413" /> services, but it could happen &mdash; and I would hate to see it happen &mdash; that there would be some reduction in the amount of money the local authorities receive from the commercial rate.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister when replying to explain the amount referred to as &ldquo;appropriations-in-aid&rdquo;. I understand these are receipts which the Department of the Environment receive.  There is a reduction of 36 per cent of that figure in the Estimate.  I would be thankful if I could have an explanation on that issue.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to say that there now is a responsibility on the councils controlled by Fianna Fáil to prepare and sanction estimates during the coming year which will provide adequate services for the people they represent.</P>

      <P>I would like to second the motion &ldquo;that Seanad Éireann condemns the indiscriminate and unplanned cuts in Local Authority funding and calls on the Government to indicate how it proposes to finance, secure and maintain services and employment for 1988.&rdquo;  One of the biggest cuts in the Book of Estimates is the reduction of £145 million in the budget of the Department of the Environment for 1988.  As has been indicated by Senator Doyle the rates support grant for local authorities will be reduced by £31 million and substantially less money will be provided for spending on roads, housing, water and sanitary services which are all important and essential services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting this motion I condemn and deplore the dismal performance of the Minister for the Environment and the Fianna Fáil Administration.  No political party ever promised so much in the field of Irish local government than Fianna Fáil in Opposition and no Government have ever so totally failed to deliver on those promises than Fianna Fáil in Government.  Today Irish local government has no champion at the Cabinet table.  Since his appointment as Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn has presided over the steady demise of a great Department of State.  Behaving in a role appropriate to a liquidator he has run <Col N="414" /> down his Department and allowed it to be almost decimated.  All initiatives have been stifled; all change and developments stopped; and staff have been demoralised and demotivated.  Abandoned also has been a range of important housing initiatives in the interest of home owners and a range of public works across the local authority spectrum.  Major initiatives which were launched by the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, for the development of public parks and amenities have all be abandoned.</P>
    <P>I support this motion because as a local authority member I believe one of the fundamental tenets of a political system is the importance of democracy and it is at local level that the democratic process is most effective.  The 1971 White Paper on Local Government stated:</P>
    <P>The real argument for the provision of local services by local authorities is that a system of Local Government is one of the essential elements of democracy.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I strongly advocate far-raching reform of our local government structures, functions and finances and the establishment of a partnership with central Government so that we can achieve true local government and not mere administration.  In Ireland, unlike most other European countries, local government has no positive constitutional status and the lack of autonomy and the restricted and narrow range of services provided by local authorities have been criticised by many bodies, commissions and the Devlin report.  It was summed up by Tom Barrington, a former director of the Institute for Public Administration, in the following words:</P>
    <P>The general drift of Irish Local Government is to give elected representatives less duties to be responsible for and in relation to the duties left less responsibility and discretion.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, therefore, that I advocate that the powers and functions of local authorities be widened and that <Col N="415" /> there be a reduction of the detailed controls exercised by the Department of the Environment.  Surely it is not Utopian to look forward to a system by which central Government reserve to themselves only a small portion of the functions of government, those that are genuinely central and indivisible, and devolve on local authorities all the detailed business of government.  The task of modernising and strengthening local government is a major and vital undertaking and I urge the Minister for the Environment and the Government to accord to this undertaking the importance and priority which it deserves.</P>
    <P>Central, of course, to the whole question of effective local government is the question of finance.  I endorse the decision taken some years ago to abolish domestic rates and I am totally opposed to their reintroduction in any shape or form.  Therefore, I urge the Government, as I urged the previous Government, to abolish the system of service charges because they are unsatisfactory and unworkable and are seen by the public as an element of double taxation.  In calling for the abolition of service charges and their replacement by a reasonable allocation from national taxation, I emphasise that wastefulness and spendthrift learnings cannot be tolerated and that it behoves all of us in local government at central and local level to be vigilant and to ensure that cost-effectiveness in our operations is the hallmark of the local government system.  The chief complaint of local authorities is not the lack of power to collect funds but the lack of autonomy and discretion to spend the reasonable amounts of money which are allocated to them from central funds.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I advocate the setting up of a national finance council on the lines of the Dutch system.  In Holland the municipalities enjoy considerable latitude in the management of their domestic affairs even though central Government contribute in excess of 90 per cent to local funds.  The degree of local autonomy in Holland is higher than in any other European country.  The Dutch authorities <Col N="416" /> operate a municipal fund administered by the national finance council, the majority of whose members are nominated by local authorities.  The proceeds of national taxation are disbursed on a defined basis without arbitrary consideration. The central Government do not seek to strengthen their control in return for this heavy subvention.  It is possible to conclude with some degree of certainty that a good local government system can operate without undue interference from central Government and that the quality of the local government system is not determined by the extent of its own fund-raising powers.  It is within the competence of a good political system to finance local government services out of the yield of national taxation and it is not necessary in doing so to impose constraints which may inhibit the proper development of good local government which is so essential to our democratic system.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable and to be deplored and condemned that all we got from the Minister for the Environment and the Government is a virtual abandonment at the Cabinet table of the Department of the Environment as an agency which can stimulate the construction industry, develop our infrastructure, encourage the concept of home ownership of which we are justly proud and provide adequately for those who cannot house themselves.  An article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 14 October stated:</P>
    <P>Are we now throwing almost every conceivable service and every last vestige of humanity out of the window in order to satisfy the demands of international money moguls?</P>
    <P>Of course the national debt must be reduced.  Of course the mindless borrowing must be repaid.  But does it all have to be done at once&mdash;</P>
    <P>in one fell swoop&mdash;</P>
    <P>with such suffering and such deprivation?</P>
    <P>These are the questions which the publication of the Budget Estimates <Col N="417" /> prompts.  Essentially they come down to one: are we, with all our indebtedness, losing sight of the reality of this small island and going too far, too fast, in terms of corrective measures?</P>
    <P>We suggest now that we are.  I would like to suggest to the Minister of State here this evening that we are, in fact, going too far in the corrective measures and in the massive cutbacks local authorities are now experiencing in the level of their funding.  Therefore, I strongly support this motion and I call on this Government to provide a proper level of funding to finance, secure and maintain services and employment for 1988.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;takes note of the level of local authority financing for 1988 and the Government's determination to restore order in the public finances as an essential prerequisite for national recovery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the closing days of the last Government many people were disillusioned and cynical and said we should put the running of this country up for contract, that we were unable to run the country ourselves and should give countries like Taiwan, Japan and even third world countries an opportunity to run it because they could not do worse than we were doing or than the last Government did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Fine Gael motion and the Fine Gael Party were the senior party in the previous Government.  It is fair to say that the Taoiseach had diagnosed the problem: we were on the brink of the precipice.  The Minister for Finance had done likewise and the spokesman for the Government had diagnosed the problem. They were inhibited or prohibited from doing what should have been done and, as a consequence, the national debt doubled in their term of office.  Everybody would agree, irrespective of what party they belong to, that we are very fortunate <Col N="418" /> that the previous Government are not in power.  Along the way they told us that reform in the local authority area was required and they promised us reform.  It was never delivered and all they did was to tamper with the constituencies for the local government elections.  It is obvious to all that Fianna Fáil will not shirk their responsibilities in Government.</P>
    <P>There are people who admit that major surgery is necessary and they ask the question: will the patient survive?  We need have no fear about the patient surviving. It is evident that we are witnessing what must be the greatest miracle since the raising of Lazarus from the dead. This country has been pulled up by its bootlaces and all the indications are that a major improvement is just around the corner.</P>
    <P>Regarding this motion, priority will be given to road workers and lower paid workers.  There will be provision for services and improved services.  On a national scale at present local authority finance committees are doing very good work and we are getting good value for money spent.  I recall that in the last Seanad we had a debate on the state of county roads.  At present in my county, and I think on a national scale, roads are in good condition.  There is no comparison with the potholed roads of that time.</P>
    <P>This motion was tabled in advance of publication of the Book of Estimates. Therefore, it was not known at that time what would be in the book.  While it is the duty of the Opposition to criticise &mdash; and it is easy to criticise &mdash; it is only fair to point to the fact that this motion was tabled at a time when nobody outside the Government knew what would be in the Book of Estimates.  When we look at the Book of Estimates we see that there are increases in certain areas, and that should not be overlooked.  Also in passing I should say &mdash; as Senator Lanigan said earlier today &mdash; that we should give credit to the Government for bringing out the Book of Estimates at least three months earlier than any previous Government. That is important.  It is obvious that the <Col N="419" /> Government are working hard and are in earnest about this problem.</P>
    <P>When we look at the Book of Estimates under the heading &ldquo;Environment&rdquo; we see, for example, that there is an increase of 21 per cent over the 1987 Estimate for postal and telecommunications services.  We see an increase of 1 per cent for local authority housing subsidy, an increase of 14 per cent under the heading &ldquo;D.2. &mdash; Grants For New Houses&rdquo;.  There is an increase of 100 per cent under D.6. &mdash; Private Rented Dwellings &mdash; Determination Of Terms Of Tenancy.  There is an increase of 22 per cent under D.7. &mdash; Grants To Housing Finance Agency plc.  There is an increase of 4 per cent for Water Supply and Sewerage etc.  Subsidies.  There is an increase of 7 per cent in Recoupment of Expenditure In Respect of Register of Electors.  It is only fair to point to those.</P>
    <P>Since the motion is critical of the decreases, it is only right and proper that I should point to the increases and overall there is a decrease of 11 per cent.  This is not indiscriminate and unplanned as stated in the motion.  With regard to the rates support grant there is nothing new in the reductions.  I want to refer to the urban district council of which I am a member, Ceannas Mór Urban District Council, and give the shortfall since 1982. In 1982 the shortfall was £2,282; in 1983, it was £3,459; in 1984, it was £9,978; in 1985, it was £13,116; in 1986, it was £29,227; in 1987, it was £56,961.  We see there the situation initiated by the Coalition Government which grew gradually over the years.  There is nothing new in that.  Regarding Meath County Council to the end of last year there was a shortfall of about £7 million going back to 1982 and for 1987 there is a shortfall of about half that figure again.  We must remember that over the past three years &mdash; and it is fair to say this; and I have always given credit where I felt credit should be given irrespective of what Government were in power &mdash; supplementary welfare, for which the local authorities originally had to provide, was phased out and the drainage demand is being phased out since last <Col N="420" /> year.  It is important to point that out particularly in respect of my own county of Meath where the drainage demand would be exceptionally heavy on account of the Boyne drainage scheme.  It is important to point out that the Government are taking this in charge and providing the finances for it.</P>
    <P>The national situation is serious and in today's press we are told that the Taoiseach warned that even after the cuts were made the deficit would remain stubbornly high.  There is no need to quote any more of that but it is quite a long quotation.  In his speech in Sligo on 31 July the Minister for Finance told us that in 1982 when Fianna Fáil were last in Government there were 169,900 out of work, the national debt was £12 billion and interest rates were cripplingly high. He went on to give in some detail the steps taken by the Fianna Fáil Government at that time which brought about a marked improvement but that in a disastrous four and a half years the national debt doubled to £24 billion when the Coalition Government were in office. Despite this, investment remained weak, unemployment rose to 250,000 with all that implies in terms of human misery, 100,000 of our young people emigrated, real interest rates rose crippling enterprise and there was little or no growth.  He asked us to reflect on the enormity of the £24 billion.  A figure of £24 billion is hard to comprehend.  It is costing us nearly £2,000 million this year to pay interest on this debt alone.</P>
    <P>There are many demands on the local authorities and they are rising to this situation. It is only fair that we should pay tribute to the manner in which the local authorities are meeting this problem and providing the services.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy referred to rates. Many people feel that rates should be brought back.  I am not saying whether they should or they should not, but there are people who feel that they should be brought back.  When rates were abolished the Fine Gael Party also were determined to abolish them.  It was not the Fianna Fáil Party alone.  Indeed, it is fair to say all parties felt that rates should be abolished. <Col N="421" /> Also it must be pointed out that one of the major considerations regarding the abolition of rates was that they were inequitable.  Two elderly people had to pay the same rates for their property as a wealthy family in the same type of house in the same street.  That inequity was inherent in the system and that was the major reason rates were abolished.  I do not know if rates will be brought back, but consideration will have to be given to every aspect of the system and that would be one consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy, if I understand him correctly, is also saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to service charges but in this day and age we all realise that, if a service is to be provided, somebody must pay for it.  He referred also to the reduction in interest charges for the money moguls, as he called them. That is not altogether the full picture.  It is necessary to reduce interest rates but, by reducing interest rates, we are helping the small individual also.  For example, the interest charged to an individual who intends to build a new house or extend his existing house will have serious implications for him.  If we continue along the path we are going with interest rates decreasing that person will be in a very strong position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate and nobody can do justice to it in 15 minutes.  I would like a longer period to deal with all its aspects.  For example, I would like to deal in some detail with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which is an important element and I would like to pay tribute to the unions, the employers, the representatives of the agricultural community and all the different parties to that recovery.  I would like to examine in depth the implications of providing funds for local authorities.  In the Journal of the Institute of Public Administration of Ireland, 1986, Volume 34, No. 2, there is an article on Local Revenue Sources for Local Government &mdash; The Continuing Debate.  We need to have an indepth debate rather than trying <Col N="422" /> to embarrass the Government because the Government will not be embarrassed. The Government will not be deflected from their drive and it is obvious to everybody that the Government are succeeding. I pay tribute to the Fine Gael Party who have decided to support the Government in their efforts from a patriotic and national point of view because they feel this is the proper thing to do and that it is necessary.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, Senator Doyle referred to the promises made by Fianna Fáil and how hollow they may sound now.  When the Government, after a period in office, have succeeded in reducing the national debt, have got things moving again, have reduced emigration and have done everything positive that can be done and that they want to do, it will be obvious that their promises were anything but hollow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this motion.  It is a good motion to talk about but hard to deliver on.  I was not much different from any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party or the public prior to the election and, coming from a part of the country where development and expenditure are always welcome and necessary, I was very interested and I criticised the Administration in power before the general election.  We were aware of the negotiations that went on and, certainly to my knowledge, the Fianna Fáil Party did not vote the previous Government out.  At the time we had substantial announcements about expenditure.  In Sligo a new hospital was announced costing £46 million and not long after the election it was discovered that the present Government had the unpleasant duty of paying off nurses, which was a complete contrast. We were led to believe, prior to the general election, that money was no problem, that there was no need for restrictions and yet when Fianna Fáil were elected we, in the same health board region, in the very same local authority, were faced with the unpleasant and difficult task of paying off people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Government responsible and acting responsibly?  We have to come up <Col N="423" /> with an assessment.  The general public have now accepted that we were on the road to disaster.  Certainly people will lose jobs, people will be made redundant and there will be redeployment.  This is the lesser of two evils.  We now know that we were reaching the point where there would be no future for our young people. Many of them were aware of it.  Educated young people saw the writing on the wall and that started the emigration because the future was getting dimmer every day.</P>
    <P>This motion indicates that the Government cuts were unplanned.  I think they were very well planned.  I do not know of any other Government in the past 50 years who put more effort into planning exactly what they should do.  The vast majority of people in rural Ireland fully understand the situation.  If you have an assessment, or a Gallup poll, or any other kind of consensus tomorrow you will find that the average person is fairly intelligent.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are supporting the Government in the broad measures but do not agree with how they are being implemented.  They are entitled to do that.  I would not claim to be an economist but it is simple to understand and simple to interpret that the Government are indicating that waste has got to be eliminated and economies have got to be effected.  I welcome those directions from Government level because in the whole area of administration within this country from the caretaker in a local authority courthouse building right up to the President in the Phoenix Park, there were reams of waste.  We are buying oil and paying for expensive heating and people will hardly turn off the heat or adjust it.</P>
    <P>I know of a regional college where if one switch is put on, 90 lights go on.  We had reached the stage when we did not care about our future.  We were drifting into space.  That is my assessment.  We were spending £60 million in my local authority down in Donegal and we will now get a cut of £4 million.  I could suggest in this Chamber why we will save £4 million.  We were at the stage in my local authority where we had a machinery yard <Col N="424" /> to which we allocated so much a year and the machinery yard could never spend it. Towards the end of the year they had to purchase 20 lorries to use up the money. We were out of control, drifting like a space ship.</P>

      <P>I am using the words &ldquo;might not&rdquo; because people are more vocal here and those who can play the record actually might be far away from the grassroots.  I say that every local authority in Ireland was duplicating.  We had reached the stage when it did not count if a fellow came in or not.  The doctor's certificates came in for planning officers and engineers.  We had engineers in Donegal who would leave their children to school and go back and collect them and call in for a read of the newspaper and for the tea trolly.  We had over 60 engineers.  We are delighted that the Government have focused attention on expenditure right across the board and that local authorities will have to effect economies.  That is long overdue.  Every local authority in Ireland will have no difficulty in responding and being a healthier local authority, in ensuring that in future the workforce carry out more efficiently the work they have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been sloppy and lazy and starting at 11 o'clock in the morning.  We are about the only country in Europe doing that.  In Holland, Belgium and Switzerland the local authorities and the administrative sections switch on the lights in the office at 7 o'clock in the morning.  That does not happen here.  We have been sloppy and lazy and we have had it too soft for too long.  We cannot sustain that because the productivity <Col N="425" /> section was down to about 10 per cent of our total volume of money.  The 10 per cent that was going towards the development of productivity was getting smaller and the 90 per cent that it was costing us to administer the little affairs of the country was getting bigger.  The pipe was closing and the end was in sight.  The majority of the people know exactly there is nothing sensational in the Government's action.  It was overdue.  It is accepted by a massive majority within the country.  The people who do not accept it just do not understand.  They are out of touch but their supporters on the ground understand.</P>
    <P>In 1987, our local authority in Donegal got double the money for county roads they got the previous year.  That is on notice, thanks to the Minister present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will but I must get time.  For the first time in five years, we made our roads safe to travel on because we had pot holes.  My colleague, Senator Loughrey, got a photograph taken of himself and he went in with his shoes &mdash; he did not wear wellington boots.  I asked him at the county council meeting if he had to walk in it.  He was photographed standing in water up to the knees in a pothole in Donegal.  His own Government were in charge in this House at the time.  The Government recognised that was serious and the first thing that was done &mdash; I am glad to say and I compliment those responsible &mdash; was that the money being made available for county roads in Donegal County Council was doubled. We used that money wisely and we eliminated most of the potholes and made our county roads passable in County Donegal, thanks to the present Administration and thanks to the Minister.  I believe and hope, that even with tight constraints, we will still get increased money for county roads.</P>

If you fly over County Donegal or anywhere in the west you will see they are not short of water and stones. We reached the stage when we were importing water and stones into County Donegal.  We could not plan to provide road making material and water for our people.  That is how resourceful we were.</P>
      <P>It is time we recognised that we were going nowhere and were facing disaster with no future for our youth.  That is the real crunch of the matter.  In County Donegal there are 20,000 young people and seven out of ten will never get a job in their own county if we do not change course.  Motions like this show blatant insincerity.  They are playing politics with the future of our young people.  Young people will not accept them as a serious contribution to secure their future.  I compliment every member of the Government. This is the first time during my lifetime in politics that a Government have performed with courage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When I passed a comment about a previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Blaney, it was intended as a compliment.  On my numerous visits to County Donegal I always admired the work the man had the courage to do when he was in the Department of the Environment.  I hope Senator McGowan will accept that.  To disclose my closeness to the grassroots, I am a member of two local authorities &mdash; duly elected at the head of the poll in each electoral area over a period of years &mdash; Tipperary Urban Council and Tipperary County Council which has the honour to be served by an assistant county manager, Mr. Dave Mackey, who comes from county Donegal.  He would need a magic wand if he were to perform the wonders <Col N="427" /> Senator McGowan talked about in County Donegal with the estimates that have been intimated to our county manager and, indeed, to the assistant county manager.  In Tipperary we are faced with a dilemma as to how we deal with what we consider to be unplanned cuts in the Department of the Environment.  The motion asks the Government to spell out how they expect the elected county councillors to maintain services for the people following the abolition of rates.  Senator Fitzsimons was correct when he said there was a race against time between the different political parties on the abolition of rates.  When rates were abolished by the present Government they promised that the rates support grants would replace the income that would normally be generated by way of rates.  That promise has now been reneged on.</P>
      <P>We are concerned as to how we can provide the services which we were elected to provide.  The figures in the Book of Estimates show an overall reduction, but the rates support grants paid by the Department of the Environment to local authorities were reduced by 12 per cent, a massive £30 million, without proper planning or reorganisation of local authorities.  We would like to see local government reorganised and this Government apparently have committed themselves to reorganise it. It is highly dangerous to massively cut spending in a local authority area where valuable and essential statutory services are required to be provided by the local authority with no funding from Central Government.  I have strong views on whether we have local government.  We have no autonomy whatsoever since the abolition of rates.  The select services on domestic premises and rates on small shopkeepers and those who are hard-pressed are our only source of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government who project an image of courage every day should reorganise local authorities along the lines Muintir na Tíre suggested last weekend at their seminar which was attended by the Minister, Deputy Flynn. He never once referred to the actual proposals <Col N="428" /> for a new democracy for local authorities as suggested by Muintir na Tíre or to the whole concept of what Father Hayes believed &mdash; that ordinary people at rural level would be able to represent themselves and make their own decisions.  That decision could and should involve financing.  The Government when in Opposition &mdash; and I am sorry Senator McGowan was not present for the past five years &mdash; never stopped harping on the amount of money they would give to local authorities.  They promised the sun, the moon and the stars but they suddenly stopped the lights when they realised it was not possible.</P>
    <P>We all accept that there are funding problems and financial difficulties but let us not suddenly chop everything without putting an alternative in place.  If we do not have the power to replace this massive reduction what will follow?  There is no mention of the problem in the plan for national recovery published last week.  The Department of the Environment are not even mentioned in it. There are a couple of paragraphs on the construction industry.  What did this Government do for the construction industry despite all their promises?  The local authorities were a major sector in the construction industry, providing local authority houses and grants, and grants for disabled people.  All of these services have been cut without anything being put in their place.  I am prepared to sit down with any Government, or any county manager, or any county engineer.  The remarks about county engineers were unwarranted.  If council members did not use their executive functions to ensure that engineers got to work on time there is no point in talking about it here.</P>
    <P>They had power as elected representatives in County Donegal to deal with the problem if they had it.  I doubt very much that they had such a problem in Donegal County Council.  Local authority members have certain powers but they are afraid of their lives to use them.</P>
    <P>In Tipperary we have been afraid to use them.  We brought in water charges when it was unpopular to do so and Fianna Fáil said they should never be <Col N="429" /> there.  Now when they are one of the sole sources of income left to local authorities, we are expecting to treble them.  The Government will not have our support this time because we want to be reasonable with people.  People are paying high rents for their local authority houses and with the reduction in funding the local authorities cannot carry out repairs.  We will finish up with a stock of local authority houses that will fall to pieces because the tenants will be unable to repair them.  We are wiping our hands of the consequences of dismantling our whole investment in infrastructure.  For the sake of financial rectitude the Government are allowing all those local authority houses to crumble because it has been intimated to councils that they can no longer carry out repairs.  To add insult to injury local authority houses may be sold to the tenants.  Most tenants would welcome the opportunity to buy them but the local authority will not carry out the normal pre-sale repairs.</P>
    <P>The local authority will not be allowed to use the money from the sale of local authority houses in the same way as they could use it last year.  The ratio between revenue and capital income from the sale of local authority houses has been changed.  This will ensure that domestic rates which are left in local authority areas will inflict pain and suffering on small shopkeepers and small businesses. Those are the only two sources of funding left, apart from the grant which is smaller by £30 million this year.  It is not unreasonable and it is not playing politics to ask a Minister responsible for his Department to explain to this House and to elected members of local authorities how we are to protect our infrastructure, how we are to provide services for people who need services?  We cannot just wipe our hands.</P>
    <P>We initiated legislation on the control of dogs and on water pollution.  What happened to An Foras Forbartha?  It was wiped out.  An Foras Forbartha was an agency people could look to for some sort of understanding of their problems and was recognised by people as being independent of the Government and the <Col N="430" /> Opposition, with the courage to say what needed to be done.  Why was it abolished? What good reason can any Government give for abolishing a body which has a recognised independent and professional view of areas within the local authorities? Why have the County Committees of Agriculture been abolished &mdash; statutory bodies with elected members serving the industry and funded by local authorities? The Government cannot expect county councils to fund money directly to ACOT or any other body to deliver an advisory and an educational service to young farmers.</P>
    <P>Without representation there will be no taxation and <i>vice versa.</i>  If we do not have a voice at local level on the delivery of these services we will not deliver the funds from the rate-payers directly to ACOT at Frascati.  The Minister can put that in his pipe and smoke it.  That is what local democracy is about.  If you remove the elements of local democracy you will have to suffer the consequent lack of direct funding from county councils. What about urban councils?  What future have urban councils in the plan of campaign for the abolition of all local democracy by this Government?  It was tried once before.  Fortunately for the Minister, the man who tried it before is now in another party.  Perhaps we may be relieved of the worry that local democracy might suffer.  I hope that when people go before the electorate in whatever guise they present themselves, at least when they are elected they represent the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>I represent ordinary working people in the Tipperary electoral area, people who need houses, roads, sanitary services, refuse collection, and so on.  I assisted in trying to ensure that those who could afford it would pay reasonable contributions for services.  We also ensured there were waiver schemes for people who could not afford them.  We were not being unreasonable.  We bit the bullet when people in the Fianna Fáil Party said there should be no water charges. Councils dominated by the Fianna Fáil Party said they would not have charges. They even promised this year that there <Col N="431" /> would be no water charges.  Let us be consistent.  I ask Senator McGowan to be consistent about what we are trying to do.  Either we are a local democracy with local elected representatives with some power at national level, or we are just rubber stamps to central Government. If that is the concept of local democracy and of local authorities, I do not want to be part of it.  When I am elected I have to justify my every action.  That is what democracy is about.  You do the job to the best of your ability and you fail to get elected if you do not do the job.</P>
    <P>I cannot stand by and be a rubber stamp for a Government who decide that everything is now to be cut to the quick without putting something in its place.  If the Government want to come up with some alternative funding for local authorities they should tell us about it and the General Council of County Councils and all the other national bodies and local authority members and the municipal authorities of Ireland can discuss it. Elected members are responsible people. They have stated publicly that they are prepared to sit down and discuss other systems of funding.  Do not send us away to a wake before we are dead.  Let us come up with proposals to ease the system of national funding for local authorities. Let us do it, but do not remove the concept of local democracy without giving us an opportunity to fight for ourselves. I went on a deputation recently to Deputy O'Kennedy in the Department of Agriculture and Food because we were worried about the future role of county committees of agriculture.  He asked us to present documentary evidence to him on the role that the county committees play in the concept of agricultural advisory training.  We spent two months preparing the paper and since then we have been trying to see him.  He did not want to see us when we had it prepared, and overnight he abolished the county committees in these Estimates.  That is the problem about these Estimates.  In that Book of Estimates there are hidden dangers for all of us.  That goes for all Members: Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Independents, <Col N="432" /> Labour Party and all others. We are concerned about what is in that Book of Estimates but we are more concerned about what is not spelt out in the social welfare area and all other areas.</P>
    <P>The motion deals specifically with local authority funding.  I hope I have convinced Senator McGowan that I know something about local authorities as I have been elected to two of them.  If that is not sufficient qualification to speak about the system, I am extremely worried. In south Tipperary the Government cutbacks this year amount to £770,000, and £38,000 in the urban area.  What will happen this coming year?  Will it be twice as bad?  I do not know how we will strike a rate.  We are elected to do a job and this Government are making our task almost impossible because they have given us no option for an alternative system of funding.  We look for an alternative system to be put in place and then the Government can wash their hands of local authorities because we will look after ourselves.  Do not get rid of us because democracy starts at the grassroots, in the villages, towns and at the parish pump where all of us came from and let us not forget it.  When you come to Dublin you cannot forget where you come from.  I cannot and I am sure Senator McGowan will not be allowed to forget Donegal either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion. Such a motion is very timely.  It is important at this stage that local authorities have a very serious look at their activities and now is the time, given the Government's commitment to achieve a more efficient, more hardworking and more productive Ireland.  Now is the time for local authorities to have a hard critical look at themselves, to fit into that plan and to see how they can become more efficient and provide services in an efficient way.  The debate on local authorities and their future is now overdue and I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss them here in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little bit baffled by the motion when I saw it.  At first I thought the <Col N="433" /> Fine Gael movers of the motion were condemning the cuts in the rates support grant for local authorities and, incidentally, the first cuts in the rates support grant for local authorities commenced in 1982 under a Fine Gael Government. I understood that the Fine Gael Party yesterday very much welcomed the Estimates and went along with the broad consensus that we need to get the public finances under control.</P>
    <P>However, when I looked at the motion again I saw they are not quite condemning the cuts but they are condemning the cuts because they are indiscriminate and unplanned.  It is important to be clear about that.  I hope I have the right interpretation that they are not condemning the cuts but they are condemning the cuts because they are indiscriminate and unplanned.  First, I do not believe the cuts have been indiscriminate and unplanned.  I believe they have been planned right throughout the summer.  The Government have a very determined plan for local authorities which they have thought out.  It is my impression that they have a very decisive plan for local authorities and how they should develop in the next three years.  I would not say that the cuts have been unplanned in any.  They have been studied in great detail throughout the summer, probably when the rest of us were on holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will expand and it will take just a little while longer.  The Government's plan is that local authorities must become more efficient. Everybody is in agreement on that.  We all know the wastages which occur in local authorities as indeed in other institutions and organisations.  Senator McGowan in particular has outlined the wastages in Donegal County Council.  We all know that there is a similar story in respect of every other local authority.  Vast amounts of money are being wasted and squandered and the general taxpayer has now said they have had enough, that they want services provided in an efficient <Col N="434" /> way.  The general public have a right to expect that.  Local authorities now must become more efficient.  The time has come to stop wasteful expenditure.  The general public will not tolerate any more wastage of public funds.</P>
      <P>I would like also to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Flynn for making the levels of rate support grants available to local authorities earlier in the year even indeed before the publication of the Book of Estimates.  That was a great step, in that for the first time ever local authorities have an opportunity to sit down and examine in a very critical way their expenditure.  In particular the local authority managements for the first time ever are beginning to have an inward look at themselves.  Because the levels of rate support grants were available to them many weeks in advance, they, too, are having an inward look at themselves and asking how they can improve the services they provide to the public.  That is a very welcome step and I congratulate the Minister on it.  Most of the rates will be struck by the local authorities in November. That is a very welcome step also.</P>
      <P>The second part of the motion asks the Government how they propose to finance, secure and maintain services and employment in 1988.  I wonder is that a serious motion at all?  Everybody accepts that local authorities are over manned in a number of areas.  Let me point to the examples of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council in relation to their housing construction programme. There are 2,000 people employed in the housing construction section of these two authorities.  These include, architects, engineers and so on.  Yet not one single house will be built next year by these authorities.  Where is the rationale in that?  The general public are saying that kind of waste must be discontinued. There are vast amounts involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Government's redundancy package in an attempt to deal with this situation.  Local authorities are now at a critical stage and they have to change. The whole area of maintenance has to be looked at and that is something I am very familiar with particularly in Dublin <Col N="435" /> Corporation.  Everybody knows that the maintenance service provided by Dublin Corporation has to be one of the most inefficient services being provided.  I am not condemning anybody, either workers, or management.  I am just saying that is the situation that has developed over the years.  I could give examples for the rest of this evening of the way maintenance services are being provided.  The fact of the matter is that it is very difficult to get a maintenance job done.  It takes about three or four weeks.  This service is not being provided in an efficient way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one way to deal with maintenance is to change to a system of privatisation. I use the term reluctantly because it is a kind of dirty word in Irish politics at present although it is coming into vogue.  However, it is seriously being suggested that, given the dissatisfaction of the general public with the maintenance being provided by Dublin Corporation in particular &mdash; I am sure the same goes for the other local authorities throughout the country &mdash; privatisation might be the way to improve the situation.  That is an option which should be examined in the process of having a hard critical look at the functioning of local authorities.  It is an option which has to be looked at, too, given the state of the public finances and the finances of local authorities.  Given that the maintenance service is not being provided in a satisfactory way I think every encouragement should be given by the Government for local authority tenants to purchase their own homes.  That would save a significant amount of money in maintenance.  The government should pursue that vigorously during their term of office.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of charges has been raised.  I know different situations exist in different local authorities.  The position in Dublin city and county is that there are no service charges.  I think that is the correct decision at present.  It is far too easy for a city management or a city council or a county council to come along and say, &ldquo;sorry, our books do not balance so we are introducing charges,&rdquo; without <Col N="436" /> having a critical look at the operation of their services.  First we must have a critical look at the provision of services by local authorities with a view to achieving maximum efficiency.  Only then if the books do not balance should charges be considered but there should be no question of the imposition of charges in Dublin city until this inward look at the provision of services has taken place.</P>
    <P>Everybody is in agreement that the public finances until recently were out of control.  The Government are determined to bring this area under control. The Department of the Environment in particular in the past number of years have gone on a mad spending spree throughout the country.  The bills are now coming in for payment in respect of the huge commitments made by that Department. The cupboard is bare so one can understand totally the reason the Government are cutting back on the capital expenditure programme until such time as they sort out the huge debts which had been built up over the years in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>As I have been saying throughout my contribution the time has come for the local authorities to look at themselves, become efficient and eliminate the huge waste which occurs.  Only when that is done can the issue of reform be looked at.  There is no point in reforming, for want of a better word, a rotten system. We have to get the system in order first, get it efficient and get rid of the duplication and the waste.  Then the issue of reform of local government can be looked at.  I think every member of local authorities would welcome reforms.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the Government's determination to bring about national recovery.  Never have a Government in such a short space of time achieved so much and indeed achieved widespread support in the community.  They are proving themselves a very decisive Government and I am confident that when people look back on this time they will say the present Administration have been particularly good.  I am confident that, when the history of this country is <Col N="437" /> written, 1987 will be seen as a decisive turning point in the history of the development of this nation.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Haughey.  I do not know what divine right Dublin city has not to pay service charges when every other county in the country are paying such charges.  It is very unfair that we should have one system for part of the country and another for Dublin city which is the largest area in terms of population.  It would alleviate the problem a lot if charges were effected throughout the country.  As a member of a local authority I have experienced a few finance meetings in the past couple of weeks.  In Leitrim no new housing will be provided.  Sanitary services have been curtailed and will be done away with in the 1988 Estimates.  The average waiting list for water in the country is 5 per cent of the population but in Leitrim the figure is about 15 per cent.  It is very unfair that we have to forego sanitary and water supply services because we are a small, poor county.  It is also unfair that water charges are being imposed when we do not have a proper water service.  This is something I would ask the Minister to look at.  There is urgent need for housing in the county and seeing that we will have no money for building of new houses in next year's Estimate, local authorities are being strangled.  I would ask the Minister to contemplate putting money into the maintenance aspect of housing in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The workers in the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have been on strike since June in an attempt to prevent the redundancy of one of their colleagues and in an attempt to secure back payment of wages estimated to total £90,000.  I find it appalling that conditions in the ISPCC were such as to lead to a strike by some of what are quite manifestly the most dedicated child care workers in the country.  I am astonished, too, that the ISPCC management have refused to abide by the proposals put forward for settlement by the Labour Court.  The Labour Court proposals were reasonable but apparently they were unacceptable to the management of the ISPCC because the ISPCC seem to be <Col N="439" /> interested in nothing except total victory. It is difficult to understand or, indeed, to justify the carry-on of the management of the ISPCC over the past number of months.  They precipitated the strike. They implied to their own employees that if the strike went ahead they would consider closing down the entire service and they have now proceeded to attempt to raise funds from the public as recently as two weekends ago by way of a church gate collection in my own city of Cork, by door to door fund raising by paid fund raisers and also by accepting grants from the State which were meant to be provided to enable them to provide a service for deprived families.  Whatever about the fund raising from the public &mdash; and that raises serious ethical questions &mdash; there is a fundamental legal question raised by the apparent failure of the Government to ensure that the money provided by the State to the ISPCC is being used for the purpose intended.</P>
      <P>There are two issues which arise here. The first is the incontrovertible fact that much of the money provided in the past by the Department of Health had been given &mdash; and I have seen the letters accompanying some of these grants &mdash; in order to contribute towards wage increases for employees of the ISPCC. This is what was specifically referred to in the correspondence from the Department of Health.  Many, if not all, of these wage increases have not been paid to the employees of the ISPCC.  Therefore, the question arises as to whether the money is being used in accordance with not just the wishes but, indeed, the decision of the Oireachtas as to how those funds should be used.</P>
      <P>The second question relates to the utilisation of this year's grant from the Department of Health.  Quite clearly for almost five months now the ISPCC have provided virtually no service.  All of their centres are closed, all of their schools are closed and all of the other services they provide are not functioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult, therefore, to imagine how the grant being provided to them by the State can be used for the purpose for which it is intended.  If no services are <Col N="440" /> being provided it is very difficult to see how the grant can be used in the way that was intended.  It is, therefore, not just a question of an industrial dispute any more: it is a question of the proper use of public funds.  That is a matter for the Minister and the Government and no amount of hiding behind industrial relations legislation can escape that fact. What is at issue now is the use of public funds, funds which are subject to the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage the Minister and the Government to take an interest in this area I wrote on 17 September to the Comptroller and Auditor General asking him to take an interest in this area.  I am happy to report that he has told me that my concern has been noted and will be kept in mind in carrying out the current audit of the Department of Health.  It is no longer, therefore, a matter of whether the Minister wishes to be involved or not. He may not wish to be and perhaps he does wish to be.  Quite clearly, in order to satisfy the possible interest of the Comptroller and Auditor General it is the Minister's duty to deal with the ISPCC and to inquire of them formally as to how they are using their funds and, if necessary, to ensure that these funds are returned to the Department until such time as the Minister is satisfied that they are going to be used for the purpose for which they were intended which is to provide services and to pay a staff.</P>
    <P>I take no pleasure in having to raise an issue involving a voluntary organisation in this fashion.  I do not think anybody could enjoy the prospect of a substantial voluntary organisation being investigated. I am speaking as one who has a long history of involvement with a voluntary organisation.  However, the ISPCC have shown such an extraordinary unwillingness to enter into serious negotiations and have issued such extraordinary demands to their employees that the Minister has good reason at this stage to believe that the will on the part of the executive and management of the ISPCC to seek a solution to this dispute is completely lacking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> In an ordinary strike the executive and the management have something to lose. For instance, in a profit making company the company will lose money.  In this case there is no apparent loss to either the management or the executive members of this organisation and, therefore, there does not seem to be any external force other than the Minister which can put some pressure on them to negotiate a reasonable solution.  The evidence is overwhelming that the employees have been, almost to a fault, reasonable in their position.  They were willing to forego multiple thousands of pounds in back money because they understood the difficult financial position of the organisation. Nevertheless, the management shows no willingness to negotiate or talk to them.</P>
    <P>By way of an example of the extraordinary demands of the management I am aware that one of the conditions they have sought from their employees is that all correspondence arriving at headquarters should be opened by management. This would include letters to employees from their union, perhaps letters to employees from their banks, perhaps letters to employees from their insurance companies which perhaps are addressed to the ISPCC headquarters. When an organisation make demands like that of their employees nobody seriously imagines that they are expecting these conditions to be met.  One can easily imagine that what they are doing is putting unacceptable conditions up to prevent a solution being reached.  If this is their objective then I think the Minister has got to take action.  I have no doubt that if they wished to bring about a settlement they would not seek to have such extraordinary conditions imposed on their members.</P>
    <P>I wonder, therefore, am I being too harsh in saying that what you are seeing is a group of people behaving like tin pot generals seeking to make a battlefield in which they win against a particularly vulnerable section of their own employees.  That is what is really involved here.  It seems to be a macho exercise in <Col N="442" /> which people prove that they can deal with their own employees and the only person who can ensure that something different is the outcome is the Minister. The only way that the ISPCC executive and management can be persuaded to become flexible is if they face the prospect of their grant being withdrawn and indeed the quite serious and realistic possibility that if money provided for that organisation has been used in a way other than that voted by the Oireachtas then there would be a question of the personal liability of the executive for the misuse of public funds.  It is a matter for the Minister to investigate matters like that and it is up to the Minister to use the leverage that he quite clearly has to make a breakthrough possible.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will now tell this House that as a matter of urgency he proposes to raise with the ISPCC the question of what is being done with the funds that have been supplied by his Department this year and also what was done in previous years.  The Government may wish and choose to ignore the industrial relations aspect of it but they have a legal obligation to ensure that public funds are used in accordance with the wishes of the Oireachtas.  No member of the Government and no Government collectively can escape that responsibility. It is specifically referred to in the details of public expenditure in each year that the grants to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It must, therefore, be spent in accordance with the wishes of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if this society continues to fail to provide any service that the money cannot be spent in accordance with the wishes of the Oireachtas.  The question of what is being done with the money, therefore, arises and what has been done in the past with the money. That is a matter for the Minister and I would appeal to him to urgently seek discussions with the executive of the ISPCC to inquire of them what is being done with this money.  In the process of making that inquiry he should raise with <Col N="443" /> the members of the executive the question of the need for this strike, its possible resolution and the urgency of resolving the dispute if for no other reason than because the personal position of the executive of the ISPCC in regard to the way public funds are being used will be called into question if they do not resolve this strike immediately.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>What I rise to say is that I support to the letter everything Senator Ryan said.  I will not go over the story of what has happened out there but I would say to the Minister &mdash; I have worked with the Minister on a number of committees and I know his commitment, and I discussed this issue with him before and he certainly gave me an indication that he was sympathetic to the problems the workers were experiencing out there &mdash;to throw away the script for a minute and tell us what he feels on this issue.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about a group of workers, many of whom we have worked with and know very well.  I have seen them working in the most deprived parts of this country.  I have worked with some of them in Darndale in the north Dublin area in adult education and in the provision of all sorts of services.  They are people whose commitment is beyond question.  They are people who believe in what they are doing, who have added to the quality of life for the most deprived and under-privileged parts of our community. They do it in every part of the country.  They are being cast off at this stage and are being cast off mainly because there is an uncaring management in the organisation of the ISPCC.  They are uncaring or unaware.  Whichever it is, there is a clear duty on us as elected Members to insist that something be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> I have made efforts during the day to raise the matter of cuts.  I am saying now to the Minister that this is one cut he might consider putting a hold on until we know exactly where the money is going. I ask the Minister to consider having a full investigation of what is going on. These employees are prepared to give up to £80,000 of their money and put it aside for the sake of their work and the organisation they are committed to.  They are prepared to work long hours after hours and their commitment is beyond question. We should say to them: &ldquo;Yes, we appreciate your case and, yes, indeed we will investigate and we will see to it that public moneys are accounted for and we will indeed see to it that that money goes towards its intended purposes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to subscribe to the sentiments of this motion.  It is rather unfortunate that there is an exit of Members from the House when a Private Members' motion is being put before us here this evening, especially because of the sensitive way in which it has been moved by Senator Ryan.  It appears that this dispute is dragging on indefinitely.  I do not have the privilege of working, like Senator O'Toole, with some of these people as I live a long distance away but when I come here and see some of these ladies walking up and down the street daily for the past number of months, I think that if it is within the compass of the Minister to intervene he should do so.</P>
      <P>I am addressing this subject with a fair degree of ignorance but some of the comments and allegations made by Senator Ryan are obviously very serious. While the dispute continues if even one man-hour is lost in the sensitive area in which these workers are involved it is a very serious reflection on us as a House of the Oireachtas.  If we can exhort the Minister to use his good offices to become involved in one way or another we should do so.  I would certainly like to be associated, in a personal way, with the motion.</P>

      <P>I would like to <Col N="445" /> thank Senator Brendan Ryan for putting down the motion on the Adjournment and also to thank Senator O'Toole and Senator O'Callaghan for their contribution. As several of us are aware, there is unfortunately a strike in progress at the moment in the ISPCC.  There was a full Labour Court hearing on the matter in July last and a subsequent Labour Court recommendation was rejected by the management of the ISPCC.  My colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, has had a report on the situation from officials of his Department after talking to both sides.  Unfortunately the strike remains deadlocked.</P>
      <P>I, and the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, are naturally more concerned that the families and children in receipt of services from the ISPCC should continue to be deprived of these services for such a long period.  I must also recognise the work of the ISPCC and the staff over the years.  It is unfortunate that this strike is in progress.  In the circumstances I have requested officers of my Department to explore every possible avenue with a view to having the strike settled at the earliest possible opportunity.  This process is now in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some of the issues raised by Senators Ryan, O'Toole and Callaghan have been the subject of media <Col N="446" /> comment during the course of the strike. I must, however, say that it would be inappropriate for me at this stage to refer to these issues in the light of the initiative which we have taken.  I mean no discourtesy to the Senators and the House but I am loath to make any detailed public comment on any specific issue relating to the activities of the ISPCC lest it be misunderstood and possibly create further difficulties in relation to this matter. It is a very delicate situation.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned about this matter and are most anxious that it be resolved as quickly as possible.  We have taken note of the comments made by Senators here this evening and these will be examined by officials of my Department. At this stage I hope that the initiative which we have taken with the Minister for Labour will be successful and that this matter will be resolved because it is causing such hardship to the parents and children involved.  I personally know of the work of the ISPCC in my own constituency and I am particularly anxious as well from a policy point of view that this matter should be resolved.  We will do our utmost in this regard.</P>
