      <P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross regarding a motion which he wishes to move under Standing Order 29.  I now call on Senator Ross to give notice of his motion before I give my ruling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Seanad on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring consideration, the matter being that the Government immediately remove the growing doubts about their intention to implement the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, on December 1 and resists the pressures to delay it from their backbenchers in Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take items Nos. 2, 1, 3, 5, and 14.  It is intended that the Minister, when he is dealing with item No. 2 &mdash; the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1987 &mdash; will take the Clonmel Gas Order, 1987, simultaneously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House if he can make available to us the Taoiseach, possibly, or one of the Ministers who were involved in the negotiations over the weekend involving the interests of this country, as we are the only House of the Oireachtas now sitting? The facility of a discussion would normally be made available to the Dáil. As the Dáil is not sitting, I suggest that the Leader of the House might make the Taoiseach available to us to discuss the Heads of State meeting which in the perception of the media has not been sucessful as there is an English veto obviously on the final decisions, and the problems of the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1489" /> over the past weekend in which some agreement was reached which, obviously, is not to the benefit of Irish farmers, and the Minister for Tourism and Transport who had a meeting over the weekend in Luxembourg, the results of which were not to our satisfaction, either. As these are very important aspects, especially arising out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris, we are still on the Order of Business and, if Senator Ross cannot make a speech, you cannot make one either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but a discussion on these matters should be facilitated.  Could the Leader of the House make the Taoiseach available to us?  All these Ministers have been battling away at Councils of Ministers meetings in various European capitals and none of the results seems to be to our benefit.  Recently the Constitution was amended to allow the Single European Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have made your point and I think the Leader of the House has heard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the facility for such discussions should be made available to us.  I thank you for allowing me to ask him but it was the Leader of the House, through the Chair, whom I was asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly support the point made by Senator Ferris.  It is normal procedure when the Taoiseach returns from a European Council that he makes a full report to the other House. Since the other House is now in recess it would be useful, from the national point of view and from the point of view of the Taoiseach, if a full report could be made to the Seanad on the outcome of the European Council meeting just past and on the other important European meetings. Also on the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House what hours he proposes to sit over the coming weeks, if it will be the normal <Col N="1490" /> hours or if longer hours are envisaged.  Is it in order to welcome the new Clerk of the Seanad and to wish him well in his duties?  He has the respect of all Members of this House and those who have known him in the past know that he is going to be an outstanding success in the very onerous job he has taken on.  I would also like to say farewell to the outgoing Clerk, Mr. Tobin, who has given many long and fruitful years of service to Members of this House and to the institutions of the Oireachtas.  On behalf of my party I would like to wish him well in retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point, I would like to be associated with the good wishes which Senator Manning conveyed to the incoming Clerk of the Seanad, who I know is a graduate of UCC and I equally endorse his sentiments about the departing Clerk, Mr. Tobin, whom all of us in our first days here found to be a very great help.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I propose that Item No. 39 should be included.  That is the motion in the name of Senator Mooney <i>et al</i> proposing to delay the implementation of the Extradition Act. In making this proposal, I want to make a general point on the Order of Business, namely, that the Business of this House should always be flexible and certainly even more so if something becomes suddenly topical and, particularly as Senators Manning and Ferris have already said, if the other House is not in session.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach would be the first to agree that Seanad Éireann is the leading forum of public opinion when it is the only House sitting. Therefore, we should be flexible in ordering our business and adjusting it to serve a particular purpose.  On the particular matter, the topicality of Article 39, I would like to point out that in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday there was an article which referred to Senator Mooney's motion suggesting it was a form of pressure on the Taoiseach in anticipation of the Brussels summit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy, I did not allow Senator Ross to make a <Col N="1491" /> speech and I am certainly not going to allow you to make a speech now.  In my ten years of service in this House, and even long before I became a Member, I have appreciated, as the Senator does, the value of this House.  We are in the process of trying to change it but there are rules by which I have to abide &mdash; it is not my toughness in the Chair.  I would like to give the Senator, and indeed Senator Ross, the freedom of debating whatever you would like but I have rules to which I must adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I am making a totally different point from Senator Ross who was speaking under Article 29 of Standing Orders.  I am speaking on the Order of Business.  I am suggesting a particular reason why item No. 39 should be included in the Order of Business.  It is topical and I am trying to establish its topicality.  The topicality is due to the fact that the press have taken great notice of Senator Mooney's motion.  As I already said, <i>The Sunday Times</i> suggested that it brings pressure on the Taoiseach.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of last Monday suggested that the Taoiseach thinks sympathetically of Senator Mooney's motion.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> today I note that in a communique issued in Brussels, the Taoiseach has committed himself, and I quote &ldquo;to implementing all measures to defeat terrorism&rdquo; which surely must mean implementing the Extradition Act.  Therefore, there is an apparent contradiction between Senator Mooney's motion and what the Government propose.  The public at large and the House are entitled to know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion that item No. 39 be included in the Order of Business for similar reasons to Senator <Col N="1492" /> Murphy's.  The House has a right to have the position of the Taoiseach and Senator Mooney clarified on this issue because it appears that Fianna Fáil are speaking with two different voices on the issue of extradition.</P>

      <P>We in Fine Gael would not be prepared to give up our Private Members' Time this evening, but I would be very willing to talk to the Whips and to the Senators in question to see if this motion could be taken at an early date. This side of the House would like to have it debated at as early a date as possible.</P>

      <P>I would like an assurance from the Leader of the House that we will be taking item No. 27, the report of the all-party Committee on Women's Rights, before the House rises for the summer recess.  I am also deeply concerned about item No. 9 on the Order Paper in view of the fact that a Private Members' Bill on adoption was defeated in the other House.  There is great concern that there should be some movement in the debate on the adoption legislation and on the report on sexual violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the vote of congratulations extended to our new clerk, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, and welcome him back to the House.  When he served as Clerk-Assistant here he certainly gave excellent service and great cooperation to Members.  I wish him success and satisfaction in his new term as Clerk of this House.  As one of the longer serving Members of the House, I should like to be associated with the votes of good wishes to our retiring Clerk, Mr. Jack Tobin, who served as Clerk for the past <Col N="1493" /> 16 years.  Mr. Tobin was an exemplary public servant who spent some 40 years in the service of the Oireachtas and he carried out his duties with great distinction. I wish him long life and happiness in his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I too pay tribute to Mr. Jack Tobin.  I very sincerely welcome back our new Clerk and wish him well. In the past when tributes were being paid to colleagues in this House, for example to Senator Dooge, to Senators O'Leary, McGuinness, Eoin Ryan, Séamus de Brún, Flor O'Mahony and people like that I refrained from paying tributes as I felt that it might be considered that I was too big for my boots in speaking, but in the case of Jack Tobin it is different.  For a man who has given such valued service to the Seanad, to pay him a proper tribute I would have to be like William Cowper, the poet: &ldquo;I would need a lyre with other strings, /such help from heaven as some have feigned they drew, / An eloquence scarce given to mortals / New and undebased by praise of meaner things&rdquo;.  I do not have those considerations but I have one thing, that is, a desire to in some way pay the deep debt of gratitude that I owe to Mr. Tobin.  I have been very fortunate through life, because I have always had somebody to whom I could go for help. In the Seanad, Mr. Tobin was one of those.  My lasting memory of him was when he told me some time ago that everybody elected to this House can play a full part irrespective of their educational background, beliefs, party affiliations or whatever.  That has been a great help to me.  He is a wonderful man. Even when I met him speeding around corners when he was secretary to the Forum, he was always patient and helpful. It must be a great satisfaction to someone when at the end of a period in a difficult onerous position, he can look back on a job well done.  Mr. Tobin can indeed do that.  In that respect there is no need for anybody to pay a tribute to him.  I will finish in the words of the poet, William Cowper: &ldquo;But thou hast little need / There is a book by seraphs writ <Col N="1494" /> with beams of heavenly light / Wherein the eyes of God not seldom look / A chronicle of actions just and bright / There all thy deeds, my faithful colleague, shine / And since thou own'st that praise I spare thee mine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is just one final comment.  In my childhood we started off with a little school book which had a poem entitled &ldquo;Manners maketh the man&rdquo;.  I never lived up to the ideals expressed in the poem which said: &ldquo;At 10 or 40 'tis the same / The manners tell the tale and I discern the gentleman by signs that never fail&rdquo;.  By any yardstick Jack Tobin is a thorough gentleman.  I wish him well in in his retirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers. As the Fine Gael Whip I welcome Kieran Coughlan back as the Clerk and I hope to work very well with him as we did in the past.  It was an excellent choice and I am delighted at his appointment even though he is a Cork man, but we will forgive him for that.  I should also like to join in the tributes to Jack Tobin who was very helpful to me during the years he was in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with all that has been said by previous speakers.  I congratulate Kieran Coughlan on his appointment as Clerk of the Seanad.  He acted as Assistant-Clerk for some time and I am quite happy that he has returned to us.  I am confident that he will be as good a man as Jack Tobin. I do not expect him to be better than Jack Tobin, but to be as good will be great. Senator McDonald and I are the two who have served longest here with Jack Tobin. I always regarded him as a highly efficient officer of this House and a man who was most courtous and fair to everyone.  We are all very sorry that Mr. Tobin has retired from this House as he has reached <Col N="1495" /> the age limit.  I wish him many many happy years in retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with our colleagues in congratulating Kieran Coughlan on his return to this House.  Most of us paid him tribute when he was leaving us and said everything we wanted to say about Mr. Coughlan on that day.  Our sorrow at losing him was lessened by the fact that Miss Deirdre Lane took his place.  On that day I mentioned that Kieran Coughlan was the protégé of his superior officer, Jack Tobin.  Mr. Coughlan acquired valuable experience by being second in command to Mr. Tobin.  Now that Mr. Tobin has retired it is appropriate that we would pay our tribute to him.  He was an excellent officer of the House and was always helpful to Members, irrespective of which side of the House they sat on.  He will be sadly missed, both as the Clerk of this House and as the returning officer who was very helpful to all of us, especially when he deemed us to be elected.  We will miss him and I hope he has many happy years and good health in his retirement.  I welcome Mr. Coughlan back to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the tributes to the outgoing Clerk of the Seanad and also to the incoming one.  I assure you a Chathaoirleach that I do not wish to make a speech either on that topic or on the matter I wish to suggest.  I would like to know if there is a possibility of provision on the Order of Business for some statement of reassurance about a matter which was raised last week by my colleague, Senator Mary Robinson, that is, the fate of the Seanad Chamber and, in particular, the ceiling.  Since the reassurances were given last week I received detailed letters of concern from both the National Trust &mdash; An Taisce &mdash; and the Irish Georgian Society and I have also been approached by a colleague in the Fine Arts Department of Trinity College all of whom are concerned with this matter.  I am slightly confused because I understood last week <Col N="1496" /> that we had received reassurance and I wonder if that can be clarified in view of the receipt of these letters.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call on Senator Lanigan to conclude I would like to be associated with the tributes to the outgoing Clerk, Jack Tobin.  He has been Clerk of this House since I was elected in 1977.  I wish him well and long years in retirement.  I warmly welcome Kieran Coughlan back to the Seanad.  He acted as Assistant Clerk during the four years when I was Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House.  If the way he acted during that time is any indication of how he may act as Clerk of the Seanad I have no trouble in recommending him.  I wish Jack Tobin many happy years in retirement and I sincerely wish Kieran Coughlan well in his new appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start on the point raised by Senator Norris.  We will do a further check regarding the ceiling in the Chamber.  From what I can gather the concern arose because it was felt that by reason of a complete impression being taken of the ceiling, the whole ceiling was going to be replaced.  There is no intention to replace the whole ceiling but damage has been done which will have to be remedied.  It is important when one is dealing with a ceiling of that nature that a complete impression is taken so that if any further slight damage occurs there will be an impression of the original ceiling. If that is not assurance enough I can guarantee Senator Norris that we will take this matter up at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges today and get a further report on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning asked about the hours of sitting for the coming weeks.  We will not be sitting normal hours for the coming weeks.  It is the intention to start at 12 noon on Wednesday and to sit until 10 p.m.  It is intended to sit from 10.30 a.m. until at least 6 p.m. on Thursday. Depending on what way we get through business next week, it is intended to sit for three days the following week and that we sit extended hours.  The hours we <Col N="1497" /> will sit after next week will depend on the business we get through this week and next week.</P>
    <P>Senators Ross and Murphy suggested that we take item No. 39 out of order. Item No. 39 is not in the name of Paschal Mooney.  It is in the name of Fianna Fáil and the Fianna Fáil group will decide when that motion will be taken.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Fennell's request in relation to items Nos. 9 and 27, I can guarantee that item No. 9 will be taken before the summer adjournment and I will discuss the timing of the item No. 27 with the Minister.  It is the intention to have the various Bills that are to come before the House dealt with as a matter of priority and motions will be taken when we get through the Bills on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>With regard to the request made by Senator Ferris and backed by other Senators that the Taoiseach should come and address the House on the various items of interest which were debated at the Council meeting yesterday and the various other debates that have taken <Col N="1498" /> place in Europe over the past number of days, we will have a discussion with the Taoisach as soon as the Order of Business is fixed and will report back to the House. I may have misled the House earlier when I said the Order of Business would be items Nos. 2, 14, 1, 3 and 5.  It should be items Nos. 2, 14, 1 and 5.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Minister I want to make it clear to the House that we are now taking Second Stage of the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1987, and that, for the purpose of debate, <Col N="1500" /> Second Stage is being taken with the Clonmel Gas Order, 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke) Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to address the new Seanad.  I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and all the Senators on their election.  I wish to join in the expressions of congratulations to Mr. Coughlan on his appointment as Clerk of the Seanad and to extend good wishes to Mr. Tobin on his retirement.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware of the concerns I have expressed that the takeover of the assets of Dublin Gas by BGE be completed as quickly as possible, and that the Dublin city utility come under the full control and management of BGE so that safety, efficiency, and progressive development would be the hall-marks of the future.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking there are three main proposals in this Bill.  First, the Bill provides that the Minister for Energy can, by order, confer on BGE functions additional to those they have under the 1976 Act.  These functions will, in effect, provide BGE with the powers and duties which Dublin Gas have at present as a gas distribution utility.  The need for these additional functions for BGE arises from the fact that the 1976 Act saw BGE's role at that time as being essentially one of a gas wholesaler.  BGE's role will now cover retail distribution of natural gas as well as wholesaling.  BGE will be restricted by order, initially to retail distribution in the Dublin area.  The types of functions being assigned to BGE for their future Dublin operations can, by subsequent order, be extended to other areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I am increasing BGE's borrowing limit for capital purposes by £90 million, from the present £80 million to £170 million.  This is necessary because <Col N="1501" /> BGE's borrowings will rise by £66 million directly on account of the takeover due to the debts associated with the assets of Dublin Gas.  Further future development of the north east pipeline project and essential capital expenditure in Dublin over the next number of years account for the balance of the increase in the borrowing limit.</P>
    <P>The increased indebtedness of £66 million relating to Dublin Gas is inescapable because of the commitment made by the previous Government in a letter dated 22 April 1986 to the banks confirming the position that they had a prior charge on the assets of Dublin Gas and that the Government intended that all amounts due to the banks would be paid in full. I now expect that these loans will be rescheduled on more favourable terms than heretofore.  The net effect is, therefore, that BGE's cash outlay will only amount to £4 million for stamp duty, payable to the State.</P>
    <P>Contrary to previous practice I do not propose to increase the limit on guarantees by the Minister for Finance from its present level of £80 million.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I propose to increase the size of the board of BGE by two.  This is necessary in order that BGE's board will reflect its expanded role as a gas retailer. A wider range of interests now needs to be represented at board level.</P>
    <P>The discovery of natural gas in 1971 represented a major development in Irish energy.  Natural gas was originally supplied solely to NET for ammonia manufacture and to ESB for electricity generation and indeed, the Kinsale field could not have been developed without these two major offtakes.  Natural gas, however, is now widely available in all sectors of the economy and in many regions of the country.</P>
    <P>Dublin is by far the largest premium market for natural gas.  Dublin Gas have approximately 130,000 consumers and in 1986, 83 million therms of gas were sold compared with 34 million therms in 1983. The target is to get this to at least 124 million therms within the next few years. A number of marketing studies which have been undertaken in the past few <Col N="1502" /> years have indicated that this level of sales should be possible, though of course it will not be easy.  It will be a primary function of BGE and their management to ensure that this is achieved.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate events of the last six months or so have not helped.  Much work remains to be done to bring gas distribution in Dublin up to modern technical and commercial standards.  I am satisfied however, that, under the care of BGE, all the necessary steps will continue to be taken to ensure the integrity of the gas network and the safety of the public.  A great deal of the pipe network in Dublin was laid at a time when attention to safety was not as important as today and when it was impossible to foresee the volume of weight of traffic which now uses the streets of the city.  BGE have already appointed a member of their staff to oversee operations in Dublin Gas and the task of determining a policy for repair and replacement of mains which may be at risk has been started.  Remedial work will not have to wait the outcome of that study however.  Significant repairs and renewals have been underway all year and the Cremer and Warner reports on the Raglan and Dolphin House explosions have identified the categories most in need of attention.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company project was financed broadly 50:50 by a consortium of Irish and other banks and institutions, and by BGE.  The bank loans were to be repaid by 1991 and BGE's thereafter. From 1985 onwards the company encountered serious marketing and costs difficulties which it was not able to rectify. It seemed unable to get its costs and management structures under control. Mounting debts in the company and failure to pay outstanding sums of many millions of pounds due to BGE for gas, forced BGE to put in a receiver in April, 1986.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in the costs and operations of Dublin Gas have been achieved during the receivership, but further improvements on the marketing and operations fronts remain necessary if its future is to be assured.  Apart from the <Col N="1503" /> fact that the receiver cannot remain in place indefinitely, these improvements are unlikely to be fully achieved while uncertainty about the future remains. That uncertainty affects the customers and the staff of the company as well as the general public.</P>
    <P>In March 1987 following Government decisions designed to safeguard the Dublin Gas Company's customers and employees, BGE submitted a bid for the assets of Dublin Gas, and this has been successful.</P>
    <P>Here I would wish to make a few points very clear.  I remain convinced that the decision of my predecessors to bring natural gas to Dublin city was the correct one, despite the various upsets that have been encountered.  The chosen vehicle, Dublin Gas Company, did not achieve success for a variety of reasons, and in consequence, there was probably no option but to put in a receiver.  The alternatives of liquidation or an uncertain future under a bank receivership were hardly palatable.  The consumers of Dublin Gas would also be put to major expense for other cooking and heating systems, the employees of Dublin Gas would have been hit severely, and a large number of small contractors and subcontractors would have been ruined.  On top of all that, a valuable outlet for the sale of our gas would have been lost and BGE's large investment in the infrastructure of Dublin Gas would have gone for nought.</P>
    <P>In its passage through the Dáil a very full and open debate took place on this Bill.  Here I would like to compliment Deputies, whose contributions were both constructive and useful.</P>
    <P>A major, and understandable, concern of Deputies was in regard to the question of public safety.  This was only to be expected and I fully appreciate the concerns expressed.</P>
    <P>While I was unable to accept all amendments proposed on this point I assured the Dáil, just as I am now assuring the Seanad, that their concerns for safety are already covered in the Bill or will be dealt with in an order to be made <Col N="1504" /> under the Bill or in the context of the 1976 Act.  I undertook in the Dáil, and I repeat this undertaking here, that matters such as safety monitoring and audits and subsequent reporting arrangements will be dealt with in the order.  Let me stress yet again that the question of safety is paramount among my priorities for Dublin Gas and the Seanad may be assured that the very wide powers which this measure proposes to confer will be used to bring about a radically changed safety regime in that enterprise.</P>
    <P>The question of transparency of accounts relating to BGE's operations in Dublin arose in the Dáil debate and I accepted an amendment to provide for the necessary transparency which is now part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As has been agreed by the House it is the intention to include in the debate the Clonmel Gas Order, 1987.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act, 1920 provides for special orders to be made to enable new gas utilities to be constituted. These orders must be laid in draft before both Houses and their approval given before the orders are made.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this order is to establish the new Clonmel Gas Company as a gas undertaking.  Currently, Clonmel Corporation is the gas undertaker in the town under the Clonmel Corporation Act of 1895.  It has 1,800 customers and sells about 170,000 therms of gas per year.</P>
    <P>The new company, Clonmel Gas Company Limited, have already been incorporated and their Memorandum and Articles of Association will be confirmed by me under the Gas Regulation Act of 1982 as soon as this order is made.  The company are to be owned jointly by Bord Gáis, with 90 per cent of the equity, and by the corporation with the remaining 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Construction of the four kilometres of four inch diameter pipeline from the main Cork-Dublin pipeline at Ballyveelish to Clonmel commenced on 12 May and is now well advanced.  It is expected that this work will be complete, in a few weeks.  The cost of the construction project for BGE will be approximately <Col N="1505" /> £860,000 and the conversion of the Clonmel gas system to use natural gas will cost about £840,000.  Considerable amounts of Irish goods and services are being used on this project and will represent up to 80 per cent of the expenditure on it. Employment during the construction phase has been provided for 20 people and there will be about 50 additional jobs during the conversion programme.</P>
    <P>The making of this order clears the way for the new company to begin operations, and I recommend this motion to the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to return briefly to the Dublin Gas takeover.  I believe that with the proper care and attention, with hard work and concerted effort, BGE can run a successful and profitable gas undertaking in Dublin.  I am also confident that this new venture will have the full, loyal support of the workforce of BGE and Dublin Gas and I have no doubt that it will merit the support of the citizens and business community in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and the Draft Order on Clonmel to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>First let me welcome the Minister to the House as it is his first time to speak here as Minister for Energy.</P>
      <P>Natural gas both from the commercial viewpoint and the safety angle in particular has become the focus of great public concern in the past few months. Accordingly, Fine Gael support fully any sensible measures which are designed to help to clear up the present problems. The Gas (Amendment) Bill before us today is worthy, therefore, of serious consideration and, I believe, after some constructive criticism will deserve our full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of supply and distribution of natural gas throughout the country has changed dramatically since the forerunner of this Bill which was the Gas Act, 1976, which at the time established BGE as basically a wholesaler of natural gas.  Since then the question of supply and demand for natural gas has been the cause of much discussion as energy prices, particularly oil prices, <Col N="1506" /> soared and our own long term natural gas supply from the Kinsale Head field became a major attraction for Irish industrial and domestic consumers.  As towns throughout the country, so many of them far removed at the time from the original gas pipeline, sought at that stage and are still seeking an extension of the gas grid to their own localities, it is only proper that new legislation be enacted to deal with the new situation and the problems which may inevitably occur.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the question of safety of gas supplies must be addressed, as the Minister has said.  The events of the past year, particularly in the Dublin area where not just the Raglan House tragedy but many minor scares and house evacuations etc.  caused upset and worry, render it imperative to ensure that these problems will not recur.  The responsibility for safety in the Dublin Gas Company rested with the suppliers themselves and, while we all recognise that they did not disregard the problem, a major question must be raised as to the emphasis which they placed on the safety aspect. The problems of a commercial body in a difficult commercial environment are often so great that I consider it unlikely that their supervising of a safety problem would get the maximum priority which it deserves, and, indeed demands.  Therefore, I consider it vital to the safety of the natural gas consumers that an outside body or person with no direct links whatsoever with the Gas Company would have the power to oversee the safety aspects of gas supplies and have the power to act as he sees or they see fit to ensure maximum safety.  While the Bill continues to allow the board of the new company to be their own safety assessors, a position I am not happy about, I am glad that the Minister has indicated in the other House his willingness to order periodic safety checks and other actions that would allow safety accountability to be brought to light.  Also, it is important to the public, although it may be a case of disquiet, to be aware by public record of any minor gas leaks, unsuitable work practices or faulty materials found from time to time.  The safety aspect must be <Col N="1507" /> an ongoing question.  It is not a case of solved today and solve tomorrow.  That is why I say that only an outside person or body responsible to the Minister, not the company, is the surest guarantee of safety.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us primarily aims to end the long running and often unhappy saga of Dublin Gas by allowing for the final takeover of the private Dublin Gas Company by BGE.  The political ideologists among us may get a certain degree of satisfaction from the fact that a private company seem to have failed and that the State has been called upon to save the day.  Undoubtedly, the money invested by the State into the former Dublin Gas Company has turned out to be a costly investment, but it must be said that it was done in good faith with the agreement of most experts at the time.  Indeed, I welcome the Minister's remarks that he believed that the original decision to supply the Dublin market was a correct one, and he admitted that it was done in good faith.  The venture failed because of a variety of unforeseen circumstances, not just mismanagement.  Now we must hope that the new amalgamation will be more successful in ensuring a long term supply of gas to the consumer particularly in the main domestic market, the Dublin area, at a competitive rate and in the long term at no further cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The takeover of Dublin Gas by BGE necessitates an increase in BGE's borrowing power from £80 million to £170 million.  While I accept that this will allow the implementation of the necessary capital programme of investment in the gas network, I hope that it will not be a case of becoming out of control in terms of expenditure and loss limits.  It is vital that stringent limits be imposed on the amount of acceptable losses in the early years of the operation and that remedial action be taken if necessary if things are not going according to plan.  The fact that losses at Dublin Gas ran out of control should be a lesson, not an excuse for someone else to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has taken on the suggestion made, I believe, <Col N="1508" /> by the Fine Gael spokesman in the Dáil, to have separate audited accounts for the Dublin Gas area within the new company's accounts each year.  This should help to ensure that past mistakes will not be repeated and, more important, it will show BGE's shareholders, the taxpayer, that his money is being used and, it is to be hoped, bringing about improvements to the area.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the section dealing with the pension fund, section 4, allowing BGE to take over the administration of the existing Dublin Gas pension fund.  I welcome this important clause.  It is important for the workers and their families and I hope that any disquiet which some of the workers may have felt at being taken over by a new company, will be alleviated by that section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the construction of new pipelines and the export of natural gas and it is important that both of these be dealt with properly.  They are very relevant at present.  As I have mentioned, there is a growing demand from all parts of the country for an extension to the gas grid.  Without being parochial, let me say that I can see in Mallow town adjacent to me the positive benefits which have accrued from the supplying of natural gas to the Ballyclough Co-operative Creamery who are a major employer in that area.  Such benefit has been seen by other similar companies throughout the country, and I presume there will be the knock-on effect of many companies in towns which do not have a supply of natural gas seeking that the grid be extended to those areas.</P>
    <P>I suppose that the increasing demand for natural gas in the next few years will create some problems of its own.  The Kinsale gas field will not be a never-ending supply and, unfortunately, the fact that the Irish market is adequately supplied means that it is unlikely there will be any further exploration of gas fields under the present terms.  This is due to the fact that there is no advantage whatsoever for people to carry out further exploration work for the Irish market because there is a fairly low fixed <Col N="1509" /> price for gas on the domestic market and there are no provisions at the moment to allow for the exportation of gas to foreign markets.  Therefore, in order to ensure that a replacement supply will come on stream before the Kinsale field is exhausted, I hope intensive exploration will take place.  Unfortunately, this will only happen if over the next few years conditions change which will allow it to become an economic reality.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill allows for the exportation of natural gas only with the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  While there is nothing wrong with allowing it to happen only at the behest of the Minister, it would be appropriate if it was clarified whether gas will be exported if it becomes available in this country above and beyond the level of demand on the Irish market.  This would help somewhat in making gas exploration more attractive to the people in that field.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of gas exportation, I will refer briefly to the long drawn-out saga of a gas interconnector with the UK.  Perhaps it is not directly relevant to the Bill in that it is not mentioned in it but, however, it is covered in the section which states the Minister's permission is necessary for the exportation of gas.  I hope that as soon as possible the Minister will make a final decision on this matter, particularly with regard to the supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland.  This seems to have been under discussion for quite a long time: from time to time various reasons were given but nothing was done about the matter. It is understandable that the economic angle was considered but it is particularly worrying when we hear about the danger of terrorist activity and the fact that we were more or less being ordered by the bullyboys of the subversive organisations as to what we could and could not do.  I would like to hear the Minister's long term plans regarding the supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland.  If the people in Northern Ireland are willing to take the supply from us, I would like to hear how he will deal with the problems that may <Col N="1510" /> arise as a result.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill allows for the increase in numbers of the board of management from six to eight.  As the number of functions and responsibilities of the new board increase there is no harm whatsoever in increasing the numbers on the board.  I certainly would have no objection to it.  However, I hope the interests of the consumers, both domestic and industrial, will be represented on the board.  I must admit I do not know the present set-up of the board but I hope these groups will have representation on it once it is set up.</P>
    <P>Obviously I am far from an expert on the Clonmel gas situation.  I mentioned earlier that there was a great increase in the demand for a natural gas supply in many towns throughout the country and the Minister's order will regularise the position regarding Clonmel gas.  Obviously I support that and I hope, over the next few years, he will do the same for many other towns so that we can fully utilise this natural resource.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not very far-reaching but it certainly will help to solve the problems which exist at the moment.  Perhaps on Committee Stage we will tease out a few more specific problems with the Minister regarding safety factors, etc. and I am sure he will be more than willing to listen to us.  I fully support the Bill and I join with the Minister in commending it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to join with the other Senators in welcoming the Minister to the House.  This is a subject in which the House is very interested and we are all very much aware of the development potential of natural gas.  We are fortunate to have an energetic Minister who is very capable of handling this very important matter.  We welcome the takeover of Dublin Gas by Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is a natural development in so far as nobody can quantify the expense at the end of the day with all the repairs and the redevelopment of the pipe network in the city of Dublin.  I am sure the Minister will not settle for the very narrow line boundaries.  I understand the <Col N="1511" /> Minister has major plans for development of the horticultural industry in north County Dublin.  This is right and proper and the Minister would be very unwise not to think on those lines because we have prime land to be developed and this is one of the areas that must stand to benefit from the full development of natural gas in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I do not think any other company could take over Dublin Gas and administer the delivery and the service of gas in a pipe network that is old and unsuitable.  Those of us who are not from the city sympathise with the problems the city authorities have with the network, the many holes, the number of contractors and all the serious developments and major costs attached to those developments.  Even those of us who do not have gas and who may not in the long term have the full benefit of this very important energy realise it is important to the city.  We think that Bord Gáis Éireann are the proper people to handle the affairs of Dublin Gas.  If there is loss-making and if there are development charges which are not to the fore at the moment &mdash; and that is possible &mdash; then there is nobody better than those who supply gas to meet those unforeseen costs and development charges.  We welcome this development. It is right and proper and it has the broad support of all the Irish people.  For some time before this proposal was made there were fears about the future of the gas network in Dublin.  This Bill goes a long way to allay those fears and to help to indicate fully that this very important energy is going to be of benefit to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time a question arises which I hope the Minister will not mind me asking, that is, in regard to the new major commitments by Bord Gáis Éireann, who are now involved in the takeover of the gas network in Dublin.  I am certain the Minister will reassess the capability of Bord Gáis Éireann to further develop the pipelines.  This is important, especially to someone who comes from my neck of the woods.  I could not <Col N="1512" /> allow this occasion to pass without commenting on this and asking the Minister to reply.</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker I, too, would like to see the gas network extended to Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry and Belfast. I hope that is the ultimate plan and that we can achieve it despite all the difficulties, threats, lack of political co-operation and lack of willingness on the part of the British Government at the last minute to make a contribution sufficient to bring the pipeline to Belfast.  I hope the Minister and his colleagues in Government will persuade the authorities in Belfast, those administering on behalf of the British Government, to cooperate and ensure that the ultimate outcome will be that we will have a gas pipeline that will benefit major centres of the population in Northern Ireland.  I am less optimistic about the potential for gas to come from Dundalk to Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo and, ultimately, to Donegal.</P>
    <P>In the past when applications for funds were made to the European Regional Development Fund proposals were put forward and maps showed the areas where ultimately this service would be provided.  Having looked at the commitments that have to be undertaken, especially the development involved in the completion of the network in Dublin, I wonder is this feasible in the short term. In the long term, we have to state with some degree of clarity to those people living in Counties Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal exactly what is involved.  I am aware that the European Regional Development Fund is forward committed, and if the fund could help in any way, this is one of the areas where a major contribution would be expected.</P>
    <P>At meetings of local authorities, local and regional development organisations and organisations of many kinds, the question is asked: what of the future?  All too often people are unaware of major development costs.  Maybe they are difficult to forecast, but in fairness to the people who live in those areas, an indication would be helpful.  The Minister is honest and frank and is well able to state <Col N="1513" /> the exact situation.  This would be more than helpful to the people in the northwest and would have a consequential benefit so far as the European Regional Development Fund, which is so important to the west and Donegal, is concerned. In other words, the contribution that might come to Donegal for a number of years will not be part of a development fund which intended to bring gas to the west, including Donegal.  Maybe I am going around in circles trying to get the point across, but this is an important issue that has been raised constantly and I am using this opportunity to raise it when the Minister is in the Seanad.  I have no doubt that he is well able to answer these points because he is totally involved, committed and aware of the ultimate development possibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is very successful. He represents a good area in the north of Dublin.  I hope the benefit I previously mentioned will be a great asset to those who are earning their livelihood from the horticulture industry, and I am sure the Minister is also committed to that development.  It is important that the nation is kept well informed about what exactly we are doing.  Everybody should know these matters are discussed very often and I ask the Minister to make this information available to all.  I appreciate the opportunity to make this contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister, particularly as he has so speedily put into legislative effect the decisions of his predecessor, the then Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, who, in this legislation and in the Clonmel Gas Order, had developed the process to the stage where the Minister is now in a position to give it legislative effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few words to say about Clonmel Gas but first I will comment on Dublin Gas.  The way the private owners were handling what was a natural resource was a matter of grave concern to all &mdash; suppliers, users, the State as a whole and the people of Dublin.  The fact that they seemed to be unable to meet their responsibilities by providing the <Col N="1514" /> natural gas grid into the city was a matter of concern to all.</P>
    <P>It was a matter of amazement to some people when suddenly Bord Gáis Éireann had to put the company into receivership. It was unfortunate that shortly after that, some of the tragedies occurred in Dublin and became the responsibility of the receiver, through no fault of his own. Many of us had a lot of sympathy for him because he was appointed by the courts to a responsible position and had to answer to the media and the public generally for some of the anomalies which had arisen in the distribution of natural gas which led to tragedies in Raglan House and other places.  I am glad the Minister has, with this legislation, put the responsibility back into the hands of the State through Bord Gáis Éireann.  I support the Minister's measures and the Bill. We look forward to the orderly development and programme of repairs that are currently going ahead in the city to bring all the gas pipelines up to the standard the Minister requires.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister stating publicly that he wants the distribution grid to be top class.  As he said, a great deal of the network in Dublin was laid at a time when attention to safety was not as important as it is today.  That was the tragedy.  Many gas-lines were laid in the city without proper safety standards being observed or perhaps ageing or some sort of damage had taken place. With the advent of a new natural supply into the pipes, it was obvious that anomalies arose within the distribution network which led to some of the crisis in the city.  I am glad the work is now continuing apace.  The public can be assured that a public utility like Bord Gáis Éireann, not for commercial reasons but for safety reasons, will ensure that whatever capital investment is necessary, will be provided. In that sense, public utility or public ownership of a natural asset like this is paramount because the safety of users is as important as the commercial enterprise or the profit making that might arise in the long term.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has seen fit to continue down that road.  It is not an ideological hangup, <Col N="1515" /> it is just reality as the Minister found and as the previous Government also recognised.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the Clonmel Gas Order because I have been involved with that project over a number of years. Clonmel Corporation, because of an anomaly in the distribution network which led to a tragedy in the town with the loss of life, had the foresight, under their county manager, to replace the entire network in Clonmel at a time when funds were scarce.  They had a commitment to public ownership because Clonmel Corporation were running it but they also had a commitment to public safety.  As a result, they invested a lot of money in the infrastructural development of Clonmel Gas under the aegis of Clonmel Corporation.  Because Cork Gas &mdash; I refer to it as Cork Gas and not Dublin Gas &mdash; was so close to the town of Clonmel it was inevitable that a demand would arise for its extension into Clonmel to service domestic and industrial users.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that all the terms in the Bill are those negotiated with Clonmel Corporation, the Minister for Energy at the time, Deputy Spring, his Department and Bord Gáis Éireann.  There was a sense of goodwill among the three bodies to try to bring a solution to the problem of the distribution of natural gas in a town which had been using the old system under Clonmel Corporation.  All the terms set down in the Bill are those which we agreed after years of haggling among ourselves to try to come up with the best possible deal for the taxpayers, consumers and Clonmel Corporation who were then faced with the dilemma of having a massive bill which they were unable to meet from the normal rating procedures and which left them with debts they could not recoup from the Department of the Environment.  Giving legislative effect to that agreement is welcomed by everybody in my constituency. I welcome the fact that when the Bill is passed here today it will be part of our law and that all the work put into this legislation by the Minister and others will <Col N="1516" /> benefit everybody in Clonmel and the constituency of South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I would welcome its extension to other towns such as Tipperary and to the North as it should not be restricted to the main cities or adjacent towns.  We should try to facilitate as many people as possible; It is vitally important to industry and, in particular, to co-operatives.  I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome the Minister to the House as it is his first visit.  I do not intend to delay the passing of this Bill but I would like to make a few comments on it.  I am pleased that the Clonmel Gas Order, 1987, will be passed.  I would like to ask the Minister what the arrangements are to have the gas find extended to Kilkenny, which was mentioned earlier as one of the places which had an old gas company which dealt very efficiently with the gas needs of the housing estates in Kilkenny.  From surveys carried out, a large number of users of gas are prepared to take the natural gas.  Many industries will find that this energy source is relatively cheap and that the heat conversion rate is very high and efficient.  Certain industries will have an opportunity to have a fuel source in which they will not have to invest a large amount of money in stocks.  They can buy them as they use them.</P>
      <P>There has been much controversy over the supply of natural gas, particularly in the Dublin region, over the past number of months.  I am pleased the Minister has guaranteed that the work will now be organised in a more efficient manner than in the past as the situation seemed to be chaotic.  The number of potential dangers from the number of holes dug in Dublin is enormous.  Many people are very worried because of unfortunate accidents which took place in the gas grid.  However, if one looks at the number of incidents in which gas was the main cause one finds that many problems were associated with other forms of fuel or energy conversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that natural gas is used to its maximum.  The sooner the Dublin Company, under the aegis of BGE, get into full control of their own destiny, the <Col N="1517" /> better.  I sincerely hope that in the future we do not find ourselves in the situation this Government found themselves in relation to the inescapable commitments made by the previous Government in a letter dated 22 April to the banks which virtually gave them every penny of their indebtedness.  I hope the Minister will be able to come to some arrangements with the banks so that the moneys which have been guaranteed in that letter of indebtedness will be paid over a long period of time and the current problems in relation to finance will not be increased because of having to pay off this money in the short term.</P>
    <P>Dublin is by far the greatest user and the biggest potential user of natural gas. I am pleased the Minister is making arrangements for the extension of the gas grid northwards.  The main gas pipeline comes from Cork through the midlands and Kilkenny, Waterford and the south east should be able to avail of the gas; 7.58 per cent of disposable income is spent on piped gas in the eastern region, 1.12 per cent in the south east, 8.2 per cent in the south west, 1.37 per cent in the north east, but nothing in the mid west, west, Donegal and north west or the midlands.  In every one of those regions an average of about 35 per cent of disposable income is spent on electricity and an average of 30 per cent on coal and coke.  The importation of coal and coke is a burden which could be done away with if we had more efficient development of natural gas.</P>
    <P>There has been more money made out of the Leinster coalfields over the last ten years without any coal having been extracted than there has been out of any other of our natural energy reserves. Money has been made shifting paper between the stock markets in Canada, America and Great Britain which has not been to the benefit of our people.  Indeed it has created much disquiet in that area. I know this has nothing to do with the Bill before us but I am glad to note that the Minister has granted licences to people who are genuinely involved in the extraction of coal.  This should lead to a <Col N="1518" /> spin off benefit supplementing the gas already existent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome. I congratulate him on his appointment.  I fully endorse most of what he has done up to date.  I am somewhat worried about what he will do with regard to offshore exploration.  However, we will deal with those issues when they arise.  I do not disagree with what has been done about Dublin Gas but there are issues of economic energy and, to a certain extent, social policy tied up in this decision that need to be teased out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that needs to be identified is a phrase the Minister used in the course of his introductory remarks.  I should stress that there is nothing significant or sinister about my interpretation of this remark.  The Minister elaborated on why borrowing limits of Bord Gáis Éireann for capital purposes has been raised from the present £80 million to £170 million.  He said that this is necessary because Bord Gáis's borrowing will rise by £66 million directly on account of the takeover due to the debts associated with the assets of Dublin Gas. Therein lies a sorry tale.  I would not be quite as laudatory as the previous Labour Party speaker about the performance on this issue of his party Leader and of that party in Government.  There is a feeling among socialists that nationalising something means one has done something very good.  Unfortunately in this country the tendency has been to nationalise things when nobody else will take them on or operate them and there is no other hope. We saw recently the extraordinary cycle when the B &amp; I were nationalised because they had lost money.  Now because, in spite of the efforts of management and staff it is losing more money, the Progressive Democrats are proposing, as a solution, that the company should be privatised. I have a feeling that if, despite all their efforts &mdash; and I know Bord Gáis will do a good job &mdash; Dublin Gas still continue to be unsuccessful we will have about five years silence from the same apostles of private enterprise.  Then when Bord Gáis Éireann do not manage to <Col N="1519" /> make a success of it we will have the call for private enterprise to take it over, of course at that stage the State will have conveniently absorbed all the debts, will have paid off and accepted all the debts. Presumably then if one were so disposed one could sell off Dublin Gas at a premium to people who would be quite prepared to take on the job of selling gas on a network when the State had paid all the money.</P>
    <P>It has been said correctly that the Minister for Energy, the predecessor of Deputy Spring, paid out £124 million for a company worth £2.5 million.  That was done in the name of private enterprise. Contrary to expectations I do not have a strong view on whether the State should or should not own everything.  At this late stage in the 20th century the State has so many instruments of policy by way of legislation, regulation and control that effectively it can regulate and control any industry whether in the productive or services sector to an extent of which a 19th century socialist could never have dreamed.  No more is needed to take ownership of various areas of the economy in order to control them.  For instance the banks, however unsatisfactorily regulated, could easily be fully regulated to satisfy my political objective without any fundamental change in legislation.</P>
    <P>In terms of what happened Dublin Gas there has been a remarkable failure of analysis.  The country was entertained &mdash; in some ways not entirely amused by the entertainment &mdash; by the battle by various entrepreneurs to take over Dublin Gas not so many years ago.  These entrepreneurs were featured on the front covers of a variety of magazines as models of the hard, tough market-orientated business people we needed to get involved in our utilities.  There were implicit contrasts between these tough consumer market-orientated, profit-orientated people who were going to revitalise and transform Dublin Gas and the allegedly lethargic State sector epitomised in most of these people's eyes by the Electricity Supply Board.  It is <Col N="1520" /> extraordinary how this huge infusion of enterprise of risk-takers and of the entire expertise of the banking sector and a large part of the financial services sector resulted in such a glorious débacle.  Once the glorious débacle which Deputy Frank Cluskey quite accurately anticipated became a reality what everybody discovered was that it was all the fault of the workers of Dublin Gas because of all the privileges and perquisites they had had and all the work practices in which they had engaged.</P>
    <P>It needs to be said everywhere in this country that the reason people in management, in any enterprise or organisation, are paid twice or three times as much as the people they manage is that they carry the responsibility of management. Ultimately if a company are managed inefficiently or in a wasteful manner it is the responsibility of management. One can balk for ever about who is at fault but those responsible are the people who manage the enterprise or company.  Those who managed Dublin Gas or Cork Gas when it was a private concern were a disgrace to themselves, to the whole of management in this country, indeed to the whole idea of active entrepreneurial talent in the private sector. Their technical skills were inadequate, their financial projections totally haywire, their capacity to manage their labour forces almost nil.  One can only wonder at the blindness of the whole of our financial market, or the people who thought it a good idea at one stage to invest heavily in Dublin Gas.  There should be a question mark over the technical quality of many of the investment decisions taken by the private sector.  It has nothing whatever to do with politics or ideology, rather has it to do with quality and skills.  In terms of the Government's national strategy for development a real question mark hangs over the technical competence of many of those on whom it relies in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The quality of the performance of the Electricity Supply Board, their capacity to sell their services on a bitterly competitive international market in consultancy services, to the tune of £30 <Col N="1521" /> million a year is in stark contrast to the fact that, first, Dublin Gas failed.  Then having failed a receiver was appointed. Then when it turned out that not only had the company failed but that they had a serious safety risk on their hands they had to buy and import external expertise. The contrast between that and the remarkably successful record of the Electricity Supply Board does not prove any absolute point.  It simply proves that one gets from a company a performance related directly to the quality of its management. The ESB are fortunate, because of the way they have developed, in having high quality management, organisation and a capacity to respond to customer needs.  Anybody living in either Cork or Dublin who cares to compare the quality of customer service provided by the two different utilities, one in the public and the other in the private sector, will be in no doubt about that.  Having said that, we were placed in a position in which the service in Dublin was seriously threatened with possible closure and quite definite serious disruption.  In the climate obtaining had Dublin Gas been allowed close down even for a period of three or six months &mdash; which could have happened &mdash; the difficulties of persuading people to take the risk again of accepting natural gas a second time would have been insurmountable.  The whole idea of a consumer gas service in Dublin would have had to be abandoned.  Therefore somebody would have to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I do resent the fact that, as far as I can establish, the commercial banks who queued up at one stage to put money into Dublin Gas have effectively escaped with no or minuscule losses, while a hitherto extremely successful State agency Bord Gáis Éireann is now undertaking responsibility for the debts incurred by an unsuccessful private company.  I am beginning to get worried about the number of times in which the commercial incompetence of our major financial institutions had to be bailed out by the State.  We have had it in the case of PMPA, in the case of Allied Irish Banks and now we have it in the case of the <Col N="1522" /> debts incurred by Dublin Gas, large parts of which are owed to the private financial sector.  There is a serious question about whether we can really hope to have successful and forward looking entrepreneurial activity in a country where the financial institutions have such a record of incompetence and inadequate judgment.</P>
    <P>I am not persuaded that there is a purely economic argument for what has been done in bringing gas to Dublin.  I say this not through any Cork patriotism, because there is not necessarily any utilisation to which gas can be put on a scale in Cork which would use the entire production capacity.  There are reasons of national economic policy for using natural gas in Dublin.  It is important to realise that the single largest user of natural gas in Dublin is still the Electricity Supply Board.  The domestic consumers are a poor second to them.  The initial argument that the reason that gas should be brought to Dublin was to avoid the ESB using it all seems a little ridiculous when the single major largest consumer in Dublin is actually the same Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>That is why I am very sceptical about many of the free market economists who write for our newspapers and feature on our national television so frequently and who talk about international energy prices as the way to determine the efficient price for natural gas in this country. The truth is that if we were to try to sell Irish natural gas on the international market nobody would buy it because the cost of transporting it by tanker to where markets exist would be enormous because the cost of natural gas transporting tankers is enormous because refrigeration is involved and since we do not have a pipeline linking us to any international market.</P>
    <P>To start from a premise that we should be charging something comparable to international energy unit prices, to try to analyse what are the economic and policy decisions to be made about natural gas is to be living in a sort of cloud cuckooland that mostly the economists would attribute to those of us who would believe in the role of the State in developing the <Col N="1523" /> economy.  There is no international comparison which can be used to determine what is an optimum price for natural gas. Because of that, there are very good reasons on policy grounds, on development grounds, on the question of strategic energy independence, on minimisation of imports, for making a variety of uses of natural gas and not for any attempt to produce a free market model of how it should be used.  Therefore, it is only to be expected that when people try to use a free market model to justify the sale of natural gas in Dublin, the whole house of cards should have collapsed around their ears.</P>
    <P>In terms of analysing what is done with a resource like natural gas the best place to start is with a realistic commercial assessment of who will buy it, who can use it and how it can be used.  That is not to say that only a commercial assessment should be used.  I have long said that the idea that, because it is ours and because BGE are State owned, therefore BGE can be turned into a semi-social welfare organisation to bail out various areas of enterprise or various domestic gas suppliers is, to say the least, inadequate thinking and no great contribution to either the national wellbeing or the wellbeing of the whole concept of State enterprise.  Socialism is no excuse for sloppy thinking, though regrettably for many people on the left of the idea that something is nationalised is an excuse for avoiding actual serious challenges to themselves and to the whole economics that underline decisions about State investment.</P>
    <P>I repeat again what I have said at the beginning of these few remarks, that I accept there was no option but to give BGE the job of sustaining the domestic consumer gas service in Dublin.  I am certain that they will do a considerably better job than their predecessors.  If BGE in supplying natural gas as a consumer utility can be as successful as the ESB have been in supplying electricity, we shall have a model of how a State utility should operate.</P>
    <P>I regret that the banks yet again have <Col N="1524" /> been shielded from the consequences of their own incompetence.  I am astonished at the fact that over a number of years major banks have made policy mistakes on a scale that is almost unimaginable. Yet the same senior executives of those banks still feel both competent and qualified to lecture the rest of society about how our affairs should be run.  They describe themselves in the private sector as being accountable but there is no evident accountability in the banking sector where some of the extraordinary decisions of recent years were made.  Half the board of Allied Irish Banks, including most of the senior executives, should have been fired.  When one aircraft penetrated Soviet air defences the first person the Soviet Union fired was the Minister and the next person they fired was his deputy.</P>
    <P>That model should have been considered by Allied Irish Banks.</P>

      <P>I did not think the Minister would.  One of his blind spots is that he can look only in one direction and that is west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a presumption that safety and profitability are somehow at odds.  The idea that companies can be tempted to cut corners on safety in order to maximise profitability is an old fashioned socialist vision of how capitalism operates.  While it does happen, and the consultants that reported on the Raglan House explosion, Cremer and Warner, are one of the world's most eminent chemical engineering consultants, profitability and safety are mutually supportive.  In the area I am familiar with which is related to natural gas and which is the chemical industry, those companies which have been most progressive, radical and innovative in the area of safety investment and safety auditing, the whole area of loss prevention, with new insight into expanding safety, into the concept of loss prevention, have all been amongst the most successful in terms of wealth creation over the last 20 years.  ICI, DOW, <Col N="1525" /> Shell, any of the major multi-nationals have demonstrated something that people should begin to appreciate, that is, that a company who run a very effective safety policy are of necessity an efficient company.  They are an efficient company because every person understands what the company are doing, everybody knows who they are accountable to, everybody to whom somebody is accountable knows clearly what he is responsible for.  It is all these factors, training, accountability, responsibility, which make a company safe.</P>
    <P>The reason Dublin Gas ended up being unsafe was because of poor management, poor technical expertise, poor training, poor planning and poor organisation.  All of these areas are the responsibility of management.  If BGE can introduce those skills at management level the inevitable result will be an upgrading of safety.  Safety is a narrower concept than the whole idea of loss prevention.  Loss prevention is not just a question of avoiding explosions.  It is a question of minimising risks of explosions, damage to people, damage to the environment, etc.  The two things are mutually supportive.  An efficient company are a safe company. The idea that in any major utility which uses anything like natural gas there can be some short cut to profitability while avoiding the optimisation of safety, is totally false.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Can the Minister tell me what proportion of Dublin natural gas consumption is actually consumed by the Electricity Supply Board in Dublin? I am interested in whether the ESB are either the largest or one of the largest consumers of gas.  I have a notion that they consume a huge proportion of the total natural gas consumed in Dublin.</P>
    <P>One very trivial point which irritates me and other Members of the Oireachtas, is that Bord Gáis Éireann describe themselves as the Irish Gas Board.  I do not understand why Bord Gáis Éireann seem to feel embarrassed by using the title Oireachtas Éireann conferred on them.  Every citizen knows that Bord Gáis Éireann are the company who look after natural gas.  There is no commercial <Col N="1526" /> reason for Bord Gáis Éireann persisting in describing themselves as Irish Gas but there are good, ordinary, Irish reasons for using the title conferred on them.  We all know who CIE are and we all know who Aer Lingus are; they do not have to produce translations.</P>

      <P>CIE still exists.  CIE now have three subsidiary companies but CIE still exist as a holding company for the three subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>I am not a company lawyer nor am I an expert, but I do not understand why Dublin Gas have not been kept as a subsidiary company.  It would have been prudent to set up a subsidiary company with limited liabilities, separate from Bord Gáis Éireann, to look after Dublin Gas, other than have this position where all of the assets of Dublin Gas could effectively be in question if Dublin Gas were to run into serious financial risk.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already been welcomed to this House. May I add my voice also?  I know the Minister has never been a member of the Seanad, but if he ever should have that privilege I can assure him that he will find it a rewarding, refreshing and an eminently more civilised experience than membership of the other House.</P>
      <P>I am in a quandary this afternoon because I agree with almost everything that Senator Brendan Ryan has said.  For the second time today, I am substantially on the same side as he, in almost every detail of what he said on this Bill.  For that reason my remarks will be brief.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It was the sensible and the only option open to the Government. I am glad the Minister brought the proposals forward so quickly and is so obviously serious about putting them into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could probably be no greater contrast in terms of efficiency and performance or clarity of purpose than that between Bord Gáis Éireann and Dublin Gas.  BGE were set up with a clear man-date. <Col N="1527" /> They began life unencumbered with bad industrial relations or bad work practices.  They have set about their task over the past decade in an ordered way. Their contribution to this State has been significant and profitable.  It could perhaps have been even more profitable had it not had to work under constraints, rightly imposed, by various Governments in the past decade.  Dublin Gas could hardly be more different.  For many years they were a sleepy and inefficient private company who survived for one reason only, that was their monopoly position. The management structures were archaic, the management were aloof, ineffective, and out of touch.  The work-force was overmanned and inefficient. There were some appalling work practices. There were appalling areas of protection within the workforce.  The whole industrial relations structure was primitive and virtually no effort was made over the years to plough profits into research and development, and into updating the entire network of Dublin Gas.  In hindsight &mdash; again I find myself in agreement with Senator Brendan Ryan &mdash; when the ESB were being devised in 1925 and set up in 1927 &mdash; when one of the key decisions in the history of this State was taken, the decision that we would have our first nationalised industry, that the supply of energy was too important not to be under some form of State control, especially if it was be be a key to the industrialisation of the country &mdash; it was a great pity that the decision was not taken also to include gas within the national energy network as set up by the ESB.  Obviously, such a decision would have been totally at variance with the conventional wisdom of the twenties.</P>
    <P>It gives those of us who are involved in public life a certain satisfaction to look back at what the conventional wisdom, as expressed through the newspaper editorials of those days, was saying about even the very decision to take the supply of energy under nationalised control.  It was described as being not just an extreme form of socialism but it virtually had us on the way to Bolshevism of some <Col N="1528" /> sort.  The newspapers &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; the chambers of commerce and <i>The Irish Times</i> in particular, of that time, were wrong in the advice they gave to the infant State at that stage.  It should give us a little bit of perspective to read the editorials, especially in relation to those involved in the day to day taking of decisions where often the full facts cannot be made public immediately.  In hindsight it was a great pity that gas, which was then not in a very developed stage, was not brought under the aegis of the ESB because, as Senator Ryan said, whatever one can say about aspects of the ESB, they have been always in the forefront of modernisation.  They have always had the highest international standards in their engineering, and have been involved always in research and development. Indeed, many innovations which have been accepted internationally have come from the ESB.  They have played a very important part in selling consultancy services and earning hard cash for this country in a variety of international markets. They have always &mdash; this is the key area where I agree with Senator Ryan &mdash; seen themselves as an integral part of the public service.  Their function is to serve the State and the people of the State and to put public service ahead of any other factor or consideration.  How different that situation has been to that of Dublin Gas, whose performance over the years is one of the great public scandals.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech today was very fair and open about the options open to the Government now.  The decision taken is the right one.  I exclude from what I say about Dublin Gas the present receiver and staff who have had to work against great odds to try to make some sense of the situation, working against the accumulated years of neglect, inefficiency, bad engineering and bad industrial relations.  I feel sorry for Bord Gáis Éireann in having to take over Dublin Gas but I accept that it is the only realistic way in the circumstances.  If the standards shown by BGE in the past ten years are continued, eventually there will be a realistic and hopeful future for Dublin Gas, but that is a long way down the <Col N="1529" /> road.  The Minister will face many crises and many difficulties from that quarter in the coming years.  They will not be the fault of Bord Gáis Éireann but will be due to the accumulated inherited problems.</P>
    <P>The issue which dominates most people's thinking about the gas services at present is not the future of Dublin Gas but the ever-present question of safety. The Minister has shown himself to be very much aware of this and he has been very vigorous in turning his mind to it. He has assured us here today that the safety factors and the points made in this House and in the other House will be taken on board in an order which will be issued shortly.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister in somewhat more detail just what he has in mind because he knows as well as I do of the extreme concern in Dublin at present on the question of safety.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread belief that the full facts have simply not been made available.  It is not surprising that this belief persists when it is impossible to get any accurate estimate of the number of holes that have been dug in the streets of Dublin over the past number of months, when it is impossible to get any estimate as to how much more work needs to be done, when it is impossible to get any accurate indication as to just how bad the state of disrepair of the pipe systems is in this area and when daily the citizens of Dublin see the damage to the infrastructure of the city, to the roads and see the dangers the holes are causing when on occasion people fall or drive into them.  This obstruction is evident and one does not have to labour the point because it is there and it is causing great concern.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of safety has two aspects.  First will the Minister tell us when the order will be made, how elaborate it will be and just what he has in mind when he tells us that the safety factor is receiving, as I am sure it is, his urgent and detailed attention.  I would like to get some further details on that. Perhaps he would also give us reassurance of the independence of the monitoring services on safety for Dublin Gas. Concern was expressed in the other <Col N="1530" /> House about the independence of those who would monitor the safety of our gas system.  The independence of this body is something which needs to be spelled out.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives the Minister the opportunity to put at rest or at least to assuage the worries which have exercised so many people and public bodies on this issue over the past number of months.  I agree with Senator Ryan on the question of safety and profitability and it is very clear that only a safe network will be a profitable network.  On this occasion, as so often, the two needs coincide.</P>
    <P>This new regime for BGE could hardly be starting under worse circumstances. There is very little credibility among the people in the financial, the engineering, or the safety standards of Dublin Gas. BGE are facing a mammoth task.  It is a task which can only be accomplished if Bord Gáis Éireann are fully open and make fully available all of the facts concerning safety and the plans of what they intend to do with this lame and injured duck which they have so reluctantly inherited.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an urgent one, it is noncontroversial and it is to a great extent a rescue operation.  However the stakes are very high and if we want to see a viable gas service in Dublin and the drain on public funds stanched as a matter of urgency, the basic thrust behind this Bill is one which will be supported by all sides in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate and for the warm welcome thay have given to this Bill.  Senators Bradford, McGowan, Lanigan, Ferris, Ryan and Manning have in their own way in their contributions emphasised the question of safety.  I want to assure the Members of the Seanad and you, a Chathaoirligh that safety is a paramount feature of the Government's thinking on this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came into power in March the receivership in Dublin Gas was nearly a year in existence, there were the unfortunate tragedies after Christmas at Raglan House and Dolphin House.  The Cremer and Warner Report was being <Col N="1531" /> compiled, and the Government were not satisfied to leave a utility with 130,000 customers in the hands of a receiver.  No matter how good a job he was doing, a receivership was the wrong way to run that type of an organisation.  We felt that the best way to do it was to have BGE make a bid for Dublin Gas and to get this utility under proper management.  We had to strengthen the management of BGE considerably to take on this task. Safety was the one factor that was in front of our minds at all times.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House, as I did the lower House, that the Government will be insisting on the highest standards of safety at all times.  Already technical officers of my Department are monitoring the implementation of the Cremer and Warner Report which, as the Senators will be aware, was a report on the explosions at Raglan House and Dolphin House.  The report made specific recommendations with regard to action in various areas and, in particular, in relation to the operations of Dublin Gas. A technical official of my Department who has been allocated by me has been given the responsibility of monitoring the implementation by Dublin Gas of the recommendations of Cremer and Warner.  In advance of BGE taking over the Dublin Gas Company, they have sent a technical expert from their Cork operation, which is very good on the distribution side, to oversee standards and other safety aspects.  Everything that can be done in relation to safety is being done.</P>
    <P>We had a long debate on Committee Stage as to what measures are going to be taken on the order to be signed under section 2 of the Bill and a number of questions were asked by Senators in relation to this.  The heads of this Order under section 2 of the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1987, are already prepared and I want to assure the Members of the Seanad that there will be no delay in the signing of this order.  It will cover such areas as the laying of the pipes, the entry on premises, the appliances, the metering of the gas, the protection of the board's <Col N="1532" /> rights, general safety questions, emergencies, compensations, records of items such as, for example, those mentioned by Senator Bradford and Senator Manning and mentioned by Deputy Bruton in the other House, that is in relation to maintaining records of leak reports, leak investigations and repairs.  All of these items are included in the draft order which I have to send to the parliamentary draftsman and hopefully it will be signed very shortly.  I want to assure Senators that there will be no delay whatsoever in the signing of that order because safety, as I say, is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Again on the question of safety, natural gas &mdash; and this was emphasised in the Cremer and Warner Report &mdash; was not the cause of the Raglan House incident. That happened for other reasons which were laid out in the report.  Concentrating still on the safety aspect, let me say that I gave a guarantee in the Dáil that period safety checks and audits will be carried out.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford referred to the question of the accounts of BGE being presented in such a way as to show transparency in relation to Dublin Gas.  I want to assure the Seanad that the commitment has been given and the amendment that was proposed in the Dáil has been accepted in relation to a separate set of accounts for Dublin Gas which will appear in the overall accounts of BGE. The pension fund section was put in because we believe the workers of Dublin Gas should be fully protected as far as their pension rights are concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of exploration and export of gas is receiving considerable attention at the moment because we believe that we have as a nation to involve ourselves in an extensive exploration programme. I am involved in negotiations at present and will be making an announcement shortly in relation to exploration terms on gas and oil.  The question of gas going to Northern Ireland was raised by Senator McGowan and by Senator Bradford. The Government took a decision to extend the gas pipeline through north County Dublin for the benefit of the horticultural industry there and also <Col N="1533" /> through Drogheda to Dundalk, to give the capacity for us to go north and northwest, but we have to go as far as Dundalk first.</P>
    <P>Many of the points raised by Senator McGowan were related to a general energy policy.  I should like to inform the Seanad, and to take the opportunity of saying so publicly, that the Government have taken a decision to publish an energy policy and work on that is already underway in the Department.  I hope to be in a position to publish a full energy policy document &mdash; a comprehensive policy document &mdash; before the end of the year.  That also covers a number of points raised by Senator Ryan regarding the question of whether the gas system should have been extended from Cork, whether the pipeline should have come to Dublin, whether it would have been better to use it in other places around the country or what should have been done? We want to look at the whole relationship between gas, electricity, turf and all other energy sources &mdash; imported fuel oils and so on &mdash; our exploration programme and our whole energy policy.  We believe it is time to look at it at this stage.  The work is already under way.</P>
    <P>I fully support the point made by Senator McGowan regarding the north County Dublin horticultural area.  The potential of our horticultural area in this country is great.  It is a scandal that we are importing so much of the food that we could produce at home.  The provision of natural gas will be of great benefit to the horticultural community.  So far as extending the gas to Northern Ireland is concerned, as I have said, we are taking it as far as Dundalk.  The next step will be to go north west if that is to be decided. I had discussions within the past three or four weeks with the gas interests in the North.  They have made a submission to me as to how they feel we in the Republic could be helpful to them.  That is being examined at present.  I cannot go any further on it at this stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris expressed a certain amazement that in April of 1986 BGE suddenly found themselves having to put <Col N="1534" /> in a receiver.  I am amazed at Senator Ferris's amazement because the former Tánaiste &mdash; and I do not want to bring politics into this discussion &mdash; in the late summer of 1985 had been told of the problems of Dublin Gas at the time and unfortunately did not take any remedial measures.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to Kilkenny. The work in Kilkenny will start as soon as the Clonmel project is finished.  So far as safety in Dublin in concerned, again this was mentioned by Senator Lanigan, after the tragedy in Raglan House there was a general increase in the number of reports of gas leaks to the extent that there was at one stage over 3,000 holes around the city.  These have been reduced to 200 and I can assure the House I am doing everything I can to ensure that there is as little disturbance as possible to the citizens of Dublin, to the business community of Dublin and to the tourists. Disturbance is one thing but safety must be the primary concern.  Reference was made by Senator Ryan to the increase in the borrowing limit.  That is what this Bill is about.  He wondered if BGE would make a success of it.  I assure the Senator that it is my view that BGE will make a success of the Dublin takeover.  The citizens and business community of Dublin generally can have confidence in Dublin Gas under BGE's management. I have no doubt that we will work to achieve the rates of gas sales we require to make this a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan entered into a long debate on private versus public enterprise which I am not going to follow at this stage.  That is for himself.  So far as the ESB question is concerned, they have benefited by gas coming to Dublin.  They use about one-third of the total gas supplied at present.  The Senator asked a question with regard to a subsidiary.  The question of working on the basis of a subsidiary or of a complete take over was argued by the previous Government who had a report in this regard carried out. The then Government decided on the basis of a full takeover and I had no reason to change that.  I accept fully the arguments put forward by the previous <Col N="1535" /> Administration and in the independent report on the suggested organisation as well.  The line we are taking is the only line possible.  In addition to mentioning the ESB Senator Manning referred to the record of the work practices.  There have been, as in relation to many other organisations, criticisms of the work practices of the Gas Company workers.  I am confident &mdash; and I said this in the final part of my speech &mdash; that with proper care and attention and with hard work and concentrated effort, BGE can run a successful and profitable gas undertaking.  I am also confident that the new venture &mdash; the extended BGE &mdash; will have the full and loyal support of the workforce of BGE and Dublin Gas.  I have no doubt it will merit the support of the citizens in the business community in Dublin.  I am confident that the workers of Dublin Gas, like any other workers, will respond to good management once they know the direction in which their company are going and that their future is secure.  The workers of Dublin Gas are no different from any other workers in the country and will respond in a positive way to proper management and proper direction.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members of the Seanad for the welcome I received on this, my first visit to the present Seanad.  I thank them also for the welcome they have given to the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Services Bill before the House today is designed to give legislative effect to a number of decisions contained in the White Paper on Manpower Policy published last September. These include: (a) the amalgamation of the manpower agencies into a single body; and (b) changing the youth employment levy into a general employment and training levy which can be used for all age groups and not be confined to under 25s, as at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill is broadly similar to the National Employment and Training Authority Bill which was introduced in the Dáil in November 1986 and which lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil in January last.  The major change from that Bill is the exclusion of CERT from the proposed amalgamation of the existing agencies.  This decision was taken against a background of CERT's close involvement with the tourism sector which has been identified by the Government as an area with growth potential.  The Government considered it unwise at this stage to change the status of CERT which has a major role to play in the development of the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been criticism of the level of support given by the hotel and catering industry towards the cost of training carried out by CERT.  The value of CERT's contribution to the industry is well known and has been publicly acknowledged on many occasions.  I have, therefore, initiated consultations with a view to securing a substantial increase in financial support from the <Col N="1537" /> industry over the next few years with an initial target of £500,000 for 1988.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the Dáil there was agreement on the general provisions of this Bill and I am confident that the same general support will be forthcoming in this House.  The major provision in the Bill is the establishment of An Foras Áiseanna Saothar, FÁS, through the amalgamation of AnCO, the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency.  These three bodies have contributed to the general economic development of the country and in more recent times have been to the forefront in the battle against unemployment.</P>
    <P>In a situation of high unemployment, however, where the agencies are directing their considerable energies at the unemployed, it is important to ensure that their resources are used in the most coherent and efficient manner.  This will benefit both the users of the service and the taxpayer.  The proposal to merge the bodies is prompted by the need to provide the best service possible for the public and to eliminate the confusion in people's minds about who does what.  The new body will provide the gateway for the unemployed to the wide range of employment and training programmes available.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the Dáil, I propose to have FÁS established with effect from 1 January 1988.  There are certain advantages in choosing this date in that it will coincide with the start of the financial year.  In addition, it will allow me time to have the necessary arrangements in place including the appointment of the board and the director general of FÁS.</P>
    <P>The main functions of FÁS are set out in section 4 of the Bill.  They include the operation of training, re-training, work experience and similar manpower programmes, the provision of placement and guidance services and support for cooperative and community-based enterprises.</P>
    <P>The tasks facing FÁS are formidable and challenging.  We have nearly a quarter of a million unemployed and our labour force is increasing despite migration.  One of the features of the <Col N="1538" /> steady rise in unemployment has been the growth in the numbers unemployed for more than a year.</P>
    <P>Assistance for the long term unemployed and the unemployed generally is now being provided in a systematic way through the Jobsearch programme. Under the programme the manpower agencies will interview 150,000 people currently on the live register; provide up to 40,000 manpower opportunities for them; and provide places for a further 12,000 persons on a four week Jobsearch training course specially devised and operated by AnCO.  Generally speaking, we are on schedule to meet these targets. The programme could not have got off the ground as quickly as it did but for the wholehearted commitment and support of the staff in the manpower agencies.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in the numbers attending second and third level educational institutions, the numbers leaving school with minimum educational qualifications have remained relatively constant over the past number of years at about 5,000 per annum.  There is a need to assist these young people through special labour market and educational interventions.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to develop our workforce so as to increase the competitiveness which is essential to the future development of the Irish economy and the preservation and growth of employment.  I do not believe in training simply for the sake of training.  But I do believe that training is a decisive element in skill modernisation, effectiveness and occupational mobility of workers throughout their working lives.  I also believe that industry must accept primary responsibility in this area.  Our future development depends upon our people producing goods and services which we can sell in the world market place.  The goods being demanded and the methods of production are changing at a rate that could not have been envisaged 15 years ago when we entered the EC.  Industry is in the best position to identify and anticipate its skill and training needs. FÁS will assist industry in this task.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to encourage <Col N="1539" /> enterprise at both the individual and community level.  It is important to assist employment growth in this area by helping people, particularly the unemployed, to start up new businesses and enterprises. This is being done through the enterprise scheme, start your own business courses and the community enterprise programme and the initial efforts have been very encouraging.  FÁS will have an important role in developing and co-ordinating these programmes.</P>
    <P>Another important function of FÁS will be the provision of pre-departure information and advice to persons contemplating employment abroad.  Up to now this function has been the responsibility of the National Manpower Service under their obligations imposed by the EC regulations governing the free movement of workers within the Community. The amalgamation of the three bodies will ensure that persons trying to decide whether to go abroad or remain at home will be fully briefed on the training and other opportunities available to them here so that they can make an informed choice.  If, in the end, they elect to seek employment abroad, FÁS will provide them with the best information and advice at their disposal.</P>
    <P>These examples of the work of FÁS help to illustrate that there will be no shortage of work for them in the foreseeable future in the manpower area.  The work will involve, to a large extent, face to face contacts between the personnel of FÁS and the general public.  The quality of service provided will depend largely on the commitment and dedication of the staff.  I have no doubt that this commitment will be forthcoming especially as the work of FÁS, while assisting the community, will also provide a real sense of purpose and job satisfaction to their employees.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the staff of the three existing manpower agencies in recent years clearly show their potential to cope with the challenges of a changing labour market.  It is entirely appropriate that this Bill should seek to minimise uncertainty for such staff as to their <Col N="1540" /> employment in the new organisation. Accordingly section 7, which provides for the transfer of staff from the three bodies to FÁS together with section 8, sets out to ensure that their existing conditions of employment are protected by providing that there will be no lessening in pay or terms and conditions of service.  I am also of the view that staff interests can make a significant contribution in the consultation process during the coming months.</P>
    <P>The scope and scale of work to be done will require FÁS to maximise the use of the staff resources at their disposal.  This would see FÁS dealing with any imbalances in staffing as between their different services by deploying staff as required to the areas most in need.  I should like to make it clear that this integration of manpower services is not intended to involve any large scale dismantling of existing services.  On the contrary it should see their rapid adaptation from a relatively centralised approach to a more accessible regionalised structure.  The prospect of continuous support from the European Social Fund should further help to underline the future development and maintenance of a wide range of programmes by FÁS, fully utilising the expertise, experience and adaptability of the staff for existing services.</P>
    <P>The other main provision in the Bill is the changing of the youth employment levy into a general employment and training levy.  The decision was taken in the context of the changing age structure of the labour force and the unemployed.  By 1990 over half the work-force will be in the 25-44 age group.  This will give FÁS more scope and flexibility in the allocation of resources and will enable programmes to be adjusted in response to labour market developments.  It will also reduce the cumbersome administrative constraints required in the allocation of funds between the different bodies and different age groups as at present.  This does not mean there will be a reduction in the provision for youth.  I would foresee a major youth dimension in the work of FÁS.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> The Bill also empowers FÁS to undertake consultancy work overseas on a commercial basis in line with Government policy.  This is likely to be an important feature of the new body's activities in the years ahead.  Over the past few years AnCO, particularly, have identified commercial possibilities for the export of their training expertise.  Most recently AnCO were successful in securing a major sub-contract, worth about £4 million, as part of a £20 million World Bank project to improve the organisation and standards of training in Indonesia. Overseas contracts for training and employment schemes will be handled by a subsidiary company which will be set up under sections 4 (6) and 4 (7) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Changes in our manpower agencies will not of themselves solve all the problems in the manpower area if the Minister and Department of Labour do not take on the enlarged role of formulating, co-ordinating and evaluating policy, as envisaged in the White Paper on Manpower policy.  I accept that in the past manpower policy has not always been placed within a broad general economic and social framework.  There is a relationship between our training programmes and what is done within the educational system.  There is a connection between the payment of unemployment compensation and assistance being given by the National Manpower Service to the unemployed.  Training activities make a major contribution to the development of industry.  The only logical way to achieve a proper relationship and interface between our manpower services and economic, social and educational services is for the policy function to rest clearly with the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, to strike a proper balance between, on the one hand, exercise of effective policy and financial control by the Minister and, on the other hand, allowing the management of FÁS to get on with the job. This I have endeavoured to do in section 12 of the Bill.  While FÁS must obtain the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance for their plans for the following <Col N="1542" /> year they will still have a considerable degree of flexibility in conducting their day-to-day operations within the prevailing agreed policy framework.  FÁS will, of course, contribute to the formulation of policy by giving advice to the Department and the Minister based on their knowledge of the labour market and the operation of programmes. Under section 17, the Minister may give a direction to FÁS to carry out specified activities.</P>
    <P>The success of FÁS will depend on how well they cater for the needs of different regions and areas in the country.  This Government stated in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> their commitment to the development of the manpower services on a fully regionalised basis.  It is my intention that FÁS should move rapidly to the provision of services more efficiently at local and regional level.  This will also involve the development of closer co-ordination with the education and social welfare systems.  A greater degree of devolution of decision making to local level will lead to more flexibility and innovation which can only improve the services to the unemployed, school leavers, the deprived and the unqualified. My policy on the regional and local delivery of services, decision making and cooperation with other relevant bodies will be reflected in the structure of the new body and will form part of the policy guidelines which will be conveyed to FÁS.</P>
    <P>The board of FÁS will consist of 17 members, including the chairman.  In deciding on the composition of the board, the conflicting objectives of having bodies which are active in the labour market represented on them had to be reconciled with the need for effectiveness and efficiency.  The achievement of this latter objective has, of necessity, meant a level of representation for some interests below what they would consider desirable.</P>
    <P>The board of FÁS will be appointed by the Minister for Labour.  The board will consist of four representatives nominated by the ICTU; four representatives nominated <Col N="1543" /> by employer organisations; one representative of educational interests; one representative of social welfare interests; one representative nominated by youth organisations; two representatives of the employees of FÁS and one representative from each of the Departments of Labour and Finance.  In addition, the Minister will appoint the chairman and one other representative. The board will comprise 15 members until the appointment of the two employee representatives following an election among the staff.</P>
    <P>Other policies and in particular macroeconomic policy impinge on manpower policy and we therefore considered it necessary and useful to have a Department of Finance representative on the board of FÁS.  This will help not only in the formulation of policy for FÁS but the first hand experience and knowledge of the activities of FÁS will assist in the consideration and approval of the reports to be submitted by FÁS under sections 11 and 12.</P>
    <P>The new body are clearly an economic development organisation with a major social orientation.  They will be operating in a dynamic situation and will need to respond quickly and flexibly.  I believe the title which I have opted for, An Foras Áiseanna Saothair, best describes the mission of the new body.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liomsa ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Saothair go dtí an Teach seo, agus fáilte a chur roimh an nBille seo, an Bille um Áiseanna Saothair, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC in their 1985 publication entitled <i>Manpower Policy in Ireland</i> on page 23 said: &ldquo;The economic and social environment within which manpower policy must operate has altered radically in the course of the two decades since 1965.&rdquo;  In that context, therefore, I welcome the timely introduction of this Bill, the Labour Services Bill, 1987, a Bill which, as the Minister has indicated, is almost a verbatim and carbon copy of the National Employment and Training <Col N="1544" /> Authority Bill, 1986, which was introduced into Dáil Éireann by the previous Administration in November 1986, a Bill the legislative provisions of which arose from the White Paper on Manpower Policy published by the previous Government in September 1986.  This is a Bill the major provision of which is to establish An Foras Áiseanna Saothair, now to be known as FÁS, through the amalgamation of the three existing bodies, An Comhairle Oiliúna, the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the new policy directions identified in the White Paper on Manpower Policy and in this Bill and the improved penetration and effectiveness of the existing agencies can be achieved, and can be best achieved by integrating the existing manpower agencies into one body.  There are, I believe, compelling reasons supporting a single integrated organisation, for there is and there has been much confusion in the minds of the public as to who does what. The existence of a number of bodies makes it more difficult to establish clear priorities between the various programmes and to place these activities within a comprehensive social and economic framework.</P>
    <P>The increasing rate of change demands quick decisions and points to the need for a single body rather than a multi-pronged response.  The establishment of a single body should lead to economies of scale and better integration of the services. The area of concentration of the new body will vary from time to time, as the Minister has indicated, and mobility and flexibility will, therefore, be required on the part of the staff of the new foras.</P>
    <P>For example, an observer looking at the work of AnCO, who were established in 1967, and the National Manpower Service, who were established in 1971, could scarcely have foreseen the extent of the training and the employment schemes being mounted by these agencies today and the relative shift in emphasis towards employment schemes.  The provisions in this Bill which deal with the arrangements for the transfer of staff from the <Col N="1545" /> existing bodies to the new Authority are unchanged from those of the original National Employment and Training Authority Bill, 1986.  I am pleased with the Minister's assurance that it is the intention to safeguard the existing terms and conditions of employment of all people involved.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to go further and to endorse the recommendation of the NESC in <i>Manpower Policy in Ireland</i> when they state on page 33:</P>
    <P>We wish to emphasise that in recommending the integration of existing agencies we envisage it as being a real amalgamation.  We do not have in mind something marginally more than a mere change of name with a largely ineffectual higher management tier with operational components which consist essentially of existing agencies. Our proposals involve abolishing all existing agencies and reorganising them within a more coherent and efficient framework.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Minister in paying special tribute to the excellent work being done and continuing to be done by the staff of the existing manpower agencies.  These bodies have served our country well over these past years.  This can be seen from the fact that in 1987 An Comhairle Oiliúna will train about 35,000 people; the National Manpower Service will place about 28,000 people on unemployment schemes and the Youth Employment Agency will assist about 5,000 young people in addition to their research and co-ordinating role.  Many of the staff of these organisations take a justifiable and legitimate pride in their work.  I hope the new integrated body will maintain the high morale and dedication already there and that they will utilise this morale to the fullest extent for the benefit of our country.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Schedule to the Bill deals with the composition of the board of the new body.  It endeavours to combine the best compromise between being representative of the organisations which are active in the labour market and being <Col N="1546" /> effective and efficient.  Paragraph 2 (1) of Part I of the Schedule provides that FÁS shall consist of a chairman and 16 ordinary members.  Paragraph 7 (1) provides that of the ordinary members four shall be trade union members, four shall be employers' members, one shall be an educational member, one shall be a youth member, two shall be employees of FÁS, one shall be a representative of the Minister for Finance and two shall be representatives of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to put it on record that the National, Economic and Social Council in their publication of December 1985 identified four major sets of objectives for a labour market policy. One of these is the need, and I quote, &ldquo;to improve the employment opportunities of groups with special labour market problems and hence to contribute to social equity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The previous Government in their 1986 White Paper on Manpower Policy stated: &ldquo;The Government have decided that the needs of disabled people require the adoption of more flexible criteria&rdquo;.  I believe, therefore, that the voluntary organisations which have displayed such marvellous dedication and commitment to the advancement and promotion of the interests and needs of mentally and physically disabled people should be represented on the board of this new manpower authority.  I welcome the publication by the previous Government of the Green Paper on Services for Disabled People entitled <i>Towards a Full Life.</i>  I welcome in particular the comprehensive response of the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped to the Green Paper, a union which acts as an umbrella organisation for approximately 37 voluntary organisations affiliated to it.  There is no doubt that many problems with which disabled people and professional and voluntary workers have to cope could more easily be eradicated were there greater flexibility within the statutory services to innovate quickly new responses to new ideas.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are fortunate in having a long tradition of voluntary support services <Col N="1547" /> for disabled people.  Voluntary organisations have been a major provider of services for disabled and handicapped people.  Meaningful arrangements must, therefore, be made for the involvement of the voluntary organisations in the future planning and monitoring of services for the disabled as equal partners. We must ensure that all initiatives and programmes at every level make it possible for disabled people to take part in the designing and organising of such services.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly, therefore, that this new body should be given a lead responsibility for vocational training, leading towards open employment for the disabled, and that these organisations which have served the country so well should be represented by such a national organisation as the Union of Voluntary Organisations on the board of the new body. The principal functions of the new Authority, as the Minister has indicated, are comprehensive and flexible and are listed in section 4 of the Bill as including training, retraining, illustration of employment schemes, work experience programmes, placement services, assistance for co-operatives and small enterprises and the operations of the European Community's free movement of workers provisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill, which was also in the previous Bill, which enables this new body to undertake consultancy and manpower related services overseas on a strictly commercial basis, to ensure that these overseas contracts for training and employment schemes are carried out according to commercial criteria, the new Authority will be obliged to set up a separate subsidiary company, as the Minister has indicated, under section 4 (6) and (7) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In recent years AnCO in particular have identified commercial possibilities for the export of the considerable experience and technical expertise.  For example, in 1985-86 they considerably expanded the scope of their overseas activities and provided consultancy services to the Governments of Greece and Portugal and for the Royal Commission <Col N="1548" /> for Jubail in Saudi Arabia.  In conjunction with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, An Comhairle Oiliúna ran a maintenance and management training programme in Cairo for participants from 11 African nations. Recently, as the Minister has indicated, they obtained a £4 million training subcontract in respect of the £20 million World Bank training project in Indonesia.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the establishment of the new Authority I welcome the provisions in the Bill for the strengthening of the Department of Labour so as to enable the Minister and the Department to assume responsibility for developing policy, as envisaged in the 1986 White Paper on Manpower Policy, for monitoring programmes and for providing policy specifications for the new Authority. This structural weakness at the core of manpower policy in respect of the policy making role of the Minister and the Department of Labour has been highlighted by the 1986 NESC publication.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Council therefore sees the primary deficiency in the manpower area as the weakness of the Department of Labour and believes that the most immediate priority must be to strengthen the Department.  This priority assumes even more urgency in the context of the recommended extension of the objectives of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>This deficiency was also noted in the 1974 report on manpower policy in Ireland by the OECD study team which stated:</P>
    <P>The Department has few qualified staff to interpret economic information, to contribute to the design of active manpower policies, to complement short-term economic strategy or to forecast developments in the manpower field and examine policy options for possible application in the future.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill should ensure that central control and the direction of policy will rest with the Minister for Labour and the Department of Labour. <Col N="1549" /> The Authority, of course, will be responsible for the execution of policy already determined and they will have an important role to play in advising on policy, based on their knowledge of the labour market and the operation of the various programmes.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, as the Minister has indicated, however, the success of the new Authority will depend on how well they cater for the needs of the local areas and the different regions in the country, I welcome, therefore, his statement that it is his intention that the new Authority must move rapidly to the provision of services more effectively at local and regional level.  This will involve the desirable development of closer co-operation with the educational and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>In the 1982 report on youth training in the European Economic Communities by the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities, they stated &mdash; and they were applying their judgment to the United Kingdom but, indeed, their judgment equally applies to Ireland:</P>
    <P>There is urgent need to bring together the whole education, training and employment of young people in a coherent framework which can be understood by employers, parents, educators and trainers and above all by the young people themselves.</P>
    <P>This was the urgent need as they saw it.  The concept of an active manpower policy was, of course, the subject of considerable debate in Ireland in the sixties. This debate, however, was largely informed by external developments, notably the 1964 OECD Council recommendation on manpower policy which culminated in the publication by the then Government of the First White Paper on Manpower Policy in 1965.</P>
    <P>The objectives set out in the White Paper and the means chosen to implement them were developed against the background which assumed continuous growth and rapid expansion of the economy, for in Europe the sixties were characterised by strong and stable economic growth and, indeed, steady full <Col N="1550" /> employment.  The major objective was to ensure the supply of a modern, well-trained workforce to meet the requirements of incoming foreign investment. Thus the measures adopted were primarily concerned with the supply side of the labour market.  As we know since 1965, however, our country has undergone major social and economic changes. In particular, we have moved from rapid economic growth into a prolonged period of recession, an extremely rapid structural change.  Indeed, in the 22 years since 1965 the population has grown by approximately 700,000 people, while the labour force has grown by over 150,000. The important fact remains, however, that the high unacceptable level of unemployment is the greatest social and economic problem facing this country and certain groups in particular in the labour market such as the young unemployed and the long term unemployed, suffer particular difficulties.</P>
    <P>As regards young people, employment and training programmes are at high levels since the introduction of the youth employment levy in 1982.  In Ireland, the proportion of total unemployment accounted for by youth is now one of the lowest in the European Communities despite our having proportionately the highest youth population in the member states.  Long term unemployment is now a major problem for this country and it has been described by the authors of the 1975 NESC Report as follows:</P>
    <P>A trap from which it is very difficult to escape and the longer one is in there the more difficult it is to escape.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, compelling reasons for helping the long term unemployed and interventions through special measures and direct actions programmes can be justified on both equity and efficiency grounds.  In the words of the 1986 White Paper:</P>
    <P>Economic improvement and employment expansion will not automatically enhance employment prospects for the long-term unemployed. The danger exists that the skills and <Col N="1551" /> experience and the potential contribution of long-term unemployed people could be irretrievably lost to the economy if special action is not taken to assist them.  The Government considers that direct action is also justified on grounds of social equity.  This is reinforced when the age profile of the long-term unemployed is taken into account.  Just over half of the long-term unemployed are in the 25 to 44 age group, many of whom have dependants and other family related commitments.</P>
    <P>Social employment schemes, which were introduced in 1985, have enabled local authorities throughout the country to do much invaluable work and to improve environmental standards and amenities. However, there is just one matter that I would like to raise with the Minister for Labour today, a problem which has arisen as regards the operation of this scheme as it affects my own city, namely, Limerick Corporation.</P>
    <P>In May 1985, Limerick Corporation submitted to the Department of Labour six social employment schemes for approval.  These schemes were subsequently approved and work commenced in November 1985.  The city manager, however, in a report to the Limerick City Council, dated 4 June 1987, stated:</P>
    <P>The position at present is that five schemes are due for renewal of extensions, two going back to November, 1986.  Despite meetings with the Department of Labour and the local National Manpower Office, approvals have not been forthcoming.  It is understood that the problem lies with the national monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>The corporation has done much invaluable work through the social employment schemes which have been favourably commented upon.  Employment reached an all-time high, at 198 people, and a structure has been developed to supervise those people. Unless approvals to extensions are granted urgently, it is anticapated that <Col N="1552" /> there will be only 75 people, approximately, employed by the end of June, 1987.  Consequently, there has been a significant drop in output due to the delay in sanctioning the required extension.</P>
    <P>The recoupment of expenditure on social employment schemes is also of concern to the corporation.  The City Manager met with Department officials on 19 May 1987, at which time a sum in excess of £350,000 was due to the corporation.</P>
    <P>I would be most grateful to the Minister if he would have this urgent matter for an important local authority investigated, and if perhaps he might be able to indicate what his investigation reveals later in the debate or perhaps he would communicate directly with me on this matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the Minister has indicated in his speech, the tasks facing An Foras Áiseanna Saothair are formidable and challenging.  I would like to take this opportunity not alone on my own behalf but I am sure on behalf of every Member of this House, to wish the new Authority, FÁS and the Minister for Labour, every success in their efforts and endeavours to deal effectively and flexibly with this challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on his appointment as Minister for Labour.  I wish him well in his interesting and demanding ministerial position for which he is exceptionally well equipped.  I would like to be associated with the remarks made earlier in connection with the retirement of Mr. Jack Tobin, the retiring Clerk of Seanad Éireann, and the incoming Clerk, Kieran Coughlan.  Mr. Tobin was a man of competence and integrity who had a profound knowledge of all aspects of the work of this House.  He was an exemplary civil servant and at a personal level I wish to record my thanks to him for the courtesy and help he extended to me at all times.  I wish him many happy and active years in his retirement.  In welcoming Kieran Coughlan, we know him, <Col N="1553" /> of course, for some years already as an Assistant Clerk of the Seanad.  He has been a most helpful officer in the past and I wish him well in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Bill, there is obviously widespread agreement on the principles underlining the Bill before us.  The Bill received a welcome in the Dáil and has already received a welcome here in the Seanad today from the Opposition side. The amalgamation of the existing manpower agencies into a single body was, as has already been stated, advocated by the National Economic and Social Council in their &ldquo;Report on Manpower Policy in Ireland&rdquo;, in December 1985 and also in the last Government's White Paper of September 1986.  The Bill gives statutory effect to this amalgamation and also changes the youth employment levy into a general employment and training levy which can be used for all age groups as distinct to being confined to those under 25.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling that the expert view of the NESC came down in favour of a united single executive agency.  The Bill is intended to give effect to the reorganisation and the real amalgamation envisaged by the NESC.  The sheer scale of the unemployment problem at present demands that Manpower services should be delivered in the most co-ordinated and coherent manner possible.  A central sense of direction is vital to make an impact on our major unemployment problem.  Circumstances have, indeed, changed dramatically since the first White Paper on Manpower Policy published in 1965.  This is underlined, for example, by the fact that economic growth averaged about 4 per cent per year during the sixties and 3.5 per cent in the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards unemployment, a major social and economic problem of the present time, as recently as 1980 the rate of unemployment was 7 per cent while today it has more than doubled, to a figure of 18 per cent.  Unemployment is already extremely high, too high.  It is vital that FÁS play their role in the Government's head-on attack on unemployment. <Col N="1554" /> This single body, FÁS, is intended to ensure that a new emphasis will be provided to tackle the unemployment problem and to ensure that the users of this central manpower service &mdash; and the taxpayer who pays for it of course &mdash; will secure the best possible return.</P>
    <P>In particular I welcome the Minister's commitment to regionalise the structure of FÁS.  We should get as much decision making as possible out of Dublin.  Therefore, I welcome the proposal of a regionalised structure.  I agree with the Minister that the success of FÁS will largely depend on how they meet the needs of different regions.  The Government stated in their Programme for National Recovery their commitment to the development of the Manpower services on a regionalised basis.  FÁS will only be as good as the services they deliver at local level.</P>
    <P>The Bill also reflects the general Government policy on decentralisation. There is an over-concentration of decision making in Dublin, a fact of which I was regularly reminded during an extensive tour of the country in the recent Seanad election campaign.  By pushing decision making down to local level, a greater degree of flexibility and innovation will be possible to improve the services at local level.  I welcome, therefore, the Minister's commitment to decentralise decision making in the area of Manpower services which, as he said in his speech, will be reflected in the structure of FÁS and will form part of the policy guidelines which will be conveyed to FÁS.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the unemployment problem, especially as it relates to the over 25 age group.  By 1990 over half the workforce will be in the 25 to 44 age group.  For many years we have been talking about half of the population being under 25.  What is now developing is a shift in the bulge in unemployment to the over 25 age group.  The Bill provides for changing the youth employment levy into a general employment and training levy.  This is a recognition of the changing unemployment pattern.  It was obviously taken in the context of the <Col N="1555" /> changing age structure and the unemployment figures within that structure. This change does not mean a reduction in the provision for youth.  I am glad the Minister underlined that.  It will however, introduce more equity and more Government discretion so that expenditure on Manpower services can be focussed on the hardest hit age groups at any given point in time.</P>
    <P>The policy role of the Minister is, of course, very important and the more executive type work that can be removed from the Department the better in that regard.  The central role of the Minister in the determination of Manpower policy is restored in the Bill, thus giving statutory effect to the proper relationship which should exist between a Minister and subsidiary bodies.  Under section 12, FÁS are required to submit annually to the Minister a report on their activities within six months after the year in question. In addition, they are required to furnish a report outlining their programme of work including expenditure estimates for the coming year.  Any Minister and his Department need to strike a balance &mdash; the Minister touched on this in his speech &mdash; between policy issues and necessary departmental controls and the freedom and flexibility which any State body require to carry out their day to day functions.  This control relationship between the Minister and his Department and State bodies is an area that received considerable attention in a somewhat different context on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, of which I have been a member for several years.  The relationship between the Minister for Labour and his Department and FÁS in the Manpower area is indeed analogous to the relationship which we considered in the commercial State-sponsored bodies area.  I welcome the requirement in section 12 whereby FÁS will have to submit annually to the Minister a report of their activities within six months after the year in question.  The time limit is important.  If it were any more it could adversely affect corrective policy action <Col N="1556" /> by the Minister and his Department.  In this same context I also welcome the requirement in section 12 whereby FÁS will be required to furnish a report outlining their programme of work including expenditure estimates for the coming year.  This requirement will impose a planning discipline which should be of benefit to all concerned, to FÁS, the user of their services, to the taxpayer who pays for it and of course to the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill, for which there is widespread agreement, a speedy passage through the House, not least because much work needs to be done before the new body can go into action.  The Minister is, of course, aiming &mdash; and I am sure he will achieve it &mdash; to get the body into action and into effect by 1 January 1988.  In the interim, of course, a new chairman and board, a director general and an organisational structure need to be put in place.  The new body will have substantial implications for the Department of Labour.  Something like a policy unit to liaise with and monitor their activities will be needed.  It is obviously of key importance that such a unit be built up with people of appropriate expertise who can do the job adequately.  A quote from NESC on Manpower policy in Ireland is relevant in this regard:</P>
    <P>We have already been critical of the fact that the Department of Labour has not become sufficiently involved in policy formulation, even within the narrow approach to Manpower issues which has prevailed up to now. However, the role now envisaged for the Department, embracing the concept of a labour market policy and involvement in Manpower issues in a much broader context, represents a considerable extension of its functions. To adequately fulfil this role the Department will have to be provided with the appropriate resources.  In this regard the principal requirement would be for staff with analytic and interpretive skills.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, I have been on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies for several years and in that <Col N="1557" /> context and otherwise I have come to regard the intelligence and integrity of civil servants with great respect.  It is a fact, however, that particular skills are required not only at the Department of Labour but in all other Government Departments as well.  The Ministers, typically, have very heavy workloads. The Minister for Labour is a classic example of somebody with a huge volume of work which, somehow, he gets through.  However, the Minister for Labour and any other Minister must, inevitably, rely on their advisers for crucial advice on various issues.  To secure suitably qualified people, preferably from within the Civil Service, to provide this type of advice requires resources.  While I would be the first to admit that there is considerable pressure on the public finances at present and that that in turn may make it difficult to provide additional funds for any purpose, it could be argued that it is precisely at this time of economic difficulty that the quality of advice which Ministers receive should be at its highest.  If additional funding is necessary to ensure that people with particular skills are available in various Government Departments, such additional funding, if provided, would be very well spent.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread welcome for the Bill and I reiterate that I welcome the amalgamation of the existing manpower agencies.  I should add, however, that the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is present here, has long advocated the amalgamation envisaged and which is now about to get legislative effect by way of this Bill.  He publicly promoted this idea when he was Opposition spokesman for Labour.  I am particularly glad, therefore, that he is here in person as Minister for Labour to give effect to one of his strongly held views in the area of Manpower policy.</P>
    <P>The Bill also reflects the Government's policy on decentralisation of services.  It fits basically into that general purpose and commitment.  I strongly share the view of the Government that decision making should, as far as possible, be pushed out of Dublin down to local level <Col N="1558" /> where the various services, including Manpower services, are delivered on the ground.  I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House so that FÁS will be established with effect from 1 January 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all recognise that this Bill is necessary in principle.  It is also legislation to deal with the method by which a quite substantial amount of money is to be organised, disbursed and used.  The Minister may have mentioned a budget in this speech but I did not come across it.  I collected a copy of the Estimates for the Public Service.  The figures I arrived at were £125 million for AnCO, £7 million for the Youth Employment Agency, £5 million on salaries for the Manpower Service, totalling £137 million.  I am not sure that this Bill constitutes the proper way for the Oireachtas to deal with an agency of that scale. Admittedly it was introduced last November, was redrafted to some extent by the present Government, was republished early in June and is now being debated by the Seanad.  It received not much more than two or three hours in the other House.  As my small contribution to accountability and because I have had some representations made to me I have a fairly long list of amendments for Committee Stage.  I hasten to add they are not being submitted simply to prove that the Oireachtas is in charge but rather because they are valid points needing to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of previous speakers referred to the necessity for manpower services policies.  We need to remember that planning is needed in all these areas of policies.  The reason I emphasise the word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; is that there appears to be a reluctance on the part of many in our society to accept that planning is something that can be done in a market economy.  Planning is confused with centrally planned economies.  That is not what I advocated or what we are ever likely to have here anyway.  In the words of Julius Kambarage Nyrere planning is about making choices.  Some of those choices will go astray.  Therefore there is, unfortunately, considerable <Col N="1559" /> temptation in the way of all of us politicians &mdash; whether we be in Government or languishing in the perpetuity of the Opposition benches in the Seanad, like myself &mdash; to avoid making up our minds, to confuse aspirations with policy and with decisions.  Therefore, what I would hope &mdash; and which is not evident from a reading of the Minister's remarks &mdash; is that one of the things that will spring from the provisions of this Bill and the establishment of An Foras Áiseanna Saothair will be a fundamental reappraisal of the role of all the bodies being amalgamated in FAS.</P>
    <P>We desperately need a fairly rigorous zero-based accounting system for all our State agencies in which the justification for any area of expenditure is need and not precedent.  I do not know that there is anything written into the provisions of this Bill &mdash; other than the very welcome extra role for the Minister in determining the broad policy parameters &mdash; to ensure that this will happen.  Therefore, I hope the role envisaged for the Minister will be seen to be operated positively.  Let me emphasise that a determination to ensure that a service is provided on the basis of need is not a negative aspiration; it is a very positive one.  It is a determination to ensure that the resources are used in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>The trouble about policy and planning is that you have to take decisions.  Once decisions are taken they are not always proven to be right.  This country in particular is awash with people who have a huge line in hindsight.  There is a natural tendency in any democratic society for hindsight to figure largely.  In this country that capacity is huge and, as somebody said, hindsight is the only exact science. At the centre of decisions on manpower have to be some decisions about realistic assessments of what we can do in the areas of economic growth, industrial production, agricultural production and internationally traded services, all requiring specific targets and assessments. Some decisions a Government may have to take in this area may not be particularly compatible with their aspirations to be <Col N="1560" /> re-elected.  Either we should accept, as a national policy or consensus that large scale emigration is necessary or the direct opposite, which is that we are not going to accept large scale emigration but rather are going to put together an economic policy in the services area which will minimise if not abolish emigration.  You cannot plan even a medium term manpower policy for this country without putting a figure on emigration.  The numbers of people who will be needing the services of FÁS will be of the order of 20,000, 30,000 if not 40,000 per annum depending on your estimation of emigration figures.</P>
    <P>I know these propositions are not very pleasant.  Indeed, a number of NESC reports on social planning emphasise that.  One of the great successes of northern European economies has been their capacity to link social and economic planning, to link targets in the area of social policy to the achievement of targets in the area of economic policy.  We have not been particularly successful in that respect.  Many of our policies have been developed piecemeal, have been developed in response to pressures or to a particular need at a given time.  It is not Governments alone who are subjected to this temptation.  For example the Youth Employment Agency was a well-intentioned response to a perceived need. There were arguments advanced on its establishment &mdash; with which I did not agree &mdash; that it was not necessary to set up a separate agency, that whatever about the extra funding or levy involved there was a serious question posed as to whether an extra agency was needed to do the same things.  Where we have ended up confirms the view, which was regarded as somewhat stuffy and conservative six or seven years ago, that we did not really need another agency, that perhaps we needed a revamped general manpower service but that another agency did not constitute the way forward.</P>
    <P>Now that we have one agency I hope specific decisions will be taken about specific targets and objectives.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate taking three agencies and placing them under the management of one board of directors <Col N="1561" /> does not necessarily mean that they will all operate or progress in the same direction. There are simple details that have to be attended to, some of which may take years.  For instance, all of these agencies must now have massive data banks.  One wonders will they be wildly enthusiastic about what they used to see as somewhat competitive agencies having access to all that information.  Will the computer records turn out to be mysteriously incompatible for months, if not years, while each subgroup within the overall body struggles to establish its identity?  Will the largest, dominant body which is AnCo continue to dominate? Will it be simply AnCO under another name the other two agencies being swallowed up by the enormous agency which is AnCO?  If that is the case then will we ever reach the stage &mdash; and perhaps I should direct this question to the Minister for Education rather than the Minister for Labour &mdash; at which the whole area of training and labour services fits snugly into the overall area of education?</P>
    <P>I have to confess an interest here because I work in the educational sector. Superficially &mdash; and I have neither the resources nor the time to do a study in detail &mdash; there appears to be quite a considerable degree of competition between AnCO and the educational sector to carry out similar areas of work.  We can neither afford nor do we need that sort of needless competition.  Therefore, I hope that when the Minister is appointing the director of FÁS he chooses somebody who has a vision beyond simply the construction of a large agency.  I hope that the Minister's and the Department's role in the area of policy formulation will not be taken in isolation from the policies being developed by his colleague in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we do not have competition either in the third level area or in the nebulous area between second and third level where a lot of training takes place.  We should not have people coming out of, say, technical colleges in particular and out of AnCO with what appear to be similar qualifications <Col N="1562" /> produced in different ways and under different curricula.  If people are being trained, for instance, as electronic technicians, it would not really matter whether they are trained by AnCO or trained by a regional technical college. They ought to be of a similar level of skill and training.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister referred to the present intense activity that goes under the heading of Jobsearch I ought to refer to it as well.  I have said before that the idea of carefully going through the numbers of the long term unemployed, carefully and sensitively attempting to discover areas of potential work, skill and activity that these people might be interested in or qualified for, is very worth while.  The country whose economic and social success I admire most is Sweden.  Sweden is remarkably active in ensuring that nobody loses the habit of work because he or she is unemployed. They take quite extraordinary, what one here could call draconian, measures to ensure that.  These draconian measures are based on levels of unemployment assistance which are close to 90 per cent of average take home pay.  Our levels of unemployment assistance, unfortunately, do not compare, at least for many groups of people.</P>
    <P>What concerns me is the quickness of implementation of Jobsearch and also the reputed brevity of the interviews that are taking place.  In a five or ten minute interview one cannot determine the possibly obscure skills of somebody who has suffered unemployment for perhaps two or three years or determine potential areas of learning or of interest of people who have been unemployed for a year or two or three years.  First, many unemployed people are understandably wary of many of the State's services.  They are not treated with great dignity in the labour exchange, for instance.</P>
    <P>The fact that the notification about Jobsearch comes via the labour exchange is not in any way going to reassure people that this is not just another addition to the indignity that is imposed on them because they are unemployed.  To bring people in, interview them for five, ten or <Col N="1563" /> 15 minutes and tell them that this is the discovering of all of their possible skills seems to be a little presumptious and unkind and the imposition of another indignity.</P>
    <P>Of the 150,000 people who will be interviewed, we are talking about 40,000 Manpower opportunities for them and a further 12,000 on a four week Jobsearch, that is 52,000.  What are we going to do for the other 100,000 to whom we cannot offer anything?  Are we going to insist still that they go through the ridiculous ritual of signing on once a week to prove that they are available for work when the combined resources of two State agencies, the Department of Social Welfare and of FÁS will have accepted that there is no work available for them?  Will we insist that they prove they are still actively searching for work when the combined resources of the State have accepted that there is no work for which they could be actively searching?</P>
    <P>Will we, at least, get around to accepting that these people are the victims of a recession, that whatever compensation we choose to give them for being unemployed ought not to necessitate the humiliations of the labour exchange and of frequent challenges to their integrity? It simply ought to become a pension to be paid to the unemployed, separate from the labour exchange, which can be terminated if these people do emerge again in the national labour force.  Since people now have a common PRSI number it ought to be possible to devise a scheme which does not penalise in terms of their dignity as well as of their pockets those who are the victims of long term unemployment.  If the Jobsearch programme is what it is intended to be, we ought to be thinking about radical reassessment of the method of income support for the 100,000 of those 150,000 for whom, it appears, we are not going to be able to do anything.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of areas of social policy and Manpower policy at which a dynamic new body should be looking.  That is my concern and fear about this whole Bill. The Minister is young and able.  I will <Col N="1564" /> give him the benefit of the doubt and presume he is dynamic.  He has the potential to be dynamic.</P>
    <P>What this agency will need more than anything else is an impetus to give their management a very clear impression that what the Government and the Oireachtas expect is not just more of the same but something fundamentally different which will, first, be defined in its differences by the policies outlined by the Minister, but will also be defined in its differences in the service it provides.</P>
    <P>I was given a document that was put together by a group of voluntary community groups.  I am not quite sure of the groups involved and therefore I will not quote statistics from it but what I will say is that the collective impression given by the 12 or 15 groups involved about the difficulties of any of these groups getting support from the various State agencies, AnCO, Youth Employment and Manpower, is not very pleasant reading.  They talk about delays and frustrations.  They have a cartoon which is effectively the same person smiling, then with two days' beard, then with a week's beard and then eventually with a six months' beard, outside in the agency waiting room waiting for a decision on his application.  If we are to have an agency who are to respond to needs and do all the things that are listed under section 4 where the functions of FÁS are set out, they will have to be able to decide quickly.  They would also have to devise procedures by which people could make contact with FÁS without, as these groups say, needing an expert negotiator to be able to convince FÁS.  This agency must be user orientated and must be directed towards encouraging people to seek the supports of the agency, not to making people feel that one needs a professional intermediary to be able to negotiate one's way through the quagmire.  It is not necessary, in order to ensure that State money is used efficiently, that people go through a series of hoops and over a series of hurdles in order to achieve what they wish to achieve.  I will go through a number of my detailed considerations on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> It is a good idea to amalgamate AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service. It is a good idea to have a more dynamic role for the Government and for the Minister in the broad formulation of Manpower policy.  But neither of those two good ideas will achieve any great impact on the lives and experiences of the unemployed, nor on the provision of adequately trained manpower for the changing economic needs one hopes we will have in the future if there is not a dynamism injected into the operations of the new agency and if the new agency do not become user orientated and see themselves as a provider of services almost in a commercial way.  I look forward to what the Minister has to say and I look forward to the Committee Stage of the Bill where I hope a number of my queries can be teased out in some detail.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa ar dtús fíilte a chur roimh an Aire sa Teach seo agus comhgairdeas a dhéanamh leis as ucht bheith sa phost ina bhfuil sé.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé togha oibre mar Aire.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I congratulate him belatedly on his appointment as Minister for Labour.  I have no doubt that he will do an excellent job in that position.  To allay the fears of Senator Ryan, I know that the Minister is young, I know that he is able and I also know that he is dynamic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Ryan, I have an educational interest.  It is in that general sphere that I make my comments on this Bill.  The general objective of the Bill which aims at the better co-ordination of the work of the Manpower agencies is to be sincerely welcomed.  In this era of high unemployment, with such great pressure on public finances, it is imperative that everything possible is done to provide an effective and economic service in training as well as in other public sector areas. There are compelling arguments to support the establishment of a well integrated agency which would assist those who have not yet found a job or have <Col N="1566" /> become unemployed, in finding their rightful place on the labour market.</P>
    <P>The preamble to the Bill states that its purpose is:</P>
    <P>to make further provision in relation to the provision of training and retraining for employment, the provision of work experience and the establishment of employment schemes and job placement services,</P>
    <P>There are other agencies or bodies involved in making somewhat similar provisions.  Will the Minister ensure that the total State services in this area are co-ordinated so that any overlap will be eliminated, thereby minimising the total cost to the Exchequer?  I have in mind the educational system which obviously has such a major role to play in providing basic literacy and numeracy skills and in preparing young people for direct entry into various professions and careers as well as in post graduate research training and continuing formation and updating after they have entered into employment.</P>
    <P>The educational sector plays an important role in preparing young people for many and varied aspects of work, ranging from providing young people with basic numeracy skills and literacy skills to the highest levels of technical and technological formations, of professional degrees and post graduate work.  In terms of total numbers, the participation in the educational system is in excess of one million, including some 325,000 following second level programmes, 55,000 fulltime third level students, approximately 10,000 apprentices and nearly 100,000 part time day and evening students pursuing a variety of continuing and adult education courses, many of which have strong training elements.  These figures speak for themselves.  It is to be hoped that the present close and effective cooperation between the Manpower agencies and the educational sector in many areas will continue.  Indeed I strongly urge that it be developed further for the benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider including in the preamble to the Bill that such provision <Col N="1567" /> shall have regard to the preparation and training programmes available to the educational system and to Government policy or guidelines issued from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Government policy is that the educational authorities will have primary responsibility for preparing young people for working life, that the Manpower bodies will have a role in assisting those who have left the educational system and experienced difficulties in achieving a foothold in the labour market and that the educational and Manpower policies should complement and assist one another towards serving the overall objectives of Government employment strategy.</P>
    <P>The VEC system, in which I am directly involved and which I represent, plays a very important role in relation to many of the areas where, with the establishment of FÁS, there is definite opportunity for very close co-operation and development with the type of mechanisms in place there.  The VEC system has the following assets; a range of strategically located premises, educational programmes geared to and derived from the world of work, trained and expert staff, experience in dealing with a whole range of working population from young to old, from unskilled to highly skilled, employers, a commitment to social betterment, a long and successful track record in this area, and a quick response capacity in relation to training for specific industries and in relation to social requirements.  The VEC have a direct involvement with many of the functions now proposed for FÁS.  This should be an opportunity to build on what is a long established and well programmed infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The role of the VEC in training could be summarised as being second and third level training, both professional and technical, vocational preparation and training programmes, literacy programmes, remedial and special education, apprenticeship training, guidance services and psychological counselling services, external training, adult and second chance <Col N="1568" /> education, catering programmes in co-operation with CERT, new community programmes, prison education, community workshops, sport and cultural programmes, outward bound activities, management and administration and curriculum development.</P>
    <P>The VEC system provides and arranges for training and retraining for employment; it provides assistance in obtaining employment; it provides and arranges for work experience; it arranges for people seeking employment and those offering employment to come into contact; it provides and arranges for guidance, advice and information in respect of choice of career and employment and it facilitates community groups, co-operatives and members of local communities in the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from an examination of the multi-facet approach and diverse levels operated by the VECs that co-operation, liaison and partnership is extremely important.  It is essential that it would take place between the vocational system and the Manpower agencies at local level.  I am very pleased to see the Minister's attitude towards the regionalisation of this service because this is extremely important.  I reiterate the sentiments expressed by a number of the other speakers in relation to that development. The co-operation which has existed between the agencies and the educational sector in the past should be developed and improved to ensure the overall success of this very important body.  I compliment the Minister on his foresight, on the work he did during the past number of years and on his attitude, towards the amalgamation of the State agencies.  The Bill is to be sincerely welcomed. There is a tremendous opportunity at the moment for improving manpower planning.  I know the Minister and his Department will make a great success of this national body and I ask him to take the suggestions I have made into account in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an appropriate opportunity for the House to be discussing and <Col N="1569" /> reviewing the implementation of manpower policy against the very difficult employment situation prevailing.  Heretofore, policy objectives for manpower always assumed economic growth and the rapid expansion of various sectors of the economy but unfortunately the growth and the expansion we have witnessed and experienced in the past decade or two no longer exists.  The primary concern of our policy now is to match the supply side of labour, which is rapidly increasing, with the skills that are required to meet the diminishing demand side of the labour force.  Economic policy nationally and the economic policy being pursued by the Government of the day is essential and important to get the foundations right in order to create the incentive to give more employment in the various traditional sectors of our economy.  Because the assumptions I referred to cannot be made, radical measures are necessary in order to improve the employment positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties on the economic front have been assisted by the unique demographic structure in our economy.  Unfortunately, it is the young sector of the population who must go abroad in order to achieve their objective of gaining employment.  The supply and demand sides of our labour force are not in tandem at present and the safety valve of emigration is necessary for thousands of those young people.  Our traditional attitude in the way that we perceive emigration must change.  When one considers the wider territorial and economic domain of which we are now part &mdash; the European Community &mdash; and because we have consolidated our position in recent times by voting through the Single European Act, we should consider the word migration within the Community as more appropriate than emigration abroad. Migration within the European Community will be necessary for many years to come if our young people are unable to find work at home.  We should assist them in making the decision to migrate if it is their preference, to go to other parts of Europe rather than just moan and groan about the appalling situation we <Col N="1570" /> have at present.  We must face reality.</P>
    <P>As a nation we must seek to employ as many people as possible in our country but we must never allow our educational or employment policy to deteriorate to such an extent that the emigrant is ill-equipped for the wider world of work.  I am glad the Minister has made reference to this in his speech and that he is conscious of supplying the necessary resources and staff in his Department to ensure that the migrant within the Community is sufficiently equipped so that he or she is not lost, as it were, in the wider world of work.  I challenge anyone in this House to suggest that emigration will cease to be a reality shortly. It is against this background that we must fine tune our present manpower policy to meet the enormous challenge of creating sufficient employment to match the rapidly increasing and ever frustrated supply side of labour.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amalgamation of the various State agencies referred to in the Bill &mdash; AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency, and the National Manpower Service &mdash; into one body, An Foras Áiseanna Saothar.  It is essential to avoid the rampant duplication of State resources we have become accustomed to and to eliminate the confusion of the general public in seeking the services of these agencies.  There is no doubt that better value for money could be achieved by the rationalisation of these services and agencies.  However, we must remember that organisational arrangements alone will not create employment.  Manpower policy must take cognisance of many other factors.  These include taxation, social welfare policies and industrial relations policies and their impact on the participation rate in employment.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a blatant lack of incentive to become employed.  From the employer's point of view he or she is saddled with an enormous bureaucracy in relation to taxation or social welfare while the unemployed often find it more financially secure to stay at home rather than become employed.  Enlightened and radical measures are needed now in this area to boost employment.  Perhaps one <Col N="1571" /> of the options that could be considered is the idea of a minimum incomes policy in order to ensure that there is a certain minimum income available to people and that where they find employment in the course of their working week that this will not be treated harshly in the taxation and social welfare code.  While it is necessary to have special employment schemes to assist specific groups such as the disabled to enter employment, the public are punch drunk with the number and the dubious quality of many of the training and temporary employment schemes at present in operation.  I want to mention four schemes which are having an impact on unemployment and which perhaps could be extended.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme came into operation some two years ago and I would like to pay tribute to the trade union movement in co-operating with the implementation of this scheme particularly through community groups and local authorities.  This was a tremendous boost to many people, particularly single people who were unable to find employment in their own communities and who felt that they could make a contribution to their communities through this scheme.  Throughout the various local authorities in particular very useful work has been done in assisting in the development of recreational facilities and in the improvement of amenity areas.  The general value for money of this scheme is much appreciated by the people involved and the wider community.  This scheme could be extended further and I hope that the trade union movement would see the usefulness of extending this scheme without putting an embargo on it.  It would be important that their own members would be safeguarded in the extension of the scheme, particularly the members who are employed at present in local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The second scheme I want to mention is the enterprise allowance scheme.  This was a very important scheme which helped to bring people into self-employment. It provided a useful incentive of £50 a week if one was married and £30 a <Col N="1572" /> week if one was single.  During the course of 12 months a person could be sure of an income while, at the same time, generating a source of revenue from the new found self-employment.  It was a necessary step in order to get into the world of work and the self-employed status.  The embargo and the quote that at present exists on the numbers of people going into the enterprise allowance scheme should be lifted and the scheme should be extended further.  The loss to the Exchequer is non-existent because otherwise these people would be on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The community youth training programme operated by AnCO is a very successful one.  It is so successful that the Confederation of Irish Industry now regard this body as probably one of the main building contractors in the country, to their detriment, to the detriment of the CIF.  I suggest that the present position of influence of the Confederation of Irish Industry at local level on the operation of this scheme militates against the improvement and expansion of the community youth training programme under AnCO.  I am aware of various schemes that unfortunately will not start to create necessary apprenticeship places, necessary employment at community level and necessary repair and renovation to community facilities because of the failure and lack of co-operation of the Construction Industry Federation at local level.  While I appreciate that AnCO can extend their influence too far, a fine balance is necessary to ensure that the communities are assisted and that the young people who benefit enormously from this programme continue to get the opportunity of gaining these apprenticeship places.</P>
    <P>The community enterprise programme under the Youth Employment Agency is a very valuable scheme.  Many communities have succeeded in gaining finance through this particular agency &mdash; the Youth Employment Agency &mdash; to set up community development committees in their own areas.  Senator Ryan referred to the frustration people will experience in getting finance from this scheme.  It is <Col N="1573" /> my experience that the Youth Employment Agency have liberally applied the finances to communities who have a programme of work for a year or for two years.  I can vouch for the experience of the Kilkenny Regional Employment Council which have utilised this scheme to carry out very worth-while assistance to community groups throughout the county.  Individuals have come to seek advice and information on the various schemes that could assist them into employment and that is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that manpower policy is in such a state at the moment that the Youth Employment Agency could fund an enterprise worker in order to plough through the bureaucracy that exists in many of the State support schemes presently in operation.  This in my view focuses in on the importance of having all these schemes amalgamated under the one banner and administered by the one organisation, the National Manpower Authority.  I hope the Minister will also take the opportunity of appraising the various schemes under the present agencies to see if he could rationalise any of them in order to ensure that we get better value for money.</P>
    <P>The educational system and the educational policy has been moving gradually towards being more relevant to the work place in recent years.  However, there is a need for greater flexibility into the system to open the way for a wider range of career options.  The traditional secondary school programme and the points system as a means of entering third level education will not discern the student's various talents accurately and thereby it will not ensure an interesting and rewarding career for that student.  The educational system at present is breeding dependency rather than self reliance, and with a scarcity of financial resources nationally that policy must change.  It must also change if we are to create economic conditions to sustain people in existing employment.  The educational system in my opinion must seek to change the tired old attitude that the State owes me a job.  The consequences for our future <Col N="1574" /> generations will be even more bleak if our present attitude continues.  I hope the new National Manpower Authority will succeed in the job of effectively co-ordinating manpower schemes.  The country has had enough review bodies.  It has had enough reports on the action that needs to be taken to create employment and to satisfy manpower policy requirements.  I sincerely hope that we will not yet again be just one more decision away from making a decision in such a vital area for our social and economic future and particularly for the future of our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Kennedy, McKenna, Ryan, Hillery and Hogan for their contributions. Most of the points made were in support of items we should take account of when we get the authority set up, and appoint the chief executive hopefully before the end of the year.  In regard to the fears which everybody has and the fears which I have had for a certain number of years, I am well aware that to take three organisations and amalgamate them under one roof with one set of guidelines will not make a manpower authority.  There is much work to be done.  It is a fairly major area.  Senator Ryan said that manpower expenditure is £127 million according to his calculations. In actual fact the expenditure of the manpower organisations is £200 million with almost 3,000 employees, which makes it a very large organisation.  Everybody agrees and a number of Senators have referred to the overlap, the duplication, the dissipation of services and all the other difficulties we have had over the years, not because of any lack of effort by the organisations but because as has been outlined by Senator Hogan, it has all changed in the last 15 or 16 years.  The job of this Government and particularly myself and the organisation FÁS is to try to come to grips with the present position and to try to use the large amount of money and staff available to provide for unemployed and disadvantaged people the best service possible in the most effective <Col N="1575" /> and efficient way.  That is the objective of the organisation and that is what we intend to deliver on.</P>
      <P>I should like to reply to a few precise questions which were put to me about the voluntary bodies.  I said at the start there was a difficulty about having every organisation involved but I assure Senator Kennedy we will take account of the input in the policy area of the voluntary bodies and we will consult with them.  There have already been discussions with the Department of Health. As I said at the outset because it was necessary to keep numbers within a manageable basis, we were not able to give everyone the representation they wanted.</P>
      <P>Regarding the area of policy on which Senators Hillery, McKenna and Ryan asked questions, the Minister's policy role will take account of the priorities. We will link the manpower policies with the programmes and take into account the economic, industrial and social policy and, as well as that, have regard to the realities of the frightening emigration position.  Some valid points have been made here.  There is a distinction to be made: the emigration position is frightening in some areas and welcoming in other areas.  The reality is being brought home to more people every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised about the co-operation and the communication between education and manpower policy.  I could not agree with that.  There are many more relationships now than there were in the past and the links are tighter.  Senator McKenna asked that we strengthen these links and I agree with him.  There is no point in people trying to compete for who does what and who helps whom, and so on.  We must ensure that the taxpayer's money, the money which was taken through the youth employment levy, now the employment levy &mdash; and the money we get from the European Social Fund is used properly to help unemployed people.  We keep coming back to that.  This organisation has a major task in trying to achieve that. My argument over the years was that they <Col N="1576" /> were competing with each other.  We had so many programmes that were duplicated and some people lost confidence. In other areas Senators referred to some of the successful schemes but there seemed to be duplication.  They can rest assured that if schemes should be eliminated they will be eliminated.  If necessary we will seek to create new schemes. This organisation is not being set up to convenience anyone or anything; its sole purpose is to help unemployed people and I am confident we can do that.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage next week when, with the co-operation of the Whips and the Leader of the House, we can go through the various sections of the Bill.  The Jobsearch programme is a positive step to take people from the live register and try to restore their motivation, initiative and self respect.  Senator Ryan said that in a short interview you cannot understand the difficulties of a person who has been unemployed for a number of years.  I agree with him and that is why the four week course is a particularly good idea.  On a four week course they will have an opportunity to talk through the difficulties and see areas of hope and where their future lies.  While some people are not happy about going on a four week course, the feed back generally is that it is helping to motivate people.  The people giving the courses put forward new ideas and ways of chasing a job or trying to start a business.  The agencies put a massive range of ideas before people on the Jobsearch course. The scheme was a good idea.  It is not perfect, but no scheme is.  It was set up quickly because we thought people who had been unemployed for a number of years deserved an opportunity to be motivated and that a substantial amount of the resources spent in the manpower organisation should go to helping the long term unemployed.  That is precisely what the Jobsearch programme is doing.  It is not the most ideal way, but at least it is a help.  A substantial number of people are being referred to courses of one kind or another.  As was pointed out, it is not 150,000 but it is a substantial number.</P>
    <P>I will certainly take account of the <Col N="1577" /> other points which were raised.  They dealt mainly with how the Department and the agency will be organised in the next four or five months to meet this challenge.  This will be a major State organisation with a budget of over £200 million and almost 3,000 people.  If we ensure that the money is available and the motivation of the staff involved is focused on the one objective of helping people who require help, a good day's work will be done.  I think that is possible.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the decision of the Government to abolish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and calls upon the Government to restore power and full funding to the Commission.</P>
      <P>It is very timely, though very sad, that we are debating this motion tonight concerning the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission on the very day an order made by the Minister known as the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission dissolution order came into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill was to establish a single function authority for a lifetime of three years which would assume all the powers and responsibilities of the local authority, Dublin Corporation, and of the Dublin Transport Authority as well as a number of the responsibilities of the Garda Síochána. They were to address in a co-ordinated way the variety of problems of the central core of Dublin.  They were assigned responsibility for an area running from the top of Grafton Street through Westmoreland Street to Parnell Monument at the end of O'Connell Street together with a number of smaller streets converging <Col N="1578" /> on the central spine.  The commission were established because for many years various bodies, organisations and individuals bemoaned the continuous rundown nature of the centre of our capital city.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, on a beautiful day, I walked slowly down Grafton Street and through that beautiful area between the Bank of Ireland and Trinity College, into Westmoreland Street, through O'Connell Street and up to the Parnell Monument and I could envisage quite clearly what benefits the commission would have brought to this area if they were allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>One of the most annoying features to me is the number of plastic signs adorning the frontage of many otherwise architecturally pleasing buildings.  This has happened to such an extent that one can only reflect on the degree of architectural vandalism which was allowed to take place over a succession of years which has blighted the centre of our capital city. The commission were charged to ensure that advertising not in keeping with the general character of a street &mdash; and which is often put in place without planning permission &mdash; could be removed.  In cases where such permission had been granted and where the commission felt that the displays were not in keeping with the area over which they had authority, they had power to remove these signs on foot of compensation.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I attended a seminar on the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission addressed by Mr. Patrick Shaffrey, consultant architect to the commission.  He stated that if the commission had to pay one penny of compensation, they would have been a failure. Mr. Shaffrey explained that the commission would have a three pronged brief: (1) to encourage owners and occupiers to improve their premises; (2) to improve actual streets and footpaths and in some cases make them suitable for pedestrian traffic; and (3) to encourage people back into the city to live.  There is no doubt that the streets commission had generated great public goodwill not only in Dublin but throughout the entire country <Col N="1579" /> in all sections of the population.  Setting up the commission demonstrated that Dublin city belongs to everyone and that Dublin must be held in trust for the rest of the nation.  Many people from all parts of the country see Dublin as the flagship of the nation.  The concept involved a partnership between the public and private sectors.  The amount of public investment was really quite small in comparison to the amount of goodwill they would generate and the additional private investment they would stimulate.  Ten million pounds would not go very far on a new road scheme which might benefit only a few motorists perhaps at the expense of the environment. We have the example of Clanbrassil Street which is a very important issue before Dublin Corporation at present.  I have no doubt that the public, in particular users and property owners, would have been closely involved in the improvement plans and this would have generated a new sense of pride in our city.  Improvements have already taken place in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion since the announcement of the setting up of the commission, for example, Eason's clock and some new shop fronts.  The potential for improvement is there.</P>
    <P>The second part of the three pronged brief which Mr. Shaffrey saw the commission having was to improve streets and footpaths and in some cases make them suitable for pedestrian traffic, very high levels of through traffic are directed through O'Connell Street, that single most important artery, with virtually no consideration given to the needs of pedestrians. The commission were to consider widening the footpaths in O'Connell Street and giving pedestrians an advantage over traffic.  This was also to apply to Grafton Street on a 24-hour, seven day week basis instead of the stop-start position which exists at present and has been the case for many years.</P>
    <P>The commission had very exciting proposals for that beautiful area which I have referred to in our city which goes almost unnoticed, the area between College Green and the Bank of Ireland.  Any <Col N="1580" /> capital city in the world with such a square available to it would take full advantage of it, and I regret that has not happened in Dublin, although I pay tribute to the Bank of Ireland for the extensive work they have carried out in restoring the facade of that historic and beautiful building. It is a great credit to them.  Many Dubliners and visitors to the capital city took great pleasure in seeing that building restored.</P>
    <P>The improvement in street furniture was also an essential matter for the commission's attention.  The street furniture in the centre of our city is very shabby and in need of restoring.  They were to carry out extensive planting of shrubs and flowers in different areas on the pedestrian ways.  I have noticed in recent weeks the initiative taken by some private individual or individuals in this regard on Wicklow Street.  There are now a number of small trees in tub boxes there and they have transformed the street and given it beauty and dignity.  If the inner part of our city were treated in the same way it would have a tremendous uplift.</P>
    <P>The commission were to encourage the concept of security for pedestrians in the centre area by having an increased Garda presence and a number of Garda kiosks. While I very much favoured the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, I think this was one of the best ideas they put forward.  For a long time now there has been a certain amount of insecurity in O'Connell Street and the necessary Garda presence is not always there.  If we had kiosks or mini Garda stations at a number of points in O'Connell Street and Grafton Street, I feel that citizens walking the streets would feel far more secure and Dublin would become a living city even after 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>I am sure a Garda presence in the form I have referred to would be welcomed by shop owners on the principal streets because security problems have arisen in a number of years past.  We have now become accustomed to seeing steel shutter after steel shutter on every shop window from Grafton Street right up into O'Connell Street.  If a Garda presence existed there would not be the same need <Col N="1581" /> for these steel shutters and shop owners would be able to leave their windows free for the public to do window shopping which was a custom I remember well as a young person living in Dublin.  It is sad that this custom has almost disappeared. Indeed, a measure such as this should be introduced during the tourist season to encourage this because it is very important for tourists to be able to walk around freely and to window shop.  I do not enjoy it much myself but many people take great pleasure in window shopping.</P>
    <P>I must say in passing that Dublin Corporation have carried out a very interesting programme of street pedestrianisation.  Unfortunately, due to financial restrictions this has been carried out in a very limited way.  Nevertheless, there is a prospect now of a pedestrian link between Grafton Street and Liffey Street.  Unfortunately, the city manager, reporting at the estimates meeting this year, said there was no further funding for pedestrianisation of our streets.  I tell the Minister this is serious because it is due principally to the cutback in the support grant rate.</P>
    <P>Dublin city centre, despite all the bad publicity, contains streets, squares and buildings of great potential and character. The amount of dereliction in the commission's area was quite small.  What was needed was an overall co-ordinating body such as the commission who would make decisions quickly and engender confidence in all who use the city centre. For some reason or other this confidence has been lost in recent years.  The present Government may contribute to this continued loss of confidence by not allowing the streets commission to continue to function properly.  History may treat the Minister harshly in this matter.</P>
    <P>The commission also had valuable human resources, mainly the chairman, Mr. McNulty of Dublin Tourism, who has demonstrated his capacity for positive thinking and determined action on several fronts, and Mr. Patrick Shaffrey whom I mentioned earlier, a consultant architect and town planner, whose dedication to architectural conservation is more than adequately demonstrated by <Col N="1582" /> his beautiful books on buildings in Irish towns and in the Irish countryside.  His work in the city of Kilkenny is a glimpse of what potential Dublin had if the work of the commission under his directorship had been allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>One positive aspect of the now defunct commission is that the members of the commission themselves were preparing a planning scheme for the main streets in the city centre, and this will be ready next month.  The consultant architect has agreed to stay on working for the commission even after the money to pay his fees has run out and I understand a number of other architects and town planners have also offered to help on a voluntary basis.  I understand also that private companies have offered to sponsor the publication and exhibition of the commission's plan when it is published, and the commission deserve at least to have it published before they are dissolved. I can understand why the Minister has done that on this very day knowing that this plan would be available.  When the plan becomes available and is put on public display I have no doubt that it will engender public support and demand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hark back on the long debate which took place in both Houses on the setting up of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission but I have great difficulty in understanding the total opposition to it from the present Government from day one.  It is difficult to fathom, the attitude of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, who is a Dubliner himself and who has, at least in recent years, proclaimed more than anyone his devotion to the progress and prosperity of the city.  Now, instead of running with the idea that would have transformed the centre of Dublin, even if it was his own, he is quite prepared to kill it stone dead.</P>
    <P>The role of the commission was not to replace Dublin Corporation.  The argument articulated at great length in both Houses regarding this legislation was false.  As a member of Dublin Corporation, I welcomed the commission.  I did not see the commission in competition with Dublin Corporation; I saw the commission working hand-in-hand <Col N="1583" /> with Dublin Corporation to improve the environment of the centre of our city.</P>
    <P>What is needed in Dublin today is some money, together with a great deal of imagination and hard work and the backing of traders and business interests.  It was clear the streets commission had the potential and capacity necessary for the job.  If the Minister felt that money was a problem then he should have reconstructed the commission.  What he did in dissolving them ensures that at this critical time the City of Dublin is back to square one.  During the last year of the previous Government significant legislation was put in place to implement the major development of an improvement programme of the Dublin city centre area.  This included the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, which provided for designated areas to encourage development, especially along the quays and other derelict areas in Dublin City and elsewhere, the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks site and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  These were all interrelated measures and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were the unifying factor in joining all three together.</P>
    <P>The inner city and the centre areas are dead and will remain dead until something is done to revitalise the city centre. I suspect that when our potential clients for the financial centre at the 27 acre dock site come here to familiarise themselves with the area, they will be somewhat disappointed when they see O'Connell Street which must be the most depressed principal street in any city in Europe. Similarly, the pension fund people who are likely to underwrite development projects in the inner city area, with the very positive co-operation of Dublin Corporation, will look at them with a jaundiced eye.  They have responsibility to secure the pension rights of the depositors and will be influenced as much as anything else by the physical appearance of what they see.</P>
    <P>The Government have made a very serious mistake in dissolving the Dublin Metropolitan Commission.  I know they <Col N="1584" /> have a commitment to the 27-acre site and to the financial centre there but I do not believe you can develop one part of the city and leave the rest of it unattended.  That is the reason I say that the dissolution of the commission is a mistake.  The commission were not a major budgetary item that would be critical to any strategy the Government were following.  They were not a continuing body; they had a budget of only £10 million for three years which is less than half the amount that has been spent on the Royal Hospital, an expenditure the public have welcomed because it has meant the restoration of one of the finest public buildings in our city.  How much more would the public welcome the revitalisation of the city centre for half that expenditure?</P>
    <P>At times we misunderstood the feelings of people in this area.  We all like to decorate our houses and keep them in nice order.  We like to have our gardens well looked after and we take personal satisfaction from that.  We also take pride when visitors to our houses acknowledge our efforts in this regard.  The same applies to places of worship.  People like to see the place where they worship well kept.  In that area it is very hard to raise funds nowadays but my experience over a long number of years has been that if the money sought was to be spent in redecorating the place of worship it was freely available because people take a pride in and like other people to see their place of worship as one of the finest kept places in the city or country.  The same applies to the capital city and to Dubliners who live here.  I am proud to be a Dubliner.  People from the rest of the country take great pride in Dublin.  It is the capital of the nation, everyone's capital city.  The feelings of people in this regard have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>When one considers all of these issues one is inevitably drawn to the conclusion that, for reasons which I will leave to this House and to the public to deduce for themselves, this Government have chosen to drive a stake in the heart of Dublin, in a most unconsidered way, on the eve of its thousandth anniversary. <Col N="1585" /> The Minister has decided to forsake Dublin once again.  The city is to be let down.  If he believes that the city does not warrant special attention then he is looking at it through rose tinted glasses. The city, after a thousand years, should get a better deal.  It is a very old and proud city.  I call on this House to condemn the Minister's ill-considered action and to ask him to look again at what can and should be done.  What can be done is contained in the motion.  If the Minister were to reconsider his decision in this matter it would not be considered a U-turn.  It would be considered as a very brave and courageous decision and would be acknowledged by all the citizens of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a vested interest in this matter, as has Senator Doyle, in that we are members of Dublin City Council.  However, I have always regarded the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission as a method of diminishing the power of Dublin Corporation and indeed as an attack on local democracy.  The Minister for the Environment has now made an order dissolving the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission with effect from today.  We on this side of the House fully support the Minister in this regard.</P>
      <P>Everyone is surely in agreement that the centre of Dublin and its main streets have problems.  O'Connell Street in particular is a typical example.  It would be fair to say that this street has been subjected to severe architectural vandalism and bad planning.  A multiplicity of hamburger joints fronted with plastic signs and neon lights have contributed to the destruction of the premier street of our capital.  In addition, there is the problem of dirt and litter and recently I have observed that even the famous Daniel O'Connell monument is now not just covered with dirt and slime but with other substances as well, and I will leave that to the imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>O'Connell Street presents the tourist with a view that Dublin is, in fact, a honky tonk town.  There are many other problems including the severe traffic congestion <Col N="1586" /> and the poor state of the roads and footpaths.  Quite frankly this part of our capital city is run down, tardy and, in places blighted with urban decay. Action is needed but the problem can be tackled without the establishment of this commission.</P>
    <P>Its main task was to design a number of improvement schemes for these areas. The commission had a number of powers which would be the envy of any local authority, particularly the powers which could compel property owners to undertake certain action.  The powers of Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority were to be given to this new commission to produce a more co-ordinated approach to the problems of the area.  Nevertheless, there is another side to the story regarding the history of the establishment of the commission.  The Government at that time were engaged in a process of systematically reducing the powers of local authorities throughout the country.  Indeed the Minister for the Environment at the time and other members of that Government, with increasing regularity, criticised and insulted Dublin Corporation, their role, their functions and even their members. Many saw the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission as a further insult by the Minister to the members of Dublin City Council. It could also be said that the issue of rejuvenating Dublin city would prove to be a vote-catching issue.</P>
    <P>Any Government providing £10 million in the run up to a general election for the improvement of the capital city would have a realistic expectation of increasing their popularity.  Given that the commission were set up prior to the general election, one must reasonably question whether in fact this whole exercise was merely an election gimmick. However, the commission were set up but are now being dissolved.</P>
    <P>The Government had no choice but to act in this responsible manner.  When this Government came to power a short time ago they were confronted with a situation whereby there was absolute chaos in the public finances.  So far as the public <Col N="1587" /> finances were concerned the eleventh hour had been reached and the Government had no choice but to tackle the situation head-on.  The country is overtaxed and now has a national debt of over £24 billion.  Given this situation, every item of public expenditure had to be examined with a view to reducing it.  The many expenditure commitments given by the previous Government in the run up to the general election have to be examined now in this light.  If confidence and growth are to be brought back into the economy the public finances must be brought under control and interest rates pushed downwards.</P>
    <P>This new confidence which has been generated in recent months will be shattered if the Government accept this motion and suddenly decide to squander more of the taxpayers' money.  I find it difficult to believe that Fine Gael are suggesting that we should now spend £10 million without any provision for it whatsoever. The question had to be asked as to whether the taxpayer could afford £10 million in the first place at a time when local authorities throughout the country, including Dublin Corporation, were implementing severe but necessary cutbacks. Could the spending of £10 million on another subsidiary bureaucracy be justified? That is the situation that confronted the Government and I am convinced that they have taken the right decision.</P>
    <P>A number of other criticisms could be made regarding the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, apart from the question of finance. When the commission were established I made it abundantly clear at various meetings of Dublin Corporation that I believed this body to be an attack on local democracy.</P>
    <P>The Act establishing the commission provides for consultation with Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Transport Authority and other interested bodies. Mere consultation, however, is not enough and it has to be asked would the members of the commission have the will <Col N="1588" /> or the capacity to consult with these bodies?  Indeed, would these bodies cooperate with the commission at all?  Certainly, many members of Dublin City Council &mdash; I exclude Senator Doyle &mdash; were totally opposed to the establishment of the commission in the first place, including the Lord Mayor of the day. Without meaning to be disrespectful to the membership of the commission, these were people who had little or no political experience, being thrown into a huge political arena.  It was a recipe for disaster and had proved to be such.</P>
    <P>For example, the leaking of suggestions to the media, regarding the reconstruction of Nelson's Pillar was a bad mistake.  A public controversy arose before the commission even commenced their work.  Incidentally, during the public controversy I was one of those people who supported the suggestion that one of the founding fathers of our State and great statesman of our time, Eamon de Valera, should have had his statue placed on the newly constructed tower outside the GPO.  However, the point I am making is that it was a mistake to give a political role to non-political people. In addition, I was also opposed to the establishment of the commission because I felt that a separation of a small area of the city from the city as a whole with respect to planning and administration was a serious mistake.  An integrated approach to planning is needed if it is to be successful.  At that time a draft development plan was currently being drawn up and yet here was a section of the city which was excluded from these plans.  To isolate one section of the city from the whole and to put people who had little practical experience in administration in charge of this section would be a mistake.</P>
    <P>As I said initially, the job of rejuvenating the inner city is a job which should be done by the local authority, which in this case is Dublin Corporation. A new, young, vibrant city council was elected in the local elections of 1983. Many of the newly elected councillors are extremely concerned about the conservation of our city and there is now a <Col N="1589" /> predominant wish to ensure that once again life is brought back to the inner city.  Dublin Corporation are now doing a reasonable job in relation to these objectives.  We have already seen the pedestrianisation of some of our major streets, including Moore Street and Mary Street.  This was done with the co-operation of the business community of the city who provided some of the much needed finance for these projects.  The lighting of many of our famous public buildings is now being carried out.  It is now a firm objective of Dublin Corporation to bring people back into the inner city and the draft development plan currently under discussion sees this as a major priority.</P>
    <P>In recent years the corporation have been renowned for the high quality of the inner city local authority housing they are providing.  Last year also there were several successful attempts made to bring life into the area and to make it a living city where people could enjoy themselves. We had the James Last concert, for example.  Annual events now include the Dublin City Carnival and the People's Art Exhibition.  Dublin Corporation have the capacity and the will to bring about much needed improvements.  They are the experts.  There are, however, a number of critics of Dublin Corporation and many of their criticisms are justified. Dublin Corporation have made serious mistakes.  There are a few big mistakes at Fishamble Street, for example. However, we do not need the establishment of another bureaucracy to iron out the many existing problems.  Dublin Corporation can be reformed, and I call on the Minister for the Environment to consider ways of imposing on Dublin Corporation reforms which would ensure that the centre city is revitalised.  When the financial climate is right further funding can be given to Dublin Corporation to make further improvements.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála have also played their role in destroying our city.  As Deputy Gay Mitchell mentioned when this matter was being discussed in the Dáil, many of the hamburger joints in O'Connell Street, for example, were <Col N="1590" /> turned down by the planning department of Dublin Corporation but were granted planning permission by An Bord Pleanála on appeal.  Here, too, reforms are necessary, and perhaps An Bord Pleanála should be made more accountable for the decisions they take.  These are future issues which the Government can confront.</P>
    <P>Next year, 1988, Dublin celebrates its millennium.  Already many centre city businesses have plans to improve their facade and clean up the city.  Many department stores have plans to erect window boxes and to plant flowers around their buildings.  Much can be done without the need for public funding. What the Dublin millennium must do is to encourage pride in our city.  In today's economic climate it is easy for Dublin citizens to become demoralised. However, we must once again encourage pride in our city and everything it stands for.  Last weekend over 100,000 people converged on north Dublin to welcome home the greatest rock band in the world, U2 and despite the large number of young people involved very little trouble occurred.  By and large, good humour and good crack prevailed.  At the concert the lead singer said he was proud to be Irish and proud to be a Dubliner.  This group clearly demonstrates what we can achieve, that if we have pride in ourselves we can succeed.  If we encourage this pride by Dubliners in their city it will do a lot more than the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission could ever have hoped to achieve.  We all hope the Dublin millennium celebrations will be a tremendous success and we wish Dublin city a very happy 1000th birthday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable Senator Haughey saw fit to introduce a party political issue at the commencement of his speech in that he saw some kind of conspiracy on the part of the Coalition Government to overpower local authorities. It is particularly regrettable and distressing that he sees this when we are talking about an issue of such sensitivity and great importance as Dublin city and the degradation and awful condition of <Col N="1591" /> the Dublin we know today.  We are talking about our environment, our culture and our lifestyle.  Whether we come from Dublin or outside, we should all be deeply concerned about the state of Dublin today.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Doyle, I am absolutely appalled and terribly distressed that today marks the ending of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  It is not relevant to talk about an investment, to talk about money all the time.  This investment have yielded a three-fold return.  I do not think anybody could doubt that.  More spending would have resulted because people would have come into the city to carry out business and there would have been increased tourism.  I want to correct Senator Haughey and tell him that £3 million that had been provided in the Estimates.  I am very regretful and sad about the demise of this commission, both as a politician of the party which had the imagination and the initiative to set it up and as a Dubliner.  This commission was well thought out and was a very well meant response to a virtual crescendo of criticism and frustration of Dublin people, Dublin organisations, and business houses, to what has happened to our capital city in the past three decades.</P>
      <P>The Government who addressed themselves to the quite awful problems of the disintegration of inner Dublin did so with the purpose of establishing a single function authority, for a period of three years which would assume the powers and responsibilities of the local authority, Dublin Corporation, and the responsibilities for the Dublin Transport Authority, as well as a number of responsibilities of the Garda Síochána. The proposal was eminently suitable and in the short space of time since the setting up of the commission it captured the imagination and the support of a wide range of interest groups and lobbies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the expectations expressed for the work of that commission would have been fulfilled.  They were to address in a co-ordinated way the many problems of the central core of Dublin.  It is not as <Col N="1592" /> if the commission were going to take over entirely Dublin city and county, although from some of the outrage expressed in some debates, one would think Dublin Corporation were being made redundant. That is not the case, and was not to be the case.  The commission were assigned responsibility for the area running from the top of Grafton Street, through Westmoreland Street to the Parnell Monument at the end of O'Connell Street, together with a number of smaller streets converging on that central spine. The budget allocated to the commission was £10 million over the three year period, as well as expenditure from Dublin Corporation representing the spending the corporation themselves would otherwise have had to make on maintenance in the area.</P>
    <P>The Government's actions on the matter smack of pique because it was not their idea in the first place.  They would have preferred a commission such as this body, if they were to be effective &mdash; and I am convinced they would have been effective &mdash; to be the brainchild of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have no doubt that this type of a senseless see-sawing of legislation on a change of Government, for no valid reason, is not lost on the electorate; it is one of the features of politics that leads to cynicism among the electorate.</P>
    <P>I regret the need for this commission to deal with the crippling problems of this city but there is a need for a small, powerful and highly motivated group which can effectively identify the problems and the work which needs to be done and to set about getting the improvements under way because, over the years, this city has been allowed to disintegrate.  Whoever was responsible&mdash; I am not here to apportion blame to any particular person &mdash; did not do the job that should have been done.  Perhaps the blame lies in administration, with councillors or corporation officials.  All who live in or around Dublin, particularly those who were born and grew up in Dublin, love it.  Each one has some special feature of the city that appeals more than any other.  Any thinking <Col N="1593" /> person must grieve deeply when they walk down the Quays or O'Connell Street at 10 o'clock on a Friday or Saturday night or, in the worst of all circumstances, see the madness of our main shopping areas during the peak shopping hours of Fridays and Saturdays.  Gone is the Dublin of Brendan Behan.  Gone is the Dublin of Edna O'Brien who wrote so wonderfully of the country girls from the offices who stayed in town for dances on Friday and Saturday nights because Dublin was a beautiful place.  Does this happen now?  Anyone who sees the packed buses leaving several centres around the city on a Friday evening can judge for themselves what has happened to their capital city over the past 25 years. We have gone beyond trying to defend the city.  Only an idiot or a liar would try to say that Dublin in its present state is a lovely place.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I attended a seminar in France.  During the course of an evening meal with 15 other participants from around the world, someone asked us where we were from.  When I said I was from Dublin an Austrian woman threw her hands in the air and cried out in consolation to me: &ldquo;Oh, how unfortunate for you; how dreadful; it is such a terrible city&rdquo;.  I was not the only one in that group to feel embarrassed by her remarks but in the face of candid truths like that it is none too easy to present a positive image. One wants to, but it is very difficult.</P>
    <P>One ironic factor about Dublin is that during the years it has been going into decline, whether through atrocious planning, derelict buildings, lack of landscaping or pollution, there has been a vast improvement in most European cities, many of which were devastated during the war years.  Indeed, a lesson closer to home can be learned if we look at what has been done to Belfast and Newry which suffered such destruction in more recent times.  I deeply and bitterly regret that the Government reversed the worthwhile initiative of the Coalition Government because it signals a victory for bureaucracy once again.  In Dublin, bureaucracy has got in the way of effective <Col N="1594" /> and speedy action in areas where it is necessary.</P>
    <P>What exactly is wrong with Dublin? First and foremost, it is the awful planning that has been allowed to develop in O'Connell Street which could more appropriately be called Las Vegas Way with its proliferation of fast food outlets, amusement arcades and advertising hoardings in the worst taste.  Secondly, there seems to be no harmonising between the traffic flow, the needs of shoppers and business houses.  Development and planning in the city centre have been higgledy-piggledy and unco-ordinated. The commission were charged with a number of very important tasks while maximising the areas which could be pedestrianised in a permanent way. They were to encourage the restoration and cleaning of facades of buildings, to encourage above all a feeling of security for pedestrians in the centre of the city by having an increased Garda presence and Garda telephone.  Dublin must rate as one of the most dangerous cities in the evening, particularly for women.  I have visited Hong Kong, Scandinavia, Toronto and various American cities and Dublin comes closest to New York for muggings and violence.</P>
    <P>The commission were charged with a number of important tasks such as maximising the areas which could be pedestrianised permanently.  The objectives of the commission was to restore to the centre of the city some of its beauty and charm which I remember from my own school days when I travelled from Eccles Street to Dundrum.  The arguments in favour of immediate and effective remedial measures to improve the amenities of Dublin city are not just for the people who live in and around Dublin.  I ask the Minister to appreciate that Dublin is the political and administrative capital of the country and has a role to play in the lives of all our citizens.  I very much doubt that people from outside Dublin find much pleasure coming here nowadays except for a football match or a pop concert, to visit a doctor or for a day's shopping.  A trip to Dublin should be enjoyable, not an endurance test.  Our <Col N="1595" /> aim ought to be to make this city a tourist attraction in the same way as London, Edinburgh, Rome or Paris are.  We will have a year of celebrations in 1988 but it will take far more than coloured flags, potted plants, balloons and bunting &mdash; this is the only facelift I can see possible in the time available and because of the lack of funds &mdash; if we are genuine about expressing our pride in our city.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the new Lord Mayor of whom I have great hopes. I am very happy that we have an Independent Lord Mayor, Alderman Carmencita Hederman, and that she has chosen Alice Glenn as her Deputy Lord Mayor.  Certainly the fact that we have two women in these important positions will help to redress the imbalance of having had only two women mayors in the past 800 years.</P>
    <P>I support the Government's emphasis on proposals to invest in improving the tourist industry.  They must consider the condition of this city in the context of tourist traffic and its impact on tourists. The foreign tourist &mdash; I am glad there are more of them this year &mdash; in Dublin is a sad, hunted looking specimen.  They have been told by tour operators about the risks of either getting killed by the traffic at an inter-section, having their bags snatched or being mugged.  For the length of time they stay in the city they move from Trinity College very cautiously across the road to the Kilkenny Design Centre, from where they are usually brought by coach to the safety of their hotels on the outskirts of the city.  Then they high tail it out of the city down south or to the west as quickly as possible.  Who can blame them?</P>
    <P>Let us ponder the incredible possible potential tourist resource because we have attractions as good as and, in many instances, better than other cities.  We have museums, the National Gallery, our old churches, the Phoenix Park and the Zoo but we cannot exploit them as long as the city environment is such a hostile one.  The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission would have been the spur to radical change and would have given the <Col N="1596" /> lead not only in the limited area for which they have responsibility but in other communities outside and around the city. They would have given the lead in a very dramatic way to a better environment and a better life in Dublin City.  We have to accept that Dublin is in a terrible mess and that legislators and the Minister have a special responsibility.  I challenge the Minister to put his proposals up front now.  He has the responsibility and the power.  He has squeezed out a very worth-while initiative.  It is not good enough to abandon one million people who live in and around Dublin and the very many people in Dublin who in the past have taken pride in their capital city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission was established on 1 February this year in the dying days of the previous Government.  The first meeting took place on 10 February.  I was appointed Minister for the Environment just one month later.  The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act had been passed into law a number of months earlier in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On assuming office the first task to be undertaken by this Government was the review of the public finances and the preparation of a budget so that practical and workable policies could be introduced and the pattern of economic decline halted and removed.  It was in the context of that review that the Government decided to suspend the allocation of £3.4 million announced by the previous Government for the activities of the commission in 1987.  As an interim measure and to allow the situation to be reviewed fully and at a more leisurely pace, the Government decided to limit the commission's allocation this year to £50,000 to meet liabilities alrady incurred.  In the weeks following that Government decision I considered the position of the commission very carefully.  I viewed the options open to me and I engaged in consultations and discussions with members of the commission, Dublin Corporation and various other persons concerned. In the end various factors, <Col N="1597" /> including the fact that I could not guarantee the future funding of the commission, impelled me to the conclusion that the proper course of action to adopt was to dissolve the commission.</P>
    <P>Before going on to elaborate on some of the detail of this, I invite Senators to consider this motion against the background, first of the overriding importance which the Government attach to the economic situation facing the country, the critical need to restore order and balance to the public finances and, secondly, to consider it against the background of the Government's record on the broader question of urban renewal. When looked at in this way, I am sure Senators will agree that the proper course of action was taken and the Government have done what is right for the city and the country.  I would urge Senators therefore, in the strongest possible terms, to reject this motion out of hand.</P>
    <P>The Government's first task on taking office was, as I have said, to review all aspects of the public finances to ensure that the resources available to the country would be used to best advantage and that confidence and growth in the economy would be restored.  The financial implications of the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were carefully considered as part of this review.  The Estimates published by the previous Government included a provision of £3.4 million from Exchequer funds for the operation of the commission in 1987.  This was roughly one-third of the £10 million earmarked in the Act for the operation of the commission over its life. The issue which had to be decided, therefore, was whether taxpayers could afford expenditure of that order in the current financial situation.</P>
    <P>Having spent so much time already in debating the Finance Bill, 1987, I know there is no need for me to spell out in any detail to Senators the current state of the public finances.  One thing I am sure we can all agree on is that there is simply no scope for further taxation.  That being the case, the only way of achieving the objective of restoring order to the public finances is through restrictions in the <Col N="1598" /> growth of expenditure even by cuts in expenditure, unpalatable though they may be.</P>
    <P>It gave me no great pleasure, as one of my first actions as Minister, to have to withdraw allocations made by my predecessor. Unfortunately, there was no other option.  In each case, we first had to be satisfied that the necessary funds could be provided without adverse effects on the level of taxation and the overall level of public expenditure.  It was a simple enough matter for my predecessor to include in the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act a section specifying that the commission would get £10 million over three years.  It is not quite so easy, however, to raise the same £10 million from our citizens already heavily weighed down by taxation. Neither can we lightly add another £10 million to the heavy burden of public debt that has been allowed to grow so rapidly in recent years.  These considerations were major factors influencing the decision I eventually made to dissolve the commission.</P>
    <P>We cannot get away from the harsh realities of the current financial and economic situation.  If the proposers of this motion want the funding restored to the commission, I challenge them now to stand up and say where the £10 million is to come from.  Is it to be borrowed or got through more taxation?  And, if not, what services are to suffer instead?  There is no point in talking in the abstract.  This Government have to take real decisions.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise at this point that nothing I have said or done is to be taken as being in any way anti-Dublin. Although I am not a Dublin Minister, Dublin is as much my capital city as it is that of anyone else living within the metropolitan area.  During the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, a recurring theme in contributions from both sides was the recognition of the problems of decay, dereliction, vandalism, pollution, traffic, noise, etc., of the capital city.  I accept that these problems exist and need to be cured.  Where we parted company was on the wisdom of attempting <Col N="1599" /> to tackle the problems through the mechanism of the three year Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted in the Act was to attempt to isolate the area designated as the metropolitan central area from the rest of Dublin city.  It would not require a degree in planning to realise that this isolation would cause major difficulty. The only way of mitigating this difficulty would have been to ensure maximum co-operation between the commission and other statutory bodies, in particular, the members and officials of Dublin Corporation. It would simply not have been possible for the commission to function without that co-operation.</P>
    <P>With the best will in the world, it seems to me that a body of seven part-time individuals could not have achieved what was expected of them without elaborate back-up and assistance from Dublin Corporation. The only ways in which the commission could have discharged the traffic, roads, litter and refuse functions assigned them would have been either a transfer of all necessary staff, premises, machinery, and so on from Dublin Corporation or alternatively to convince Dublin Corporation to continue to carry out those functions but on an agency basis.  Realistically, I have to say I was apprehensive about the continued smooth operation and discharge of these essential functions.  The action of my predecessor in transferring these functions to the commission while still in its infancy, with no improvement scheme prepared and only one fulltime employee, struck me as particularly foolhardy.</P>
    <P>In any event there were other major difficulties facing the commission in implementing the Act.  One of the more important of these was that the time allowed was quite simply far too short. There was a certain fondness in some quarters during the debates on the Bill, and later, to draw parallels between this commission and the Wide Streets Commissioners of 100 years ago.  Unfortunately what seems to have been <Col N="1600" /> forgotten, is that the Wide Streets Commissioners functioned for much longer than three years.  In fact, they functioned for close on 100 years.</P>
    <P>If the job which faced the commission was too big, because it depended on a broader and more integrated approach, and the time available was too short, it is also true to say that the finance marked in for the commission, namely £10 million, was almost certainly too small to enable them to achieve what had been mapped out for them.  My predecessor may have considered the £10 million a generous sum in times of financial stringency but what was never made clear was where this sum of £10 million was to come from.</P>
    <P>It is important that I place on record the nature of the discussions which I had with the members of the commission and with a deputation from Dublin Corporation before I took the final decision to dissolve the commission.  The members of the commission felt that they could bring a bold and imaginative new approach to the problems of the city centre area.  I have to say I was impressed by their enthusiasm and commitment to hard work.  They indicated to me that they hoped to complete the preparation of their improvement scheme by the end of June and that they would be in a position to submit the scheme to me at that stage.  Because of that, I agreed to allow the commission to continue until the end of June.  In the event, the chairman of the commission indicated to me a number of weeks ago that they would not, in fact, prepare an improvement scheme but would instead prepare a report of their ideas.  I have not received any indication of what will be in the report but I understand that the ideas will not be costed and that they will have been prepared without the benefit of consultation with Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with Dublin Corporation I was equally impressed by the considerable work that both the members and staff of the corporation put in recent years to secure improvements in all parts of the city.  The corporation's plans for 1987 include the resurfacing, both carriageway and footpaths, of Crown Alley, <Col N="1601" /> thus completing a connection from the Ha'penny Bridge to Grafton Street via the Central Bank Plaza, Trinity Street and Suffolk Street.  Lemon Street &mdash; which connects the Royal Hibernian Way with Grafton Street &mdash; will also be upgraded by resurfacing, as will Duke Lane.  Castle Market &mdash; which connects the Powerscourt Centre with the South City Markets &mdash; is being resurfaced with a special three castles motif.  When this is completed there will be a total pedestrian connection from Dawson Street to Georges Street via Royal Hibernian Way, Lemon Street, Johnston's Court, the Powerscourt Centre, Castle Market and South City Markets.</P>
    <P>Other improvements envisaged, I believe, include floodlighting at additional strategic points and improvements to traffic islands at key locations in O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>Plans are also advanced for the upgrading of Grafton Street.  This is a key location in terms of the city centre shopping area and as a tourist attraction.  I will be having further discussions with the corporation about Grafton Street and I can say now that I hope to see a major improvement scheme completed in time for next year's millennium celebrations.</P>
    <P>On the question of the millennium, I have to say that I believe it would have been singularly inappropriate to have removed the city centre from the control of the elected members of the city council during the millennium celebrations.  I know that the members of the corporation are keenly aware of their responsibilities to the city and of the need to tackle the problems which exist in preparation for the millennium celebrations. The plans for the millennium have attracted interest from many individuals and both public and private bodies have begun to generate support which will be channelled into various projects and events to enhance the city's image.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, Dublin Corporation will continue to have a special duty to have regard to the special importance of the metropolitan central <Col N="1602" /> area in the discharge of their statutory functions.  A special task force of officials within Dublin Corporation have been established and I have asked for regular reports on progress being made.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to draw Senators's attention to the progress that is being made on urban renewal generally. The Government's approach here is to create the right environment to lead and encourage development and investment, particularly by the private sector, through utilising appropriate tax incentives and making the most of the existing structures and bodies.  The existing designated areas scheme is being reviewed and consideration is being given to extending it to a limited number of other provincial centres.  In addition, the National Building Agency are playing a more active role in the area of urban renewal and, of course, tremendous advances are being made on the Custom House Docks project.  Accordingly, I believe that the Government's approach of utilising existing structures and opportunities to the fullest is the correct one and that there is no real need for a Metropolitan Streets Commission, which would have been another elaborate and expensive State body.</P>
    <P>I urge all Senators to reject this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned, I suppose the Minister more so than anybody else, about the condition of Dublin. It is our city.  It does not belong to any individual or type of individual.  I think we are all in favour of the hidden sentiments in this motion.  Of course, we reject the motion, but if the sentiment is that we would like to see the central area of the city improved and indeed all of the city, there is nobody who would be against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions so far.  I was very impressed by the contribution of Senator Joe Doyle.  It was well thought out and well prepared.  In my view, and I am subject to correction on this as I may have misunderstood the Senator, he has made a very good case for what the Minister <Col N="1603" /> has done.  If I understood Senator Doyle correctly, he more or less stated that since the Minister made this decision there are indications that private funding will be available and that professional people are prepared to offer their services voluntarily.  The Minister in that situation might be tempted to withdraw money in other areas and look for private support and volunteers.  If that is the situation I am very happy about it but in all the contributions so far there has been nothing to convince me that there is anything amiss which cannot be done by Dublin Corporation and for which we must have a commission.</P>
    <P>I sat in this House last year when the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, was passed.  I very much welcome the redevelopment incentives under the Finance Act in association with that Act.  As the Minister has pointed out there is on today's Order Paper a Bill to improve that Urban Renewal Act in various ways.  There is no question of the commitment of the Government being at issue.  I would have to commend the Government and the Minister on coming to a brave decision rather than letting this thing wander on, perhaps with some hope of a little more money.  I think it was a brave act and the right one and I commend the Minister for it.</P>
    <P>In the Fine Gael/Labour programme for Government published in December 1982 it was proposed to have an annual 10 per cent tax on derelict sites.  So far as I know, this was never done.  It would not have cost the country anything and this is an important area.  The latest Act we have in that regard is the 1961 Derelict Sites Act.  There is a need to update the Act.  There is a widespread problem in this area.  The Government promised to introduce that tax.  When I questioned Deputy Fergus O'Brien in this House on the matter he told me that they intended to bring in this tax but that was never done.  If any other party, and particularly the Coalition in power, were interested in that area they could have made this important amendment at no cost to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> Reference has been made to a replacement for Nelson's Pillar.  I hope the pillar will be replaced because a focal point is a very important consideration in any design.  Mention has been made of people it will be appropriate to remember when the time comes.  The late Mr. Eamon de Valera would have a great right in that regard, so would other politicians. However, in my view, the right of James Joyce to commemoration in this way would be very hard to surpass.</P>
    <P>I went into the matter in great detail when the Bill was being discussed.  There is no need to go back over that road, but most people thought it undermocratic.  It took power from the corporation.  At a time when we are looking for decentralisation and to give more power to local authorities it was rather unfortunate. I have always made the case that in any area of development, and housing in particular, the people who will live in those areas should be consulted.  In other countries that is a first step.  In Sweden, for example, the views of the people are sought for a proposed housing scheme. There was a provision that local authorities could have this consultation if they wanted.  Local authorities have to make very difficult decisions, for example, with regard to rates and service charges.  It would be most unfortunate to take this business from them when they have to make that choice.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are responsible for the way in which Dublin has developed. We should ask why have Dublin Corporation failed.  Is it because of our planning laws?  The Planning Act came into force in 1963 before development really started, and consequent legislation dealing with planning is deficient in some ways.  New legislation is necessary to amend existing legislation.  We have an opportunity now.  We see the mistakes which were made.  That is one area in which the Minister could work.  It has been claimed that planning does not work.  Of course this is wrong as there is no other way.  But the legislation needs to be amended and supplemented.  This should be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Reference was made to An Board Pleanála. It is worth remembering that there is no design experience in An Bord Pleanála. This is necessary.  Senator Haughey highlighted instances where decisions by Dublin Corporation were ouerruled by An Bord Pleanála.  The problem is financial, as the Minister pointed out.  The Minister rightly said that it was very easy to allow £10 million on paper, but the actual provision of it was another matter.  This reminds me of the various home improvement grants and the other housing grants.  I welcomed them at the time but the money was not provided and problems arose.  It became almost impossible to get application forms from the Department.  The money was not provided in this case either.</P>
    <P>Design has two aspects, the functional and the aesthetic.  You do not have to have a degree in planning or in architecture to understand these things in their simple, broken down concepts.  The functional aspect of design relates to what something has to do and the aesthetic aspect relates to the emotional impact on the beholder.  It is not a matter of deciding which is the more important.  They are both very important.  If the functional aspect is not satisfactory, the aesthetic part cannot make up for it.  In simple terms, if I design an armchair which is not comfortable to sit on, it does not serve its purpose and no matter how beautiful it looks, it is a failure.  The same applies to urban development.  The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill was a cosmetic exercise.  We were dealing simply with aesthetics. There was not enough in depth investigation. There was no provision for that. The aesthetic aspect is important, but the functional aspect is also important. Possibly the investigation into the functional aspects would be the most labour intensive area of this work.  We dealt simply with cosmetics whereas the other part of it could have been a total failure. I am not saying it is, but it could have been.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to plastic signs. They are a big problem.  It is strange that we did not come to terms with plastic <Col N="1606" /> as we have with other materials used in building.  It really was an abuse of the material.</P>
    <P>In efforts at urban renewal, people were transported to the suburbs.  This was unfortunate as it has denuded the centre city area of life.  It interfered with the culture and the dignity of a people.  It brought consequent stress into their lives by bringing them into strange situations. I dealt with that in detail before.  It is unfortunate that we do not have that living central city area.  The only way it will come to life again is by bringing the people back.  I commend some of the schemes which have been undertaken in the centre city area and contiguous areas in recent times, even if these are taken more or less wholesale from across the water.  There is no harm in copying the best features of anything, whether it is in our own country or in foreign countries. But the ordinary people should be consulted and should have some say in the type of environment they get.  I am not sure that I should use such a term as I do not believe that there is such a thing as an ordinary individual.  It is very important for people to have that contact with the commission.  That is the only way improvements will be made.  You cannot impose them on people.  They must be part of the decision making progress.</P>
    <P>The metropolitan streets Bill was very specific regarding area, time and amount. The area extended from Parnell Square to St. Stephen's Green with small spur streets along the way.  The time span was three years and the amount was £10 million plus a contribution from Dublin Corporation. It was unfortunate that it was not more flexible.  I am not saying it should be open-ended but it should have been more flexible.  The areas to be considered and taken into account are mentioned in the Second Schedule of the 1986 Act, for example, buildings and facades in need of improvement, redecoration, renovation or renewal.  They do not need a commission.</P>
    <P>I admire the work of Patrick Shaffrey and of his wife Maura who is a very noted architect also.  Mr. Shaffrey has been <Col N="1607" /> responsible to a large extent for the success of The Tidy Towns Competition and I hope his services will be retained by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I hope the motion is rejected for the reason I have stated, that there is nothing that needs to be done that cannot be done by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain bogus element about this motion which I am very glad was put on the Order Paper. To oppose the motion put down by Fine Gael is to possibly fall into the trap of being accused of being Philistine, being anti-environment and all sorts of accusations of that sort.  I do not think that those who are oppossed &mdash; and I am opposed to this motion &mdash; should be condemned as that.</P>
      <P>On the whole I support what the Minister has said on the principle of setting up the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission. I do not think we should once again debate the Bill that went through here last year but we should ask whether at this time it is helpful to set up yet another State or semi-State body which is State-funded and whether it is a principle which we can support.  I think we in this House would like to see Dublin city for its millennium becoming a more efficient, better run, more beautiful and more cosmetically attractive place to look at.  If we are opposed to this motion it does not mean that we oppose that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find difficult to approve of is primarily the principle that such a body should be set up and, if it is set up, why it is necessary to set it up.  Senator Fitzsimons said he felt that there was some fault in the corporation and this was why the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were necessary.  I do not necessarily think that there was a fault in the corporation.  There may be a fault in the system because by setting up this body we are once again pandering to the philosophy of depending on the State.  If there is something wrong with Dublin, the streets in Dublin and the way the streets are being looked after we look automatically to the Government to <Col N="1608" /> rescue us from this problem and to remedy the situation.  We look automatically to the apparently limitless treasure trove of Government funding to improve the situation.  Instead of depending on the Government to conjure up this lovely idea, which the Minister produced in his speech, of a pedestrian way all the way from Dawson Street to Georges Street why do those who own offices and shops and those who work in the streets not get together and do it themselves? Why do we need Government funding to improve the streets?  Why can these people not make their streets more beautiful and get together in a private way to do it?  They may need Government or corporation permission for it but I am not sure that they need a Government organisation or a Government funded organisation to do it.  If we set up this body we will grow more dependent once again on the Government to do the work which we could perfectly well do ourselves if the motivation was there.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the aims of the Bill were lauded and if it achieved the results which we were looking for it would be laudable but we do not agree on whether it was necessary.  To set up yet another commission to solve or ameliorate a problem is the wrong way of thinking.  The people in individual streets and areas who live and work in the area should be asked to contribute not necessarily with their money but with their time and effort to improve the environment in which they live.  It is justifiable to depend on the Government for permission, motivation and direction but not necessarily for funding.</P>
    <P>That is why in principle I do not feel it is right to condemn what the Government have done.  It is very easy for us to say this is a dreadful thing to have done, they are Philistines and they are ruining a well-intentioned Bill which was put through by the last Government.  Nobody believes for one moment that this Government do it out of any motive except to save money and because it cannot be afforded.  It is not going to make the Government popular to abolish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  The motives <Col N="1609" /> of those who have abolished it cannot be questioned.</P>
    <P>What I do see in this debate, I am afraid, is the same old problem emerging on party political lines of being in Opposition and immediately condemning specific elements of public expenditure cuts, and of being in Government and having to take them.  We had exactly the same thing when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition. They condemned spending and cuts which were made by the Government at that time.  Now the shoe is on the other foot and inevitably we have the Opposition condemning it.  What we should have had from the Opposition were specific funding proposals for the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission. In other words, if they are going to say this body should not be abolished and it is going to cost £10 million, we should at least have specific proposals about where that £10 million is to come from and where they will cut elsewhere. We had an election campaign in which the present Government, then the Opposition, were continually asked where the cuts would be made if the budget was to be balanced or to come near being balanced.  If they are now condemning a Government cut they have a moral duty to say exactly where they would find the £10 million and from whom they would take it.  There is a completely different responsibility from being in Government and taking decisions and being in the luxury of Opposition and condemning them.  That is the difference.  I know the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were set up by the last Government. They say that if they were in power they would keep the commission going but they ought to point out how they would fund it, in other words, where the money is to come from.</P>
    <P>There is a strong argument in this for looking at many other bodies and quangos of this sort and dismantling them and putting them in private hands. There is a good case for looking not only at the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, their powers and what they are doing but for looking also at other bodies <Col N="1610" /> set up by the State to do much of the work which private industry, private individuals and private organisations could do.  I would include in this Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála and all sorts of semi-State bodies.  Admittedly this body do not have a proven or an unproven record. Therefore, it is very difficult to condemn them before they start but we should look at the principle of setting this up and not necessarily condemn those who want a cut on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me this opportunity to make a case for funding for Waterford Airport. Why is there an airport in Waterford in the first place?  To go back to its origins, the need for an airport in Waterford has long been recognised by employers, the trade union movement and by the people of Waterford generally.  In 1978 a report was produced by Dr. Michael Bannon of the Urban Planning Section of Dublin University on Waterford as a regional centre and he highlighted the need in that report for an airport in Waterford.  In that year the regional manager of the Industrial Development Authority, Mr. Frank Burke, wrote to the city council pointing out that industries had been lost to Waterford because of the lack of an airport and the city council decided to take the initiative.  Surveys were carried out and an area of land was earmarked and purchased by Waterford Corporation. Going hand-in-hand with this, negotiations took place between the IDA and a German glider manufacturing company who intended to put up a manufacturing unit in Waterford.  The airstrip would be provided on the land already obtained by the corporation, the glider company would need the airstrip to test their gliders but it would also be available for airport activities.  Unfortunately at a very advanced stage the German company <Col N="1611" /> pulled out of the project and the corporation were left with the land and with no prospective project.</P>
      <P>As part of the 1979 national understanding the employment guarantee fund was set up which was subscribed to by employees, employers and by the Government.  A proposal was put to the tripartite committee, who administered the fund, by Waterford Corporation and something very important happened in Waterford at that time.  The social partners and the local representatives made common cause and lobbied the tripartite committee and, as a result, a total of £860,000 was provided to construct an airport at Waterford.  Construction went ahead but there was not sufficient money to finish the project.  A steering committee was set up consisting of the employer organisations and the local trades council to get the project off the ground but when the airstrip was finished it was obvious there were some notable omissions in the project.  There was no terminal building, navigation equipment could not be provided and money was obtained by appeals from the local business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been two appeals during the years of the airport's existence which realised in the region of £200,000. Initially this money was seen as revenue which would be used for running costs but unfortunately because of the situation that had developed this money had to be used to provide capital equipment.  A prefabricated building was obtained as a terminal building and the necessary navigation and radio equipment was acquired but from the very beginning there were financial problems.  Waterford County Council, Waterford Corporation and the IDA also subscribed money towards running costs and Waterford County Council and Waterford Corporation continue to do this on an annual basis.  The airport officially opened in December 1981. Avair, which was a national airline, operated a flight which linked into a Dublin-Cork flight which the company were organising and this flight continued <Col N="1612" /> until 1984 when the Avair Company went into receivership.</P>
    <P>Waterford Airport had little activity until June 1985 when Ryanair came on the scene and a scheduled flight, the first one from any regional airport in Ireland outside of the three major airports, was put into operation and we had a flight from Waterford to London.  This scheduled flight has gone from strength to strength.  Initially we had 16-seater aircraft, a Bandeirante operating.  This operated until June 1986 when a Hawker Siddeley 748, a 44-seater was provided. At present out of Waterford Airport there are several flights a week to Luton Airport.  There is a flight every day and there are double flights on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.  The number of passengers using the Ryanair service are well above expectations and the whole operation has been a success.</P>
    <P>The airport has been faced with the problems of success because as the Ryanair service developed further capital equipment was needed.  In recent times we have doubled the size of the apron, we have upgraded the fire service and, most important of all, we have upgraded our navigational aids.  We had a diversion rate which caused a great deal of concern but since the new equipment has been put in place that has halved so that we are in a very strong position <i>vis-a-vis</i> other airports in the country regarding diversion rates.</P>
    <P>The real rationale behind the airport is one of developing the region, developing industry, tourism, and commerce generally. I was in touch with the airport today and there were three executive jets in Waterford.  They departed to Luton, Ostend and Munich.  To demonstrate the regional aspect of the airport two of those planes arrived here to do business with the digital company in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>In general the airport is progressing well.  The use of the airport by the business community <i>vis-a-vis</i> the charter flights is increasing dramatically.  There is good progress in the freight business at the airport.  We must bear in mind that the previous Government agreed to grant the airport a licence to operate a duty <Col N="1613" /> free service.  In 1981 we were faced with crisis after crisis on the running cost side. Now there is some stability there and forward planning is possible.  Having appealed twice to the business community in Waterford and having obtained not alone approximately £200,000 but also a great deal of help in kind, professional services and so on, the airport is now at a stage where we cannot realistically go back to the business community again.  To finish the airport to a standard which we would all desire, a number of capital items are very necessary.  I stress that we see these capital items as finishing this phase in the development of the airport. If a proper terminal building is given to us and the car parking at the airport is extended, we will have new revenue generating areas and the airport can develop self-sufficiency.  However, without a major capital investment at this time we cannot get to that stage as quickly as we would like.</P>
    <P>There was no provision in the Estimates for the Minister's Department this year for local and regional airports.  Last year there was a £1.1 million provision and £987,000 of that, on the outturn, has gone to Galway.  We in Waterford welcome the development of Galway Airport.  We welcome the development of all the regional airports because this area of our national infrastructure needs development so that Ireland can be an attractive location for industry and tourists.</P>
    <P>Waterford city now has a definite project under way to attract more tourists to the city.  We have looked at the York model in the UK.  York is a city of some 160,000 people and it had a very run down city centre in the early sixties. Through the aggressive and constructive work of the local authority the city centre was greatly enhanced.  They retained their old streets and developed a very important and revenue generating craft sector hand in hand with very modern shopping centres.  Apart from London, York, with its historical attractions, which are very much sought after by American and continental tourists, is now the tourist capital of the UK with <Col N="1614" /> three million visitors per year.  Waterford city has looked at that model.  It is making use of the incentives for urban commercial development which were granted to the five major cities by the previous Government and a very impressive shopping development is to start later on this year in the city centre.  The city council are already developing our very important and extensive historical remains.  A booklet was produced recently outlining Waterford's history.</P>
    <P>The airport will play a major role in attracting visitors to our city.  It is very important that the airport should look well.  We started with a prefabricated terminal building which was upgraded quite a bit in the past 12 months with money as well as a great deal of help in kind from the business community.  A control tower was put in place, but we need a modern solid structure.  We need also to double our apron space because at present we have not got sufficient parking space for planes.</P>
    <P>A hangar was constructed at the airport by a local businessman who is about to provide an aircraft maintenance and repair service.  A local building firm has taken a site from the corporation on the 60 acres of industrial land adjoining the airport and it is hoped that in the very near future a unit will be constructed.  We have a flying club in Waterford which is continuing to prosper.  There is an aviation museum at the airport which has attracted visitors from England and the Continent.  There is a DC7 and a great collection of aeronautica which have increased the public awareness of the airport in Waterford.</P>
    <P>In any speech about Waterford Airport, the vision and determination of the city manager must be given full recognition, because there would be no airport in Waterford if he had not taken the initiative and pressed for this project, and, more important, managed to get all the sections of the community pulling in the same direction.  Mr. Chris Hennessy manager of Waterford Airport has been there since the beginning.  He is an aviation enthusiast, a man very dedicated to Waterford but, most important of all <Col N="1615" /> from the point of view of the airport, a total professional.  Mr. Michael Doody as city manager, and Mr. Chris Hennessy as manager of the airport have made a tremendous contribution to what we have in Waterford today.</P>
    <P>An application was lodged with the Minister's Department on 13 October 1986 seeking £250,000 for the erection of a terminal building and a control tower. We also sought in a subsequent submission a grant to double the size of the apron.  As I said earlier we are now experiencing the problems of success.  We have not sufficient parking space for planes at the airport.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to improve the access roads but that does not directly relate to the Minister's Department.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices and mention this matter to the Minister for the Environment.  The access roads to the airport are far from adequate. There are 1.9 kilometres of road from the city side of the airport and 6.2 kilometres on the county side which require urgent attention.  A rough estimate is that £450,000 would be required to do this job adequately.  We are not seeking a hand out.  We will not be coming back to the Minister again.  We are asking the Minister to provide us with the money to complete this phase of the airport.  In the Green Paper on Transport produced by the Minister's predecessor, one of the conditions for a grant-in-aid to a local or regional airport was that 25 per cent local funding would be provided.</P>
    <P>I did not mention earlier that in 1982 the then Fianna Fáil Government provided a grant of £50,000 for the airport and late last year the outgoing Government provided a grant of £20,000.  We are seeking money to complete the airport, to give us a revenue generating base to make certain that we can rely on having the running costs of the airport. We have run this airport on a virtual shoestring.  The Minister's Department will be in possession of our annual reports and any scrutiny of those will give evidence that we have used every halfpenny we have ever got to the very best effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> If it is not possible in the Estimates to provide us with the full amount, if an ongoing commitment could be given during a number of years to help us to complete the airport, it would at least give us the chance to embark on this final part of our project.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ní mór dom a rá go raibh sé beartaithe agam go mbeadh an tAire anseo ach tá sé i gcomhrá, d'fhéadfaí a rá, le daoine mar gheall ar eitileáin agus a leithéid agus ní raibh sé ar a chumas a bheith anseo.  Ach de bharr seo, tá anáthas orm bheith anseo mar is í seo an chéad uair dom san Ard Teach, an Seanad, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh mé anseo arís go minic as seo amach.  De réir dealraimh ní féidir leis an Roinn Turasóireachta agus Iompair éalú ó chúrsaí eitleoireachta faoi láthair.  Mar sin féin cuirim fáilte roimh an seans seo chun ceist Aerphort Phort Láirge a shoiléiriú don Seanad.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to make the point that the Minister, Deputy Wilson, is, as Members are well aware, heavily involved in discussions on air transport at this time.  People are causing us little problems here and there which are not of our making.  We wish him well in trying to solve a problem that has been going on between two of our neighbours for some while.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline the broad parameters which apply in the case of regional airport development.  In recent years, Exchequer grants of almost £14 million have been provided for the development of such airports.  Given the extremely difficult budgetary position faced by the Exchequer in this period I am sure Senators will agree that this level of financial assistance has been very generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of additional regional airports or the financing of improvement works at existing ones is essentially a matter in the first instance for local initiative, subject to compliance with the technical aviation requirements <Col N="1617" /> of my Department and of planning legislation. As far as State financial assistance for such projects is concerned, the situation is that before this question can be considered, an assured local contribution of at least 25 per cent of the capital cost of the project is required.</P>
    <P>Exchequer assistance can be made available only in cases where there would be clear economic benefits, assessed on an objective basis, from investment in the project.  Such assessments are based on the following criteria: (1), the need for the project; (2), the market potential for scheduled services; (3), the likely return from the capital invested and (4), the impact on local employment and other infrastructural services in the area.</P>
    <P>In the specific case of Waterford Airport, I am sure Senators will be interested in the following information.  Waterford Airport was constructed in 1980-81 at a cost of £1.2 million.  Since then additional expenditure of about £150,000 has been incurred on various improvements bringing total investment in the project up to £1.35 million.  Of that figure an amount of over £930,000 in capital grant assistance has been provided by the Exchequer.  This figure comprises £860,000 from the employment guarantee fund mentioned by the Senator and £70,000 from my Department's Vote. The most recent grant was for £20,000 and was paid in December 1986 to enable the promoters to purchase essential navigational equipment.  This has helped to further improve the airport's capabilities.</P>
    <P>So far as employment guarantee fund assistance for Waterford airport is concerned it is sometimes suggested that such funds did not represent a contribution from the Exchequer.  I would like to completely refute any such assertions and to point out that the bulk of these funds was provided directly by the Exchequer and administered by the Department of Finance.  Furthermore the amount of grant assistance which has been made available to Waterford over the years compares very favourably with support given to the regional airports at Farranfore, Sligo and Carnmore, Galway.</P>
    <P>I would also advise the Seanad that in <Col N="1618" /> 1986 the airport promoters sought additional grant assistance of £250,000 for further development works including the provision of a new terminal building-control tower, fuel storage tanks and additional road improvements.  This application was carefully considered but in the light of the substantial amount of Exchequer grant assistance already provided for the project and the many competing demands for scarce Exchequer resources, it was not possible to accede to the request.</P>
    <P>At present Waterford Airport caters for certain international scheduled and non-scheduled flights and the technical facilities and services available to assist aircraft movements have been progressively developed at the airport over the past few years.  The aviation technical staff of my Department are constantly available to give the airport authorities any advice they may need on aeronautical matters.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the technical services at present available at the airport adequately comply with international standards particularly with regard to safety.</P>
    <P>The initiatives taken recently to improve competitive conditions in air travel and to maintain fares at the lowest possible levels have acted as a major stimulus to the increase in traffic between Waterford and London.  In July 1985 Ryanair introduced daily services to Gatwick from Waterford using a 15 seater aircraft.  This service was such a pronounced success that in May 1986 Ryanair inaugurated the Waterford-London route and introduced a 44 seater aircraft on to the service.</P>
    <P>Like the Senator, I acknowledge the commitment by the city manager and all others who had an input into the achievement so far attained at Waterford Airport.</P>
    <P>Passenger loads on the route have been very satisfactory.  In the period May 1986 to March 1987, over 15,000 passengers were carried on the route; this compares with carryings of 4,870 on the initial service from the date of introduction up to March 1986.  Those figures indicate <Col N="1619" /> clearly the success of the airport.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure Senators that I am acutely conscious of the contribution which Waterford Airport has made to the overall development of the south-eastern region and the regeneration in the area of a spirit of entrepreneurial initiative.  In this regard the success of the scheduled services to London should be a major attraction for potential investors in the area.  I am also satisfied that the airport authorities can, with intensive marketing, succeed in attracting successful industries to the area and in that way continue to make a major contribution to the economic development of the region as well as secure the additional funds necessary to finance improvements at the airport.</P>
    <P>I also understand that a licence was <Col N="1620" /> recently granted to the airport by the Revenue Commissioners to enable duty free sales there.  Duty free facilities have proved to be major revenue earners at many airports throughout Europe and this concession and the major developments in aviation and tourism at present provide the promoters with the opportunity to establish the airport as a viable proposition and to generate profits which could be used to finance future investment in the airport.  I regret, however, that in the present financial circumstances I could not agree to provide or to commit, as has been requested by the Senator, any further Exchequer funds for the airport project.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 July 1987.</P>
