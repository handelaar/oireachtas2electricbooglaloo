      <P>I have notice from Senator Maurice Manning regarding a motion which he wishes to move under Standing Order 29.  I call on Senator Manning to give notice of his motion before I give my ruling on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Seanad on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration. The matter relates to the serious situation of public disorder which has occurred over the past number of days in the Darndale area of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I have given careful consideration to the matter raised by Senator Manning and I do not consider it to be a matter contemplated by Standing Order 29.  I regret, therefore, that I have to rule it out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly regret your judgment.  This is &mdash; and I am sure Senator Haughey will agree &mdash; a matter of great importance.  There is a great danger of further disorder if urgent action is not taken to resolve the problem which is more than a policing one.  It is a social problem and one of long standing.  The matter is worthy of urgent debate in this <Col N="1792" /> House to try to bring about its resolution. I will discuss it later with you, a Chathaoirleach, to see if there is some way in which we could have the matter raised in this House.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole has a letter from me regarding something which is related to this and I will come to it in moment.  I would like to say at this point to all my colleagues in the Seanad that there are rules for me as Cathaoirleach whether they are in relation to Standing Order 29 or any other Standing Order.  The Senators have the power to change those rules if they want to through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I hate ruling out of order something that may be of great importance to any individual Member of this House. Senators have the power to change the rules but while the rules are before me I have to abide by them.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan, that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure that funds provided by him to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are used for the purposes he intended.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The attendance of Irish diplomats at the official reception for President Waldheim of Austria on 25 June 1987 in the Vatican.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to reverse their decision to abolish Bord Scannán na hÉireann, the Irish Film Board, in the interests of the Irish film industry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate when it is proposed to start a building programme at Rahan national school, Mallow, County Cork, as a serious accommodation problem will exist there in September 1987 as some of the present accommodation is extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> I also received notice from Senator Mick Lanigan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his considerable influence to ensure that the United Nations renew the UNIFIL mandate in Lebanon which expires on 19 July.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To demand of the Minister for Justice that persecuted members of the travelling community be offered the same protection from the law and the forces of law as the rest of the community, and that those who in recent times have attacked, threatened, frightened and evicted members of the travelling community be brought to justice immediately.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ryan, Norris, Daly, Bradford and Lanigan as suitable for discussion on the adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ryan's motion and it will be taken from 10 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.  Senators Norris, Daly, Bradford and Lanigan may give notice for another day.  With regard to the matters raised by Senator O'Toole, I will talk later with Senator Manning and him.  The House should take note of my earlier reference if they want more freedom in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any intention of making a speech but I want to say how grateful I am to you for directing the attention of the House to certain deficiencies and I hope all sides of the House will take this opportunity to bear in mind very clearly that you are giving us a lead in attempting to make the procedures of this House such that they may respond to serious matters.</P>

      <P>Just in case the Senator took me up wrongly, I do not want to give the impression that there are any deficiencies in the Seanad because I do not think there are.  What I said is that there might be greater freedom for the Members of this House and this reform is in their hands if they want it.  I am the <Col N="1795" /> Cathaoirleach and I have to abide by the rules.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that we take items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on the Order Paper.  Regarding the matter raised by Senator Norris and referred to by you, a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has already been set up and the situation regarding motions of urgency will be taken into account when that committee meets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I suggest that Seanad Éireann as the less party political of the two Houses, and the only one in session at the moment should welcome the moves towards dialogue in Northern Ireland arising from the report of the Unionist task force and should express its hope that there will be a fruitful outcome to these first new beginnings with the full sympathy, but without any interference, from this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House we would certainly like to be associated with those good wishes from Senator Murphy towards the beginning of dialogue in Northern Ireland.  On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would give us some guidance as to Government policy on the refusal yesterday by the Department of Foreign Affairs to receive a delegation from Kampuchea who had come to this country to express their gratitude for the donations and help of the people of this country.  This group was received by senior Irish politicians but yet was refused recognition by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is all the more bizarre because our policy over the years has been consistently to try to make the situation somewhat easier for the Government which replaced the barbarous Pol Pot regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House be prepared to enter into discussions today with the Whips to see if the Darndale motion could be discussed either today or tomorrow?  My intentions are very similar to those of Senator Haughey.  We both feel very strongly for the people who are being misrepresented in what is happening.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business would the Leader of the House be prepared to consider accepting an all-party motion at the beginning of the next session for a full scale debate on the Constitution such as was envisaged here last week?  Finally, could the Leader of the House give some indication of the business for next week and the days when it is intended to sit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I reiterate a question which Senator Manning asked and address it to Senator Manning and his party and the Government party because I met the president of the Kampuchean Red Cross.  Why cannot our Government meet the president of the Kampuchean Red Cross.  That is a deplorable stain on our image as an independent country with concern for human rights as we recognise the most genocidal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business I should like to associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Manning and Senator Murphy about the need for dialogue in Northern Ireland between the two communities and specifically for us <Col N="1797" /> not to interfere in that particular dialogue. With that in mind I should like to congratulate the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party for their continued refusal to sign Item No. 38 on the Order Paper.  As they have taken a responsible attitude to the issue of extradition perhaps they would persuade the less responsible members of their party to take this item off the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business perhaps the Cathaoirleach will pardon me if I express surprise.  I appreciate that the Cathaoirleach tries to keep order and it surprises me, as a rural Senator, that the people who try to bulldoze, who try to make a speech to get their point across, people we would like to look up to, people who are called professors, are the people who ridicule&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the questions raised by Senator Manning. Matters relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs are within the ambit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  They are not in my area of responsibility.  The matter should be taken up with the Minister <Col N="1798" /> and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>In regard to discussing the Darndale issue, the decisions taken by the Cathaoirleach was the decision of the Cathaoirleach.  It was not a decision of the Government; it was not a decision of the party or this side of the House.  The Chair's decision is based on Standing Orders but I agree, as other Senators have suggested, that we should have discussions during the day to see how we can get over that.</P>
      <P>So far as a discussion on the Constitution is concerned I have no worries about taking a motion on that subject in due course.  I said last week there was no way we could get into a full scale discussion on the Constitution in this session.</P>
      <P>We will take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  The motion will be taken from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m.  If all stages of the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1987, and the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill, 1987, have been dealt with we will continue after 8 p.m. with the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  It is intended that we will sit late this evening.  Tomorrow we will be sitting possibly until 8 p.m. We can have discussions on the ordering of the items for next week but it is likely that we will sit Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</P>
      <P>The question relating to Foreign Affairs was raised by Senator Manning and Senator Brendan Ryan.  I have already replied to that.  I am glad Senator Ross has withdrawn his amendment to item No. 38.  Since that amendment is withdrawn, we will withdraw the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the following arrangements for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad, recommended by the Committee <Col N="1799" /> on Procedure and Privileges, be adopted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  that Radio Telefís Éireann be authorised to continue broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad and Oireachtas Committees on a pilot basis for a further period of twelve months, provided that such broadcasting proves satisfactory throughout that period;</P>
    <P>(2)  that such broadcasting be reviewed on an on-going basis by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;</P>
    <P>(3)  that such broadcasting to be in any of the following forms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in edited form in Radio and Television News bulletins and current affairs programmes,</P>
    <P>(ii)  in edited form in a &ldquo;Today in the Seanad/Oireachtas&rdquo; type programme,</P>
    <P>(iii)  in edited form in a &ldquo;This week in the Committees&rdquo; type programme,</P>
    <P>(iv)  occasional live broadcasts of major debates of events in the Seanad or in Committees subject in each case to the prior approval of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;</P>
    <P>(4)  that recordings should not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcasts;</P>
    <P>(5)  that copyright of the material be retained by the Houses of the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(6)  that Radio Telefís Éireann archive material in accordance with their usual practice;</P>
    <P>(7)  that Radio Telefís Éireann be empowered to sell the recordings to foreign broadcasting stations at an appropriate charge subject to a formal agreement between Radio Telefís Éireann and such foreign broadcasting stations that the recordings shall not be <Col N="1800" /> used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcasts;</P>
    <P>(8)  that Radio Telefís Éireann devote a proportion of broadcast coverage to proceedings of Oireachtas Committees; and</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the extremely impartial and objective work done by the broadcasting unit of RTE in reporting what happens in this House. The example they have set might well be followed by some of the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges some years ago how long it took to get the business of reporting proceedings in the Seanad off the ground.  Like Senator Manning I agree it has been fully worth while.  It has worked out very well.  I have no reason for personal dissatisfaction with the reporting of the proceedings, though I am sure Senator McGowan has. It has given the public a better idea of the workings of this House.  Although there are times when one would wish that the nightly report on the Oireachtas would cover more ground in respect of Seanad Éireann, on the whole we should be well pleased.  Regarding our concern about subsection (4) which states:</P>
      <P>That recordings should not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcast;</P>
      <P>I wonder if we are not being too thin skinned.  After all, politics is entertainment and the business of RTE is primarily entertainment.  If it is a matter of record I cannot see why the material should not be used in any way the authorities wish to use it.  I want to express my satisfaction with a job which is being done extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1801" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree completely with Senator Murphy.  If people in this House choose to make fools of themselves then it should be the privilege of the nation to have that made known to them.  We have an extraordinarily protective attitude towards ourselves and the media.  In general I have no reason to complain about the media nor, I think, does any Member of this House.  We can all make specific complaints about things we wanted reported which were omitted but I think it is time we got used to the fact that we cannot prevent satirical print organs of the media from making whatever use they wish of this House and its proceedings. They can use quotations out of context.  They can use quotations which are unfair and quotations which are perhaps silly which were made on the spur of the moment and we can do nothing about it.  It is time we stopped this genuflection towards the electronic media.  My view is that we are masters of all of them, that we can handle all of them and we do not have anything to apologise for to any of them.  We should, therefore, let them deal with this House any way they wish. We can deal with them on our own terms without this protective cloak we throw around ourselves the whole time.</P>
      <P>Although I do not see any reference to radio in this motion, I presume it refers only to radio since that is the way it has been up to now.  Again, we have this protective cloak around ourselves.  I know RTE would drop dead if we suggested they should provide television coverage because of the costs involved; RTE would say that they are in favour of it, but what if we actually agreed to it? We should be setting the pace on this, inviting the electronic media to catch up with us rather than this grudging step-by-step recognition that we live in the late 20th century and not in the end of the 19th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to look at the issue of our putting a whole series of restrictive conditions on how the electronic media deal with our affairs, and in particular the committee should look at the issue of allowing full access of all the electronic <Col N="1802" /> media to deal with the business of both Houses as they see fit.  We have an extremely responsible media in this country by comparison with our near neighbour. We should get away from having to protect ourselves with rules and regulations and get used to a healthy ordinary working relationship with all of the media.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of Senator Ryan.  If the terms of reference under which broadcasting is made are to be reviewed that should be done through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is an important organ that serves as a monitoring device, and I would like to see that continue.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I share the view that the presentation of the proceedings of both Houses of the Oireachtas has been done in a very balanced and fair manner.  Furthermore, we often complain in the Seanad about the lack of coverage we get in the media.  RTE have made an important contribution to redress that imbalance.  I particularly welcome the further step to cover the proceedings of joint committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Many important national issues are discussed in these committees and I think the greater coverage will enhance the relevance of the committee and its work in the future.  I welcome this motion and look forward to its further development.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we might compromise on the suggestions already made by my colleague from Donegal, Senator McGowan and other Senators, that the contributions made by that side of the House be used for light entertainment programmes and that of the more serious Senators be used for the proper debate.  Senator McGowan referred to the professionals; he should have referred to the professors.  We are the professionals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that in a sense I am becoming a member of a protected minority, that is, the members of the university teaching profession.  I endorse what has been said previously.  I think the broadcasting of the proceedings of this House would benefit the great majority of people because they would learn, as I have since I entered this House, how very much higher and more informed is the conduct of debates in this House.  The Seanad itself would only benefit by being given air time by Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what one or two of my colleagues here said, I understand from the terms of this proposal that some suggestions, in the direction of television coverage are already contained therein because in paragraph 3 (i) there is a reference to edited highlights being broadcast on radio and television news items. That clearly is an invitation.  It seems to me that we should welcome positively television coverage.  We can learn from the example of Channel 4 television in the neighbouring island which has successfully broadcast the proceedings of the Upper House of that Parliament.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to congratulate RTE: I would be very foolish as a politician if I did not congratulate them.  It would be very much welcomed by all sections of this House if the coverage of the proceedings of Seanad Éireann were more adequately covered by a general spread of the national print media because it is very largely left to <i>The Irish Times</i> to cover the proceedings of this House.  I very much wish that the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Press</i> would follow suit and have a much more detailed and serious coverage.  I say this because at election time all the national newspapers lecture the Irish public about the irrelevance of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members for allowing this order to go through in such a speedy fashion.  The points raised by many Senators regarding the form of <Col N="1804" /> broadcasting will be taken into account. The proceedings will be broadcast on a pilot basis for 12 months so that at the end of 12 months what has been said here and what is being said in other places can be taken into account.  I would like to thank the editing staff of RTE for the excellent job they are doing.  It is very hard for them to edit the day's work in both the Seanad and the Dáil.  It has to be said that the Seanad has got reasonable coverage from RTE.  Since the Seanad is sitting and the Dáil is not sitting, I would like to thank RTE for the work they did to ensure the allocation of 20 minutes of each night the Seanad is sitting and the 20 minutes on Saturday is allowed to us.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other organs of the media, the public interest in these broadcasts is enormous judging by the amount of correspondence and the amount of comments made.  I take the points that have been raised by Senator Norris regarding the other organs of media.  We should not suggest that <i>The Irish Times</i> is the only newspaper that covers the Seanad debates: <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and the <i>Independent</i> group of newspapers give a very good coverage.  Again &mdash; I have raised this matter time after time &mdash;<i>The Irish Press</i> group in general do not cover, except when there is something they want sensationalised or to run down what happens in this House.  The editors of the newspapers should take into account that there is an interest in what happens in this House.  As Senator Norris has said, the lecturing that goes on about politicians at election time and at other times should be ignored if the media are not prepared to tell the people what does actually happen &mdash; warts and all.</P>

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1987  [  Certified Money Bill ]:   Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the new <Col N="1805" /> Seanad Éireann, I want to congratulate the Cathaoirleach on being elected by your fellow Senators as Chairman of the Seanad.  I want to congratulate the Senators who were successful in the difficult Seanad election, both those who are Members of former Seanaid and those who are new to this Seanad.  My visits to the Seanad previously have been both enlightening and stimulating and I expect that will be my experience again.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for increasing the statutory limits on the total amount of grant-in-aid which may be paid out by Bord Fáilte for development purposes. The current statutory limit on grant expenditure for amenity development will be reached before the end of this year while the limit on Exchequer grant assistance for the development of tourism accommodation will be reached sometime in 1988.  Consequently, it is necessary to increase the amenity limit immediately to permit Bord Fáilte to make full use of its capital allocations for 1987.  It is also appropriate at this stage to increase the accommodation limit.</P>
      <P>The statutory limits were last raised to £30 million and £14 million respectively by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1983.  The increases of £6 million and £4 million on accommodation and amenity limits respectivley now being proposed in section 2 of this Bill could, under present policies, be expected to cover grant payments until at least 1990.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the Dáil, this does not imply continuation of existing grant schemes or the introduction of new schemes in the foreseeable future.  The existing schemes are subject to review each year during the annual Estimates exercise and their continuance will be subject to rigorous appraisal and will also require approval by the House.</P>
      <P>Policy in relation to capital grant aid for tourism is based on the belief that selective and targeted aid acts as an incentive to the private sector to invest in new projects and to up-grade and develop existing tourist facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These grants are only one of a range of incentives designed to stimulate investment <Col N="1806" /> in facilities for tourists, including the availability of concessionary finance from the Industrial Credit Corporation for working capital and long term investment requirements for which the Exchequer covers the exchange risk; investment capital from the National Development Corporation; and the recent extension of the business expansion scheme to export tourism.</P>
    <P>Capital grant aid which is the particular subject of the current Bill has since its introduction stimulated investment in excess of £90 million in the case of accommodation developments and £40 million in the case of amenity developments.  It is arguable that much of this investment would not have occurred without the incentive of grant aid.  Considerable job creation has resulted over the years from this investment.  For example, in 1986 it is estimated that investment aid by Bord Fáilte generated in the region of 950 jobs in the construction industry alone.</P>
    <P>In their short term in office this Government have by their decisive action in their crash programme for tourism announced on 3 May last demonstrated their commitment to develop the potential for growth in the tourism sector.  This programme was designed to achieve a substantial increase in tourist numbers in 1987 and subsequent years with consequential spin-offs for employment and wealth creation through a concerted national effort by everybody involved in tourism.  The main elements of the programme were a series of major innovative measures on access transport including a £57 midweek special air fare from London to Dublin with an equivalent £67 fare to Cork and Shannon, special continental air fares, <i>exempli gratia</i> a Brussels-Dublin fare of £180, which was a reduction of 16 per cent, £182 from Amsterdam to Dublin, a special Greensaver fare of $399 from the United States of America, special promotional fares by the sea carriers, a new cheap fuel promotional scheme for UK motorists visiting Ireland under which vouchers worth £10 are given to the first 20,000 visitors who show evidence of a confirmed booking <Col N="1807" /> to Ireland from June to September, price reductions in hotel accommodation and meal prices, more aggressive and targeted marketing in foreign markets and a diversion of extra resources into tourism.</P>
    <P>In addition, we announced that there would be a concerted drive to increase investment in specialised activities due to the business expansion scheme proposals announced in the budget and greater coordination of public sector activities in the tourism field.</P>
    <P>We followed up this initiative by having intensive consultations with all sectors of the industry to see what contributions they would make to the drive for growth in tourism in 1987 and subsequent years. The speedy response of the industry was magnificent as shown by the following initiatives which I announced to the Dáil on 14 May 1987: The Irish Caravan Council recommended that all their members offer a 10 per cent reduction on direct overseas bookings for mobile homes caravans and that pre-booked pitches and tents be given four nights for the price of three; the Irish Boat Rental Association offered a 5 per cent discount on all direct overseas bookings and a 10 per cent discount to walk-in overseas visitors, that is overseas visitors who come into any boat hire base in Ireland; the Restaurant Association of Ireland launched a new initiative on the tourist menu scheme with a view to making it more widely available throughout the whole of the country.  They also launched a third tier at £12 and asked all their members to participate in this for the present tourist season; SFADCo are offering 15 per cent off any booking for banquets in two of their castles; the Car Rental Council of Ireland recommend that with effect from 1 June 1987 their members offer 10 per cent off their national tariff rate for hirings of seven days' duration or more; the Self-Catering Association offered a 10 per cent discount off all overseas consumer bookings; CIE decided that rail/road unlimited rambler tickers sold in the US would be reduced by 25 per cent and they extended <Col N="1808" /> their validity to 30 days.  The new cost is US $100.  They also undertook a special printing and distribution of 250,000 brochures for US, Britain and the Continent, giving up-dated promotional information.</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to express my sincere thanks to these organisations for the initiatives they have taken to support the Government's drive for tourism growth in 1987.  Individually and collectively they responded magnificently to this attempt, seeing it for what it was, an attempt to stimulate the industry and to arouse interest in our markets abroad.</P>
    <P>Trends to date show that growth in the industry has picked up considerably. Bord Fáilte statistics for the first five months show an overall increase in visitor numbers of over 16 per cent.  This includes increases of 17 per cent from Britain, 12 per cent from North America and 19 per cent from Europe.  Indeed, the figures for France show an increase of almost 46 per cent and for Holland 31 per cent.  We are attempting to target the European markets of France, the Netherlands and West Germany particularly, because the numbers of tourists who avail of holidays abroad in those countries are very high.  Indeed, we have had a falling graph particularly with regard to West Germany for some time.</P>
    <P>Preliminary indications for June show that this momentum has been maintained as evidenced by arrivals data for our three main airports.  In June 1987 passenger numbers at Dublin were up by over 30,000 or almost 22 per cent, in Shannon by over 5,000 or 12½ per cent and in Cork by 4,000 or almost 25 per cent.  Arrivals by sea in the same month were only marginally down on their 1987 level.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a comment with regard to those statistics.  Some people say we are comparing 1987 with 1986 at a time when certain factors militated against the tourist industry here.  I want to point out that these statistics are for the early months of this years, 1987, and they correspond to a period last year before Chernobyl, before the United States President told its citizens to stay at home and before the factors that fought <Col N="1809" /> against a successful tourist year in 1986 came into play.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the Government are not concentrating solely on the overseas market.  As an earnest of our commitment to the domestic market an extra £75,000 was allocated to Bord Fáilte for promotion in the home market this year. I an confident that with these extra resources and some fine weather the important domestic market will also show growth this year.  In relation to Northern Ireland, prospects for the remainder of the season are optimistic with one quarter of hoteliers anticipating some increase in their Northern Ireland business.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, growing confidence within the industry itself.  It is important that this confidence manifests itself in a willingness to reinvest in and develop all aspects of the Irish tourism product.  The series of incentives which I have already outlined ranging from attractive loan schemes to easier access to venture capital through the BES as well as grant-aid, are provided in the belief and expectation that the industry will respond positively, and play their part in putting growth back into tourism.  The Government for their part will do all in their power to provide a regulatory framework which will both stimulate and facilitate growth in this crucial sector.</P>
    <P>But expansion, increased profits and additional employment can only come about from the efforts of those businesses directly involved in the industry itself.  It is up to them to seek out viable projects, identify the markets which offer potential for growth and take advantage of all the opportunities available &mdash; many of which have been made more attractive by a series of incentives provided at no small cost by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In considering this Bill Dáil Deputies referred time and time again to the need for a more specific and targeted approach in marketing Ireland as a holiday destination. I am in complete agreement with those sentiments.  In these competitive days it is vital for Ireland to be seen as more than just a green, beautiful and unspoilt destination, although it is important to try to keep it green, beautiful <Col N="1810" /> and unspoilt and we are not absolutely dedicated to that in all areas of the country as yet.  These worthy attributes, which are rarities nowadays, are not sufficient in themselves to capture a large segment of the world tourist market.  We must also appeal as a place which offers the potential visitor a wide range of things to do.  The modern tourist expects and, indeed, demands activities and entertainment. We in Ireland have a lot to offer to those looking for satisfying activity-related holidays &mdash; namely, angling, water sports, cycling, hiking, equestrian pursuits, walking and golf to mention but a few.</P>
    <P>Considerable work has been done with walkways.  I had the privilege of opening a walkway in my own county, in the Cuilcagh Mountains, earlier in the summer and it links up with a walkway in the Six Counties.  They join at the BelcooBlacklion Border area.  There is a Táinway, a Wicklow-way and a Kerry-way and I look forward to a time when there possibly could be a competition organised walkways for encircling the whole country, a kind of <i>tour d'Irlande</i> which many people would be interested in.  I have already made contact with the development officer in County Fermanagh who would be anxious to link up the walkways. We have had co-operation with the tourist people in the Six Counties for some time.  We hope to develop and strengthen it because, apart from the fact that it is the best province of the four provinces, there is great potential in that development.</P>
    <P>Indeed, demand for this type of specialist holiday constitutes one of the fastest growing segments of the international tourist market.  With our wealth of natural resources, unpolluted environment and temperate climate, we have a strong competitive advantage to exploit. This, however, is not in itself sufficient to attract additional visitors to Ireland. We must also pay increased attention to protecting and developing the basic facilities which nature has endowed us with and use our marketing skills to build good quality attractive holiday programmes <Col N="1811" /> around them.</P>
    <P>The specialist holiday market is one which, it must be admitted, has to a considerable degree been under-exploited by the Irish tourist industry.  It offers tremendous scope for generating increased tourist traffic and revenue, especially off-peak, from key foreign markets like Britain, France and Germany. This is one of the major areas into which the Government will be encouraging investment and channelling grantaid.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Bill now before the House, I should explain that the main elements are contained in section 2. Section 2 (1) deals with the limits on grant-aid to holiday accommodation. Grant assistance of over £5 million has been provided by the Government, through Bord Fáilte, for the development of holiday accommodation since the limit was last raised in 1983.  This grant expenditure has had a positive effect in the upgrading and expansion of our accommodation stock.  Specific grants have been available at various stages for the hotel and guesthouse sector, the caravan and camping sectors, town and country homes, farmhouses and also for the expansion of the youth hostel network.</P>
    <P>Accommodation schemes in operation at the moment are for caravan and camping and for the supplementary holiday accommodation sectors which cover town and country homes and farmhouses. There is a special need in these areas to continue to improve standards and upgrade facilities.  They represent a very important element of the accommodation sector and are particularly well suited for growth, in line with the trend towards more outdoor activity type holidays. The feedback from tourists who have used the facilities of farmhouses and the type of accommodation being talked about now has been more than encouraging. In fact, it is regarded as some of the best value in Europe in tourist terms.</P>
    <P>The scope of the supplementary holiday accommodation scheme was extended earlier this year, and now applies nationwide.  Previously the <Col N="1812" /> scheme excluded County Dublin and premises within a seven mile radius of Cork city and three mile radius of towns of over 3,000 population.  However, the widening gap between standards of similar accommodation in urban areas and in rural areas in recent years justified this extension.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year Bord Fáilte will have paid out almost £29.6 million in grant-aid for accommodation since first introduced by the Tourist Traffic Act of 1959.  This leaves less than £0.4 million remaining before the statutory limit of £30 million is reached.  I therefore propose that the statutory limit be raised now from £30 million to £36 million.  This will be adequate to cover existing accommodation schemes until 1990, at the earliest, as well as allowing some leeway for their extension or the possible introduction of new schemes should the Government and the Oireachtas decide this is warranted.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) deals with grant expenditure for the development of tourism-related facilities and amenities.  The existing statutory limit on grants of this nature is £14 million and expenditure up to the end of 1986 amounted to almost £13 million. The 1987 allocation for this type of grant expenditure is just £1.2 million, bringing aggregrate expenditure on amenity development by the end of this year to over £14 million.  The current statutory limit of £14 million must, therefore, be increased now to ensure completion of this year's amenity development programme.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 the Government, through Bord Fáilte, have provided almost £4 million in grant assistance for the development of tourism amenities and facilities in the non-accommodation area.  This expenditure has stimulated the development of a wide variety of facilities including angling, inland waterway development projects, heritage centres an the up-grading and extension of the local tourism information network. Other areas of major grant expenditure include water sports facilities, equestrian centres, historical and cultural sites, parks and great houses and gardens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> If we are to compete effectively for an increased share of the growing world tourist market our amenities and facilities must be of the highest standard and comparable to those available elsewhere. However, we need to continue to spend available money wisely so as to achieve a real return in terms of increasing tourism numbers and revenue.  It is, therefore, paramount that the funding available to Bord Fáilte be used in so far as it is practical to further and complement the board's primary role &mdash; the promotion and marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
    <P>Assistance provided for many projects in the past may have enhanced general tourism amenities in particular areas, but from the point of view of the generation of additional tourism traffic the effect has been negligible.  It is my intention that future assistance under this scheme be channelled towards projects which enhance and complement the existing tourism product and which offer a clearly identifiable return in the form of additional tourism revenue.  Bord Fáilte will continue, of course, to maintain considerable discretion in the day to day allocation of these grants.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, the statutory limit covering this particular area will be reached during the current year and I am accordingly proposing that the limit be increased from £14 million to £18 million.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh Seanad Éireann leis an mBille seo agus leis an dearcadh atá agamsa gur tionscal antábhachtach ar fad tionscal na turasóireachta. Tá mé réidh chun éisteacht leis na moltaí &mdash; tá a fhios agam go dtiocfaidh siad &mdash; ó Bhaill an tSeanaid agus tá súil agam go mbeidh Bille againn a bheas chun sochair na turasóireachta agus na tíre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I welcome him on his first visit to the Seanad.  I am sorry we were not in a position to welcome him to our own Chamber, but I am sure he realises the difficulties we have been having there and he is at home in this Chamber anyway.  I would also <Col N="1814" /> like to compliment him for his efforts since his appointment.  He has certainly brought flair to the office and we will be anxiously awaiting the results of that enthusiasm.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I have often felt that we never made the most of our potential as a tourist nation.  We have miserably failed in the past to sell our advantages and attractiveness for a relaxing vacation to the average busy European businessman or woman.  I welcome the Minister's remarks today in regard to his concentration on mainland Europe.  We are blessed by heaven in having a most magnificent varied coastline, one that cannot be matched in the world for variety.  We are an island outpost of Europe steeped in history and one can scarcely travel a couple of miles without discovering something different, something historic, something interesting.  Thus, Europeans can enjoy a landscape and climate unparalleled in mainland Europe.  Above all, we have a relaxing atmosphere not easily found by those same Europeans in their own countries.</P>
      <P>Europeans have easy access to Ireland because it is comparatively near their homeland and yet to them it can be a different world.  Many of these people know very little about us or what we have to offer.  Here I believe we have failed in the past and it is time to put that right.  I do not know if Bord Fáilte have ever considered employing an officer from one of those countries from which we are trying to attract tourists.  It would be a good idea to advertise in these countries for a suitable officer to come here and tell us what is necessary to encourage tourists to glance in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years we expended our energies, money and determination to get the British tourists here.  We succeeded mainly by our own efforts but we were helped by world events.  In the fifties and sixties our greatest number of tourists came from Great Britain and they were very welcome.  Unfortunately that was interrupted in the late sixties and seventies by events on this island but we had no substitute ready.  At that time, Bord Fáilte could have paid more attention to <Col N="1815" /> the European market seeking the tourists I have just spoken about &mdash; the busy European businessman who wanted a quick vacation in a country which was easy to get to and relatively near home.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things we must do to make tourists feel wanted.  We need to pay attention to quite a number of items in many parts of the country and I want to refer briefly to some of them. The Minister would do well to have a word with local authorities &mdash; even in these stringent times when capital is scarce &mdash; to impress upon them the importance of paying attention to improvements in order to attract tourists. Most of us know how inadequate road signs can be, as we have found earlier this year and at other times when travelling the country.  Very often they point in the wrong direction.  It baffles me that so many local authorities have done so little about that, that they cannot design a road sign that cannot easily be moved by vandals or the weather.  I believe such a road sign is possible &mdash; perhaps they could put a screw in the arm that grips the upright post or even weld it.  There are many road signs which are misleading for the Irish and foreign tourists.</P>
    <P>There is also the terrible publicity our beaches got at the weekend when we had the first burst of continental weather. One of our beaches was described in a national newspaper as an unflushed toilet.  That is not good publicity.  It is about time our people woke up to the fact that what they do and how they behave has a bearing on our tourist trade, one of the most important industries the country has today.  It might be no harm if the Minister were to give some attention to educating our people on how they should treat the environment.  No matter how far advanced we seem to get along that road, there is always some section of the community or some area which will let us down and, we were sadly let down by many, not all, of those who went to the beaches at the weekend.  This has been going on for a considerable time.  I remember passing through a very famous County Waterford seaside resort about <Col N="1816" /> six years ago and I have to say I would be reluctant to visit that resort again.  I had a swim in the sea and I was only about 15 yards out when I felt I was in a cess-pool.  That is no exaggeration.  What was found on the beaches was similar to what the newspapers said was on the Dublin beaches this weekend.</P>
    <P>It baffles me that the Minister for the Environment in recent weeks made an order disbanding the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  I sincerely hope that, while it is not this Minister's responsibility, he protested at the Cabinet table.  An effort was being made to make Dublin more presentable not only to its citizens and those who come into it from other parts of the country but to foreign tourists, many of whom have strong words to say about the condition of Dublin.  I have spoken to some tourists who are frequent visitors to Ireland and they cannot get over the deterioration in the city.  Last year I was told by a tourist who has visited Ireland 11 times, spending more than a week each time in Dublin, that when he travels the city streets today he scarcely recognises them. Buildings that were there two or three years ago have disappeared with nothing to replace them but derelict sites.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take up with his Cabinet colleague the question of having the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission reconstituted as quickly as possible. This was a step in the right direction and the commission would have been of enormous benefit if they had been permitted to perform their duties.  I hope the Minister will have something to say in that regard although I know that, perhaps for political reasons, he might prefer to stay silent. If he remains silent in this House or outside the Cabinet room I hope he will not remain silent within the Cabinet and that he will make every effort to have the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission or some similar body in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to see greater efforts being made in the Dublin area to attract not only foreign tourists but also the domestic market.  While Bord Fáilte and those <Col N="1817" /> in the tourist trade try to attract city people to country areas, beaches, parks and mountains, little effort is made to encourage country people to spend their vacation in Dublin.  Little publicity is given to Dublin.  The Dublin street carnival held recently has been a great addition to the Dublin scene in recent years.  There is musical entertainment in St. Stephen's Green about twice a month at present but bands should be encouraged to play there at least twice weekly.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have to refer yet again to another black spot in the Dublin area, where not a day passes without a tourist being relieved of his wallet.  I referred to that two years ago and I was critical of the Garda activity in and around O'Connell Bridge and St. Stephen's Green.  A friend of mine who is a Dubliner but looks like at tourist because his hair is very fair, unlike an Irish person, was approached on his way to the bank while he was carrying a sum of money.  He knew that while the person in front was speaking to him the danger was behind him.  He used his foot to hurt the person who was about to relieve him of his wallet although he ran the risk of being criticised by passersby for kicking a young person.  He has seen this going on so often with little or no action by the Garda and he deplores it.  This happened outside the gates of Trinity College and is happening every day of the week.  Events such as this are being reported in tourist offices in Great Britain and the Continent and are not doing our tourist trade any good.  I ask the Minister to pay some attention to this and to direct the relevant authorities to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>I live in a scenic area visited by many Dubliners and foreigners.  The Dublin mountain area is used in particular by Dubliners for picnics, evening drives and so on.  We have been scourged, particulary this year, by unauthorised dumping in picnic areas.  I have been battling with the local authority to have these cleaned up and they have done so two or three times in the past few months.  There was a difficulty because one of the main tipheads was closed.  It will be open again for a few hours this week and I understand <Col N="1818" /> that in about one month's time it will be fully open.  What happens then? The local authority now impose a charge on people who go to the tiphead to dispose of their rubbish.  There are instances of shopkeepers who tidy up their entire area consisting of, perhaps, six to eight local shops.  These people will now be charged for disposing of their rubbish in the tiphead.  This is a step in the wrong direction; a charge that should not have been imposed.  For political reasons the Minister's own party refused to have anything to do with water rates and opposed their imposition in the Dublin area. Instead there is a charge on tipheads which is having a detrimental effect on the environment.  It is also a disincentive to encouraging visitors to the area.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the fact that there are only two sites for caravan holidaymakers in Dublin, both of which are on the Wicklow border at Ballybrack and Shankill.  I understand there are no camping facilities on these sites.  The Minister should have a word with Bord Fáilte to see if it would be possible to have a caravan and camping site provided in the Dublin mountain area or in the west county area because the existing sites are in densely populated and built up areas.  Most people going on a caravan holiday want to be adjacent to a city but not in it.  Serious consideration should be given to this as it would be a tremendous asset to such holidaymakers.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented a great deal on the success of the Government's efforts since coming into office which resulted in increased tourist traffic which we all welcome.  He attempted to explain that the comparison between this year and last year is not as relevant as might appear at first sight on paper because of the difficulties encountered by the tourist industry generally last year.  Let us hope that we are overcoming those difficulties and that the improvement will continue and that many more foreign visitors will be attracted to our shores.  The initiative taken by Northern Unionists in recent days may be significant in this respect. The less we in the Republic say about that for the moment the better.  It is a very <Col N="1819" /> welcome step and should be reflected in the efforts of both Bord Fáilte and other tourist agencies engaged in the business of attracting tourists here.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the Minister of the apparent lack of success on the domestic scene.  Over the years insufficient attention was given to encouraging Irish people to stay at home.  A greater effort could be made at making our people realise the value to the country of spending their pounds here in Ireland and at the same time, seeing more of the country.  There must be many thousands of Irish people who know more about the coastline of the Canary Islands or of Spain or Portugal than about their own. Our people are bombarded by television advertisements and tourist operators here offering cheap holidays abroad.  Of course, the great attraction is the sun. For whatever reason this year we seem to be failing more than ever in encouraging our people to remain at home.  I am sure every Member of this House and the Minister who enters Leinster House from Kildare Street will see the hundreds of people queuing for passports at the Passport Office in Molesworth Street. Many of them may be emigrating &mdash; I hope that proportion is small &mdash; but a large proportion must be going abroad on holiday.  If we could only persuade 10 per cent of those people to stay at home think what it would mean to the country, to employment generally.  I would ask the Minister to devote as much attention as possible to this matter.  Thankfully, over the last six or seven years inflation here has dropped to almost 2 per cent, whereas &mdash; as far as I can remember &mdash; when the Coalition Government who have just left office came into power, inflation was at 18 per cent.  That is a big reduction in inflation and must encourage people to holiday at home and, indeed also, foreign visitors to come here.</P>
    <P>There should be more incentive to Irish people to spend their holiday at home. When I mentioned this recently to some Irish people who had arranged to spend their holidays abroad, their response was that all Government encouragement was <Col N="1820" /> directed at foreign visitors.  They referred to the petrol allowance and other incentives to foreign visitors.  I am not complaining about these incentives.  I am telling the Minister about the perception among our people that more attention is given to attracting foreigners here than to encouraging Irish people, man or woman, to spend their holidays at home. I am well aware that it is not an easy task. Many people will go abroad seeking the sun whereas the reverse is the case with regard to continentals coming here.  They do not come here for the sun.  They are not the people who frequent our beaches. They come here for a leisurely holiday in a different atmosphere and climate and we should recognise that.</P>
    <P>I hope that Minister will redouble his efforts in encouraging our people to spend more time at home seeing and learning more of our beautiful land.  I related in the House last week my experience in the west of the previous weekend which was not very encouraging. Unfortunately, I had gone there the wrong weekend.  It would have been different had I gone this past weekend when we had such glorious sunshine. When we get sunshine there is no better place throughout the length and breadth of Europe in which to spend one's holiday, even for our own people.  We should remember that foreign visitors do not come here seeking sunshine.  Many have told me so.  Last weekend in the west I met some French people to whom I apologised for the bad weather.  They replied that they did not come here for sun, that if they wanted sunshine they would go elsewhere.  They were quite happy, even delighted with the prevailing weather.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would also consider my suggestion of employing somebody from, say, France, Germany or wherever Bord Fáilte decide each year to encourage visitors to come here so that they could familiarise themselves with the holiday scene in Ireland.  If say, the Spanish or Germans were encouraging Irish people to visit their countries I am quite sure they would endeavour to find a qualified Irish person to assist them in <Col N="1821" /> their objective.  There is no reason why we cannot do likewise.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider having a highly qualified, well-paid senior officer of Bord Fáilte from continental Europe to assist them in their efforts in attracting continentals here.</P>
    <P>I and my party support the Bill, as we did in the Dáil.  I am glad the Minister has noted some of Deputy Deasy's remarks in the Dáil because he has included some of them in his speech to this House which is somewhat different from what he said in the other House.  I wish the Minister well in his capacity as Minister for Tourism and Transport &mdash; both related &mdash; and I hope that his efforts will pay dividends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I, too, would like to be associated with Senator McMahon's expression of welcome to the Minister and to wish him well in his office. The signal success which the Minister has had to date in this Ministry should be recorded here.  It is an indication of his commitment to the wellbeing of our tourism industry.  A recent article in the Stokes Kennedy Crowley Commission report to the Irish Hotels Federation states that it would be possible to double the real value of tourism in six to seven years if the Government recognise the significance of tourism to the economy; if a detailed co-ordinated plan is developed in conjunction with State interests involved in tourism; if the Department is strengthened; if funds are provided to invest in a growth plan; and if substantial increases are introduced in the level of promotion in key markets. An additional £3 million to £5 million will be required each year for the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister has committed himself to a practically identical programme because, after two to three months in office, his own programme was launched on 4 May, which is a little over two months ago.  Significant success has been achieved already in commitment to the programme as outlined in this suggestion by Stokes Kennedy Crowley.  If for no other reason, the Minister must be <Col N="1822" /> congratulated for that.  There is already evidence of success.  We have seen in the media over the past two or three days that arrivals for the first quarter of the year are up by 19 per cent.  Some word of caution might be sounded here because I am aware that the hotel industry people are saying they do not see evidence of this increase.</P>
    <P>It is obvious at the early stage of the reduced fares that that has made quite a substantial impact on the ethnic market in the UK in that it was an inducement to people who have, in the main, quite recently gone as emigrants to the UK, to avail of the reduced fares.  They are not staying in hotels and guesthouses but are coming home.  It should not be lost sight of that these people make a significant contribution to the economy, despite the fact that they do not avail of tourism facilities as we know them.  They are still visiting public houses, shops and whatever other facilities they make use of when they are at home.  We in the hotel industry quite often tend to cry crocodile tears.  It has been brought to my attention over the past few days that there is not much evidence of the 19 per cent increase manifesting itself by way of increased bed nights in hotels but these are early days yet and we are really only into the peak of the tourism season this week, so people should be conscious of that.</P>
    <P>We should also take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his outstanding success in the area of reduced fares.  The initiatives taken by his predecessor should not be lost sight of and, indeed, the outstanding contribution being made by our EC Commissioner, Mr. Sutherland, in this whole debate on reduced fares.  If ever there was an impediment in the way of the development of Irish tourism, it was the cost of access fares into this country and the success in this area is nothing short of outstanding; everybody involved in it is to be congratulated.  The tourism industry people have been saying for years that it could be done.  This Minister has now proved that it can be done and is being done and this will manifest itself in a sizeable increase in tourism traffic into <Col N="1823" /> this country over the next four or five years.</P>
    <P>However, now that we have removed that sizeable impediment, it is important that the Minister should &mdash; and I have no doubt he will &mdash; now produce a development plan for a five year period.  We have had over the past number of years a kind of hotch-potch development in the tourism industry.  One year a lot of money was provided, the next year, none, and so on.  As a consequence, we did not have a development plan as such.  That must be a priority and I have no doubt the Minister will commit himself to providing a five year plan.  Growth targets must be decided upon and in this context an independent study has shown that it is possible to double Ireland's foreign tourism earnings over the next six to seven years, with the consequential creation of in excess of 40,000 jobs into the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It is also important to state at this stage that, if the existing tourism agencies and organisations cannot deliver this kind of growth, we must seek new organisations and new people who will deliver.  This is important and this assessment must be done soon.  It must be done quickly and if the Minister is satisfied that the existing structures cannot deliver, he should not be reticent about providing new structures. There is evidence on the ground that in the recent past we have not gained the kind of market share we may have felt entitled to.</P>
    <P>In relation to market share, somewhat belatedly&mdash;though better late than never &mdash; we have gone back into the British market.  Tragically, over the past few years we lost sight of what was the backbone of our industry.  Emphasis should be put on the fact, however, that the UK scene has changed substantially and we now have two or three generations of UK citizens who have become totally sold on the concept of the sunshine holiday.  We should not endeavour to compete in this area, but should direct our attention towards the kind of environmental attractions we have that still appeal to a very large segment of the UK traffic.</P>
    <P>There is an additional dimension to <Col N="1824" /> that traffic, I would suggest, that is, the one described by some segments of the industry as the golden years element. There are now over 10 million people on retirement pensions in the UK between the ages of 60 and 70.  It is a sizeable market that is not adequately focused on.  These are quite a well-off section of British society, quite often having two pensions each.  Many of them have been here in the past.  They are not particularly well disposed towards language difficulties on the Continent, food difficulties quite often and traffic difficulties in particular.  The kind of autobahn concept of France, Germany and Spain does not appeal to the older generations, whereas they can drive here in safety without any let or hindrance on practically all our roads and enjoy the environment at the same time.  It is a market that should be seriously focused on.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I would like to bring to the Minister's attention while we are debating on tourism.  I mentioned last week in the debate on the Finance Bill a significant element of tourism that quite often tragically is lost sight of, and I hope I will not labour the point too much today.  One great common denominator with regard to complaints about the tourism industry here is the cost of drink.  It is something that we do not like to discuss publicly very often, either, but it is a serious deterrent to our efforts to attract tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>Another serious matter which we need to address very earnestly, is hundreds of tourists finding themselves standing outside hotels and pubs at 10 o'clock on a Sunday night.  It is very difficult to reconcile that with holidays.  People visiting this country at Easter find every pub and every hotel bar closed.  How one reconciles that with Ireland of the welcomes I do not know, but it is something we need to address very quickly.  I know there are proposals to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas over the next few months in relation to opening hours but I am addressing myself only to the tourism dimension of this problem today.  It is one to which the Minister for <Col N="1825" /> Tourism and Transport should address himself.</P>
    <P>We talk about transport, suitable accommodation, the quality of food and the environment, but we must never forget that people enjoy the night life in a resort just as much as the day life.  This is very important and in Ireland we tend to lose sight of it.  A significant attraction to foreigners coming to this country is the whole aspect of the pub culture.  We tend to play it down, whereas it is significant. So long as we continue to close pubs on a Sunday night at 10 o'clock and to close pubs in resorts at 11.30 p.m. in the summer time we are harming very seriously the people in the marketplace who are trying to sell Ireland as an attractive tourist destination.  I suggest to the Minister that we should seek to have a tourism input into this debate as well as the other considerations which the Minister for Justice will have to address.</P>
    <P>Another problem which is related to the somewhat jaundiced eye with which people in the hotel industry sometimes look at the Bord Fáilte suggested upsurge in tourist figures is that many thousands of tourists who arrive in Ireland each year find themselves in unapproved accommodation. This is a subject that has been put before successive Ministers for Tourism and has been shirked because there are some constitutional ramifications in addressing it.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago I was chairman of a group in a regional tourism board.  At the end of each year we used to examine written complaints submitted by tourists at ferry ports, airports, hotels, and regional tourism offices.  On one occasion in excess of 50 per cent of the complaints related to problems in unapproved accommodation locations.  You can imagine the invidious position we found ourselves in as a regional tourism board with statutory establishment having had to write back to these tourists and say: &ldquo;We are very sorry but we have no control over these people.  They can carry on without let or hindrance from the Government, the county councils, the planning authorities or anybody else.&rdquo;  In many cases next door to an unapproved <Col N="1826" /> accommodation operator there is an approved guesthouse operator who is subject to investigations by a Bord Fáilte quality standards inspector, a fire inspector, a hygiene inspector or a revenue inspector while the person operating in perhaps the same terrace can operate without let or hindrance and can ignore every regulation as he sees fit.  This is a serious problem and it is the classic black economy in the tourism industry.  The unapproved accommodation operators are creaming from the top of the deck. Hoteliers, registered guesthouse owners, town and country home operators and farmhouse operators have to subscribe to various standards and legislative controls and until such time as everybody is obliged to be registered by the State or some licensing authority, we will not have the uniformity of standards that we and, in particular, tourists are entitled to.</P>
    <P>In regard to the involvement of local authorities in tourism generally much has been said in recent days at various conferences, and so on, about the desire of county councils and corporations to have a greater involvement in tourism.  As a member of a local authority for 15 years I know there is more than enough for public authorities such as councils and the corporations to do under existing legislation if they would only do it.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon referred to the nonchalant attitude we have to the problem of pollution.  There is a sizeable number of pollution Acts, litter Acts and other legislation in place to control litter and dumping.  One has only to look at local or national newspapers to see how few prosecutuions there are in regard to pollution. As a race of people we are indifferent to problems of the environment. There is little point in putting into position reams of legislation to control pollution if we are not going to implement it.  I suggest to local authorities that this is the area they should be addressing themselves to rather than looking for an additional brief in the tourism arena.  On a daily basis there are fish killings in practically every river in this State but very few prosecutions are initiated.  In my county last week farmers refused to allow <Col N="1827" /> the county council environmental officers onto their land in pursuit of huge fish kills in one of the best salmon and trout rivers in Munster.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must act under their present brief to pursue the people who are polluting rivers and killing fish.  This is having a huge effect on the quality of our tourism product.  The impact this has on our native angler can be discussed another day because we are addressing the tourism industry today.  The impact of a fish kill in a river in any part of this country on the tourism product is immeasurable.  I discussed this with tourists in my constituency recently.  These tourists come to Ireland on the basis that the rivers are pollution free, that there are adequate fish stocks and so on. However, they may be fishing for only ten minutes when they see the contents of a slurry pit passing down the river and within hours hundreds of fish are dead on the river bank.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  The legislation is in place and all we need is a commitment to take on the people who are causing pollution. With proper confrontation by the public authorities we will stop them in time.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on about our indifference to litter.  Senator McMahon referred to the litter problem on the beaches in County Dublin over the holiday weekend.  It is a problem on every beach.  This pollution is being caused by our own citizens.  When non-nationals have picnics in caravan parks and the other places they reside in during their holidays they collect their debris and refuse, take them to a receptacle and put them away.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said about Irish tourists.  The disarray on our beaches over this weekend with disposable nappies and so on is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>We will have to continue to exhort people to be conscious of the importance of the environment.  We are a little blase when advertising our beautiful rivers and countryside abroad because we are slowly but surely eroding the beauty of our countryside by our own indifference.  This is a programme local authorities could <Col N="1828" /> address themselves to on a local basis by going into the school and convincing children that littering is a serious problem, a blot on the landscape and will ultimately contribute substantially to the demise of the tourism industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the area of planning and, in particular, our general indifference to street planning.  I know the Dublin street plan was referred to but there are problems in every town and village in relation to street planning. There is a proliferation of neon signs and so on.  Thankfully this is changing due primarily to the success of places like Kinsale, Dunmanway, Tyrrellspass and other small towns and villages in the Tidy Towns Competition.  These towns and villages were transformed by local people in pursuit of prizes in the Tidy Towns Competition.  By removing the neon signs and replacing them with handpainted signs made by native craftsmen people saw that a village landscape could be enhanced in a matter of days.  With a proper commitment this kind of transformation can take place in days rather than years.</P>
    <P>On the converse side there is the continuing disarray in relation to the cavities on streets, abandoned buildings and cars, indifference to the necessity to paint street shop fronts and so on.  We will have to examine that area and again this is an obvious role for local authorities.  We need to exhort local authorities when they give planning permission in scenic areas to ensure that the conditions laid down are being properly adhered to.  This should especially relate to the provision of gardens and the laying out of a properly landscaped site in relation to house development.  Quite often architects and planners send in very fancy plans to local authorities but when a house is constructed, the garden is forgotten about. We see nothing but disarray.  I saw an example of this in the forest park in Glengarriff where very controversial planning permission for a house was given four or five years ago.  The house was built but the concrete blocks that where there five years ago are still standing where the <Col N="1829" /> garden should be.  A facet of that planning permission was that a properly landscaped garden would be laid out but nobody went back to see that it was done. This is a result of staffing ratios which is another day's work.  There has been much comment in recent days about the anxiety of local authorities to get involved in the tourism arena.  Legislation is in position for them already and all they need is a commitment to pursue the people who are abusing the environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the payola industry that is starting to rear its ugly head in the tourism industry.  It is a very serious problem.  People are making arrangements with coach drivers and tour operators to go to certain shops and stores to the detriment of all others &mdash; if you are not contributing to the wellbeing of these people you do not do business with the passengers on the coach.  That has to be stopped.  I understand people have examined the type of income these people can expect at present which can amount to £40,000 and £50,000 annually. That cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Other Ministers in this Government have already committed themselves to fair play in the marketplace.  It has to come into play in the tourism industry as well.  We must ensure that people who have craft shops, restaurants and so on are allowed the same access to the customer as everybody else and are not dictated to by the operator, the courier or anybody else.  That must stop.  I ask the Minister to address himself seriously to this whole business.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is important for people in the industry to respond to the commitment they are presently getting from the Minister and the Department of Tourism.  It is not enough any more for Irish people in the hotel and guesthouse industry to expect that people will be conveyed up to their front doors by virtue of Government initiatives taken in the marketplaces of Germany, France, the United States or wherever.  They will have to come together and will have to do more.  Unfortunately, at present, in workshops abroad and so on the primary representation is done by the chain hotels <Col N="1830" /> and so on who are giving huge employment, and so they should, as they have the resources to be in the marketplace. Other strata of the hotel industry do not have the funds at their disposal to go abroad.  They are dependent entirely on Bord Fáilte to market them abroad.</P>
    <P>A welcome initiative was taken last year and the year before in relation to branding but that needs to be extended to the entire spectrum of the industry. We are picking only at the surface at present.  It is not enough for foreign tourists to have a perception on Ireland that every hotel is costing £60 per bed without breakfast, because that is not the case. You can still get good quality hotels in this country.  Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C, offering accommodation for as little as £12 and £14.  It is not necessarily the preserve of guesthouses.  Unfortunately there is that perception and one has only to listen to the current affairs debates on radio and television to realise that hotels are costing a fortune.  If there are segments of the industry that can get £60 for bed only or for bed and breakfast <i>c'est la vie</i> so far as I am concerned and the best of luck to them, but everybody in the industry should be exposed to the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Much of the initiative must come from the industry itself but I put it to the Minister that we should be looking at the possibility of allowing others greater exposure into the marketplace.  The obvious vehicle for that is greater exposure for the regional tourism organisations in the marketplace.  At present there is a statutory constraint on regional tourism boards.  They cannot advertise abroad except with the specific permission of Bord Fáilte in certain specialised areas like angling and so on.  There is a definite role for regional tourism companies in the vanguard of the kind of initiative that Bord Fáilte will take.  Following that up, when the initial shock troops have gone through from Bord Fáilte, a specialised group from the regional tourism organisation would them come into that same marketplace and sell individual packets on the ground whether in trade fairs in Frankfurt, Paris or wherever.  Bord <Col N="1831" /> Fáilte's job is to sell the total Irish product. They have done that very well.  It would be tragic if we got into the knock Bord Fáilte league at this stage when there is a hiccup in the marketplace because they have done an extraordinarily good job over the years and that should be recorded here.  There is need also for a more localised and more personalised involvement in the marketplace once the Bord Fáilte initiative has been taken.</P>
    <P>We must examine Ireland as a tourism destination.  Is this the Ireland of the fáilte we knew ten or 15 years ago?  Is it the Ireland of the welcomes we knew 15 or 20 years ago that made us different from every other tourism destination in this Continent?  We should say that it is not any more.  It is an aspect of the development and the training of our tourism people, particularly through CERT, that will have to be projected to a much higher degree than is being currently done.  We are unfortunately getting into the business of the mechanical tourism operator. Even though a Senator was taken to task in the House last week for making a similar comment I am fortunate in that Senator Daly is not present at the moment so I can say it with some degree of freedom.</P>
    <P>It is a serious problem and it is a matter that is commented on by tourists who were here in the past and have come again now that we have become a little indifferent, we do not seem to be as concerned with the wellbeing of the tourist as we were in the past.  He does not get the same kind of welcome he used get when he went into a pub, a restaurant or a shop where people bent over backwards to ensure that that tourist got to his destination. If a product he sought to buy was not available in a particular shop he was directed somewhere else where it was available.  This is the kind of thing we must do again.  It is a natural phenomenon for the Irish to welcome people into their homes, town or business.  We have lost sight of how significant it is in the tourist perception of how much he enjoyed his holiday.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1832" /> to pass that on to the training agencies currently involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will read the final conclusions of the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report, in relation to the potential of the tourism industry as related in a recent report to the Irish Hotels Federation. The report states that if tourism could be doubled in five years the real GNP would increase by £208 million, the balance of payments would improve by £126 million, employment would increase by 40,000 jobs and Government borrowings would fall by £143 million.  This is an indication of the market and the potential this tourism industry has.  If the initiatives and the thrust the Minister has given to the industry and the new impetus he has given it in the three months he has been in office is any indication it augurs well for the well being of the tourist industry in the future.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte chroíúil roimh an Aire.  Seo í an chéad uair a chonaic mé é sa Seanad.  Tá aithne againn ar a chéile le fada an lá.  Bhaineamar tráth leis an aon cheard amháin agus deirtear, &ldquo;is báúil iad lucht aon cheirde&rdquo;.  Tá aithne againn ar a chéile agus, má deirim é, meas againn ar a chéile.  An post atá anois aige, ar shlí tá sé níos tábhachtaí, déarfainn, ná aon phost a bhí aige cheana.  Tá a fhios again go maith gur fheidhmigh sé mar Aire Oideachais ach ó thaobh na heacnamaíochta de i láthair na huaire, do tharlódh go bhfuil an post atá anois aige chomh tábhachtach ar a laghad le aon phost a bhí aige cheana. Faoi mar a léirigh an Seanadóir O'Callaghan ansan, níl aon teora leis an fhorbairt atá i ndán dúinn má éiríonn i gceart leis an turasóireacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and I am glad to see him in his present incarnation.  In my previous presence in Seanad Éireann it was very fruitful to engage in discussion with the Minister on educational matters. I know he has a particular crusading zeal in his present post which is very welcome because as Senator O'Callaghan said there is no limit to the possibilities inherent in tourism.  I wish the Minister well and fully support this Bill.  I listened <Col N="1833" /> with great interest to the previous speakers. Senator O'Callaghan in particular made some very arresting points but he is an expert in these matters and I fully endorse both his support for Bord Fáilte's achievement over several years and the necessity of regional tourism boards.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I agree with Senator O'Callaghan that our people have changed in their personalities.  These are relative matters and certainly in comparison with other countries, even in a disintegrating social climate such as we are experiencing at the moment the natural courtesy of people irrespective, as they say, of class or age that you get in an Irish town can only be appreciated if you live for some time in Boston, New York or London.  That warmth and informality are there.  This is one of the things that attracts tourists here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the obverse side of that coin is the kind of informality which expresses itself in regard to the Environment. They are actually two sides of the same coin.  Our task is to preserve the positive and beneficial traditional side of the Irish personality, while reforming what has become now a major threat not alone to the tourist industry but to our own environmental survival.  We are, in short, a filthy people.  The scenes that have been referred to here in recent days are inexcusable &mdash; the littering of the beaches.  It is the same kind of mentality that accounts for, for example, the widespread disregard of no smoking notices in areas where smoking is prohibited. Again it is the same indifferent attitude that has been referred to, the same informality as it were.  We have yet to discipline ourselves very much in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the possibilities for walking holidays.  We are at the beginning of the whole idea of expanding the walking dimension of tourism in Ireland.  In a walk which is a favourite of mine in what I call inner west Cork, one comes to a spectacular summit of a country road and looks down on the lakes of Inchigeela.  The place in question is called in English Mount Prospect but in Irish it is favoured with the much more romantic name of Mullach Méaróga <Col N="1834" /> Finn.  At the top of this beautiful and otherwise unspoiled area, about two years ago somebody parked a truck.  It is as if he deliberately selected the most scenic spot in which to dispose of his unwanted truck.  My question is: why has nobody removed that particular blight on the landscape?  It is all part of the same pattern.  A historian is interested in the causes for this particular blight in the Irish personality.  We are careless about these matters partly because, up to quite recently, it really did not matter.  We were a rural people, an under-populated country, and if you threw litter here and there it did not matter.  There is a timelag here in people's perception.  We are now an urban people.  It is vital for our own survival that we change our ways.  There is something of the anti-authority element which accounts for it as well.</P>
    <P>A fundamental point and a political point at best is that people will not treat the environment with respect unless they identify with it.  It is no good talking about lack of civic spirit.  That only begs the question.  You cannot teach civic spirit in the abstract.  Unless people identify with the scenery, with their parks, with public amenities generally, they will think of them as belonging to other people.  Whatever has to be said about the deficiencies of the socialist society in Eastern Europe, nobody can be in any doubt that the Russians treat their public resources with great respect.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this unfortunate propensity in our people are not for this particular discussion.  Our task is to address how we should remedy this.  It must be a combination of many things such as a permanent part of instructions in schools and public disappoval.  I spoke about the indifferent attitude to smoking in train compartments, but I think that is improving.  There is a growing climate of public disappoval which I hope will continue and be extended to other areas. In the end, the sanction of the law must be applied.  As Senator O'Callaghan said, we must enforce as far as possible the existing laws.</P>
    <P>I remember being here when the Litter Bill was going through the House some <Col N="1835" /> years ago.  The fines mentioned in the Bill struck me at the time as almost excessive. It seemed to me that they were draconian, the idea that you could be fined £800 for littering the pavement.  In theory this was true; in practice, of course, it has remained a dead letter.  The Litter Bill is a dead letter.  That is unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>Some of the least noticed and yet most important aspects of our tourist traffic in Ireland are summer schools which are growing in the number of schools themselves and in the individual number of students.  These are now becoming a feature of Irish universities during what is sometimes called the long vacation but, as those of us who are attached to these universities know, there is no such thing as the long vacation.  In University College, Cork, &mdash; I have some direct responsibility for it &mdash; we have just begun a month long summer school in Irish studies. I submit that the students who come to these schools form first impressions and very often they are lasting impressions.  We are very much aware of that in the provisions we make for the social side of the school.  Sometimes even a very modest sponsorship from Bord Fáilte can make a big difference to the financial make or break of these schools. I know the Minister is aware of them but I plead with him to make a note of it that these schools are extremely important. Today's students are tomorrow's tourists. They will come back again if they are impressed.</P>
    <P>Commercial operators are now recognising the need for an educational dimension for tours.  It is very interesting that over the past few years, upmarket coach tours for Americans &mdash; in fact, Shannon Castle is one of the these tours &mdash; are recognising the need to get somebody to talk to their tourists at the outset of their Irish tour about the history of the country, about its culture and about is politics. These tourists come here, not to a sun-soaked resort as they know, but increasingly in pursuit of something more than the scenery and more than the people. They want to know something deeper about the country itself.  This is a very <Col N="1836" /> creditable activitiy.  It is very important that the people who give these talks are properly informed and that they can enhance and enrich the audiences to which they lecture.  Despite the disparaging references earlier on to professors, professors have their uses in this context and are very much welcomed by these commercial operators for these scene setting talks.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest also to Senator O'Callaghan's reference to unregistered and unlicensed guesthouses. I am not sufficiently well acquainted with guesthouses to be able to tell the distinction always, but I know that generally we should all be grateful to the legitimate bed and breakfast business.  In a time of high inflation, which mercifully seems to be past, the bed and breakfast business provided sometimes the only way in which our own people or visitors could have a holiday.  In that respect some of the most frequent users of the bed and breakfast trade were and are the British tourists.  I endorse what Senator O'Callaghan said about their importance to the tourist economy and I am glad to see them back.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves here again, that politics really enters into everything.  Many British visitors still will not come to Ireland because of their perception of the political situation. Many of those who came to Ireland in past years got a very poor welcome from yahoos who went around burning buses and so on.  We cannot welcome the British tourist on the one hand and hope we can indulge our emotional, sentimental feelings about past events on the other. These two things are closely related.</P>

      <P>Speaking with the utmost detachment, let me say that along that line of mountains, the Boggeraghs, the Derrynasaggarts down to Shehy, in that crescent in inner north-west Cork we have the finest walking country in Ireland and, indeed, in Europe, in that we have a dense network of roads which are almost unused and on which there is very little traffic and properly equipped with a half inch map, you can plan the most spectacular walks combining fresh air, scenery and a solitude, in every sense a whole recreation of the spirit.  Mind you, I should not be saying this because I enjoy these walks so much that, selfishly, I do <Col N="1838" /> not want anybody else to enjoy them as well.  Nevertheless, my patriotism prevails in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the floor and I am entitled to praise Cork while I can. Clare happens to be at the moment No. 3 in my favourite counties but if you work hard you might get it elevated, a Chathaoirleach.  For a certain kind of tourist we are at only the beginning of developing the whole idea of a walking tour.  Visitors do not really mind the rain &mdash; although perhaps I am a little optimistic in saying that.  Really it does not rain that often.  A commited country walker can find out how many rainy days we have and how frequently one can get out.  As has been said, they do not expect the sun.  They expect the rain but they certainly do not expect the litter and the filth.  We should provide for that walking and hill-walking dimension.</P>
      <P>Profits, as the Minister pointed out, are absolutely vital to the expansion of the tourism industry.  However, profits are not to take precedence over fair prices and we have, to a large extent, overpriced ourselves.  I am sure many Senators will share my experience that any time one goes, for example, to London and has a modest meal one realises how little it costs in comparison with the same meal back at home. Attempts have been made to have special package prices and so on and that kind of thing should be developed further.  Also, profits must not be made at the expense of exploitation.  The day has gone when youngsters could be recruited as slave labour in the tourist industry, and I submit that any attempt to revive that is simply an invitation to social trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a special interest in the whole tourist dimension because my basic faith is in this country and tourism is a native industry.  It is a virtually undeveloped resource.  That is why I welcome what is really only a modest Bill technically but one which has given us this welcome <Col N="1839" /> opportunity to talk in the presence of the Minister.  I wish him very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome the Minister and congratulate him in particular for the very swift action he has taken since he has come into office. Resolutions to many problems we have been talking about for a long time have been announced recently, and that is a welcome factor.  However, between our tourist boards, ourselves and anybody connected with tourism, we are not doing enough to promote this growing industry which has no limitations on its growth. All our energies and efforts should focus on it in the future.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a greater awareness and acceptance by everybody in the industry that we must generally make the visitors welcome, treat them well and give them good value for money so that they will return, spread the faith and tell people exactly what kind of country we have.  Immediate attention is needed to improve and regulate some of our major attractions.  I am referring not merely to what Senator McMahon spoke about, our local beaches which need to be controlled and maintained for our own people, but I am referring to tourists and the country we are trying to sell to them.  We cannot go abroad and sell sunshine.  However, we have things to sell which are far more important.  We have the beauty of the country.  We have our offshore island trips.  Here, let me be parochial and mention trips to the Blaskets, the Skelligs and so forth and I will even expand and go to the Aran Islands.  We should ensure that the operators are licensed and that the systems are regulated.  At present we cannot promote the Skelligs, the Blaskets or any of these islands because we have no licensed operators.</P>
      <P>However, we have both coast and inland fishing.  Fishing is one of the biggest sports in the world now: it is the biggest single sport in the UK.  The Minister and Senator Murphy talked about walking.  In the UK at the moment about three million people participate in walks and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a recent conference of the General <Col N="1840" /> Council of County Councils in Ballybunion, part of the morning session was devoted to tourism, the growth of tourism and so on.  I was more than surprised when it was stated by one of the speakers that, in a recent survey in France, 85 per cent of the people surveyed did not know where Ireland is.  We are not doing enough to promote our country.  I mentioned to the Minister that about a year and a half ago I was in Spain at the Future conference where every country in the world was promoting its own country, selling its wares and so on.  Ireland had a stand there but it was unmanned.  I took a very poor view of that because it is one of the biggest tourist promotion conferences not alone in Europe but in the world.</P>
    <P>There should be harmonisation of standards between the various Departments as regards caravan and camping sites. They should be legally registered through Bord Fáilte.  At the same time local authorities are now in a position to issue licences to people who will not even meet with Bord Fáilte requirements.  There should be initiatives to encourage more improvements in the hotel and restaurant sectors.  Taxes may be too high.  The tendency now seems to be for the proprietors to cut back on staffing levels.  This obviously has a knock-on effect of reducing the level of services to the visitor.</P>
    <P>There should be more initiatives to provide additional active type holidays and indoor facilities.  Another recommendation which the Minister should consider is the area of grant-aid.  Consideration will have to be given in the future of providing a fund to the industry which could be used for interest free loans.  The easy grants system sometimes encourages people to get involved in uneconomic projects, whereas if they had some responsibility for the total costing of the project they would ensure that it is viable before they would enter into it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what other speakers have said but I want to put emphasis on one matter mentioned by Senator O'Callaghan, that is, the licensing laws.  It is a disgrace and a scandal to see our own tourists who go to seaside <Col N="1841" /> resorts for a week or two weeks holidays having to be out on the sidewalks at 10 o'clock on a Sunday night.  As Senator McMahon mentioned, there is an urgent need for proper signposting and priority should be given to the prime tourist areas in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his swift action which is badly needed because the tourist industry &mdash; even though the growth figures were mentioned for the first quarter of this year they are not visible &mdash; needs the injections and the initiatives which he has put into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fine Gael support this Bill in its entirety.  I commend the Minister for the enthusiasm and the drive he has brought to the task of increasing our tourism earnings.  In this, he is following a very good example set by Deputy John Bruton as Minister and by Michael Moynihan when he held that portfolio in the last Administration.  I do not underestimate the size of the task facing the Minister.  It is a very difficult one, even though tourism is seen by very many people as a fairly easy soft target. Most people feel they are experts on why we are not doing better and can tell us why we should be doing better, but what we usually find in these discussions, when we get down to specifics, is that it is not always that easy to bring about the changes which would improve the situation especially when these changes can involve taking on local vested interests, whether they be local angling groups, local shooting groups, restrictive trade union practices or people who are in pursuit of short term financial gain.  The key sentences in the Minister's speech made in the Dáil was:</P>
      <P>... we carried out a full appraisal of the targets which Bord Fáilte had set for the 1987 season.  We were frankly shocked by the complacency and lack of ambition which they showed for the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right to be disappointed and I urge him to have, as a priority, a major reappraisal of the role, the functions <Col N="1842" /> and the whole <i>raison d'être</i> of Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte are an institution and like all institutions, including ourselves here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, they must renew themselves or else atrophy.</P>
    <P>When Bord Fáilte were set up they were a small vibrant, exciting organisation charting out new developments and seeking out new markets.  They were enthusiastic about their market and their purpose.  Nobody today could describe Bord Fáilte in those terms.  Bord Fáilte are now very firmly part of the Irish establishment. There is no sense of challenge or excitement about what they are doing. Bord Fáilte have become increasingly defensive about their own role and their own contribution.  That is not the Bord Fáilte of yesteryear and the Minister is right to be concerned about their targets and their performance.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at a few facts concerning the operations of Bord Fáilte. Last year Bord Fáilte spent over £23 million. In these days when we have become used to telephone numbers as the sort of figures used in terms of public spending, £23 million may not seem to be an awful lot of money.  But if we think about £23 million for a moment and put it into the context of what other similar organisations spend, we can see that it is, indeed, a huge sum of money.  It is a huge marketing budget.  Its true size becomes apparent when we put it into perspective and the perspective in this case is the private sector.</P>
    <P>Last year the total advertising budget of the combined advertising agencies in this country was £110 million.  That includes the spending on promotions of such enormous companies as Guinness, Brown Thomas's, Clery's, Waterford Glass, NET, the building societies, Carroll's, Esso, Shell, Texaco, Superquinn and Dunnes Stores.  The entire advertising spending of all these companies last year came to £110 million.  Bord Fáilte's budget on spending last year &mdash; I may be slightly unfair here but nonetheless Bord Fáilte are largely a marketing organisation <Col N="1843" />&mdash; was one-quarter of the combined spending of all of these organisations.  RTE's total advertising revenue last year was £50 million.  That includes all the money spent in this country on radio and television advertising. Bord Fáilte spent about half of that amount.  Those comparisons put the amount of money Bord Fáilte are spending into some sort of proper perspective. That budget is proportionately higher than the amount of money spent by any national tourist organisation in any other country in the European Community and probably any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are not the only body spending money seeking to attract visitors to this country.  The major air and sea carriers spend large amounts in promoting Ireland.  Aer Lingus, for example, are huge spenders in this regard.  Irish Continental Lines spend money to great effect in attracting people from the Continent and B &amp; I have been aiming at the British market and and with some success, as have Sealink.  In recent times we have seen the success of Ryanair in their advertising budgets trying to attract people into this country.  CIE do not do a bad job in trying to attract people to their bus tours.  There is also spending out of this country by the major hotel groups, by Jury's Hotel, the Doyle hotels groups and some of the other major hotel groups.</P>
    <P>When we add all this to Bord Fáilte's budget we can see that the amount spent, both out of public and private funds, in trying to attract tourists to this country is a truly huge amount, much greater than that spent by any other European country. We have to ask ourselves a number of questions about this.  How many of those who came here as tourists came as a result of Bord Fáilte promotions?  I do not know the answer and I do not believe there is any real way of knowing.  We have all filled in forms at airports and seaports asking us about our travelling, whether we were tourists, trying to ascertain the true extent of the size of the number of tourists coming into the country, and we have to conclude from our <Col N="1844" /> experience that this is a fairly imprecise science, especially trying to find out why people came and what prompted them to come to this country.  Was it the promotion of Bord Fáilte?  Was it the other advertising groups?  Was it the ethnic pull?  Was it simply a whim, or was it word of mouth?</P>
    <P>Talking to people in the tourist industry, people whose judgment I respect, many would argue that the promotions of Bord Fáilte have, perhaps, not had the same cutting edge or the same success as the more specific promotions of those people who have a direct dollar or pound to make from their promotions.  In many ways these may well have been effective in bringing people into this country.  I do not know what is the real story.  It is one of the unanswerable questions, but there are enough doubts surrounding the whole question of whether we, the taxpayer, are getting value for money spent by Bord Fáilte promoting tourism to treat with a certain amount of caution some of the more outlandish claims being made by people in the tourist industry who have a vested interest in telling us that all is going very well indeed.</P>
    <P>I am not here to knock Bord Fáilte. There is always the danger if one says hard things about a State organisation that one is accused of knocking it.  I am not doing that.  Over the years Bord Fáilte have served this country very well in many ways.  There are certain parts of our tourism promotion which are identified, and always will be, with Bord Fáilte.  The Tidy Towns Competition, which is in some trouble at the moment, is one of the great innovations of Bord Fáilte.  Many of their brochures and their promotions have been of a very high quality. Having said that, I come back to the question which I am asking as objectively as I can: are Bord Fáilte giving value for our money?</P>
    <P>To some extent we are all in a classic no-win situation as far as Bord Fáilte are concerned.  If we are being honest we can see there are many factors over which no State agency has control which will affect the state of tourism &mdash; the state of the <Col N="1845" /> dollar, the pound, the franc, the Deutsche Mark, the climate of international terror which prevailed last year and which kept many Americans away from Europe, and even the weather.  If it is a good year Bord Fáilte will always be very quick, maybe justifiably, to claim credit for that fact, but if we have a bad year, then the cry goes up from Bord Fáilte that they are under-financed, that they need more money to get the message across.  We may well have a situation where the taxpayer is pouring in more money without involving the Government in any root and branch appraisal of whether the money is being spent well or wisely or whether we are simply pouring good money after bad.  Over the years this has been the classic response of Bord Fáilte.  In a good year Bord Fáilte take much of the credit, in a bad year Bord Fáilte needs more money to be spent in the same way, irrespective of the results being achieved.  It is time that &ldquo;stop&rdquo; was shouted in this regard.  That certainly was the view of Deputy John Bruton as Minister and I believe it is also the view of the present Minister, Deputy Wilson.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have at least two major problems at the present time.  The Minister referred to one of them in his speech today and I agree with him, that is, the problem of developing a saleable attractive image of what Ireland has to offer. The current image projected by our tourist board is too vague.  We have not created an image of Ireland to which people can readily respond, which makes a fairly immediate impact and makes them see something specific which they will want to enjoy and which will bring them to this country.</P>
    <P>Let us take by contrast the image of Spain.  All of us have a very definite image of what Spain has to offer.  We think of sunshine, beaches, bull-fights, late night dancing, and we may think of drink at prices a great deal less than obtains in this country.  The picture of Spain is a clear one.  Any one of us thinking of Spain would have more or less the same picture of why we want to go there and what we will get there.  If we go to France we think again of the sun, but we think perhaps <Col N="1846" /> more in terms of the very high quality of food, the sense of culture, the chateaux and a civilised history.  There may be other things about France but there is at least a very definite picture in our minds as to what France stands for.  Even England, which is a latecomer into the tourism area, has succeeded in projecting a much more definite specific image of what it offers than we have.  It has marketed itself better, capitalising on the monarchy, on a sense of nostalgia and tradition and it has been highly successful.</P>
    <P>Our marketing image &mdash; and the Minister is very aware of this &mdash; is too vague. Looking recently through some French and German magazines, I noticed a very heavy concentration on the colleens with red hair, Aran sweaters, wolfhounds, Powerscourt, donkeys, and beautiful scenery &mdash; all very attractive and picturesque but not conveying to the wouldbe tourist any sense of what is available in Ireland.  The wolfhound might be, the red-haired girl probably is not, but there is no real sense of what specifically is available here.  It seems to be a soft centred type of advertising.  There is an absence of any specific message or theme. What was Ireland offering?  It did not come across very clearly and certianly the message was not as obvious as that conveyed by the other countries I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I believe, and the Minister made this point very clearly, that our marketing should concentrate far more on specifics in trying to put our message across.  It is here that Bord Fáilte should be much more active and should initiate developments. Bord Fáilte should be much more active in drawing public attention to the reasons why local vested interests in different parts of the country are inhibiting the development of angling and shooting, and this point should be put strongly and specifically.  Bord Fáilte should take a strong lead in developing access to our national monuments, ensuring there is better presentation of these marvellous treasures.  They should be strong in pointing out the reasons why <Col N="1847" /> Dublin and some of our major towns are not attractive to visitors.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed a strong Bord Fáilte view on the demise of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, which matter will be debated elsewhere today. In passing, I would ask the Minister, wearing his tourism hat in Cabinet, to look hard at the potential value of the idea contained in the concept of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, namely, its potential for developing the centre of Dublin in an attractive way.  While it is gone for this year, I ask him to look hard at the idea and perhaps see if in some way that intention could be revived.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that Bord Fáilte should be in there making things happen.  They should be initiators.  They should be speaking out, not in the guarded language of the bureaucrat but in plain ordinary English or Irish, attacking those things which inhibit our tourist development potential.  They have not been doing that, nor, I believe, have they been developing a specific image of Ireland which will make real impact outside this country.</P>
    <P>The reason they are not doing that brings me to my last point.  For historical reasons Bord Fáilte find themselves like so many other public organisations, an ageing organisation.  This is a very common feature of current Irish society. It is true of my own area &mdash; the universities &mdash; where the age imbalance is very much in favour of the middle or older age, and there is a very small proportion of younger staff.  It is true of the research institutes, it is true of many of the public sector areas in our society and it was true until very recently of RTE.</P>

      <P>I interrupt to say that we came to a decision.  Before the statements, which we ruled on earlier, commence, I should like to remind <Col N="1848" /> Senators that certain aspects of the Darndale situation are before the courts and are therefore, <i>sub judice.</i>  I request Senators making statements to bear that in mind.  Under the Order of the House, each Senator offering has ten minutes only.  In case there is a misunderstanding, the House agreed to give this time for the statements, not the Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for allowing this matter of importance to be discussed and to thank Senator Manning for raising the issue this morning.  It is important that we use the debate to put this whole issue in perspective. The sensationalism is not helpful and we must appeal for calmness and reason.  That is the best way forward.  I would like to outline to the House the history of this problem.</P>
      <P>The illegal parking of caravans along the Darndale link road has been a problem for many years now, maybe 15 years. This situation is totally intolerable from all points of view, from the point of view of the travellers, the settled community and the industrialists living adjacent to the road.  It is important to use this debate to ensure that this problem which has been going on for many years now is tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have been very active on this issue.  Indeed, they held a number of meetings to discuss the issue and to bring all the parties together.  I would like to pay tribute to Dublin Corporation for their work on resettling the travelling community in the city.  They do great work and it is probably not recognised. They have undertaken to organise a number of painstaking negotiations regarding this issue with all the parties involved.  Now, after many years, there is a plan to erect two halting sites in this area, which is agreeable to all the parties concerned.  However, we are waiting for final approval from the Department of the Environment to give the go ahead to this plan.  That is the solution to the problem which has arisen over the past two days in particular.  If these two halting sites are provided &mdash; small family halting sites &mdash; that road can be cleared <Col N="1849" /> and landscaped to the benefit of all the people of the area.</P>
    <P>It is important to comment on the community of Darndale.  They are sick of the bad publicity the estate has got over the past number of years and the recent publicity has not helped.  Darndale is a community of 1,000 families approximately. It is always the small minority who get an estate a bad name which is the case on this occasion also.  You cannot brand 1,000 families with a particular tag when only a small minority are responsible for the trouble.  There is a very active community spirit in the Darndale area and a very active tenants' association who have been particularly helpful in bringing about a solution to the problem of homelessness in the locality.  There is also a scheme going ahead at the moment for the refurbishment of Darndale, due to be put in place some time later this year.  There is a tremendous community spirit and the people have brought about great improvements in their living standards. The recent publicity will do a terrible amount of damage.  It is important in this debate to say that Darndale is an active, thriving, healthy community and that only a small minority are responsible for the trouble.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure recently of opening a scheme of 12 chalets for travellers in this locality and I witnessed a tremendous amount of goodwill in the community towards the travelling people.  This is one of the areas of Dublin where travellers and the settled community have a very good relationship.  That is something which must be pointed out.  Unlike many other parts of the country, there is close co-operation between travellers and the settled community.  I hope that recent incidents will not damage this good relationship.</P>
    <P>The problem of travellers in this country is a major challenge and we owe it to ourselves and to everybody concerned to tackle it.  It is one in which I am particularly interested as I represent the Darndale area on Dublin City Council. I appeal for calm.  The solution to the <Col N="1850" /> problem is the provision of the two halting sites proposed by Dublin Corporation, after long painstaking negotiations, as quickly as possible.  We must communicate that decision to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I was responsible for the misunderstanding regarding the statements so I am glad you put the record straight.  I am also very pleased that the Leader of the House saw fit to agree to having time made available for this brief discussion today.  I would like to follow in the spirit and tone set by Senator Haughey who adopted a very calm, responsible approach to a problem which concerns him, myself and anybody who has the honour to represent that area at local or national level.</P>
      <P>As is by now well known to most people, Darndale was conceived as a model housing estate about 12 or 13 years ago.  It was based upon an award winning design which had been implemented with some success in parts of Britain and the Continent.  Unfortunately, the award winning design was not a success in Darndale, for a variety of reasons.  Perhaps it was the wrong concept; certainly the range of support services were not available.  The people in Darndale found that the bus service was not adequate. They were living a long distance from the shops and a range of problems developed.  In addition, one could perhaps say that the question of maintenance over the years and the policies followed there were not particularly successful. One way or the other, Darndale was beset with a great number of social problems, problems of maintaining the housing stock and, most of all, in maintaining the morale of the estate.  These problems were tackled in a number of ways but usually in a piecemeal fashion.</P>

    <P>I should have said that Darndale suffered greatly over the past number of years from the implementation of the £5,000 scheme which allowed council tenants to give up their homes and get £5,000 if they were buying private houses.  In a great number of cases this scheme was highly successful, but it had a disastrous <Col N="1851" /> effect in Darndale.  A very settled community, beginning to find its own way, suddenly found itself depleted of some of the most constructive people living in the area.  There were a huge number of vacant houses and a huge throughput of people, many of whom stayed only a short while in Darndale.  To a certain extent, Darndale was used as a convenient dumping ground for a number of problem families.  In a short space of time much of the character of Darndale changed and the job of the extraordinarily good community workers and community leaders who were trying to develop Darndale became much more difficult.  It is within this context over the past two or three years that the last Government &mdash; after a visit by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, to Darndale &mdash; took the decision that Darndale needed to be fundamentally redesigned.  It was no good repairing broken houses or simply patching up a fabric that was showing great signs of wear and tear.  In effect it was necessary to redesign the entire estate in accordance with the wishes of the people who live there.  So there began the Darndale pilot project when, in consultation with the wishes of local tenants' and residents associations, the scheme of redesigning the whole estate commenced.  It had the positive support of the previous Government. Money was made available.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to say that the present Government accepted the need for this fundamental redesign of Darndale and that they have supported it enthusiastically. I must pay tribute to Senator Haughey in this regard.  He has been a very strong supporter of the redevelopment and refurbishment that has been taken on board.  While it constitutes a beginning only, nonetheless that project showed the depth of goodwill obtaining in Darndale and the extent by which local people were prepared to become involved in what they saw as their chance to be consulted and involved in redesigning their own estate.</P>
    <P>In view of the very adverse publicity surrounding the present troubles &mdash; and <Col N="1852" /> Senator Haughey has set out the context of these difficulties very clearly &mdash; it is important to say to those who do not know Darnadle that there are probably few areas in Dublin which have such a richness of voluntary organisations dedicated to trying to improve the truly bad conditions obtaining in many parts of Darndale, seeking to help people there to find employment in creative ways.  The Darndale Unemployment Action Group has given me, Senator Haughey and all politicians representing the area a very rough time on various issues.  Nonetheless, it is probably the most vibrant, creative and active group in the country. The local tenants and residents' association have consistently over the years set out to improve the quality of life in the area, have been very quick to point out people who have been involved in breaking the law and have sought to bring about harmony in the whole Darndale area.  There are very few areas in the country where, under such adverse conditions, there is such a strong spirit of voluntary co-operation.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey made a point which is vitally important &mdash; in spite of the size of the travellers' encampment close to Darndale in a very unsightly place, the majority of the people of Darndale have had very good relations indeed with the travelling community far better and more Christian than that prevailing in many of the more affluent parts of this city.  There has been a greater understanding that travellers have rights and specific problems. There has been a very strong, conscious effort to ensure that the plight of the travelling people was understood and the demands for their rights fully supported.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that the present publicity surrounding the trouble in Darndale is to be regretted.  Local people feel they have enough difficulties without the area having the stigma of the bad publicity.  Often when a young person seeking a job gives an address in Darndale this itself, is almost seen as a disadvantage. I want to ensure that the picture of Darndale put across today is of a people, a community, striving against <Col N="1853" /> the odds to redress great injustices which have been visited upon them, striving to make the best of the community spirit, to build up a proper sense of community, to tackle in a community way, the enormous social and employment problems more present there than in most other places.  It is that picture I want to attempt to get across today, to try to undo the harm caused by much of the recent adverse publicity.</P>
    <P>The problems of Darndale are probably more intense and more deeply rooted than in any other similar community in the country.  The real problems of Darndale need the attention of a Government task force with a blueprint to draw up, at great speed, a programme for action.  There are ideas in abundance among the people of Darndale as to what needs to be done and how such can be done to render Darndale a viable, living community of which the people living there can be truly proud.  The ideas are there.  There is a terrible sense of isolation &mdash;either that Government is not listening or that there are so many varied and serried Government agencies that nothing will ever be done.  I would ask Senator Haughey, his party and the House if it would be possible to make a recommendation to the Government that a task force be appointed, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that the problems which are specific or peculiar to Darndale are tackled urgently, ensuring that we do not have a repetition of the unfortunate events of recent days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the House found time to respond so quickly to a matter of some considerable concern.  During my election campaign I had as an assenter Nan Joyce of the travelling community.  If this morning Senator McGowan elevated me to the status of professor &mdash; he quite regularly refers to the school of life and hardship &mdash;then the leaders of the travelling community are professors of this university of hardship.  I am sorry he is not here to listen and learn about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saddest story I heard this year was from a young woman who lived in a small <Col N="1854" /> provincial town.  Her name is Aoife.  She likes dancing, to go to the disco in the local town on a Saturday night but on her way to the disco she has to call into the local Garda station where she is issued with a special ticket.  The first ten of the special ticketholders are allowed into the disco.  The special tickets are for travellers and the quota of travellers allowed into that disco is ten.  I raise this point because quite regularly we became emotional about the problems of South Africa and apartheid thousands of miles away from us.  This really is the system of pass laws operating in an Irish provincial town.  It is apartheid Irish-style.  It is abhorrent and offensive.</P>
    <P>Recently I learned of a member of my union, the INTO, working in support of travellers and travellers' rights who had organised a function for them in a Dublin hotel.  The function had been booked and arranged, tickets were sold and they were ready to operate.  When the proprietors of the hotel discovered that they were a group of travellers they cancelled the booking and put them out of the hotel.  I raise this point but because it is something that will probably be tested in the courts in a short time I am prevented from saying more because of the sub judice rule.</P>
    <P>As Senators Haughey and Manning both said, it is quite unfortunate that the reporting of the Darndale events presented the community there in such an unfortunate manner.  I would agree with both Senators that the Darndale community is not one that could be described as racist in any sense.  I have worked in adult education and unemployed groups there myself.  I know the people, many of the community groups there and I can subscribe to what has been said.  They are a vital, energetic and tightly-knit community who have always striven to improve the quality of life in their area.  The Darndale Tenants' Association and other community groups have always worked to promote good relations between travellers and the settled community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> The people of Darndale, though suffering from the highest levels of under-privilege and socio-economic deprivation, have always found time to consider those less-well-off than themselves, have always found time to support travellers and their rights.  At this moment community leaders and groups are meeting with travellers in Darndale to discuss how they can prevent a worsening of this terrible situation.  That demonstrates their concern and commitment to finding a solution.  It also underlines their sense of frustration.  Because of the way events there have been reported, people outside Darndale may well feel there are circumstances prevailing there that can be stopped or started at will.  Some events go beyond the control of normal communities. The people are trying to retain control in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>At present in Darndale the travelling community feel frightened and besieged and the settled community is worried and frustrated, all because a small, unrepresentative group have behaved in a violent, obnoxious and dangerous way.  We cannot ignore the petrol bombs and stone throwing at the gardaí and the riots in the streets in Darndale.  We must learn something from it.</P>
    <P>Racism in any form is offensive and as citizens we should always find it unacceptable but we, as legislators, have a very special duty in this area.  We must learn from this and similar incidents and we must commit ourselves to introduce legislation which will outlaw racism in all its forms.  It is scandalous that Ireland is being used by fascist and racist groups throughout the world to get material printed and distributed.  That is an area which touches on this issue and we must make ourselves aware of it and do our best to outlaw it.</P>
    <P>Following the recent attacks, threats, violence, eviction and intimidation of the travelling community, they now find themselves living in a state of siege and fear.  I agree we need to have a special task force in the Darndale area but there have been reports previously on related issues and we have not had the action <Col N="1856" /> to which we are entitled.  There is still victimisation of a section of the Irish people.  The lack of respect and concern for travellers' rights has many forms. Travellers are now being harassed and outright hostility is being manifested towards them by a very small minority, but it is a small minority who give a bad impression of the general status.  Attacks such as these take from the dignity, self-respect and confidence of the travelling people.</P>
    <P>Travellers have their own culture, their own values and they are a dignified, committed and caring people.  They have the same proportion of bad eggs in their midst as the settled community have but one of the tragedies of Irish life is that when a traveller is found guilty of some action it reflects on the entire travelling community whereas the obverse does not happen in the case of a member of the settled community.  This is where we must educate the community at large.  Travellers must be accorded their full rights as citizens.  They are a particular ethnic group, with their own language, their own customs, their own lifestyle, their own culture.  All of us, be it in the trade union movement, in politics or wherever decisions are taken and where there is power, have a duty towards this minority group.  We must give leadership to allay and break down the barriers of fear and suspicion that exist between the settled community and the travellers.  The Government have a duty to provide halting sites, group housing schemes, health care, education and social rights for travellers. Certainly members of my own union, the INTO, have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We can learn that we need to meet with both settled and travelling communities and find out what we can do to prevent further outbreaks of this kind of unacceptable violence.  We must state that confrontation politics are not on, we must say that there is enough space and goodwill in the country for all of us and, finally, <Col N="1857" /> we must say that the strength of any democracy can be measured only by the yardstick of how it looks after its minorities. Let us learn from Darndale, let us ensure that it does not happen again and let us give travellers their full rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I had come to the last point I was about to make in my contribution and that was that I felt Bord Fáilte had found themselves in a situation similar to many other major institutions and organisations in this country.  For a variety of reasons, they are an ageing institution, an ageing organisation, and I instanced many other public bodies which I feel are suffering from a similar malaise at the present time.  The reasons for this are fairly simple.  There was a huge recruitment of young people into these organisations and institutions in the sixties and it was this recruitment which gave many of them that sense of excitement at that time, that sense of pushing back the frontiers and that sense of the possible.  Sometimes maybe there was a sense of naivety, sometimes this went over the top, but there was no doubt about the vigour and the thrusting, aggressive approach of many of these organisations at that time, organisations peopled by persons who wanted to make things happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the economic growth of the sixties did not last.  We have had two decades of retrenchment and we have had very little young intake into any of these organisations over the past number of years.  They are increasingly dominated by the middle-aged and the young elderly &mdash; not quite the old elderly. As a result, many of these organisations <Col N="1858" /> have changed in character.  They are now defensive, concerned with defence of the <i>status quo</i>, justifying and defending themselves, fearful of change, and certainly not taking on the new challenges of changed circumstances.  This is certainly true in the case of Bord Fáilte who are not taking on challenges in the way Bord Fáilte of 20 years ago would have done. It is a huge problem and it exists right across our public sector.  It is at the root of some of the problems now facing Bord Fáilte and it is not going to be easy to overcome.  If our tourism industry is to be healthy, it needs at the very core a trimmed down, vigorous, redefined, muscular Bord Fáilte.  It needs Bord Fáilte taking and giving a lead that has been lacking over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister to the House.  It has always been a pleasure to stand opposite him as one always gets a very civilised and full hearing for one's point of view, however apt or inapt that view may be.  I wish him well with the Bill and in his new portfolio. A great deal depends on the success or otherwise of what the Minister achieves in tourism.  This Bill is a step in the right direction, as have been the wide range of measures he introduced, which have been greeted with widespread approval right across the tourist industry and which we all hope will succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I would like to join in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Wilson, to the Seanad. People from my part of the country were genuinely pleased and happy when he was appointed Minister for Tourism and Transport because it held out some hope that some of their problems might be addressed.  The people of the north-west have had long experience in dealing with these problems and they have been met with sincere and sympathetic, understanding from Deputy Wilson in his capacity as Minister.  I am one of those who are delighted he is in charge of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I want to refer briefly to some of the difficulties involved.  I support <Col N="1859" /> Senator Manning in his reference to Bord Fáilte, critical in a sense but not for the purpose of just knocking Bord Fáilte.  It is timely that Bord Fáilte should be looked at and I come from an area where the majority of the people feel that they have been neglected by Bord Fáilte.  I am sure the Minister is not going to say he would support what I am saying but his own country, Cavan, and the rest of Ulster and also Connacht have not got their fair share of attention.  I feel I have a responsibility to speak for an area that is in difficulty and the people from my county are very, very angry with Bord Fáilte.  In the magazine of the hotel and catering industry, the question is asked: &ldquo;How real is the Wilson package&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>My response to that is that the Wilson package and the Government package is a real and solid commitment to the tourism industry and there is no doubt in the world about that.  Only those who want to play the game of politics with a very important industry could question the sincerity of that package and that is not a role that I intend to play.  I accept that the Government, the Minister and everybody concerned are committed to that package because if we want to provide jobs for our young people, tourism is one of the potential areas of growth.  Jobs can be provided for young people in the tourism industry if there is co-operation and the promotion is accepted by everybody.</P>
    <P>There have to be very substantial changes in the tourism industry.  I come from county Donegal where we have problems. We have one third of the beaches in the country.  Whether one is mountain climbing or walking in areas like Glengosh or Glangevlin, the peace, tranquility and scenery of the areas are unequalled. Special care and recognition must be given to the remoteness, beauty and value of what we have to sell because it is not being done adequately at the moment.  The tourist potential in Connacht is not being promoted as successfully as it could be and I humbly <Col N="1860" /> suggest to the Minister that he might consider some alterations in the way it is being promoted.</P>
    <P>People in my county have tried consistently to work and to get a positive response from Bord Fáilte for 25 years but they have not achieved much.  The Minister will accept that my county &mdash; and I hope he does not mind my being parochial &mdash; is serious about its commitment to the tourist industry.  We have a hotel training college in Killybegs where we train people from other counties.  This is a very successful college.  We were honoured to have the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Education conferring awards on the students in the college and I have no doubt that he fully accepts and values the contribution that is being made by that college.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage when a review of the industry has got to take place.  The provision of extra capital seems to be routine and it happens every year or every four years when the capital provision needs to be extended automatically. I want to ask some hard questions and if I am wrong or unfair I may be corrected.</P>
    <P>People in my county believe that, if the Government allocate another £10 million to Bord Fáilte, about £9.5 million will go on administration.  Bord Fáilte have three major headquarters in this city &mdash; the glasshouse at Baggot Street Bridge plus two other centres.  I stand to be corrected but I think they have about 40 offices abroad which are all up to embassy standard. The remarks made by my colleague, Senator Manning in this regard are right because after a while complacency among the workers in these offices sets in and it is the order of the day for them to arrive at work in time for the tea trolley and a look at the paper. People are above being asked individually what their contribution to their job is or whether they were out of work because their Granny was sick or whatever. To question them is nearly beyond the limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister should complete his task by taking a very hard look at the contribution Bord Fáilte are making to the <Col N="1861" /> tourist industry.  Too much of the revenue of Bord Fáilte is being provided for administration purposes, for rent, for rates and pensions.  Too great a slice of that cake is going towards administration which at the same time is becoming very ineffective.  I hope the House will be patient with me if I give one or two simple explanations for this.</P>
    <P>Previously to this term in the Seanad, I was 16 years or four terms in the Seanad. I tried to see the director general of Bord Fáilte to discuss a number of problems. I went to Bord Fáilte.  I phoned his office and I made numerous contacts with Bord Fáilte but I failed to see the director general.  I did this for a period of about seven years until I finally gave up.  If I, in my capacity as a Senator, was unsuccessful in meeting the director general how does the ordinary person involved in tourist industry ever meet the director general of Board Fáilte if he has a special problem?  I was always told the director general had appointments, he was out of the country, he was out of the office or that he was at meetings.  The first time I met that gentleman &mdash; and I would not miss this opportunity to tell this to the House &mdash; was years afterwards when I got a phone call asking me if I would see a gentleman who was on a Seanad campaign.  I agreed to meet him in my house in Donegal.  When he came in I had a cup of tea with him and I said to him: &ldquo;I do not believe you know me.  I am the person who tried unsuccessfully for a number of years to meet you and if you knew the circumstances you would have to have a hard neck to approach me for a vote.  If I had 100 votes, I would not place you at 99.&rdquo;  That was the only satisfaction I got out of my unsuccessful attempts to meet the director general of Bord Fáilte.  I would not have mentioned that if I thought there was some personal reason he did not want to meet me or that I went about it in the wrong way.</P>
    <P>Donegal County Council are contributing substantially out of their rates to the Donegal-Sligo-Leitrim tourism industry.  They discussed their contribution at local authority level towards <Col N="1862" /> the tourism industry.  Some dissatisfaction was expressed about Bord Fáilte and as a result it was proposed that Donegal County Council would write to the director general of Bord Fáilte and ask him to come up to Donegal, meet Donegal County Council and answer some questions.  The present Director General of Bord Fáilte, Mr. Michael McNulty, replied to Donegal County Council and said he did not have time to come up, but that he would send up a representative called Stan Glenn.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise the issue on this occasion is that I believe it is consistent with my own bad experience with the director general.  What chance have Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo and Donegal of projecting their problems and having a case heard?  My simple assessment is &mdash; and my county men of all political persuasions have convinced me beyond doubt &mdash; that they are outside the Pale for recognition by Bord Fáilte at present.  I have an obligation to explain to the Minister the feelings of my county colleagues.  Rather than question how real the Wilson package is it would be more appropriate to question how real is the ability of Bord Fáilte to deliver the Wilson package.  Mr. McNulty's photograph is on the back of that article.  I wonder how he got time to stand to have his photograph taken as the report reaching Donegal is that he is very busy.</P>
    <P>I have serious reservations about the performance of Bord Fáilte.  I do not believe it is appropriate that Bord Fáilte should be made up of people who have been highly successful in the industry.  I would like to give the Minister an example.  I attended a jointly held tourism conference in Boyle a few years ago. Mr. Michael McNulty attended on that occasion, just after his appointment and he was being introduced.  I did not know what kind of a contribution I might make but the meeting adjourned for lunch and I bought the evening paper.  The heading was &ldquo;A Dublin hotelier may have to lay off 2,000 people&rdquo;.  I made my contribution from the headings of the evening paper and asked if the news was <Col N="1863" /> sensational enough to get banner headlines across the top of the paper, why did it not make sensational headlines if the industry had to lose substantially more in rural Ireland and in my constituency.  Far in excess of that number of jobs were lost through the negligence of Bord Fáilte in the north-west of Ireland.  I also said I believed it was wrong for a Bord Fáilte director to be guiding the policy of Bord Fáilte.  I referred to the statement made by one particular director when he said the industry had now spent enough on development and it was time we did some selling.  What that director, a hotelier based in Dublin, meant was that he had enough bedrooms well equipped with showers, baths and so on and that Bord Fáilte should start selling and filling his bedrooms.  The people who are committed to the industry, the people in the west, have been getting an unfair deal from Bord Fáilte as presently structured.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, Deputy Wilson, in his struggle and effort to spend money wisely and get the best results to restructure Bord Fáilte and get rid of the tea-trolley complex at Baggot Street Bridge.  I suggest that the Minister should examine the feasibility of regionalising Bord Fáilte and resiting the three office blocks in Dublin.  They could be based in Dublin, the south and Connacht. Whether the Connacht office is based in Galway, Sligo or Cavan &mdash; there is no better site for it &mdash; I would be the first to congratulate the Minister whenever he tackles and succeeds in that task.  I accept that it would be a marathon task to dismantle the existing structures.</P>
    <P>Something has got to be done to retain the interest of those who are committed to and who have the potential for looking after the tourists.  Because of the hopeless situation of tourism in the north-west my constituents have had to look to the North for business.  The Minister will be aware that Donegal County Council have certain proposals to establish a tourism organisation with County Derry and County Tyrone.  We sincerely hope that development will have the Minister's blessing.  It may not have the blessing of <Col N="1864" /> Bord Fáilte and they may try to influence or discourage his support, but the people of my county are aware of the difficulties in setting up a new tourism structure.</P>
    <P>It is not a small task; nevertheless we have undertaken that job and we have submitted a rough draft proposal for the Minister's consideration.  Arising from the Minister's commitment to the area, we hope he will be helpful with regard to the submission, and, if necessary, that he will make proposals to improve that submission.  We believe there is tremendous capacity in the industry and that capacity will not be fully developed without a courageous approach to questioning the value we are getting from the money that has already been provided.  The danger of duplication has got to be looked at.</P>
    <P>We all realise the limited areas where we can find jobs, whether it be in the fishing industry, agriculture, or manufacture. There is no area easier in which to find new jobs than in the development of the tourist industry.  My little contribution here today is to encourage the Minister and to express the sincere hope that he will be successful because if he is not successful it will be a tragedy for us all.  The Minister has a sincere commitment and support from the area north of the Boyne which area in my opinion is not getting a fair crack of the whip at present.  We look forward to the Minister's success.  I believe the Wilson package will work because there are enough determined people standing waiting and ready to support the Minister in whatever measures he proposes to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, to the Seanad gathering in this Chamber. It would be superfluous to talk about wishing him well.  He appears to be a person with a definite purpose and I look forward to great strides being made in the area of tourism.  It is nice to hear something that is socialistic in its purpose being praised by people who might at other times knock at it and it is nice to think that people are interested in this development in the various regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the importance <Col N="1865" /> of tourism not only from the point of view of attracting people to the country but because of its impact on unemployment. I live in a city that is burdened with unemployment and so generally speaking is the whole country.  The tourist industry should be reassessed, with an emphasis on its effect on the problem of unemployment. The Minister has made an effort in this direction, for example, by the introduction of the cheap air fares and competition.  If costs come down, automatically people have more money in their pockets to spend when they come here.</P>
    <P>The problem of taxation is a very serious one.  The sad development down through the years is that beer and cigarettes have taken an awful hammering.  I do not think I can lay the blame on any particular person.  Many years ago when I represented the Guinness workers as a branch official of the Workers' Union of Ireland I remember writing to the Minister of the day, our present Taoiseach, and getting a reply telling me that the Government would have to continue in the vein of taxing beer because revenue from that source was very buoyant.  That dates back about 25 years ago and people have been using the same argument over 25 years.  Buoyant and all as it was, the excessive tax on beer was one of the reasons the number of ordinary working class tourists particularly from Britain has declined.  The Northern troubles may have contributed to a degree, but in general when the prices of beer and cigarettes were more reasonable a very good type of decent tourists who spent money were attracted here.  It is not always the people with the big money who spend big.</P>
    <P>With regard to unemployment, the Minister in his address referred to a grant-in-aid of £30 million and £14 million for amenity and accommodation development and then immediately refers to 950 jobs.  I am a bit confused about this.  The Minister states:</P>
    <P>Considerable job creation has <Col N="1866" /> resulted over the years from this investment. For example, in 1986 it is estimated that investment aid by Bord Fáilte generated in the region of 950 jobs in the construction industry alone.</P>
    <P>Is that the number of jobs created in 1986 or is it over the whole period of receiving the grant-in-aid?  That is a bit of a puzzle. If it is over the whole period they received this grant-in-aid in addition to other moneys, would 950 jobs constitute a very successful output or spin-off from the tourist?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is at present trying to deal with the question of petrol prices and I know some concessions have been made to tourism. Quite frankly, I think the Minister will have to go a little bit harder on petrol prices.  There are Irish people who like to travel around the country and they might, if the weather improves, use their cars more if the petrol prices were satisfactory, and thus spend a great deal more money in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in relation to Northern Ireland and I will tell a true story as an example.  Someone came home from England to visit me and he brought a person with him who had been suffering from a nervous breakdown.  He went to stay with a friend of his in Dublin in an area where there happened to be a lot of graffiti about supporting the Provisional IRA, etc.  This person was not used to drinking in the morning but he went out and had a few drinks.  He was sleeping in a room with a roof extension. He woke up in a panic and jumped out the window.  Fortunately he landed on the roof and jumped off the roof.  We were going around Dublin for hours trying to find him.  He was brought to Rathmines Garda station.  He woke up in the horrors because of the graffiti; he thought he was in the middle of a Provo area and that he could be attacked and he had to go back home.  That is a true story.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of truth that the Northern Ireland problem is not good for the market.  Nevertheless, British tourists, and the working class people in <Col N="1867" /> particular, who are good spenders, want to get out and about, to have a sing-song and let their hair down.  I do not think the information that the South is a safe place is getting across very strongly but I do not know if it would be counterproductive to go too hard on that line. The fact that the South of Ireland is a safe place is realised by the ordinary people in the workmen's clubs in England etc.</P>
    <P>On the question of the restaurants and food, in the package we received recently from Bord Fáilte there seems to be a stepping up of efforts to project restaurants, hotels, accommodation, etc. Overall it seems that it augurs well for international growth in the tourist industry, but there is still much left to be desired on the question of restaurants and prices in hotels.  In England, where the inflation rate is higher than here, it is possible to get meals in first class hotels very much cheaper than it is here.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister his task of bringing together a variety of interests and a variety of agencies.  That is not easy.  Nevertheless, they must be brought together, and it can be done.  Despite our small population we have a vast number of young people.  I do not want to go over the worn out statistics about the under 25s.  Despite the number of young people we have here, we are not attracting a great number of young tourists.  I do not mean to be derogatory, but a substantial number of the blue rinse brigade and older men come to us, while there is a marked absence of young people.  That is probably a result of the marketing promotion.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the benefit promoters get from conditions being made favourable for them by Bord Fáilte and their obligation to put in a little effort and to work perhaps to greater effect, which they do not always do.  The quick buck, the large profit in excess of what is really necessary to make a very good living is always at the back of the minds of many people.  They must be told emphatically that they are getting a great deal of taxpayers' money and assistance <Col N="1868" /> in many ways.  The ground is made right for them.  They must make some contribution even in the sense of not going overboard on the question of profit alone as long as they are making a good living.</P>
    <P>We do not really get the feed back on this.  You would wonder whether they are really putting forward significant information about ideas and suggestions.  For instance, the beneficiaries should begin to think about how young people can be attracted to come here.</P>
    <P>The question of off season attractions needs further examination.  Not alone should we get good value during the high season for the money the taxpayer has put into tourism, by the people concerned should come up with further ideas and suggestions on off season tourism.  Perhaps it would not be sensible to refer to the health cuts, but one must observe that there is a possibility that the health cuts could result in the hygiene regulations suffering to some extent.  Like Senator McGowan, I do not mind being wrong and this must be said in order to find out the truth.  Some premises are in a terrible state.  Many years ago when I was on a Seanad campaign I went into a certain restaurant and sat down, had the menu in my hand ready to order a meal and decided I would go to the bathroom, as the Americans say.  On the way out I happened to look into the kitchen, so I kept on walking.  I did not go back.  The hygiene regulations for public premises must be examined and I hope that they have not suffered because of the health cuts.</P>
    <P>I read recently about more layoffs in the OPW in reference to carpenters.  God forbid that the national monuments, parks etc. will be affected by this.  You cannot on the one hand make strides to develop your markets by relying on the people who are beneficiaries thereof to come up with more ideas and, on the other hand, take away the services that would attract the tourists, thereby contradicting to a great extent the information in the brochures issued by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Really the weather here is not what matters to tourists.  We must advertise <Col N="1869" /> different attractions and look for tourists other than those who seek the sun.  You cannot stop them from seeking the sun but they go for more than the sun.  They get very good value for money, and this is a key factor in whatever attractions are on offer to tourists.  Value for money is very important and it overrides the question of the weather.  An Irish person travelling abroad can do very well in other countries with a pleasant atmosphere, good entertainment etc., far more cheaply than the visitor coming here can tour the country.</P>
    <P>The incentives have been held out, but are they being lived up to?  For example, I worry a little about hotel prices.  Hotels have overheads and face many difficulties, but think of partial board at £34 a day.  Americans who may not be too wealthy may have borrowed money to look prosperous while they are here, but £34 a day per person for partial board is a substantial amount of money to working class people from England.  Perhaps many guesthouses would work out cheaper than that, but it is not always possible for people who are moving around the country to find a suitable guesthouse easily.  Some hotels have no package deal. You get bed and not breakfast, and when you have breakfast it costs a dreadful price.  It is unfortunate that for tourist purposes it could not be more uniform. The State has been the driving force under the Tourist Traffic Act since 1939. The financial assistance, the incentives, the advice, the guidelines and the marketing facilities have been there.  For some time this was not complemented by many of the beneficiaries due to overcharging and to the fact that they did not exploit a lot of the opportunities that were put their way or if they did exploit them it was in an adverse way.</P>
    <P>I am like some of the playwrights who pose a lot of problems but usually do not have the answers but I am entitled to make observations.  I do not want to get into the gimmickry area but, for example, we now have a national lottery.  When I used to travel to England the first thing I did was to buy a bond or something of that kind.  Some of the people here who <Col N="1870" /> have the nose for the quick buck might be able to come up with an idea that would encourage tourists to buy lottery tickets.  There might be some sort of a special prize for tourists or there could be a special type prize bond.</P>
    <P>The question of licensing laws should be considered again.  The insurance cover is another problem because it spins off into car hire which can be very costly. These are things which need to be considered. I wish the Minister well.  He is going about this in the right way.  I am not sure whether, down through the years, we have got the full value as regards employment out of the money which has been put into the industry on behalf of the taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I welcome the Minister, Deputy Wilson, to the House.  I assure him of our support and wish him well for his tenure of office.  To date we have been very proud of his activities in the area of tourism.  He has worked hard and worked well and the results are already there to be seen.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight the thrust of the Government's attitude to the whole area of the public finances.  They are endeavouring to get the public finances under control and that has been the biggest single issue for them.  Most people would accept that in the interests of this nation that is what they ought to be doing.  The gap between Government income and expenditure should be reduced drastically. If that comes about, then the whole economy will prosper.</P>
      <P>A second prong of the attack is a restructuring of the various Government Departments which we all hope will produce additional employment.  The Government have created a Department of the Marine which relates to all functions in regard to the sea.  I hope this will prove important in the area of fish farming and so on.  Equally, they have carried out the same exercise for horticulture, forestry, science and technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite rightly, tourism has been included in that whole area for growth and employment.  Tourism can prove <Col N="1871" /> very important in the area of new employment.  We have fallen behind in terms of growth in this area.  World tourism is a fast expanding area.  It has been suggested that in 20 or 25 years time tourism can be one of the world's largest industries, if not the largest.  The Government are correct in endeavouring to increase our revenue from tourism which will mean extra jobs and a better economy for this nation.  The tax incentives that have been suggested and the extension of the business expansion scheme will also be of huge benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Wilson, has played a major role in bringing about these new developments in tourism.  The extension of the business expansion scheme will have very beneficial effects in the area of tourism.  It is quite obvious that this Government since coming into office have stressed the importance of tourism.  They have clearly demonstrated their total commitment to the industry with the introduction of the special package of measures, which are at present in operation, with the express purpose of attracting substantial additional numbers of tourists this year.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the benefits of the business expansion scheme a company must obtain approval from Bord Fáilte for a three-year development and marketing plan which is designed clearly to increase tourist traffic and to bring in revenue from abroad.  The purpose of that would be to ensure that the qualifying companies are committed to the essential purpose for which the scheme is being extended, namely, to bring in more tourists from abroad.  That is to be welcomed. I am confident this extension of the business expansion scheme will benefit tourism in a very practical and big way.</P>
    <P>We realise there are many deterrents to tourism.  For one thing, the weather over the past number of years has not been conducive to attracting people from abroad.  We all like to get the sun while we are on holidays.  If we had for three or four months of the year the nice, fine, warm weather that other countries of the <Col N="1872" /> world have we would not need a Minister for Tourism, we would not need Bord Fáilte and we would not need to make any effort to attract tourists because they would just come to this beautiful island of ours which has so much to offer them.</P>
    <P>Another deterrent, which has been referred to by other speakers, is the North of Ireland problem.  It is not helping tourism.  Unfortunately, many people think a major war is taking place in Ireland and they feel that if they come here they will land in some war zone. Every possible effort must be made to show the people of other countries that this is not the case, that they are welcome here and that they will receive a very warm welcome.  We all have a role to play in tourism and we should extend a very warm welcome to every tourist who comes to our shores.</P>
    <P>When the Minister announced his packages the industry responded quite well.  He referred to some of the initiatives that have come from various groupings such as the Irish Caravan Council, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and so on.  One problem which occurred to me &mdash; and it is one I am dealing with at present and it was referred to by the previous speaker, Senator Harte &mdash; is the price of car rentals.  The Car Rental Council of Ireland recommended that all their members should offer 10 per cent of their national tariff for hirings of ten days duration or more.  All these initiatives are very welcome because, let us be honest, car rental is expensive.  Last night I heard about a person coming from America with four or five friends who is anxious to get a mini type van, or a transit van, for two weeks and the charge is almost £1,200.  That is a lot of money but it was suggested that the insurance and other costs contributed to this very high rental charge, and that is true.  The cost of such insurance is very expensive indeed.  I am asking the Minister in the autumn to use his good offices with the Minister for Justice to implement the Courts Bill which I think will clearly help to reduce the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to local issues. <Col N="1873" /> I did not intend to, but coming from Athlone on the banks of the River Shannon, I think I should.  The River Shannon and its lakes have tremendous potential for tourism.  Only last Sunday week my family and I went on a pleasure cruise to Lough Ree, a very enjoyable occasion but the sad reality is that there were very few boats on the lake that fine, sunny evening.  It occurred to me that if this facility was in any other country, it would be overused with cabin cruisers, rowing boats of all sizes and shapes.  I urge Bord Fáilte to continue their efforts to sell the Shannon and its lakes as a major tourist attraction, which I am convinced it is. This ought to be brought home more forcibly to tourists and, indeed, to Irish people.  I did not intend to make a long speech this evening but I felt I should make some contribution to this very important topic.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Wilson, on his great efforts to date which are contributing to a better tourism industry which, hopefully, will continue.  I repeat that we all have a role to play and, if we are to compete effectively for extra tourists on the world market, we have to pull up our socks, improve our amenities and facilities so that they are of a very high standard, equal to, if not better than, what is available elsewhere.  In any tourist exercise &mdash; and this is the main point in my contribution &mdash; we must continue, to make a major marketing drive abroad to attract tourists.  We must use every means at our disposal &mdash; the media newspapers, television and tour operators &mdash; to bring foreign tourists to our shores.  If they come once and get good service, they will come back.  The Minister knows only too well the problem facing the tourism industry.  He is committed to tourism which can make a very important contribution to our economy.  I wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  It is the first time he has taken a debate in the Seanad on which I have spoken.  I wish him well, particularly in this important area of <Col N="1874" /> tourism.  I welcome the Bill which provides for increasing the statutory limits on the total amount of grant-in-aid which may be paid out by Bord Fáilte for development purposes.  In supporting this measure I know it has potential for growth in the economy and will assist all of us in creating jobs, developing initiatives and both creating a demand for our kind of holidays and responding to trends in the tourist market.</P>
      <P>Tourism needs to be taken by the scruff of the neck and thoroughly shaken.  I despair at times when I hear some of the tired old rhetoric used to sell Ireland both here and abroad.  Have we not got the imagination and the skill to reflect modern Ireland, to sell our culture and our scenic beauty as well as modern Ireland?  Of course we have, but we must do more to improve the infrastructures, roads and telephones of that modern environment.  We have come a long way from the bog road, the rivers, mountains and the pub syndrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the tourism industry we have a vastly under-utilised resource.  It is an industry that has few restrictions, and I mean that in the context of our other main industry of agriculture, the restrictions which could be imposed by the EC and by what happens in Europe.  Perhaps a single exception would have been the restrictions on air fares which we had in the past and which I hope will be a thing of the past.  It is largely up to ourselves what we do with our tourist industry, how we market the country and how we focus on specific and different types of holidays. We must ensure that the general standards of the quality of holidays are maintained, that tourists get value for money and that where possible &mdash; and this is not always possible and certainly is not something that can be dealt with in legislation &mdash; the tourists experience the warmth and the hospitality for which this country has been renowned in the past. As a national industry, tourism directly and indirectly employs 85,000 people, earns nearly £850 million in revenue for Ireland each year and contributes just <Col N="1875" /> over £400 million in taxes.  It is a considerable industry and one that needs to be nurtured, supported and promoted.</P>
    <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to put forward points that may be helpful to the Minister, his Department and to the tourist industry in general in looking at ways to make this a more attractive place to choose for holidays than thousands of other competing areas.  Indeed, when we consider our uncertain climate in the last couple of summers, our relatively high cost of living and our high transport costs, it is a wonder that we have competed even as successfully as we have over the years.  It is regrettable that we have not made sufficient impact in mainland Europe which represents only 14 per cent of visitors from 14 to 15 countries &mdash; the total in Europe.  This has increased only from 11 per cent since 1975 despite the fact that since that time we have had closer liaisons with our neighbours in Europe through EC membership.</P>
    <P>We fall down very badly in providing personnel who can deal with non-English speaking tourists.  It amazes me that even in the higher grade hotels you will not always find basic information for instance in bedrooms, for using the telephone or for sightseeing in any language except English.  Few things can make people feel less welcome than the frustration of not being able to communicate.  Many tourists from France or Germany who do not speak any English would be in a desperate plight in the midlands or the west if unable to communicate.  It is very different from the situation of an Irish or an English speaking person in France or Germany.  We must make provision at key positions &mdash; apart from hotels &mdash; like airports and railway stations, for the employment of or access to interpreters to look after visitors from the European mainland.  We will not improve or increase our trade from Europe until we do this.</P>
    <P>Access to information is important and Bord Fáilte booklets and publications impart it very well.  All their publications set a very good example in that they are <Col N="1876" /> in English, French and German.  I would like to compliment Bord Fáilte &mdash; I know they take a lot of criticism and brickbats &mdash; for the job they have done in putting this small country on the tourist map.  A great deal of our success is due to them even if initially they have a good product to sell.  Credit must go where it is deserved.  However, the board, the Minister, his Department, local authorities and regional local interests involved in tourism cannot rest on their laurels.  A greater spur should be given to tourism and it does not all have to be of a financial order.</P>
    <P>I will mention a few matters on tourist amenities in which I have a particular interest and which should be emphasised. The last speaker, Senator Fallon, said he was reluctant to take on local issues but it is important to highlight any local issue relevant to tourism.  I am very concerned about Dublin Bay, the stretches of beach from Howth in the north down to Killiney or even further south of the city.  To swim in the waters of the bay has become an unpleasant and unhealthy exercise.  As a very keen swimmer, I get no joy whatever from raising this matter because I realise that swimming is a very enjoyable and healthy exercise and I do not want to create alarm or concern among people who like to go to the beach but there is cause for concern.  As we saw this week from newspaper reports, there is a great disparity of opinion regarding the bacteria content in the water.  I attempted to establish factual information about the suitability of the water in Dublin Bay but with little effect.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> made outlandish claims about the condition of the water.  I do not believe that that report was sufficiently substantiated but it was later counteracted by the public relations officer of Dublin Corporation, Noel Carroll, who in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i>, invited everyone in for a dip saying the water was lovely, very healthy and good for us.  I have great regard for Noel Carroll as an athlete but when he goes to Dollymount and paddles his toes to convince people that the water all around the bay is good for us, he is stretching <Col N="1877" /> credibility.  He should look at the beaches at Sandycove, Seapoint, Dun Laoghaire and Killiney on a hot day.  I used to swim all along the coast.  Indeed as a teenager I cycled 12 miles to get to Seapoint or Blackrock for a swim.  I do not expect the sea to be the same now as it was then but neither do I expect it to be as bad as it is at present.  I do not swim in the sea any longer because it is polluted and unpleasant.  I have had a skin rash even after a vigorous shower when I have had a swim in the sea.  I am not saying that one person's experience makes a scientific case about the water in Dublin Bay but I know there is grave concern amongst health conscious Dubliners, particularly parents, in that regard which is not being addressed.</P>
    <P>The issue of the bay will be acute if the heat of last weekend becomes a regular feature of the summer.</P>
    <P>In the last two summers it did not matter much as the weather was bad. Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the council responsible for that part of the coast outside, the Dún Laoghaire Corporation area are burying their heads &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; in the sand. I challenge Dublin Corporation to say how many samples they take of the water, how often and where the testing is carried out.  Are they done daily, weekly or monthly? Are they done in Dollymount, Seapoint or Dun Laoghaire?  That important information should be available so that people can make up their own minds about the risks.</P>
    <P>I contacted An Foras Forbartha to see what action they might be taking and while they were helpful I got no concrete information.  I learned that they are constantly monitoring the water quality and will have a proposal report as to what needs to be done ready and costed in two and a half years' time.  That is merely an assessment of the problem.  We will have to wait after that for a programme of action.  People were very evasive when they spoke about it and I am concerned that it should be so difficult to get information about the quality of the water when you think of the number of people who go daily to the beach and who are <Col N="1878" /> swimming in water that does not meet reasonable standards of health.  I was told that there is flotsam and jetsam in the water, that certain areas are a problem &mdash; some are better than others &mdash; but there was no hard data.  Dublin Bay is important to millions of Dubliners and tourists who realise it is on the coast and want to go for a swim, but they should be dissuaded because it would be a very offputting experience to swim at the beaches around Dublin.  It is a free recreational resource with easy access, potential for healthy exercise and relaxation and it is being allowed to deteriorate to unacceptable standards.</P>
    <P>A working party should look at the whole stretch of Dublin Bay and I suggest that it should not be confined to officials. There should be some officials but also environmentalists and conservationists to examine the facts and take remedial action not later than this year.</P>
    <P>To return in general to the developments in the tourist industry, I should like to make a few comments about one area of our tourism accommodation I consider to be outstanding, that is, the number and quality of Bed and Breakfast accommodation.  If Bord Fáilte are to be commended on anything it is the manner in which they have encouraged and supported the upgrading of bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is different, it is better, it is a form of accommodation about which people talk when one goes abroad.  Americans particularly will mention such reasonable good accommodation, food and friendliness provided by bed and breakfasts establishments which cost on average £10 per night.  The women who run these businesses are the unsung heroines of our tourist industry. They are excellent and constitute the backbone of the industry.  I am delighted at their success.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the initiatives of the Irish Caravan Council.  It has taken us far too long to realise the potential of caravaning and camping here.  Ten or 12 years ago there appeared to be a fear that if one allowed camping as a tourist or holiday amenity somehow it would destroy the countryside and would attract <Col N="1879" /> undesirable people.  I think Bord Fáilte felt at that time that campers from abroad did not spend enough money, that they all arrived with knapsacks on their backs. If one examines what happened in France one discovers that that is not the case. Campers and caravaners comprise the most certain survival species of the tourist industry in France and I am delighted to rate that there appears to be a definite policy for developing camping sites here.</P>
    <P>I am a camper.  I have camped here and many of our camping sites are as good as any to be found elsewhere.  One does not really need a Michelin Guide to go camping.  One can go to a site that is reasonably simple and well planned.  It does not have to have all the luxuries. People camping do not seek the luxuries of a Grade A hotel.  These are the kinds of areas we must examine &mdash; off the beaten track the opposite of the Spanish resort, high rise flats, pools outside balconies. That is not what Ireland is about.  Ireland is about giving people access to the countryside, giving them reasonable accommodation such as is available in bed and breakfasts accommodation.  We are only begining to realise its potential. I am very happy to welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to make on this very welcome Bill.  First, I welcome the Minister to the House on this, his first visit.  I wish him well in his important task.  Over the past couple of hours there have been many comments about our tourism industry, its regulation and management.  It has to be said that in recent years Bord Fáilte have been working in an environment which has been very hostile to the tourism industry.  They had been endeavouring to expand the industry at a time when internationally there were problems encountered <i>vis-a-vis</i> American tourists. It appeared that Americans decided Ireland was a place that should not be visited because of events which took place in countries not very far away from us.  We have encountered fluctuations in currencies and other difficulties.  We have also encountered difficulties in terms of access costs.  Added to that, the weather <Col N="1880" /> experienced over the past few years has not been good and it has not helped local tourism.  They are a number of factors that are now changing which should help development of the tourism industry in a manner that will be to the overall benefit of our economy.</P>
      <P>I might avail of this opportunity to compliment the Minister on the work he and his European counterparts have been doing attempting to have air traffic deregulated. It is unfortunate, because of a difficulty encountered between Spain and Britain, that such deregulation will not be speeded up.  I do not blame Spain for gibing at the British on the issue of landing rights in Gibraltar.  There is an historical problem attaining there.  Probably this is the first time Spain have had a chance to have a go at Great Britain and unfortunately we find ourselves in the middle.  Because of that, Aer Lingus one of the smaller airlines in Europe, is not being helped.  One of the problems that Aer Lingus has experienced in recent years is the fact that they have been confined to flights to and from European destinations without being able to pick up passengers en route or extend their area of operation.</P>
      <P>The cost of access to Ireland has decreased in recent years, competition being one of the factors involved.  In particular the emergence of Ryanair has speeded up that process.  First time in a number of years there is now competition prevailing among airlines on routes in and out of Ireland.  There was a time when there was a large number of airlines flying particularly on the transatlantic route but many pulled out when the going got tough.  Recently I read that, statistically, possibly Aer Lingus have the heaviest transatlantic traffic at present. Our tourism industry will benefit because of the fact that access costs here are becoming cheaper, that is by air and sea. The shipping companies plying the Irish Sea and to France are reducing their prices as a result of the ever-increasing competitive air fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain speakers mentioned the management and organisation of Bord Fáilte in a somewhat uncomplimentary <Col N="1881" /> manner.  There are difficulties being experienced in certain areas of their activities, but their director general, Mr. Michael McNulty, and his staff have done a very good job in difficult times.  The back-up they are receiving from the regional tourism organisations is fantastic. There has been some talk in recent months about their abolition.  That would not be a good thing because the people who work at local level in a voluntary capacity as members of regional tourism boards or on a professional basis bring local initiatives into play which have a significant effect on the provision of tourist facilities within their regions.  It is not sufficient to suggest that Bord Fáilte attract tourists to these regions and that the regional tourism organisations direct them where to go.  There have to be local initiatives which will provide entertainment for visitors, to direct them where to go or visit and to ensure that they get good value for their money.</P>
    <P>When speaking of local initiatives, I must cite the position obtaining in Kilkenny where the hotel and tourist industry have amalgamated their efforts. One can listen to radio programmes sponsored by hotels and catering establishments in Kilkenny, paid for by them. This means that on a national and international basis they are putting their money where their mouths are.  For instance, there is the provision by the South Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation &mdash; on the initiative of the local manager in Kilkenny &mdash; of a cityscope which gives the history of Kilkenny by way of sight and sound.  It has increased tourism in Kilkenny to an enormous extent.  A very simple thing like a guided walking tour which can be provided without much bother is often of as much value to somebody living in a city or town as it is to a tourist.  It is only when you go on one of these guided walking tours that you realise how many good facets of your home town or city you have missed because of your very proximity of them in everyday life.  I mention this as an indication of what can be done by local initiatives.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Alderman Mick <Col N="1882" /> McGuinness at a corporation meeting said that a plastic illuminated sign which was put up on a major shop in Kilkenny was a disgrace.  As a result of that comment there are only about seven illuminated plastic signs left in Kilkenny now and traditional shop signwriting has come back into being and traditional wood carving is very much to the fore in the shop-fronts. It is amazing the number of people who come, take pictures and are very interested in seeing what can be done without glaring Las Vagas type flashing lights.</P>
    <P>It is also important in bringing in tourists that we do not oversell.  How many people have read tourist brochures telling them of riding schools, availability of swimming pools, fishing, etc., and when they go looking for these facilities they cannot find them.  Brochures must be clear, to the point and accurate.  If we are to develop the tourist industry to the extent that it should be developed our ancient monuments and artefacts must be recognised as being of major value. We have Knowth, Tara and such places which are of significant international importance but, seemingly, are not pushed as hard abroad as they could be. Many of the ancient sights we have here are equal to if not better than any I have seen anywhere, including Egypt.  I have not seen anywhere a site as valuable as Knowth.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the fact that we are not getting young travellers into Ireland.  They are coming in and are using inter-rail tickets more and more.  The back packers who are travelling around Ireland by CIE are very welcome.  The initiative of one hotel group in providing facilities for elderly tourists has to be commended.  The Ryan Hotel Group cater for elderly tourists with specific week-ends and specific weeks and provide the type of facilities needed by this age group.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The hotel <i>versus</i> bed and breakfast <i>versus</i> farm house or guest house argument can go on and on.  There are excellent hotels providing excellent service, as there are excellent farmhouses and guesthouses.  If we look at the international <Col N="1883" /> prices for hotels, we have in Ireland hotels which are of international status but are much cheaper than those of a similar nature abroad.  Unfortunately when people compare prices they look at the highest price charged by hotels here and compare this with hotels which are not similar in nature and which are lower in grade.  I suggest that when people are comparing hotel prices here with hotel prices abroad they should compare like with like.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry is a base industry. It is third in terms of money generation in our economy.  The employment content in it is extremely important to the economy and can be built on.  The very fact that the CERT hotel training courses have been so successful is an indication of the value in terms of placement of students.  Over the past few years CERT trainees have invariably been able to get jobs, whereas trainees from other training establishments have not been able to do so.  There is a problem in our tourism industry as between home tourism and foreign tourism.  There is no doubt that because of the initiatives of the Minister, which have been backed up by many organisations, we have been successful in attracting more and more tourists.  As time goes on more tourists will come.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that an attempt is now being made to get petrol prices down to a reasonable level.  It has to be said the problem is that the international companies are creaming off the profits here. People suggest that garages are earning too much from the sale of petrol but they do not look at the throughput.  The volume is not there and therefore, the profit is not there.  Any attempt to curb petrol prices should be made at the supplier end and not at the garage end.</P>
    <P>Seaside resorts are having a difficult year because of the short season.  Many of the seaside resort hotels are family run, family owned and family managed and there is no doubt that they need special attention.  However, they, too, should be able to use their own initiatives. The very successful seaside resort hotels <Col N="1884" /> have had to develop facilities which provide amusement for people even if the weather is not of the best.  The hotels which have the highest occupancy for home tourism are the ones which continually provide these facilities. However, if business is not good for a few years, unless they get substantial grant-aid to change their method of attracting visitors they will be unable to do so.</P>
    <P>Convention business is ideally suited to Ireland.  Our country is not a sun seeker's paradise but it can be attractive to a broad range of people.  Recently the Minister was in Kilkenny to show the initiatives that can be taken at local level and suggest that regional and local managers should take an interest in the place in which they are working.  We had a convention in Kilkenny on Irish origins and had over 50 people from Australia and New Zealand in Kilkenny for one week. The went back with a better idea of modern Ireland and what it has to offer. Sun is not the be all and end all of holidays. We do not have enough of it but without sun we can produce a holiday package for the majority of people who want a varied and interesting holiday.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the excellent initiatives he has taken over the past number of months and I sincerely hope that, with the help of everybody in the tourism industry, they will continue. Mention was made of dirt in public places and where tourists tend to gather.  There is an increasing awareness that hygiene is of primary importance in attracting people into pubs, hotels and guesthouses. Litter was a major problem in the past but initiatives have been taken at local level and the situation is not as bad as it was.</P>
    <P>The Bill has given people an opportunity to address themselves to one of our major industries.  It will give Bord Fáilte the grant-aid they need for the coming years and I sincerely hope the industry will respond to the Minister and that the board will respond to the industry and to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to associate myself <Col N="1885" /> with the welcome that everybody else has conveyed to the Minister lest I appear in any way to be rude to him.  I wish him well because it is a difficult time to be in Government.  However, that is not to say we would not all wish to share his difficult burden if we had the opportunity.  Within the general philosophical approach that dominates the approach to tourism what the Minister has done is welcome but whether it is the right way to approach fundamentally the question of developing tourism, and whether we have addressed ourselves and our contradictory views and attitudes is another matter.</P>
      <P>Tourism, and the discussion of tourism, has probably generated more clichés and more waffle than even agriculture has generated, and that is saying something. Much of it has at its root extraordinary uncertainties about why people come here, what they want when they come here and how we should best go about providing what they want.  We have not yet really addressed in full what people come here for or what we think they come here for because there are different kinds of tourism.  The Mediterranean countries are seen primarily as tourist countries for sea, sand and perhaps other things as well.  Countries, such as Switzerland, on the other hand have a quality of environment and certain opportunities in the area of winter sports.  There is also the sick sort of tourism in places like Bangkok such as child sex tourism, which is one of the most rapidly growing areas of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the spectrum of the kinds of tourism one can have we cannot sit back and wait for something to happen.  It is up to us to realise what people want and, more particularly, what kind of tourism we want ourselves.  I do not think we want the sort of tourism which has every decent piece of beach along our coastline absolutely saturated by large vulgar Costa de Sol type hotels.  That is not what we want and it is not what the Irish people want.  Given the choice, we would regard that as too high a price to pay for large amounts of tourists revenue.  We have to go more deeply into it.  We should not, <Col N="1886" /> see Ireland as a playground for good hunting, fishing, shooting and so on, similar to what people can have in their own countries but perhaps in a slightly different and more pleasant environment.  Our future does not lie in encouraging huge numbers of huntsmen from the Continent to come here and have a great time shooting the wildlife that our own gun clubs have worked very hard to preserve.  That is not what we want.</P>
    <P>At the centre of the tourist industry is ourselves.  It is we, the Irish people, who makes this country an attractive place to visit &mdash; our values, our attitude, our identity, our heritage and the environment we have the good fortune to live in.  Many of the things that happen peripheral to the tourist industry and even directly within the tourist industry which are thought to be good ideas very often are direct attacks on the qualities that appeal to tourists.  I have a long list of items that need to be discussed.</P>
    <P>Development and increasing affluence in many tourist areas seem to have motivated many of those who have benefitted financially from tourism into the construction of mini-Southforks in our most attractive rural and tourist areas.  These are large vulgar piles which masquerade as houses and which desecrate the environments in which they are built.  On the road as Gaillimh go dtí An Spidéal there are huge numbers of houses on the seaward side of the road which has desecrated the visual amenity of that area. Those houses were built because people choose to ignore good planning, good development philosophy, etc. and they are an affront to the environment.</P>
    <P>When I go into a Gaeltacht pub and am assaulted by a juke box in a corner playing identical music to that which a tourist can hear in any country in the world, I have to wonder whether those who hope to make a living out of tourism are aware of what distinguishes this country from other countries.  We will not get large numbers of discriminating tourists to come here by giving them exactly the same services, the same environment and the same culture they can get in any other country.  I have a strange feeling that <Col N="1887" /> many of those involved in our tourism industry, having noted that we are different, have extraordinary poor taste in terms of deciding the qualities that are different in this country.  They allow, for instance, probably the worst traditional band in the country, the Wolfe Tones, to masquerade as the image of Irish traditional music.  They are a band who can neither sing nor play and they have the capacity to exploit Northern sufferings to their own financial benefit.</P>
    <P>There is also the extraordinary spectacle that unfortunately characterises large areas of the west where second-rate country and western music masquerades as culture.  This is an offence to people who come to this country to find something different.  What is good about this country is what is different about this country &mdash; it is not what makes us the same as every other country but what makes us different.  Even within the ranks of Bord Fáilte there is a certain apology for the fact that we are different, for example, the sort of mid-Atlantic presentation of their home holidays campaign on television, Mid-Atlantic people with mid-Atlantic attitudes and quite obvious mid-Atlantic values have very little to do with the uniqueness, the values, qualities and identity of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make reference again to groups in the fashion that I have just done so.  I am referring to our sense of our own identity.  Our sense of our own identity is not just cultural; it is not just the Irish language although that is part of it.  It is not our traditional music, although that is part of it.  It is a sense of our being at one with the country we live in and that goes through all sorts of things.  As I have said, it goes through our attitudes to ourselves, to the country we live in, to the environment we live in, to the values we have and to the way we respond to other people.  It is reflected in our identity, and in our heritage, and I have said enough about that.  It is <Col N="1888" /> reflected in our lifestyle and in our environment. That is what we have to sell if we want to create a real tourist industry, not artifical add-ons which are a kind of a compromise between this country's uniqueness and the plastic identikit tourist hotels that are springing up in other areas.  We are a unique country, with unique values, and we will not succeed in tourism by pretending we are the same as everywhere else.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the appalling state of our capital city which Senator Fennell referred to also.  It is beyond me how Dublin can masquarade as a tourist centre in its present state, with rotten, collapsed, derelict buildings and ugly office blocks, most of which have been constructed either by State bodies or bodies that are directly funded by the State.  Likewise, all over rural Ireland there are houses springing up in areas mostly as a consequence of section 4 decisions.  The same amadans who introduced the section 4 decisions are the ones who proceed to lament the collapse of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>If we are going to sell ourselves, our uniqueness and our environment, it is up to us to protect and appreciate that environment, to advance it and to underpin it.  The idea that a kind of a mid-European or mid-Atlantic nightlife, of the vulgar kind that is visible in, say, Killarney in the mid-tourist season is going to attract huge numbers of international tourists is a contradiction in itself.  It is a contradiction philosophically and in business terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the electorate as amadáns, I am reflecting on those people who bring in section 4 decisions which allow houses to be built in areas of prime visual amenity and then fail to understand the connection between that and the lack of tourism.  It <Col N="1889" /> is not meant to be a generalisation.  I have a considerable respect for the electorate. I have very little respect for those who persistently flout good planning and good environmental thinking in order to achieve some short-term political gain.  I would regard Members of this House who do that as amadáns, I would regard myself as an amadán if I did it but, if the word gives offence, I am sorry, I did not intend it to give offence or to apply collectively to all county councillors but simply to those who fail to distinguish between the short term consequences and the long term consequences of their own decisions.</P>
      <P>This country has a way of developing a successful tourist industry.  In terms of developing a successful tourist industry, the first thing we must have is a product. I think I have elaborated enough on the product.  The product is us, the way we are.  We must be very careful in terms of developing ourselves not to lose us, the way we are.  It is regrettable that there are many signs that we are losing that sense of ourselves, the way we are.  If you travel around many of the major tourist regions of the country, you will find more and more barbed wire around more and more fences, saying &ldquo;no camping allowed here&rdquo; and &ldquo;trespassers will be prosecuted&rdquo; and so on.  There seems to be a reluctance to accommodate tourists in a way that, perhaps, did not exist some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming we can straighten out the product, and I am not sure yet that we can, because we do not seem to take our planning, our environment or any of those things seriously enough yet, the second part is the job of selling and developing that product.  This is where some of the major contradictions in what he said developed.  Everybody apparently agrees that there is a huge potential for job creation in tourism.  It is fairly sensible economics to presume that, if there is a huge potential in job creation, there must be a huge potential for wealth creation. I cannot understand, if everybody agrees that there is a huge potential for wealth creation &mdash; not necessarily for <Col N="1890" /> wealth creation but for drawing in wealth through tourism &mdash; why we are perpetually hearing about the need to create more incentives, to give more grants, to make more generous tax allowances available.  We heard that VAT rates in hotels were far too high.  They were reduced and I did not notice a dramatic increase in tourist numbers.  We heard that VAT rates in restaurants were too high.  They were reduced and I did not hear of any huge expansion in the whole catering area.  We hear now and have heard for years that the cost of access to Ireland was a huge deterrent to tourists. That has now dropped dramatically and we still have not heard or seen any sign of a dramatic increase in the number of tourists.</P>
    <P>I am not sure &mdash; and I do not mean to be in any way offensive to anybody &mdash; that we have yet satisfied ourselves that we have the quality of management, the quality of leadership, the quality of enterprise in the tourist industry that can capitalise on opportunities.  The industry seems to be, along with agriculture, one of the two which spends most of its time demanding more and more by way of State aid while, at the same time, wearing its other hat &mdash; the one which preaches loudest about the values of the enterprise economy &mdash; suggests that perhaps there is too much reliance on the State in the industry and too little willingness to do that which ought to characterise entrepreneurs which is to take risks which, when they are successful, ought to be properly rewarded.  There is a case to be made for the valid point which has been made frequently that perhaps tourism ought to be treated for taxation purposes in a similar way to manufacturing industry. The consequence of that ought to be the virtual elimination of most of the grants towards the development of the tourist industry, so that those who are successful will be rewarded by their success and will not need the State to hold their hands.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I have a peculiar view about Bord Fáilte.  I cannot understand why, on the one hand, Bord Bainne has to be run by the industry itself, but Bord <Col N="1891" /> Fáilte is financed by the State.  If tourism has such a huge potential for growth and if there are so many people with the capacity to develop tourism the least they could do is take on the job of marketing and developing their own industry themselves, instead of relying on the State by and large to do it.  There is a strong case to be made for turning the whole operation of Bord Fáilte into an industry cooperative modelled on Bord Bainne rather than into a State agency being funded directly by the State.  You cannot have it both ways.  If tourism is the sort of industry that is going to rely on the enterprise mentality for development, then the driving force for tourism development ought to be under the control of those who have that kind of mentality; if not, then perhaps the State should take a far more direct role in the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will repeat what I said at the beginning.  At the centre of our tourist industry are ourselves, our culture, our identity and our values.  At the centre of that are our faith and our belief in that culture, identity and values.  That means a sensitivity in tourist areas to preserving that uniqueness and to understanding that whether people necessarily come and talk about it or not, what they want is something different.  The more we try to make ourselves the same as where they came from, the less interested they will be in us.  The extreme examples I talk about are Radio 2 blaring out of coffee shops in Gaeltacht areas but there are different degrees of this in evidence in most of our large tourist areas.  The sunset strip vision of some of our big tourist towns is nothing to advertise, nothing to sell and nothing to appeal to the sort of tourists to whom we should be appealing.</P>
    <P>If we get the product right, then there is the question of selling it and that requires all the attributes of any good selling job.  It means advertising and it means also, quality of delivery of the product.  They are the sort of qualities that we, as a people, are supposed to have.  We are supposed to be friendly, <Col N="1892" /> considerate and thoughtful.  The tragedy is that more and more people are saying that, in many areas where they encounter the Irish tourist industry, they do not meet those qualities.  They are the qualities that will develop a unique tourist industry, which is the only sort of one we can develop.  We cannot develop one which is a mirror image of somewhere else, because there is nowhere else that is any way like this country.</P>

      <P>I dtús ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht é bheith ceaptha mar urlabhraí turasóireachta.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an-obair déanta aige ó ainmníodh é agus go deimhin go bhfuil toil aige dul ar aghaidh agus turasóireacht a chur chun cinn, rud nach ndearnadh le blianta fada anuas.</P>
      <P>Mar dhuine as an nGaeltacht mé féin labhróidh mé, b'fhéidir, go háitiúil faoi na deacrachtaí atá againn maidir le tuarasóireacht. Go hiondúil bíonn iarthar na tíre, is é sin iarthar na Gaillimhe, ag plé le bord turasóireachta an iarthair féin i nGaillimh a bhfuil baint ag Bord Fáilte leo.  I mo thuairimse níl na Gaeltachtaí ar fud na tíre ag fáil cothrom na Féinne ó na boird áirithe seo, mar tá mé ag ceapadh nach bhfuil an meon ná an toil acu an cúnamh a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht maidir le turasóireacht.</P>
      <P>Go hiondúil tá na Gaeltachtaí uilig le taobh na fairige má thógann tú Gaillimh, Maigh Eo, Dún na nGall, Ciarraí agus Port Láirge, cé go bhfuil Corcaigh freisin agus Gaeltacht Chontae na Mí istigh i lár na tíre cé gur bunús de mhuintir Chonamara atá ann.  Chuir Údarás na Gaeltachta moltaí ar aghaidh, tá mé ag ceapadh dhá bhliain ó shin chuig Aire na Gaeltachta chun cead a thabhairt don Údarás dul i bhfeighil cúrsaí turasóireachta sa Ghaeltacht. Iarraim ar an Aire an mbeadh sé féin in ann casadh le Aire na Gaeltachta agus an cheist seo a phlé chun a chinntiú go bhfaighidh na Gaeltachtaí cothrom na Féinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má thógann tú na háiseanna atá sna Gaeltachtaí, go mór mhór i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe &mdash; tá na hoileáin ann amach ón chósta, Oileáin Árainn, áit a dtéann <Col N="1893" /> na mílte daoine gach bliain ó Ros a'Mhíl agus ó Ghaillimh.  Tá seirbhísí á gcur ar fáil ansin faoi láthair ag daoine príobháideacha as Ros a'Mhíl, ag éirigh réasúnta maith leo cuid mhaith den am, go hiondúil ag brath ar an aimsir.  Go mór mhór na daoine anseo, daoine ón Fhrainc agus as na Stáit Aontaithe, is daoine iad sin a bhfuil suim faoi leith acu sna hoileáin mar gheall ar go gceapann siad go bhfuil siad thar a bheith iargúlta.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh scannán anuraidh ann &mdash; bhí Bobby Ewing ann as na Stáit Aontaithe. D'imigh siad as Ros a'Mhíl go dtí na hoileáin agus chaith siad seachtain ann. Cuireadh an scannán seo ar fud na Stát Aontaithe, agus i mbliain tá sé le feiceáil go bhfuil na céadta Meiriceánaigh ag teacht isteach.  Ceapaim féin gur féidir an bolscaireacht atá ag teastáil le haghaidh daoine a mhealladh isteach a fháil tríd a leithéid de scannán a thaispeáint.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh tú an Ghaeltacht a chur i gcomparáid leis an Ghalltacht mar ní hé an meon céanna a bheadh in iarthar nó i ndeisceart Chonamara agus a bheadh i dtuaisceart Chonamara.  I dtuaisceart Chonamara tá, b'fhéidir, suas le 15 d'ostán ann.  I ndeisceart Chonamara, áit a bhfuil tú sa Ghaeltacht, níl ann ach ceann amháin.  Crothaíonn sé sin an rud a bhfuil mé ag caint faoi, nach raibh cothrom na Féinne á fháil ag na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor cainte déanta faoi aerphoirt sa díospóireacht seo, agus caithfidh mé a rá gur maith ann Aerphort Chnoc Mhuire ag an am seo.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfeicfidh muintir Mhaigh Eo toradh na hoibre seo, go bhfuil na mílte ag teacht isteach, agus an rud céanna nuair a bheas an t-aerphort i nGaillimh faoi lán seol, go mbeidh na daoine ag teacht isteach chun cuairt a thabhairt ar an gceantar.</P>
    <P>Tá caint déanta faoi chúrsaí tránna, an salachar atá orthu.  Cuireann rud amháin imní orm ag an am seo, mar go bhfuil na tránna is deise agus is glaine ar fud na hEorpa sna ceantair in iarthar na hÉireann. Rud amháin a chaithfimid bolathrú amach chuige ná go bhfuil tionscal mór ar bun ansin maidir le feilméireacht éisc. Iarraim ar an Aire go ndéanfadh Roinn na Mara, a bheas ag plé le seo anois, <Col N="1894" /> a chinntiú nach mbeidh an salachar a thogann ó na feilmeacha seo ag dul isteach ar na tránna, mar tá contúirt ann go mbeidh truailliú an-dona ann agus go bhfágfaidh sé na tránna i ndroch chaoi ionas nach mbeidh aon turasóireacht ann.</P>
    <P>Sna Gaeltachtaí féin luadh an chaoi maidir le cultúr.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liomsa, tá an cultúr go láidir fós sna Gaeltachtaí ach tá an brú isteach ag teacht maidir le ceol nach ceol Gaelach é.  Cloisimid gearáin go minic ó dhaoine a thógann isteach ó tíortha thar lear, nuair a théann siad amach chun na Gaeltachtaí nach bhfuil an ceol Gaelach le fáil chomh flúirseach agus ar mhaith leo.</P>
    <P>Bíonn go leor féilte ann maidir le rásaí curacha.  Tagann go leor foirne isteach ó na Stáit Aontaithe &mdash; ó Nua Eabhrach, ó Boston agus mar sin de.  Tagann siad ar ais chuig na féilte seo chuile bhliain chun páirt a thógáil iontu.  Chomh maith le sin, maidir leis na rásaí báid seoil, fiú's chuaigh cuid acu treasna an Atlantach chomh fada leis na Stáit Aontaithe anuraidh. Taispeánann sé go bhfuil cineál athbheochana déanta ar an chultúr seo, rud a bhí ag fáil bháis le blianta anuas.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Seanadóir Ryan ag caint faoi easpa pleanála sa Ghaeltacht, cuir i gcás an Spidéal.  Ní fheicim san Teach é faoi láthair.  Níor mhaith liom go ndéarfadh éinne sa Teach seo gur amadáin iad na daoine a chuir ar aghaidh section 4s. Tógaim é sin mar mhasla, agus is trua nár fhan an Seanadóir go dtabharfainn freagra air.</P>
    <P>I take exception to what Senator Ryan said regarding the movement of section 4s in county councils especially on the west coast and possibly Galway.  It is quite easy for professors such as he who live in a very snug environment.  At the least people of the area should be able to live where they want to live and not be pushed up into the mountains where some of our planners would love to see them.  I take exception to that remark and I ask him to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister to the Seanad and I wish him well.  He has a tough job before him.  Like other members of my <Col N="1895" /> party I support the increased grant-aid to Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte had a great many problems which have been eased a bit recently.  Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus were at each other's throats.  We realised that when they came before the Joint Committee on Small Business.  The trouble was that Aer Lingus fares were so high that it was very difficult for Bord Fáilte or anybody else involved in tourism to bring people into Ireland.  The Minister in the last Government gave a licence to Avair, Ryanair and Club Air and the present Minister gave a licence to Virgin Airways.  This made Aer Lingus sit up for the first time.  When Ryanair introduced their service Aer Lingus offered a cheap fare but they were not prepared to carry people.  I had many complaints from people who paid the £79 fare to England and could not get back.  The ticket was valid for 14 days.  You could not pre-book. You reported into the office every day but you could not get back.  I had that out with Aer Lingus.  Before the collapse of the last Government I had arranged that the Committee of Public Accounts would hear the case.  Aer Lingus refused to go on Radio Éireann with me, and I would not go on radio without them.  However they went on air and made their statement.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus have done more damage to tourism in Ireland than anybody else. They had a monopoly in the charter flight business, but I do not know how they acquired it.  I can instance cases where Aer Lingus blocked charters from France to Ireland, bound for Killarney, which were due in every week for three months during the off tourist season.  The travel agent, Mr. O'Reilly, a Cavan man, brought them in by boat.  He succeeded in breaking that monopoly.  The Minister is on the right lines regarding tourism. He made certain changes and he will do more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister on the radio one morning when he said that the price of car hire in Ireland was too high.  As somebody who is involved in car hire I could not agree more with the Minister but the reason is that this Government, <Col N="1896" /> the last Government and all the previous Governments taxed cars so much that you now pay £10,000 for a car on this side of the Border which would cost £6,000 on the other side of the Border.  Where we are really losing out &mdash; and I would like the Minister to take note of this&mdash; is known in the trade as backtracking. People coming from the UK to Ireland for their holidays are hiring cars in the North and if they are hired from the bigger companies the hirers can leave them in Dublin on their way back and they will be collected.  That arrangement applies to them as it applies to the car hire people here.</P>
    <P>Various Ministers for Industry and Commerce were unable to do anything with the insurance companies.  For car hire we take out what is known as block insurance.  Anybody who qualifies with licence, age, etc. can hire a car for a week, a fortnight or any period they wish. The peak season in Ireland is about 20 weeks for the car hire people and we have to pay £1,000 in insurance for a car for the 20 weeks.  We have insurance for the whole year but we have no use for the car for the rest of the year, and we get no refund from the insurance companies. That is for third party insurance with liability for the first £50 of the cost of every accident.  Put that against the North where the people have full comprehensive insurance for £200.  How could we compare?  The Minister is quite right.  Prices are too high and people will not hire the cars here.  We were running a fleet of 50 cars up to about two years ago.  Then prices started to escalate and now we are down to ten cars.  For July and August we do a little extra business. Now we are leasing cars to other car hire people.</P>
    <P>I was very glad Senator Lanigan raised the matter of the price of petrol here.  He pointed out that the price of petrol was not the responsibility of the garages.  By ordinary standards the garages' margin would be a reasonable one, but petrol companies have promotions which are costing the dealers 3¼ per gallon.  Then we have credit cards which can cost 6p <Col N="1897" /> per gallon for Visa and 7p for Access.  I will not try to cod the Minister by saying all our petrol sales are through credit cards; they are not.  Credit card sales in our business, which runs around 7,000 gallons a week, are 1 per cent of the turnover which takes 2½ per gallon from us.  Therefore, add the cost of the promotion, the cost of credit cards and evaporation &mdash; which accounts for 1 per cent and for which the company gives no refund &mdash; another 2½p, and that brings us to 10p on a gallon of petrol.  It has been stated that in the North and in the UK it varies between 9p and 12p per gallon, but the throughput in this country per petrol station is less than half of what it is in the UK and the North and we would have to sell twice as much petrol to reach their profit.  Therefore, there is a big difficulty and I would like the Minister to examine it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is dealing with the price of petrol at the moment.  Perhaps if the price of petrol was reduced that would be of some help to car hire people.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister for Finance in the debate on the Finance Bill in regard to the business expansion scheme and perhaps the Minister here will use his good offices with the Minister for Finance to achieve what I could not. For some unknown reason car hire is exempted from the business expansion scheme.  That scheme would have been helpful to the car hire business and would have helped to reduce costs, as the Minister mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said traffic into Dublin Airport in June was up by 30,000 in Shannon by 5,000 and in Cork by 4,000.  This was music in my ears because I fought for a number of years at every level the high cost of air travel into this country. Air fares are down this year compared with last year, and this is a good thing. However, I have received a number of reports that the hotel industry are under-booked this year and that the figures are down compared with last year.  I am merely putting this to the Minister.  I have no facts to go on other than what I have heard.  If I am wrong in what I say I hope the Minister will correct me and if I am <Col N="1898" /> right that he will give some explanation for it.  If that is the position what is wrong?</P>
    <P>Other people are waiting to talk and the day is proceeding so I will delay no further.  I have put those points to the Minister and I would like his comments at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief and I will confine myself to a few remarks which I hope the Minister will find helpful and positive.  Like other Members, I welcome the Minister to this debate.  He is well known in my part of the country.  He has a reputation for being as good a friend of Meath as of Cavan except in the days of his football career when he was a formidable opponent.  I offer him my best wishes.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Minister has a great difficulty because, as Senator Daly said, many areas impinge on and influence tourism and the Minister has no control over them.  Nevertheless he has made great strides in the short time he has been in office.  The crash programme which he introduced on 3 May has been very successful and, even though sceptics may question the result, I think it stands up to examination.  The Minister has given us the statistics.  There is a very simple yardstick by which I judge the tourist industry in my part of the country.  On summer mornings when I go out on to the street I see cars travelling towards Cavan, to the lakes principally, with fishing gear on the racks.  Some years ago we had a very heavy flow of traffic, which I am glad to say is coming back.  Of course, nobody is satisfied but we hope to regain the stage which we reached some years ago.  Cavan has grant fishing potential. Senator Daly spoke about Killarney and the beauties of Kerry, and Kerry being the Mecca, as indeed it is.  One thing that was brought home to me in the recent Seanad campaign when I travelled from Cavan to Donegal was the sheer beauty of the area north west of Cavan and I am sure the Minister will agree with me that it is second to none.  I think it would be in the area described by the planners as &ldquo;sublime&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> Senator Lanigan referred to the situation with regard to national monuments compared it to that which obtains in Egypt.  We have a very long way to go in this regard.  The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill which we passed last year will be a great help in a negative sort of way.  There is a big area to be made up on the positive side.  I am a member of the Meath County Council National Monuments Advisory Committee and last Monday week we met on the Hill of Tara, a very historic place.  Unfortunately, Tara is very badly catered for. There is a very small car park there. There is a very small refuse bin which is apparently seldom emptied.  There are no signs there for visitors.  It must be a total anti-climax to people who come from different parts of this country to visit Tara.  They see there a hill with a statue of St. Patrick that is in a rather poor state and should be replaced.  I am sure nothing could follow but complete disappointment. That situation obtains all over and that is unfortunate.  In this area we are losing out as regards tourists.</P>
    <P>There was a meeting of the General Council of County Councils in Ballybunion on 19 June and I am sure the Minister is well aware of what was discussed at that meeting.  Very many people there felt that private concerns and private business could contribute far more to tourism.  Concern was expressed that they should be allowed and encouraged to make a contribution and I agree with this.  I read in today's <i>The Irish Press</i> under the heading, &ldquo;Tidy Towns to go Private&rdquo; that Bord Fáilte are seeking private sponsorship from the business world for the national tidy towns competition and other tourist promotion schemes and I welcome this.  A US-based multinational company have been asked to sponsor this year's tourism on wheels awards.  Sponsorship is also being sought for hotels and restaurants awards, national roadside gardens awards and the award of excellence for local authorities. I welcome this as it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The local authorities and the regional <Col N="1900" /> tourism boards have been very active. There are 56 of them in all and they have provided significant funds in the tourist area.  Lough Sheelin was mentioned at the conference in Ballybunion as an example of what we should not be doing. I am sure the Minister is very concerned about that and I am also.  Lough Sheelin is not very far from where I live.  At the same time the members did not advocate that Ireland should be an environmental museum.  In many areas we have gone too far and we are now redressing this imbalance.</P>
    <P>Some things are done by local authorities which hinder tourism.  The town dump in an open location at the edge of a town, for example, is no help in attracting tourists.  Ribbon development was referred to by Senator Ryan and by Senator O'Connor.  Ribbon development is a very big question and I referred to it in my contribution on the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill.  I do not think this is an appropriate place to develop it any further.  There are more things to be considered than Senator Ryan alluded to. This is not the first instance of ribbon development.  If we look at the ordnance survey sheets for the pre-Famine period we see there was ribbon development of a worse kind with hovels and shebeens along the roadside and they did not have a half acre site, septic tanks or many other amenities.  I am not condoning what was done but the public representatives who resorted to section 4 did so in many instances to overcome bureaucracy. Ribbon development is a big question.  I do not think it would be appropriate to develop it at this stage but there are many aspects to be considered.  We have certainly made mistakes and these are being taken care of now.  It is only right that we should learn from our mistakes.</P>
    <P>Local authorities tend to provide picnic areas and carparks but they do not maintain them.  This was very obvious on the Hill of Tara, as I mentioned.  A full refuse bin had been turned over.  It is important to maintain those areas properly.  Public toilets are not always maintained and there is poor sign posting.  That is one of the biggest complaints.  It was felt by <Col N="1901" /> those who contributed to that meeting in Kerry that we should be promoting our flora and fauna.  We have a cultural gold mine.  Hill climbing is one possibility, as has been mentioned already.  Others are painting, angling, surfing and the local friendly pub, although Senator Fennell was not very enthusiastic about that aspect.  Perhaps I misunderstood her but the local friendly pub has a fairly important part to play.  Something should be done about litter and dumping.  The poor quality of some restaurants was referred to as was access to archaeological sites and monuments, county museums and display centres.  We could have more of these such as the one in Kilfenora which is highly successful and very helpful for those who wish to visit the Burren.</P>
    <P>We should promote the use of public libraries as local history repositories, keep litter bins empty, remove graffiti, maintain street furniture and improve derelict sites.  I referred to this before. The last Government promised to introduce a Bill to tax derelict sites but unfortunately this was not done.  Perhaps the present Government would take this in hand and see what can be done.  Special weekends could be arranged for cultural or other ends outside the tourism season. The emphasis at the meeting was that local authority members, rather than criticising Bord Fáilte, should be doing whatever possible with local authority funds.  There are considerable funds. There is no budget specifically for tourism but much can be done by local authorities out of their own environmental funds.  I am sure the Minister will promote that idea.</P>
    <P>The weather has been referred to and perhaps we make too much of an issue of it.  It is important that we have indoor facilities for tourists.  The Minister does not have the control over that area but I am sure in the broad spectrum it is something that we should take into consideration.</P>
    <P>Some of our roads are in a bad condition. I am glad to note the great improvement in county roads but I will raise one matter with regard to roads which I have raised on other occasions.  I <Col N="1902" /> am sure the Minister will agree that, by and large, the road from the northern part of Donegal through Cavan town, Kells, Navan, Dunshaughlin, to Clonee is a perfect road.  Then we suddenly come to a three mile bottleneck.  I cannot understand the planners who allowed this to happen.  I understood that this road was to be improved last year and I hope it will be done before too long.  It is very difficult to understand why the part of the road that should be the best, the part within the Dublin County Council area, is a narrow, bending road without a grass margin on one side.  It inconveniences everybody who uses this road, particularly in the mornings.  I ask the Minister to do whatever he can to see that this area of the road is improved.</P>
    <P>Display centres are very important for tourism.  We should be able to get school children, or those who have left school, to act as summer guides, giving them reasonable pay.  Apparently this is not possible under the existing schemes and something should be done about it because guides are very important.  It is extraordinary when you go to the Hill of Tara and see so many visitors looking for help or guidance which is not available. In a situation like that there should be a display centre, not alone for that area but for the surrounding areas as well.</P>
    <P>Hotels, motels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation have been referred to, and I have nothing but the highest praise for them.  In my Seanad campaign, no matter where I visited, I found prices were reasonable and the service excellent.  It is felt in certain quarters that we do not have enough guesthouses and perhaps the Minister would look at that.  I regret what is happening in Dublin Bay.  I referred to this before.  The subject of a ship dumping raw sewage in Dublin Bay twice weekly was discussed at some length and while there may not be any direct danger to health, that is totally unacceptable.  This is outside the Minister's remit but it has been referred to and I just mentioned it in passing.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to pay tribute to Bord Fáilte.  They do a marvellous job although <Col N="1903" /> on occasion there are justifiable complaints. I spent my holidays in the Burren three years ago and one day I arrived in Galway to cross to Inis Mór on the ferry. I was an hour late because the brochure I got applied to the previous year.  I suppose this is one of the things that happen, and it was no great inconvenience to me, but it should never have happened.</P>
    <P>This year Bord Fáilte have prepared more than 140 separate brochures ranging from the full colour promotional brochures in 11 languages for use abroad to county guides and information on individual products.  For example, accommodation, angling, golf, etc. for use by both visitors and Irish people while on holiday here.  All these booklets are printed in Ireland.  Bord Fáilte do a very good job and I compliment them.  Once again, I wish the Minister well and I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I would like to welcome the Minister to the House to wish him well in his office as Minister for Tourism and Transport and to pay tribute to some of the things he has introduced in the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1987.  Lest the record should not show it, he is not the first Minister to take tourism seriously.  Deputy Bruton was the first Minister and the Coalition Government were the first Government to publish a White Paper on tourism to open a wideranging debate on tourism in these Houses.  I wish the Minister well in continuing Deputy Bruton's work.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately I did not hear all of Senator McGowan's contribution because I had to leave the House temporarily to seek a report on the environment produced by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.  It was not in our Library, and I cannot understand why. Its Chairman was David Kennedy, chief executive of Aer Lingus.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation therefore commissioned a study by environmental experts to identify the problems and needs of the <Col N="1904" /> environment today.  That study, &ldquo;Tourism and the Physical Environment&rdquo;, was carried out by Reid McHugh and Partners, Planning and Development Consultants, and this report is based on the findings of that study.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that our environment needs protecting, and there is absolutley no doubt that we, as a people, need awakening to the value of our environment, maintaining it and keeping it.  I will quote further from the report &ldquo;Chapter 2, Issues in the Rural Environment&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>In scenic counties such as Kerry, Galway and Donegal, the spread of bungalow blight &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I presume this is a play on the term bungalow bliss and some Senators may recall that this got some publicity over two, three or four days in the press, on radio and on television,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash; has been facilitated by councillors through widespread abuse of &ldquo;section IV&rdquo; procedure.  Last November, for example, there were over 70 such motions on the agenda of Donegal County Council &mdash; the vast bulk of them seeking planning permission for bungalows in the countryside.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to write this into the record before I correct the statistics, because I took the trouble of going to Donegal County Council, of which I am a member, getting out their agenda of the 2 November meeting, and looking at the section 4 motions.  There were over 70 such motions but not one had anything to do with giving planning permission for bungalows anywhere in Donegal.  The only section 4 application that had anything to do with planning on the day was in the name of my colleague, councillor McGowan and it dealt with a customs and excise depot.  I am sure he will recall that.  Not one other section 4 application was to do with bungalows or planning permission.  I did not mention this specifically today just because of the reference by Senator Ryan.  The Irish Tourist Confederation produced this <Col N="1905" /> document.  They circulated it to people all over the country, they employed a team of accountants called Reid McHugh and Partners to do a study and bring in this report, and yet they could err so much in that one statistic alone &mdash; of which there is documentary proof which can be got simply by looking at the agenda of that meeting.  Therefore, I must ask if this is a load of codswallop they produced.  Is there any factual base for their report?  Who paid for the report? What were David Kennedy of Aer Lingus and many others whose names I cannot recall, doing sitting on a board producing a document based on non-fact?  If that is the type of document the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation are producing, what of these documents &mdash; the 1985, 1984 and 1983 reports on Irish tourism?</P>
    <P>I do not have the 1986 report.  I do not know if it is published yet.  If it is, I would like to have a chance to study it.  The chairman's statement for 1983 said that Irish tourism earned a total of £802 million in 1983, an increase of 10 per cent. In 1984, the chairman's statement said that the target for 1984 had been achieved and that the total revenue to the State amounted to £591 million, an increase of 14 per cent in real terms.  In 1985, revenue to the State amounted to £960 million, an increase of 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>It does not take very long to realise, if you are involved in interest rates, that if you add 14 per cent to 10 per cent to 15 per cent it does not take long to double the number you started with.  If you are paying high interest rates &mdash; as anybody knows who may not be able to meet the targets &mdash; it does not take long before you owe twice as much.  In other words, the numbers are doubled in roughly four and a half to five years.  According to that, we should be swamped with tourists.  We should not be able to walk the streets of Donegal, Sligo or Dublin without bumping into them right, left and centre. Where are they?  The tourists are just not there.</P>
    <P>I wonder when I read reports like this what Bord Fáilte are doing about tourism. One does not like to be parochial but one can only judge by the area that <Col N="1906" /> one sees often and to judge from my area in Donegal, from north of Letterkenny, tourism has collapsed.  Did Bord Fáilte do anything about it?  Port Salon Hotel is closed, derelict and falling apart.  Did anybody from the Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim tourist offices &mdash; I doubt very much the need for these regional tourism bodies &mdash; go to the owners or management of the Port Salon Hotel and tell them they were going about their business in the wrong way?  Did anybody say they should not close down their hotel or that they were sorry to see it close? Did anybody go along to discuss it with the management?  Did anybody in 1969 go to the owners when speculative interests moved in to buy it simply to try to sell it a few years later?  They or none of the rest of us could have anticipated the Northern Ireland problem.  The same speculative interests bought 15 Irish guest hotels.  How many of them are closed today?  What have Bord Fáilte done to justify their existence apart from perpetuating their own existence?  I do not know where tourism is going and I am certainly not an expert on it, but I see my own village and towns and surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>If my memory serves me right, the Cathaoirleach took exception to some of the remarks I made last week and I do not intend to repeat them for the sake of hurting her or anybody else because that is not my intention.  I was about to say last week in another debate that some people involved in providing services are not doing so in a nice way.  One will not find the expected warmth in public houses, restaurants, bars, newsagents and grocers.  Deputy Joe Walsh, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, referred to this and he was slated.  He did not mean that everybody in Ireland is unmannerly, but the basic training is not given.  Indeed, to judge from reaction to my remarks last week the warmth certainly was not here, whatever about the manners.</P>
    <P>We like to think that we are Ireland of the friendship.  We would like to sell this and yet we sometimes look at tourists as if they had horns on them.  When they <Col N="1907" /> pull up at various establishemnts we are reluctant to serve them.  I have often opened the door of a public house and walked in but the barman did not even address me to say good day, to comment on the weather or to ask if I was on holidays.  I was born and reared in a public house with a grocery shop&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Thank you, Minister.  We did the best and were known for that, which is part of the warmth I am talking about.  I was born in a small pub to which was attached a grocery, newsagency and filling station and I did not have to be taught how to treat people.  If I knew them, I named them and if I did not know them, I was not long getting to know their name.  I did not do it in a unmannerly way.  I bade them welcome, I inquired what they wanted to drink and, if I was serving somebody else, I asked if they would mind waiting until I finished serving. These things were not taught.  I do not want to sound smug but it seemed to come naturally at the time.  I have often walked into various places where they were chewing gum and did not speak. They opened their eyes a little wider, which means they were asking what I wanted.  When they served me, they took the money and gave back change without thanking me.  Manners are disappearing from many establishments of all kinds.</P>
      <P>I did not have time to fully read or absorb the Minister's speech but I noticed the emphasis on capital grant-aid and I wonder if the Minister is heading in the right direction.  As my colleague from County Donegal, Senator McGowan, said earlier &mdash; I only heard bits of what he said &mdash; all the capital grant-aid in the world will not improve tourism in Donegal.  It may improve it in Dublin or Killarney but not in Donegal unless money is spent on Killybegs training centre where they are taught the things to which I referred as well as cooking, management, etc.  We have to examine, as Senator Brendan Ryan said what we are selling and how we sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> Over the past ten to 15 years we have been trying to compete directly with places like the Canaries which is daft because we do not have the one ingredient they have, the sun.  We will not have it in any great degree although we may get odd bursts of it.  We cannot sell that and we should not attempt to put up high rise buildings all over the country.  We should identify what we have to sell and then sell it nicely.  Perhaps it was inappropriate on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill to talk about tourism but I will talk about it now.  We identified our small, neat golf courses not the great ones like Rosses Point, Ballybunion or Waterville and the ordinary decent golf courses.  If they can be in groups of eight or nine or, if one could get bed and breakfast for £10 and a round of golf for £3 or £4, we could sell seven nights bed and breakfast and seven rounds of golf in seven different locations for under £100 which is value for money.</P>
    <P>To revert somewhat to Bord Fáilte, I am not sure what my colleague put on the record but I intend to put something on the record.  We in Donegal County Council have either been reluctant or have refused to pay Bord Fáilte because of the way we were treated by their Director General who refused to come to meet us.  I do not know if my colleague referred to steps we are taking to set up a unit of our own that we feel could cater properly for the interests of County Donegal.  I have watched tourism die.  The Minister referred to the fact that in 1986, approximately 950 job were created in the construction industry alone by way of tourism.  I am not too sure that is a figure I would brag about other than to remark that it would be nice to see tourism developing.  The only bit of building I saw in Donegal over the past year I could relate to tourism was the reconstruction of the tourist office in Letterkenny. Where does one find it?  About a mile outside Letterkenny.  If one travels by public transport &mdash; and we do not have much of that in Donegal &mdash; or by private transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Which road is it on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1909" />
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the Derry road, a mile out that road.  If one travels in by public transport, an express bus from Dublin or, more probably nowadays by private transport from Dublin which is about one-third of the cost, one arrives in the heart of Letterkenny town.  Then one has to travel a mile back out again to inquire where travellers or visitors may go or what they might want to do.  The tourist office should be located closer to the town.  I do not know what they were doing spending a large sum of money last year: I do not have a figure for it but I presume there was a large sum of money spent on the type of building &mdash; on the type of mini-cathedral &mdash; they built there.</P>
      <P>I was invited to the opening of that building.  I had to decline because of another engagement, presumably in this House.  I rang the Sligo office of Bord Fáilte to advise them that I would not be able to attend.  I spent two days ringing the Sligo regional office of Bord Fáilte, without getting a reply.  I do not recall precisely when that took place &mdash; I suspect it was over Easter&mdash;I may be totally wrong in that.  But, if it was not over Easter, then I have another experience to relate to that of trying to contact the Bord Fáilte office in Donegal during Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real selling week of the year for tourism in areas along the Border is Easter.  If the weather is good at Easter people make day trips to Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim or Cavan and, if they are pleased they return.  Imagine somebody coming to Donegal that week, day-tripping, saying they will book a holiday in Carrigart, Milford, Kerrykeel or wherever when the Bord Fáilte office was not manned and that in the middle of Easter week.  I have not done any in depth study of these statistics, but I wonder when I see figures produced by Bord Fáilte of a 14 per cent increase and so on when everybody knows there has been a decrease in tourism for quite some time. I do not blame Bord Fáilte absolutely for the decrease, but the pretence that there has been an increase annoys me.  There has been no reduction in the amount of <Col N="1910" /> money spent while there has been that decrease.</P>
    <P>People have made reference to the troubles in Northern Ireland.  There is no doubt in my mind, no more than in anybody else's, that the northern troubles have contributed in a negative fashion to a decrease in tourism, certainly in my region and probably all of the country. We have ony to think of the type of graffiti we have seen &mdash;&ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; and so on &mdash; written all over the place, and indeed not condemned by some of the areas prominent politicians.  It would be too much to expect that people from Britain would come here in large numbers.</P>
    <P>I wonder has anybody given thought to another statistic or lack of it.  First of all, how many people from our capital city ever come to Donegal?</P>

      <P>Good, because I suspect there are very few and that is because of the Northern troubles.  I know people, I am related to people, who would not come.  Bord Fáilte will have to try to break down this imaginary trouble filled spot of Northern Ireland because it is not trouble all the way.  Mind you, it is bad enough.  If we cannot get people from anywhere south of, say, Cavan or Monaghan to come north to Donegal, how can we expect people from England, Wales and Scotland to come here?  How many of us ever consider going in to Northern Ireland for a nice holiday?</P>

      <P>Again, I am glad to hear it.  Easter two years ago I walked into the Bord Fáilte office in Letterkenny. I had decided to spend a couple of days in Northern Ireland.  They could not give me information on Northern Ireland tourism.  We sometimes get the whole game mixed up.  Some of us feel that we are more &ldquo;Republican&rdquo;&mdash; in inverted commas &mdash; than others.  We feel it is a Thirty-two County Ireland, not a Twenty-six County Ireland.  Yet some of <Col N="1911" /> the same people would say: &ldquo;But until we have it you do not dare go in there; you do not contribute to their economy; you do not buy anything in there and you certainly do not holiday there.&rdquo;  We get a little mixed up.  We cannot really expect tourists from Northern Ireland to come drifting towards the south while, at the same time, refuse point blank ourselves to go north.</P>
      <P>If my contribution has been a little mangled, I suppose it is because I have not prepared it so well but I have tried to give some thoughts on tourism.  The most basic one being that we should try to sell what we have, the nice things we have &mdash; our beaches, hills, mountains, lakes, fishing, mountain-climbing and golfing activities and facilities.  We should try to sell those things and not pretend we are competing directly with sunny resorts because we cannot.  We should identify our attractions and try to sell them to ourselves for a start.  Remember, while tourism in some ways is an export industry, once we bring people here from abroad that has the same net effect as selling goods abroad.  If we can keep some of our people from emigrating and dissuade them from spending their holidays abroad, then that means stopping that outflow.  We should first try to encourage our people to spend their holidays at home.</P>
      <P>This is the first time I have suggested this publicly.  I ask the Minister perhaps to put to Government the possibility of having an annual monthly holiday in this country when virtually everything would close down.  I do not see much merit in Departments of State operating with a skeleton staff for the month of August, likewise local authorities.  In my local authority in Donegal, one can make representations about this, that or the other thing during the month of August, but try to contact the person in charge and you will find they are on holiday, and rightly so.  Is there merit in the idea of simply closing down most of those establishments for the month?  Imagine the savings effected on lighting, heating, stationery and telephone bills and so on.</P>

      <Col N="1912" /> Perhaps the Government should seriously consider that policy because there is much merit in it and then encourage our people &mdash; knowing that they will have a month off &mdash; to take a few days here or there.  For instance, one can get a bus from Parnell Square right into the heart of Donegal for £9 return.  As I said earlier, one can get seven nights bed and breakfast and seven rounds of golf for £100.  The House might think on that, that one can be taken from a point in Dublin to Donegal for seven nights.  All one has to do is arrange the transport in between.  For £120 a Dubliner could have that type of package.</P>
    <P>I hope some of my remarks &mdash; none was intended to be hurtful &mdash; will be taken on board and considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many of my colleagues, I welcome the Minister to the House, particularly in the light of the imaginative package of tourist measures which the Government have put before the people.  I have been listening throughout the afternoon and, as someone relatively new to debate, I have been a little surprised and at times disappointed, but perhaps it is the nature of debate that one should criticise and oppose, particularly if one is on the other side of the House. However, part of the problem facing this country over a long period of time is that we are a nation of begrudgers and knockers and that we spend far too much of our time opposing, criticising and knocking.  That is not to suggest that glaring inadequacies in Irish life should not be highlighted and brought before the relevant authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are talking about tourism, as Senator Loughrey said earlier, we are talking about an export.  There are countries which would welcome the type of income into their economy tourism is bringing into this country.  Any attempt to co-ordinate what is in a sense a disparate industry &mdash; it is a very difficult industry to pin down and to quantify &mdash; and to bring a degree of sophistication to it and to increase revenue is initially to be welcomed.  If one is to tease it out and criticise it afterwards, that is fine.  As <Col N="1913" /> somebody coming new to the House I was a little disappointed at the tenor of the debate on what has proved to be a very bold and imaginative piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>However, moving on from that sort of naive attitude, as some people might assume it to be, I might very briefly mention one or two aspects of the tourist package in the context of what the Minister and the Government may be able to do in order to attract more people into this country, which is basically what the package is all about.  As someone who travels regularly to England &mdash; and England being our nearest neighbour has traditionally been also our largest tourist revenue earner &mdash; I have found that certainly the Northern Ireland problems over the past 15 to 18 years have had a dampening effect on the traditional British market.  I do not mean the ethnic market, but the traditional British market, the family type holiday, the people who came to this country because it was the nearest country to them and for a long time was a competitive country. Also it was much more expensive in the sixties and early seventies to travel abroad, much more so than it is today. Obviously, the Northern Ireland problems have had an effect on that market.</P>
    <P>At the risk of dividing my colleagues from the north west region &mdash; and Leitrim is one of the three counties in the tourism region in the north west &mdash; listening to the tears being shed by Senator Loughrey &mdash; I am not too sure about my colleague Senator McGowan &mdash; I wonder how people outside this House would react. If Donegal is complaining about a problem in tourism, where does that leave Sligo and Leitrim?  We have always thought that we are, in a sense, on the hind tit of the north west tourism organisation. The criticisms that have been levelled at Bord Fáilte within the north west have been at what has been seen as the dominance of the Donegal tourism industry within the region and the manner in which they are successfully able to gain whatever kudos or whatever money is coming their way.  I make the point that, while I have every sympathy with what is <Col N="1914" /> obviously a problem in Donegal tourism according to what we have been listening to, Sligo and Leitrim must be having a much more difficult problem.</P>
    <P>This year, particularly since May, the indications are that the traditional tourist from England, particularly to Leitrim, the tourists who are coarse fishermen &mdash; when I was growing up there were as many of them around the town of Drumshanbo as there were in the population &mdash; are coming back and they are coming back in greater numbers.  The main reason is the cheaper cost of access into this country.  Therefore the competitive nature of the carriers coming in must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I could never understand why Aer Lingus and the other carrier on the Dublin-London route, British Airways whenever criticism was levelled at the high cost of the travel from Dublin to London and vice versa, were always able to come up with some justification for it. Suddenly, Ryanair came along and they exploded that myth because really that is all it was.  Now Aer Lingus are in a sense out-competing Ryanair.  I hope there will be more independent carriers on routes into this country because the tourism package as outlined by the Government will not work unless there is cheaper access, people are able to get in here cheaply and when they get here they are able to live and to spend the limited budgets that most people now have.</P>
    <P>The day of the flashy American with the hip full of dollars is long, long gone. They even tell me in Killarney, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that they are not as thick on the ground as they used to be.  Therefore, the approaches which the Minister is making and the approaches that are being made to him by the various independent carriers are to be encouraged.  I know the whole thrust of Government policy is towards a more open market economy and in that respect it is working. Indeed, like other speakers, I am disappointed that, despite the Minister's best efforts at the recent EC summit, we were unable to gain fifth right landing rights for Aer Lingus and Ryanair which would have been a tremendous boost for <Col N="1915" /> us.  I only hope that that is a short step back for the Minister.  According to the suggestions in the media he will be involving countries other than Spain in bilateral agreements on the package and I hope that he will be successful.  Obviously it will generate an enormous amount of income for Irish air carriers.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning earlier on touched on something I had intended to bring up and it is important to reiterate it.  What are we selling when we sell Ireland?  If Bord Fáilte are to be criticised about anything, it is perhaps that over the past number of years they have not identified the image of Ireland.  Every company selling products identify what is known as a corporate image of that company. Taking one of the most obvious examples, whenever a housewife, or indeed a husband, goes into a store to buy a vacuum cleaner, nine times out of ten he or she will ask for a Hoover, whereas Hoover are but one of many manufacturers of vacuum cleaners in the world.  So successful have Hoover been in establishing a corporate image of themselves that everybody assumes that a vacuum cleaner is a Hoover.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to suggest is that Ireland should try to establish an image of itself.  When people, as Senator Manning said earlier, talk about Spain they think of sand and the sun.  When you think about Ireland it is sometimes difficult to figure out exactly what it is that attracts people here.  Perhaps because we are in a very competitive area, the tourism area, Bord Fáilte should adopt what might be referred to as local stratagems.</P>
    <P>For example, I have family relations in France and they tell me that the main reason French people come to Ireland is the wide open spaces.  They tend, in the main, to go to places such as Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry and the Burren in Clare is a very popular location for French visitors.  This is mainly because they come to Ireland knowing they are going to have that type of pioneering, wild environment which is totally at variance with what they have been used to in France.  Germans, increasingly, are <Col N="1916" /> coming here because of pike fishing which I am not too sure is a great development because, unlike our traditional British fisherman who always threw back what he or she caught, continental fishermen are destocking our lakes at an enormous rate.  I am wondering if perhaps the Minister, through Bord Fáilte, might take cognisance of the fact that it is causing a very serious problem in coarse fishing areas that pike, in particular, and other forms of sporting fish are being taken our of our lakes at an alarming rate. Consequently, our remaining fish stocks are not appealing to the traditional English visitor.</P>
    <P>In the the same context I am wondering &mdash; it might not come within the Minister's brief but perhaps under trade and marketing &mdash; about the marketing of things Irish.  Senator Manning touched on how successful the British have been, or more accurately the English, in identifying what is attractive about an English holiday &mdash; the nostalgia, the history of the monarchy, its traditions.  Anybody who has ever visited London, being the largest British city and also attracting the largest number of tourists, has been inundated with souvenir shops.  One could say that their wares are very tacky and are of little relevance but has anybody ever quantified the amount of money generated by shopping bags with the British flag on them and British slogans, by the various traditional souvenirs such as T-shirts and sweat shirts?  One does not see them here in Ireland to the same extent.</P>
    <P>If the British can say &ldquo;Britain is great&rdquo; why cannot we have slogans such as &ldquo;Proud to be Irish&rdquo; or &ldquo;I visited Ireland this year&rdquo;?  I do not see any Irish company manufacturing a souvenir or logo which is unique to Ireland and which, if taken abroad, would have some long term benefits for tourism.  I am not sure it is something the Government can do but perhaps Bord Fáilte could encourage some Irish manufacturer to market and merchandise more Irish goods that would proclaim the message that Ireland is the place to visit.</P>
    <P>For many years it seemed that Bord Fáilte &mdash; and from listening to the debates <Col N="1917" /> in the House this afternoon this is an opinion shared by many Senators &mdash; in not being able to identify what it was that attracted people to Ireland, tended to try to compete, unsuccessfully as it happened, with the traditional holidaymaker who went abroad for the sun.  Ireland is not a sun resort: it never was and never will be.  Therefore, to use a rag trade reference, we should cut our cloth to our measure.  In fairness to Bord Fáilte they are beginning to do that by opening up more conference facilities and attracting more conference delegations here.  These are an enormous source of revenue to any city.  They have started to encourage entrepreneurs to develop inside leisure facilities.  There are a number in the south and I have heard rumours, which I hope are true, that a number of major entrepreneurs are going to get involved in a major tourist development in the midlands around the Mullingar area which will incorporate golf courses, indoor leisure facilities and various other tourist leisure facilities of that nature.  This will be a marvellous benefit to the midlands if it comes to fruitiion.</P>
    <P>In that context in recent years the upper Shannon has proved to be a gold mine in tourist terms.  Senator Fallon spoke earlier about the area around Athlone.  I want to extend this further and say that because of the reopening of one portion of the Lough Allen canal from Battlebridge just outside the town of Leitrim into Acres Lake outside Drumshanbo, the economy of the Drumshanbo area in the summer has benefited greatly by the access which has been provided as a result of this imaginative move which was taken some years ago.  I want to prevail upon the Minister to help to push along the very seriously held aspirations of the people of Drumshanbo and the mid-Leitrim district to reopen the other area of the canal which leads from Acres Lake into Lough Allen.  This would recreate the full navigational access which was available up to 1926 from Ardnachusha in Limerick up to Lough Allen and towards the Shannon pot touching on the Minister's county, Cavan.  This would be a tremendous <Col N="1918" /> boost for the mid-Leitrim and upper Shannon area in general.</P>
    <P>While boats are coming up in increasing numbers to Acres Lake &mdash; and obviously there is a need for the development of more marine facilities there &mdash; there will be a growing clamour from boating enthusiasts for access into Lough Allen. I know that costs are a big problem for any Government Department in this day and age but in the long term interests of tourism and because the amounts of money which are being talked about are small in comparison to the long term benefits to the area and to the economy generally I hope that the canal will be reopened.  The reopening of the Lough Allen canal would be a major financial and economic boost to the area and to the country generally.</P>
    <P>In relation to boating and lake pursuits in general the Minister will be aware that for many years there has been a great deal of agitation about the reopening of the Ballyconnell canal.  While this could be operated with cross-Border co-operation I get the impression from people who have more technical expertise than I have that, in the long term, the aspiration for the reopening of the Ballyconnell canal might not be the best in terms of spending scarce money.  The objection is that there are far too many locks on that canal and that, as a boating access, boating enthusiasts would not find it such an enjoyable experience and it might not be used to the extent people suggest.  I do not want to be criticised by tourism interests in the Cavan-Fermanagh area for suggesting that their long held hopes and aspirations should be shoved down a chute.  I am simply saying that, in the context of scarce resources, the Minister might look at the other side of the suggestion that has been put to me that it is not as rosy as it may seem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he might consider, as a long term proposition, the provision of a slipway at some out access of Lough Allen as close as possible to the Shannon pot and that a further slipway would be provided on the northern side around Ballyconnell or Belturbet.  Therefore, <Col N="1919" /> instead of looking for this hoped-for development which might not come to fruition Lough Erne could utilise the slipway to take their boats by road from the Ballyconnell or Belturbet areas and bring them down to Lough Allen and put them on the slipway there.  Obviously, this would require a service be provided on a summer basis if not on a half year basis and that would require more money.  It has been suggested to me by boating enthusiasts that that suggestion might be a more practical one in the medium term rather than spending a great deal of time, effort and money on trying to reopen the Ballyconnell canal. I mention it because boating and the Shannon generally are germane to the ongoing development of the economy of the areas in which I live.</P>
    <P>The future of a county like Leitrim, and to a lesser extent Counties Sligo and Donegal lies in the development of their tourist facilities.  At the end of the day we are all concerned about the areas where we live and hope they will be improved and made better.  I welcome wholeheartedly the imaginative moves that have been taken by the Government in the tourism area generally and I hope the ideas which are already beginning to bear fruit will result in long term benefits to the Irish economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, fáiltím roimh an Aire.  It is nice to be renewing a debate with the Minister after a long number of years.  I recall that it was ten years ago this month that he first called me a Blueshirt when we were discussing the Wilson grants or some such issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to what the Senator was wearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I intend to take a very positive approach to the Minister's present Bill and to wish him well in his office.  The challenge of going out to sell Ireland is one which most people would welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate has been very interesting. I suspect it covered much more <Col N="1920" /> ground than was covered in the Dáil debate on the same issue and it reflects the contribution the Seanad can make to such a debate.  We should identify our product and if there is to be a negative aspect in what I have to say it is that we have failed to identify properly the product we are selling to our tourists. We have the natural resources to make Ireland a most attractive package from many different perspectives.  We should look at our national natural resources and maximise them.  We need to have a very pragmatic approach to marketing Ireland and it needs to be a positive one.  We have what it takes and we have what tourists want.  I have been on holiday in most European countries and further afield in every part of Ireland.  Ireland can match any place for a holiday provided people know what they are looking for when they head for an Irish holiday.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas which could be developed.  One area which saddens me more than any other is the food industry.  Countries in Europe have got the reputation of being very professional in their approach to food.  If I could take an example without in any sense having a go at the whole French nation, the French have got a reputation of being great at food presentation, of being great at vegetable production.  It is like when somebody gets the name of getting up early they can stay in bed until mid-day. The fact is that the Irish vegetable is a far superior product to the French vegetable. I live in an area where I am surrounded by vegetable farmers and what is thrown to the animals in Ireland as being unfit to be graded for the Dublin markets would appear in the best supermarkets and vegetable shops in France as grade one vegetables. That is a factor which we have not considered and I use that as a sort of an <i>entrée</i> to discussing the whole area of the restaurant, food and hotel business because we have the opportunity of presenting and selling good clean food. There is a tiny market for natural foods but I do not know of any major restaurant or hotel in this country which can advertise additive-free, antibiotic-free, hormone-free meat.  I know very few butcher <Col N="1921" /> shops where the same is on offer.  We are falling behind Europe in this area.  The average European is more health conscious than the average Irish person and there is a whole area there ready to be developed.  We could be the food centre of Europe.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the tourist menu has been a major step forward in attracting tourists to Ireland because eating out is part of the style of living of continentals. We have priced ourselves out of that market.  Prices are dropping somewhat in restaurants and people can now look forward to eating out on a regular basis but it is still very expensive and eating out for the whole family is still not achieveable.  That is an area where the internal market is not responding to a need.  I urge the Minister to look at investments which will increase production of natural foods and to apply the most rigorous standards to additives, antibiotics and hormone treatment of Irish food because that is certainly a factor which tourists will take into consideration.</P>
    <P>One matter which I am concerned about in discussing tourism is the area of job creation.  We have discussed this many times.  In a previous debate Senator Farrell talked about the three industries in Grange which were employing 100 people.  We have to be clear about this. People set up industries to make a profit; they do not set up industries to create jobs, the jobs are a spin-off.  Similarly, in relation to the tourist industry, people do not get involved in that industry to create jobs.  Our interest in it is that it does create jobs but the people who operate in it are in it for a profit.  I know my colleague Senator Ross will have something to say about the privatisation of this area and I want to make it clear that I would not agree with him in that respect. We need State investment in this area but we must have a pragmatic approach to a viable industry.</P>
    <P>A large amount of the money which we are voting here today will be used as grants for housing purposes.  Every grant should have the most stringent set of conditions, not in terms of what is about to be built but in terms of the type of <Col N="1922" /> building and where it is going to be built. I wish to refer here to earlier debates on section 4.  I thoroughly support the idea of section 4; there should be checks and balances in every system.  The idea behind section 4 is very good but the abuse of section 4 is something which I cannot tolerate any more than anybody else.  It is somewhat arrogant to say that people who apply section 4 are always acting out of order.  There are good and right reasons for applying it.  Senator O'Connor quite rightly said that there are planners who would put the people of Ireland in the most obscure mountain areas when they have an entitlement to good natural surroundings as well and I certainly support that general viewpoint. Section 4 is important if it is used responsibly and I would certainly leave it there.</P>
    <P>What do tourists coming to Ireland exepect?  What are they looking for and do we meet those needs?  Do we measure up to their expectations?  We have not developed the areas of art, culture or craft.  There are very few tourist towns in Ireland that have a theatre.  There is room for investment in an infrastructure that could double up for various things.  There is no reason why a building in a small town could not be used partly as a leisure centre, cinema, theatre, an exhibition area and a concert hall.  There is need for imaginative planning.  I disagree-with Senator Mooney when he says this is a bold, imaginative Bill being introduced by the Minister.  It certainly is not and I do not think that the Minister would make that claim for it.  It is simply a repeat of what was there before and the imaginative aspect relates to the investments for which this money will be used.</P>
    <P>We have failed to develop the personality of the different places in Ireland. We must look at the different areas and ask ourselves what each area stands for, give it a personality of its own, develop that personality and then sell it.  From Kerry to Donegal each area has a different personality; the Gaeltacht areas, the Burren area and others.  I want to make a special appeal for an area which has been left out of this debate and that is the North.  We talk about hands across <Col N="1923" /> the Border, we talk about making positive attempts.  I certainly welcome the idea of opening navigation across the Border.  This is a very positive and progressive development.  It saddens me that people do not know the beauty of County Down or of County Antrim.  I know this is against the thrust of this Bill but it would be a positive gesture towards peace, reconciliation and understanding of different cultures if we were to include Ireland as a totality in selling it.  There would certainly be no weak response to it.  I urge the Minister to ensure that closer links are developed between the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that in my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am sorry.  I missed some of the Minister's speech this afternoon but I am glad to hear that.  I think it is absolutely vital.  In attracting people to Rathlin Island, Slieve Donard or wherever, it proves to people, as Senator Loughrey said, that the North is an ordinary place in many respects.  One of the great difficulties we will have in developing the sense of place is understanding what people want and what they do not want, what is useful, what is difficult and what is dangerous.  The family holiday is a very important part of the tourist business.  People have mentioned why families will not go to some parts of Ireland but, without singling out any county, I say I will not take my family on holiday to a place where they cannot walk into a shop without passing by a gaming machine.  It is an absolute threat at present.  Many small towns on the west coast particularly have the problem of one-armed bandits.  I urge the Minister to clean up the act in those areas.  The legislation is there, it is just a matter of enforcing it.  It certainly takes from the character of an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The roads infrastructure which is critically important has been neglected.  I know the cost of maintaining roads, but it saddens me that the more scenic the area, the worse the roads seem to be. <Col N="1924" /> The further west you go, the worse the roads seem to become.</P>
    <P>Chualamar ón Seanadóir O'Connor mar gheall ar staid na mbóithre i gConamara, and we have heard plenty about them before but I would have to say gur scriosadh an carr seo agamsa ar na bóithre céanna.</P>
    <P>The bad state of the roads deters the caravan user.  I have taken a caravan and camped in various European countries, including Ireland.  There has been a major improvement in the quality of camp sites and caravan sites in Ireland. It has been a worth-while investment because a self-catering holiday is definitely the type of holiday which is striding ahead and becoming more and more popular.  I certainly urge that that investment be continued, and be continued in the way that is being done at present because most of the camp sites that I have looked at that have been renovated or improved, extended, or have added new facilities in the past couple of years, have done so in a most tasteful manner.  I know that people can stand up and give me an example which would prove otherwise but I have certainly seen lovely places.</P>
    <P>I hear people commend the camp sites in France and Germany &mdash; I have been to the camp sites in France, Germany and Italy and they are beautiful but you pay through the nose for them as well.  A good camp site in Europe will cost about £12 a night.  So, let us not sell ourselves short.  In terms of the facilities, let me say the good camp sites here are comparable to the best camp sites in France &mdash; and I know because I have been to them. Perhaps we need a stricter grading system in Ireland so that people know what they are going into.  There should be a common European standardisation of camp sites and caravan sites so that the tourist walking into a two star site in Ireland can compare it with the two star site in France, Germany or elsewhere. This is important and it is something the Community could take on board.  The different countries have different standards. It is a matter really of applying a convention and I certainly ask that that be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> The other great lack in this general area that I find when driving through Ireland is the rarity of the decently laid out picnic or lay-by area.  We just do not have them.  In other countries at every ten or 20 miles of a main road there will be a very nice secluded, sheltered picnic or lay-by area with services.  We have not developed that facility and, even worse than that, in some counties where they made a serious effort ten of 12 years ago perhaps because of cutbacks or whatever they have not been able to maintain some of these areas.  If an area which has been set up as a picnic or lay-by site is let go to rack and ruin, or becomes overgrown, it is worse than having nothing because it becomes an eyesore.  I certainly urge that the Minister would look at this matter.  Everyone loves a picnic.  Let us give people the opportunity of travelling through the country and stopping safely and enjoying the countryside as well.  The planners forgot that it is dangerous for families to stop on the side of the road. It is necessary to provide safe, clean, hygienic conditions where people can stop and enjoy themselves.</P>
    <P>The other thing that Ireland has and can be very proud of is a great sense of history.  I know that every country has a history but we have a great sense of our own history and traditions.  We talk about them but we do not ever sell them.  I would like to see some of this money diverted to the Office of Public Works, who have done massive work over the past ten to 20 years on some of our historic sites in renovating them, in presenting them to the public, in making them more accessible and in describing them.</P>
    <P>Could I just make a small observation on what I find an annoying lack in many of these places?  For instance, you can walk into Notre Dame Cathedral, put five francs into a machine and the machine will give you a running commentary in English on what you are looking at.  It is a very small investment which pays for itself.  I believe there is a little bit of this in Ireland, but it should be done, all the time.  We fail in this.  You can walk on to the <i>Fram</i> in Oslo, press a <Col N="1926" /> button and you will hear all of Nansen's adventures, background, and travels explained in detail and highlighted.  It is a small investment and it does make the tourist more appreciative of the facilities. It also sells our sense of place and sense of history.  I think that places like the Skelly and others need to be made more accessible and that means an investment in the infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We must stop selling Ireland as the sunshine island, as has been said today. We can sell this country without sunshine and I believe if we take the sunshine out of the equation and then try to start selling the place we will be far more successful. I think the chief planner &mdash; if there is such a person &mdash; should be asked to visualise himself or herself on a wet July day in Dingle wondering where they were going.  It is that basic level of response we are lacking really.  We must say, &ldquo;Well, where can you go&rdquo;.  There are many facilities there.  I was delighted to hear the Minister this morning talk about his plan for the <i>walk d'Irlande</i>, or whatever phrase he used.  It certainly seems imaginative and that is the kind of return on small investment which repays one hundred fold and I ask that that would be done.</P>
    <P>To get back to Dingle on the wet July day, I think we need cycle ways, which are a small investment.  I also believe we need cycle lanes which are a major investment but these are things which are available in other countries.  Cycling is a healthy outdoor activity that many people like to do on their holidays.  We should facilitate people in that there should be cycle ways as well as walkways. I believe that there must be an investment in leisure centres, in all areas.  With imaginative planning leisure centres are not something that are used for two months or six weeks of the year, if they are planned properly can fulfil many different needs of the local community.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign the Fianna Fáil party talked a lot about investment in building.  Building of leisure centres obviously creates employment and it is not wasted investment. The building of a leisure centre not only <Col N="1927" /> creates employment but also improves in a permanent way the infrastructure and the facilities, in addition to creating a community resource which can be self-financing for the rest of the year.  It is an investment in the nation's health.  I do not like comparing Ireland with other countries all the time but one of the things one notices in other countries is that even in the smallest towns they have the <i>stade municipal</i> or whatever it happens to be called, and the local swimming pool or leisure centre, and they are very proud of those facilities.  I ask that we would go in the same particular direction.</P>
    <P>We need to work on the impressions created by our towns.  The first impression one gets of a town is whether it is clean and neat.  Is there a nice floral arrangement on the way into the town? Are there signs?  Could I make the point here that the first time I drove down the Champs Elysées, I was astounded and astonished to find the golden arches of a well-known hamburger company shining out at me through what I considered the beautiful environment of the area.  I was shocked to see it.  I did not think the French could show such lack of taste.  I am pleased to know now that they have been booted out of the Champs Elysées and have handed over to another hamburger company because they were not allowed to have their flashing arches on it.  That is the kind of decision we need to make and take.  I believe we need taste and balance in our planning and in the facilities that are available.  We could develop the whole fishing area.  It has been touched on by a number of people. Before we can develop fishing we must sell the clean lakes, the clean seas and the clean rivers.  We should adopt the Greenpeace slogan of clean air, clean seas and pure water.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is a disgrace.  I did a certain amount of scuba diving before my body lost its shape, and I can say that to go underwater in the Irish sea is far more of a lesson than being on the beaches.  We have a responsibility to other generations for our seas.  The Irish Sea at present is just a mix of raw sewage and radiation. <Col N="1928" /> The jokes are flying around the place about knowing the fish from the Irish Sea because it glows in the dark.  It is all right as a joke but the thing sticks.  Last night in a restaurant I was sitting beside somebody who was not very health conscious and who asked where the fish was from. Once people become so conscious we have a real responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck just this moment by the similarity between the Bill we were discussing today and this motion and the inconsistency which exists in the Government giving money to Bord Fáilte in a very liberal fashion, as they are doing in the Bill going through the Seanad today, and the withdrawal of £3.4 million allocation being debated in this motion.  It would be more consistent, because the two are related, if the Government were either to give less to Bord Fáilte or to give the £3.4 million to Dublin, and admittedly that amount is small.  We <Col N="1929" /> would be more sensible to put both sums of money, the allocation to Bord Fáilte and this £3.4 million under scrutiny.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to this motion put down by Fine Gael not because of the aims, the objectives or the possible achievements of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, whom I support, and I support the idea, the objectives and the possible final results of what is being done, but because what we need is a dash of realism.  I am sorry to see the Fine Gael Party putting down a motion of this sort without any suggestion from the Opposition about where the money is to come from not just this year but in future years, and I have read last week's report. Remember that this allocation of £3.4 million will not be just for this year but if the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were to continue it would be an allocation which would continue year after year.</P>

      <P>Ah, in the words of our Taoiseach.  The Senator will, I hope explain that to me in his speech if he has not spoken already.  It is a pity that we have not had an explanation from the Opposition in this way, that they have not said, &ldquo;All right, we will resurrect this £3.4 million and we will get it from here&rdquo;. That is the objective.  It is dishonest to suggest that the Government want to scrap the Commission from some motive other than a dearth of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see fewer.  State funded bodies in this State.  I would like to see the pressure for those idyllic ideas which were put forward by Senator Doyle, come from the community themselves and not from the Government.  I read Senator Doyle's excellent speech with great interest.  He conducted us on a particularly pleasant tour from the top of Grafton Street to Parnell Square or the Parnell monument anyway &mdash; and suggested the great improvements which the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission could make.  I applaud all those improvements, but Senator Doyle should have said how this was going to be paid <Col N="1930" /> for and how he expected the State to do it.  I would like to see people who own those shops he referred to, who pull those shutters down, who put that street furniture out, getting together and doing it themselves.  We should be less eager to support this constant dependence on the State which the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission continue to encourage. We have this constant dependence on the State in the Bill which we had earlier today and again it is part of the mentality which unfortunately we are tending to accept.  All the aims, all the objectives which this Bill seeks to promote could be achieved by other means and not by the State itself.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Connolly to the House.  I do not think I have spoken since he has been in attendance in the Seanad and I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion which condemns the decision of the Government to abolish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and calls upon the Government to restore power and full funding to the commission.  I, too, have read the report of the Seanad debate on this and in particular the Minister's speech and I am afraid that I remain unconvinced of the argument which he advanced in support of the abolition of this body.  I was intrigued by Senator Ross's suggestion that the major task in hand should be accomplished on a sort of DIY basis.  I regard that as preposterous.  It is just impossible to think that such a mammoth task could be co-ordinated and assembled on the basis of it being left up to the individual will and activity of shop owners etc.  in the designated metropolitan area in the core of the city.  Such an idea, while it might gain credence with some, is unworkable.  Those of us who have been part of the regeneration of urban areas &mdash; I have as a member of Waterford City Council &mdash; will see that when a city centre begins to come alive again it is the fruit of the process of planning, co-ordination, <Col N="1931" /> deliberation and great thought.  That is the only way in which it is possible to achieve a meaningful revival of a city centre.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question raised by Senator Ross as to where the money would come from to fund this. The money involved is really quite small; it is £3.4 million per annum.  It is very easy to be in favour of financial rectitude and constraints on public expenditure in a global sense and then to be opposed to one's pet hobby when the cut comes down in that area, but the money involved in terms of national expenditure is minute and the commission would be self financing, maybe not in the short term but certainly in the long term.  I will deal with that later when I speak about what seems to me to be a major Government inconsistency rather than the sort of inconsistency which Senator Ross seems to lay at the feet of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>On 17 June 1986 the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy John Boland, who has been recognised as a good and effective Minister for the Environment, announced his intention to establish a Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission with a mandate &ldquo;to secure, improvement in the general appearance and condition of the central artery of the city running from O'Connell Street to Grafton Street.&rdquo; The general reaction to this at the time was one of unqualified enthusiasm both from the public in general and from the specific interest groups involved in the area.  Representatives from the tourism industry and the building industry and city centre business people were overjoyed because they saw hope in this major initiative.</P>
    <P>However, the enthusiasm was not universal and very soon negative and what I would call mean vibes began to surface in relation to this project.  The first salvo was fired by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Jim Tunney, who roundly condemned the commission as a dictatorial and alien proposal.  Another city council member, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, Leader of The Workers' Party, <Col N="1932" /> spoke of it as democracy thrown into reverse.  The problem, on closer examination, seemed to be one of concern that the powers of the corporation were in some way being eroded by this new creature, this new statutory body, and the hackles were well and truly risen.</P>
    <P>In my estimation this attitude was one of full blown paranoia and it was not borne out by the facts of the commission. The commission was to be given a time span of only three years and at the end of that time there was a clear realisation that the powers and duties relative to the designated part of the city would be returned to Dublin City Council and to the Dublin Transport Authority.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy Boland, indicated that the City Manager, Mr. Frank Feely, would be a member of the seven person commission and that should have allayed the fears of those who claimed that the powers of the local authority were in some way to be massively eroded, of course, it did not allay the political antagonism which was by then in full spate.  It really got underway with a vengenance because the Bill to establish the commission was introduced into the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was opposed tooth and nail by the Fianna Fáil Party now in Government and who are responsible for the abolition of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech talked about the commission being established in the dying days of the Coalition Government. Whose fault was that, I ask?  It was established in the latter days of the Coalition Government precisely because the Bill had been opposed tooth and nail and had been subjected to an overstated and full-blown denigration by the party now in Government.  It was not passed before the summer recess in 1986.  It has been suggested &mdash; and I do not think this is too cynical &mdash; that Fianna Fáil did not want to let the Government pass such an evidently popular measure.</P>
    <P>Finally the Bill passed all stages in the Dáil and the Seanad and the commission held their first meeting on 10 February 1987.  A new dawn for Dublin was heralded. When looking back over newspapers at that time, all the editorials and <Col N="1933" /> all the feature writers were pleased, excited and happy that the possibility of growth, revitalisation and regeneration was on the cards for Dublin.  There was clear recognition that the centre of Dublin should be a national showpiece and should be the focus of a concentrated drive to make it such.</P>
    <P>The city, and in particular its vital core, has over the past number of years deteriorated massively.  O'Connell Street is now an absolute disgrace.  It has been overwhelmed by a succession of hamburger joints, gambling dens, which I gather are euphemistically referred to as gaming halls, and discount stores.  The whole effect is one of decay and a disgusting tackiness which is totally at variance with what should be and what has been a majestic thoroughfare.  The same creeping degeneration is percolating right up through Grafton Street and through the other major streets of the area under consideration.</P>
    <P>Here was a chance for change but it was blown, and it was blown by naked political posturing.  People who love this city will find it very hard to forgive this action and the Fianna Fáil Party for such an attitude.  Ostensibly, the concern and the opposition was based on a wish to preserve the fucntions and the role of Dublin City Council.  I contend this was totally spurious.  While the corporation have many powers &mdash; I am a member of a council so I know what I am talking about and I know what those powers are &mdash; these are largely, technical and supervisory.  The corporation have not got a city architect, nor have they a design department.  Their development plans are all about zoning, land use, site density, road widening and sanitary services, all very valuable and all very necessary, but so very different from the remit of the commission which was specific, limited in area, limited in time and clearly designed to revive and restore the very heart of our noble capital.</P>
    <P>The Government are failing to co-ordinate their own policies and here I come to an inconsistency which I find baffling. All day today there has been a lengthy, <Col N="1934" /> extensive and discursive debate on tourism. While listening to the other side of the House, I cannot understand why more or less the same people with the same political thrust can say what they said on the Tourist Traffic Bill and then stand up and support the abolition of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission. There is a massive inconsistency about this.</P>
    <P>Government policy has brought tourism into the area of the business expansion scheme.  When I was speaking on Second Stage and also on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill I welcomed this.  The Government also plan a major development on the 27-acre Dublin docks site which will mean a significant investment. All of this useful activity, this good activity, this valuable activity, for which I give the Government credit is expected to co-exist cheek by jowl with what is the worst and the most honky-tonk city centre in Europe, if not in the world. There is just no logic to it.</P>
    <P>The amount of money involved was peanuts in terms of total Government budget, a mere £10 million over three years or £3.4 million per annum.  The effect would have been marvellous.  It would have been a face lift which is decades overdue.  The spin-off in terms of lifting Dubliners' morale and national morale would have been incalculable and the tourism potential which would mesh with Government policy is self-evident. It would &mdash; and I am convinced of this &mdash; have become self-financing over time.</P>
    <P>Some outstanding people were to have been part of this &mdash; Matt McNulty, manager of Dublin Tourism, a person with long standing and genuine concern for the city and Patrick Shaffrey whom we have engaged in Waterford to help us with our urban renewal plan.  He is an architect and townplanner whose mark has already been made on that fine medieval city of Kilkenny.  He has a keenly developed and a very fine aesthetic sense. Shop fronts, offending plastic or neon signs would, over time, have been replaced.  Street furniture would have been put in place and a really exciting prospect and a vista of Dublin would have <Col N="1935" /> become a reality.  I was excited by the prospect of restoring a Doric column in the place of Nelson's Pillar or commissioning a major piece of sculpture which would have been a 20th century civic statement about Dublin but all that has been abolished and is to be no more.  I am really sad about the deliberate failure and I can only conclude that the Government and the Fianna Fáil party do not really care about our capital city.  It was a foolish, a limited and a wrong-headed decision, a mean economy and an utterly and absolutely false one.  I am a realist and I accept that the restoration of the commission is probably not on at this stage despite all the cogent arguments which have been advanced by people outside and in this House.  I understand the commission have a report which would be the fruits of their brainstorming sessions and their collective wisdom.  I would hate to see that report shelved as so many reports have been, and that the whole matter would be left in abeyance for some more enlightened Administration to put into effect.</P>
    <P>Could I ask that this report be given to Dublin Corporation and that Dublin Corporation, who many people feel are official vandals, be requested to implement this report and that we could even at this stage, see what might have been had the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission not been so peremptorily abolished and cut off.  I would like to think that this could be done and that something good would come out of this.  I wish to reiterate my acute and keen disappointment at what will be seen by people in the future as a parsimonious, mean-minded, negative response from Government to our capital city, the capital city of all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly glad to speak on this motion because I am independent and I speak as an Independent. I would greatly regret it if this matter of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were allowed to become a small-minded matter of party political dispute because I believe it is far more significant <Col N="1936" /> than that.  I also believe that any political party, or indeed individual, who snubs the city of Dublin is taking a grave political risk.  I have no doubt whatever from listening in the streets and in the public buildings of this city that this is precisely the view that is taken by the people of Dublin.  I would take this opportunity to remind the Government that Dublin as a city is not only one of the cities of Ireland, it is our capital city, and it is a city in which all of the citizens of the State have a direct vested interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, like many other Dubliners and people throughout the country, was excited even before I knew the specific proposals of the Metropolitan Streets Commission because the echo of that name carried me back to the eighteenth century and to a very practical body called the Wide Streets Commissioners on whom, I belive, this commission was at least in part modelled.  I would refer the House to the fact that as Dr. Maurice Craig reports in his book &ldquo;Dublin 1660-1860&rdquo;, in January, 1756, the city petitioned in the matter and the following year an Act set up the commissioners.  By the end of the century they were spending £25,000 a year.  It was they who achieved the articulation between the two independent and privately sponsored fashionable quarters, a cognate development was the Paving Board set up in 1773 for paving, cleaning, lighting, draining and improving the streets.  These enactments show a very high degree of enlightened planning and were well in advance of their time.  They left us a Dublin the breadth of whose streets still astonishes the stranger.  They are the very embodiment of unsentimental utility.  It seems that there you have a very good argument for reconsidering because as has been said already, we have because of the cooperation of various Governments and various interests and in particular the present Government, a number of elements already existing.  You have the designated areas, the Custom House Docks development site, you have the creation of the Dublin Traffic Authority, but these are all elements and, as I think my colleague, Senator Bulbulia, was suggesting, <Col N="1937" /> it is counterproductive to develop the Custom House Docks site, to develop the designated areas and to miss out that link which is absolutely essential to the prospering of the whole area.  It simply frustrates logic.  I would appeal to the Minister to think again about this issue.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Metropolitan Streets Commission, as I understand it, was to increase pedestrian amenity and access, to reduce traffic and to get rid of the plastic signs which have been so colourfully and poetically described here this evening.  It was the intention of the commissioners to encourage shopkeepers to expose the facades fully, to give a greater traditionalism of design and to encourage civic planting and so on.  The name of Mr. Patrick Shaffrey has already been mentioned and we can look to one of our provincial cities, Kilkenny, for an example as to what might have happened in Dublin.  I personally, as a Dubliner and as an Irishman, feel it is shameful that we have to look to one of our provincial cities for the example we should follow in this great capital city.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been made about money, and I was very shocked indeed to hear my university colleague, Senator Shane Ross, speak on this question of money and profligacy and so on, because I do not believe the mathematics of the situation have been fully understood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to, but I certainly do not wish to be in a situation of confrontation because although I am prepared to be critical, I want to lay the basis for positive suggestions.  I do take very much to heart the remarks of the <Col N="1938" /> Minister's colleague, Deputy Pádraig Flynn when he said that although he was not a Dubliner he wished to take a very positive view and he was not in any sense anti-Dublin.  I believe this is true and I believe this is also true of the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.  What I say is not intended in any carping sense. However, I have had discussions with people centrally involved.  As I understand the simple mathematics of it, there was a sum to be made available from the central Exchequer of £10 million.  This was to be matched by a package which had been very carefully put together and costed of another £10 million from central city businesses, traders and so on. For this expenditure &mdash; and this has been fully costed and I am sure the Minister can go back to the commissioners and ascertain this &mdash; if you take the return of tax at the end of the day for the expenditure of a mere £3 million, the Government would get value of £20 million.  In any housekeeping budgeting, to spend £3 million and get £20 million benefit is a very good deal indeed.  It is also unquestionable that if you spend this money it is, in a sense, priming a pump, and I have every sympathy with the Government in terms of the cutbacks that are necessary.  I have spoken on a number of occasions not so much directly against cutbacks but against the principles that underlie them.  I did this with the health cuts, in regard to which I suggested that a principle was necessary to be looked at first of all.  As regards spending this kind of money in the inner city, first I accept some of the difficulties in quantifying the returns because many of them do come through tourism and it is difficult to estimate this kind of spin-off revenue exactly.  However, it is unquestionable that if you deploy this kind of economic power to the centre city area, you begin to get investments from large institutions, such as pension funds and so on.  There is no doubt about this.  If you feel I am partisan in some way, perhaps the members of the business community in the centre of Dublin and former members of the Metropolitan Streets Commission could be consulted about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1939" /> I would greatly regret it if it was suggested that there was some kind of indecent opposition between the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  Over the past few days I had the opportunity to speak to Mr. Frank Feely, Dublin City manager.  I said to him that I was very sorry to hear this might be the case. Although occasionally I criticise the corporation, I am not a pathological &ldquo;corpo&rdquo; basher.  I give them credit when credit is due with the result that I get on moderately well with Mr. Feely.  Mr. Feely asked how that could be the case since he was one of the principal commissioners.  I asked Mr. Feely if he would be prepared to sit on a reconstituted commission of some kind and he said he would be glad to do that.  Mr. Feely may regret having said that to me now but I indicated to him that I would make this point in public which should help to scotch the notion that this is in some way an attack on Dublin Corporation.  If they feel that, it is perhaps because they feel a certain guilt.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey said that the job of rejuvenating the inner city should be done by the local authority.  They have had 150 years to do it and they have not done it.  The city of Dublin which is their responsibility is, to coin a phrase, a thundering disgrace.  I do not want to be too contentious and to apportion blame but because of the enormous scale of the bureaucracy of Dublin Corporation and because of the many difficulties and worries that assail that body, it seems to be perfectly legitimate and very good sense to establish a separate project orientated task force which is what this Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission is. The Government would be very foolish to turn away this resource.</P>
    <P>I would like &mdash; because I believe in being positive &mdash; to pay great tribute to the members of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, in particular, to Mr. McNulty who has already shown what can be done in the acquisition of Malahide Castle and its refurbishment as <Col N="1940" /> a major tourist centre, to Paddy Shaffrey, an extremely distinguished architect, who has benefited this country, not just the city of Dublin.  I would like to pay particular tribute to the fact that with great generosity of spirit, which I sincerely hope the Government will feel able to match, Mr. Shaffrey and his colleagues have undertaken to work, if necessary for nothing, until the report is completed.  I strongly support Senator Bulbulia's suggestion that this report should at least be made available.  I understand that there may have been political feelings of some kind involved.  I do not know.  I am too junior and too new a politician to be sensitive to this area but it does seem that there is more than a possibility that this does exist.  When my friend, Senator Ross, says nobody believes for one moment that this Government do it out of any motive except to save money and because it cannot be afforded, that may be what people think in the stockbroker belt, but in the inner city of Dublin believe you me that is not what people believe.  I will not reduce the dignity of the House by saying in this session precisely what the people of Dublin believe, but it not quite as naive as that.</P>
    <P>I accept that mistakes of sensitivity were made by the commission.  Mistakes of sensitivity may very likely have been made in the method of establishing the commission and the way in which certain officials were treated &mdash; that appears from reading the speeches.  I appeal to the Government to overlook this and to think in terms of the national interest rather than any monetary advantage.  I hope that they will not totally slam the door.  The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission are gone but an opportunity provides itself for something to be done to replace them.  When I say there may have been insensitivity, I was horrified to see the proposal that Nelson's Pillar should be re-erected.  If anything could be guaranteed to land such a commission right into the middle of controversy, this was it and I regret it.  It was foolish and unnecessary but that is gone; let us think afresh; let us get something done on <Col N="1941" /> behalf of the city of Dublin and not include these rather ludicrous proposals for the re-erection of Nelson's Pillar.  It should include proper funding and some practical instrument.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the millennium and about what is intended to be done for it.  It is very sad that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission should have been abolished in some sense almost to coincide with the millennium itself, which is a very great pity.  I hope and urge, for a variety of practical reasons, even if it has to be thought out again, &mdash; I am greatly distressed to see the Minister shaking his head &mdash; that at least the package that had been so carefully put together should be re-examined with an open mind just to see if, in the interest of the city, something could be done.  The people of Dublin will take a very harsh view if nothing is done and if we cannot even emulate the 18th century when we had a city which was the finest in Europe.  We are now left with a seedy provincial town, <i>si monumentum requiris, circumspice.</i>  I am sure I have pronounced that incorrectly but from my Latin class I remember that what it means is: If you want a monument, look around you.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister and the Government that if the people of Dublin in 50 year's time want a monument to this Government, they may well not find a very pleasant one unless the Government take a much more positive view of the city of Dublin.  I appeal to them to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very useful, very interesting and very positive debate.  Many of the earlier speakers, Senator Doyle, Senator Bulbulia and Senator Norris have been very positive in what they have had to say on this motion.  I disagree with only one point raised by Senator Norris.  As somebody living in Dublin but born in Kilkenny, I see nothing wrong in looking for examples as to what we might do in Dublin to that fine and noble city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know we live in hard times and that there have to be cutbacks.  We spent <Col N="1942" /> the past five years telling the people and the Government that this was the situation, but they said we were alarmist, insensitive, and monetarist although the Taoiseach now admits we were right.  We were accused of being Thatcherite and unimaginative.  Every effort we made to implement cuts was frustrated by the party opposite who now find themselves in Government having to implement cuts more severe than any they could have imagined.  Be that as it may, we see now that there was not a better way and the public have been subjected to an avalanch of cuts.  If accounts in today's papers and talk around the House are anything to go by, &ldquo;we aint seen nothing yet&rdquo;.  We can expect further more severe cuts over the coming weeks.  We can also expect the implementation of the 1988 budget by stages during the last weeks of this month and in August.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, unlike our predecessors in Opposition, support the need for many of these cuts.  We supported many of the cuts specifically while we have objected in detail to others and, in some cases, to the way in which they have been implemented.  We regard some cuts as counterproductive, illogical, as having no economic sense, likely to create more problems than they resolve and ultimately to cost the Exchequer more in terms of lost revenue.  Some cuts, in short, are daft and this is one of them.</P>
    <P>I will go back to the origin of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, although this ground has been covered very well by previous speakers.  The decision to establish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission was taken because we recognised the problem could not be resolved in the ordinary way by ordinary agencies working through normal prodecures.  The normal agencies, as we will call them, had two decades to come to terms with the problems and they have not been successful.  One has only to walk from this House down to the Parnell Monument to see the extent of the failure of the normal agencies in this case.  It is not just the ugliness that speakers have talked about; it is not just <Col N="1943" /> the garish, honky-tonk fixtures and fittings, the predominance of fast food outlets and disc stores.  It is not just the absence of any symmetrical or thematic planning, the absence of integration that strikes one.  It is much worse.  It is the failure to grasp the potential which Dublin offers, the failure to use the great possibilities which nature has given this capital city of ours.  It is still not too late to make the centre of our capital, of Ireland's capital, a centre of which all our people can be proud, a centre which can increase the tourist potential of Dublin, which will be attractive to the people who live here all the year round and to the people from the country who visit Dublin from time to time.</P>
    <P>Clearly, over the years, the relevant authorities have been handicapped by two main factors: the size of the problem and the multiplicity of the agencies involved.  It simply was not possible, under existing planning legislation, to devise and implement a unified planning and design concept for all of this area.  It was virtually impossible, over the years, to co-ordinate the activities of the legions of services, sometimes competing services, involved.  There are really no sanctions which could be imposed on those who lowered the whole tone of areas or, in many cases, those who were allowed to persist for lengthy periods of time, in flagrant violation of planning legislation or by-laws.  This was the size of the problem. It was enormous.</P>
    <P>Then there was the nature of the problems involved &mdash; the absence of any co-ordinated agency capable of dealing with them in an integrated urgent way.  Most of all, as far as the development of the city centre of Dublin was concerned, there was the absence of any leadership. Even when many of the businesses in the city centre areas, or people who still live in those areas, wanted to improve the overall sense of the area, there was no single body capable of offering a unified plan which could be implemented.  There was little incentive for many of the businesses to get involved in piecemeal restoration. First of all, the premises beside <Col N="1944" /> them could be tawdry, cheap and garish thus damaging their efforts, and the concept within which they could operate. We could have restoration work done on one building set to a particular style while somebody up the road would adopt a totally different style.  In the end there was likely to be a conflict of styles, mishmash of different styles and different eras.  The whole thing was likely to be some kind of dog's dinner, much worse, perhaps than if nothing had been tried. That was the size and the nature of the problem involved in the attempt to create a city centre of which we could all be proud.</P>
    <P>The answer to those problems was not to be found within the existing structures. Certainly that was clear.  The existing authorities had time to try to sort this matter out and failed.  To a great extent they themselves admitted this failure.  If they did not, the people of Dublin and those who visited the capital city were certainly very conscious that failure had been visited upon the efforts to create the sort of Dublin that would be worthy of its history and of its place as a capital city.</P>
    <P>The solution to this problem was both new and old.  In the 18th century the Wide Streets Commission were called into being.  That a commission had very sweeping powers and gave Dublin much of its present day character and grandeur. They established the base from which Dublin developed.  When the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland looked at the problem he very rightly concluded that some body with the powers of the Wide Streets Commission were needed to tackle the problems as they exist today, such was their depth and nature.  Out of that was born the idea of the Dublin Metropolitan Street Commission, the 20th century version of the Wide Streets Commission. That new Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, as set up, had many advantages. It was packed with expertise, imagination and enthusiasm.  Tribute has been paid by other speakers to Mr. Shaffrey and the others members of that commission. Had they been given the chance <Col N="1945" /> that commission would have brought to their work a great deal, if not an unrivalled amount of know-how, expertise, flair, sensitivity and enthusiasm for the task in hand.  Its composition was sufficiently small to allow for rapid decision making.  It was not going to be a bureaucratic body answering back here there and everywhere, stifled, as are many local authorities, by the absence of any rapid decision making process.  That commission, was small, knew its business, could take decisions and act quickly.  To a great extent, that was the value of that body.</P>
    <P>The members of that commission also had imagination as we saw from the plans that were published and the ideas expressed by some of them.  Certainly there was imagination in great quantity. What is most important they also had public backing.  Indeed, few initiatives have been so warmly welcomed in this city over the past number of years.  Those welcoming them included the present Lord Mayor, the city centre business groups, An Taisce, various environmental groups.  In fact, almost anybody who has concern for the development of this city welcomed what was being set up as being necessary, timely, imaginative seeing it as the right idea in the right place at the right time.  All of the major agencies involved in the re-development of our city welcomed the establishment of that commission.  Indeed, much more important, the vast bulk of Dubliners saw it as something which was needed, which was timely, with which they could empathise and to which they gave their support. In all of this the new commission was the right size, had the right ideas, the right people and had public backing.  On top of that they had a specific mandate, a job to do and were approaching that job with urgency and imagination.</P>
    <P>What we see here &mdash; I say this in no polemical sense &mdash; is a lost opportunity. I have known the present Minister of State for a long time.  I have always regarded him as one of the most open-minded and fair-minded members of any party in this House.  He is a man who, <Col N="1946" /> when he sees a good idea, is capable of grasping it and evaluating it fairly.</P>
    <P>I do not want this to become a party political issue.  For that reason I am not going to push this motion to a vote this evening.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to come in here, as have other speakers, to put our case to the Minister.  I think the Minister will agree it is a good case.  I know the present constraints and difficulties.  I am not asking the Minister to back down, change his mind or to give way.  I am asking him, in all fairness, to listen to the people who have spoken here this evening, to realise the spirit in which this motion has been put, to grasp the central thrust of what we are trying to do, to be persuaded of our sense of urgency and importance.  I ask him to look at this idea calmly over the summer months &mdash; it cannot be changed for this year.  Even if that commission is reinstated with a different name, even with somewhat changed personnel, if the idea and the thinking behind it live, then I will be happy.  In that sense I commend the motion to the Minister.  I will not be calling for a vote on it because I believe it is not a party issue.  It is an issue which affects all of the people of this city and country.  I ask the Minister to accept it in that spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear at the beginning of my contribution that I am on the side of those who deeply regret the decision to dissolve the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  I have read the previous day's debate on the matter.  I have been here for the entire debate this evening.  There have been some very good and well-researched speeches on the matter.  Certainly I do not intend to repeat some of the very cogent points which have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to do instead is to look quite closely at the root of the decision to dissolve the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  I am very glad that Senator Manning is not going to put this to a vote because as an Independent Member of this House I would particularly like to examine not in a partisan or political way but just in an open and fair minded way <Col N="1947" /> what is best for the city of Dublin.  One point I would make and make it as somebody who served for four years on Dublin City Council: I understand the feelings of members of local authorities in Ireland about the gradual dimunition of powers of those who serve on local authorities, the frustration, the difficulty of getting things done.  That is true of local authorities generally and certainly particularly true of Dublin City Council.  I speak from personal experience.</P>
    <P>I would very deeply regret it if that understandable concern not to have powers further depleted or to be deprived of existing powers and functions in local government were such a major factor in the Government members of Dublin City Council as to have generated a sufficient reaction against the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission to have it dissolved. That appears to be one thread, that these functions could be exercised by Dublin City Council and it is wrong to deprive Dublin City Council of the capacity to do it.  There is an answer to that.  That answer has been given by a number of contributors.  The answer, in fact, is that if you want to accelerate and make more effective the decision making process, then you cannot do it by the existing powers partly resting on Dublin City Council, partly resting on Dublin Transport Authority, partly resting on the Garda and so on.  As I understand it, the purpose of the Act which established the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission was a pragmatic assessment that, in fact, you could not get relatively quick and effective co-ordinated decision making to transform the centre of the city on the basis of the existing local authority structure and the fragmentation of functions and responsibilities that existed &mdash; a pragmatic decision, particularly pragmatic because the commission were going to be charged with responsibilities for a period of three years.  They were not intended to be a replacement of local authority powers and functions.  It is very important that we all reflect on that.  It would be a great pity if the understandable concern of members of a local <Col N="1948" /> authority for their powers were thought to be a reasonable or a full response to the creation of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.</P>
    <P>That commission are perfectly compatible with the continuance and the reinforcement of powers of Dublin City Council.  What they do is to accelerate over a certain period by having a particular focus, by having certain statutory powers which do not at the moment appertain to Dublin City Council, by generating goodwill, by securing a response from the private sector.  They would have been able to lift the issue, to provide that kind of zip and innovation which is so badly needed if we are to see a transformation of the centre of our capital city. I would have to say, having considered sympathetically the question of whether they take powers from Dublin City Council, that I cannot regard that as a convincing argument against the establishment of a three year commission to provide that kind of focus and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>The second objection which has been put forward is money.  There again, it has to be regarded as a very serious issue at this stage in Irish life.  It is a serious issue but I would say, particularly having listened to the debate and the contributions on both sides, it surely cannot be the fundamental issue.  First of all, we are talking about an allocation of £10 million, £3.4 million a year over the three years initially.  I would say at this stage that if we were to halve that allocation, you would get the same performance from the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission because those who are involved, and the private sector who view it as a very welcome thing, would give the same commitment for half the money.  You are not, in fact talking about money as being the be-all or end-all of this.</P>
    <P>The kind of energy, creativity and goodwill that was generated by the commission greatly exceeds any allocation of, be it £5 million or £10 million.  Also, we have seen during the lifetime of the commission, during its brief period of existence, a phenomenal response by the <Col N="1949" /> people of Ireland to our national lottery, which I greatly deplore but it is there. The national lottery funds exceed by a factor of five or ten to one what the expectation was.  There is a great deal of money in the national lottery funds that is not being deployed at this stage for a purpose.  If we are serious and if we recognise what the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission could still do, then I do not believe that money is really the issue.  I do not believe there necessarily has to be a budget of £10 million over three years.  It could be less for the reasons I am giving.</P>
    <P>When people are committed to something they will in fact, if necessary, do it for nothing.  Look at the example that the commission are giving at the moment. The members of the commission are going to work voluntarily to complete their report because they fundamentally believe in what they are doing.  I do not accept the objections advanced by the Minister and by speakers on the Government side and, indeed, by my university colleague, Senator Ross, who concentrated on this money aspect of it as well.  I do not accept that argument at all. It is countered by the reality.</P>
    <P>Are we somehow talking about some philosophical objection, the philosophical objection being to a proposal for a statutory body that came from the previous Government and the baby is not the child of this particular Government? I hope that the future of the centre of Dublin would not come down to that.  I am not making that as a party political point but it is better to identify all the possible threads.  I hope we are not saying that because this was an initiative of the previous Government it could not be carried forward by this Government if this Government are satisfied of the merits of it.</P>
    <P>Anybody who is considering the arguments put forward on both sides of the issue in the course of this debate cannot but feel that the arguments for retaining the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission are infinitely more compelling and cogent than the objections which have been raised &mdash; objections relating <Col N="1950" /> to somehow potentially depriving Dublin City Council.  It would not be.  It is a three year upgrading of a particular focus on Dublin city centre and a co-ordination which would have to come by way of a statutory body which has been envisaged and the money simply is not in itself either large enough or unobtainable enough, even in the present exigencies, to be an objection.  It would be possible to reduce the overall amount that we are talking about and still achieve a great deal of the objectives which were behind the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>Now I come to what I think is a very important procedural or structural factor in relation to this proposal.  It was possible to come forward with a proposal for a statutory body for the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission precisely because Dublin is a capital city.  It is the city of all citizens of Ireland.  It is the capital and therefore is a city which has a particular place for all citizens of the State, regardless of where they were born and brought up.  I am a Mayo person myself; I live in Dublin and I have a very strong affiliation with Dublin.  We are all like that.  It is reflected in the fact that because it is the capital city you can, by means of an Act of Parliament, establish a statutory body for a limited period of years to do a very important task, to revitalise, to rejuvenate and to stimulate the development of the central core of the capital city.</P>
    <P>It would be much more difficult to justify in political and structural terms having a statutory body for other towns or cities in Ireland.  There it could be said &ldquo;Why are you cutting across local authority powers and functions?  Why are you doing it?&rdquo;.  That does not apply when one is talking about the capital city.  We had the example that Senator Norris and Senator Manning referred to of the Wide Streets Commission.  There was a recognition at that time of the importance of a body focusing and concentrating on the aesthetic and living-in quality of the centre of Dublin.  We all recognise the seriousness of the problem.  We all recognise the degree of official neglect there <Col N="1951" /> has been and the degree of official misjudgment, to put it at its politist, of how to deal with the centre of our capital city. We see each day all too visibly around us the degradation and deprivation of the centre of Dublin as has been referred to.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the problem we have been discussing in the context of this motion.  The establishment of a statutory commission for a period of three years is a purely pragmatic decision to get action. It cannot be viewed as cutting across local authority powers.  It simply enlarges for a brief period certain powers in relation to the central core in order to get decisions taken and implemented.  It cannot be said, even under the present economic stringencies, that money is not there in terms that would prevent the commission from functioning.</P>
    <P>As I have emphasised, the commission could achieve a very considerable proportion of what they wish to achieve on less than the allocation which the previous Government had in mind, £3.4 million a year.  As has been emphasised by a number of contributors to this debate, that money was in effect seed money to call down private funding, private investment and private support which is there ready to provide the necessary goodwill and concentration of resources because the spin-off will be there.  The private sector know very well that if we can transform the centre of Dublin then we will improve tourism, we will improve the economic life of the country, people will come back to live in the centre of Dublin and the spin-off, as Senator Doyle said in his very moving opening speech on this motion, will be tangible and will far exceed any investment.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, who has clearly been following the debate with interest and attention, to consider the issues as they have been put, to weigh the objections which have been advanced by the Government and to consider the possibility of finding a middle ground, if I could put it that way.  In doing so, I would like to ask the Minister to clarify the present position under the Act.  The Minister for the Environment has dissolved <Col N="1952" /> the commission.  I would like to ask the Minister if the commission could be revived because the Act has not been repealed?  Would the Minister clarify that?  That is presuming, of course, there is a Government decision to revive it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will be able to formulate that question adequately in a minute.  I will happily give way to the Minister in the hope that he might give me an answer to it.  If the commission could be revived, then there is a number of possibilities.  If money is the problem, then either halve the budget or quarter it &mdash; but let the commission get on with their job and let them do within the limits of their budget what they can do.  If the problem is that members of Dublin City Council feel that their powers are being encroached upon, then enter into a dialogue with the members of Dublin City Council, and I include Senator Haughey in that.  I read his speech with interest. He did not pin-point what powers the city council would be deprived of.  He did not refer to the very limited time span, three years.  He did not refer to the input of the Dublin City Council, particularly through the involvement of the city manager in the commission.</P>
      <P>There is room for discussion.  There is room for a formula to be found which would pick up again and allow to flower and develop the enthusiasm, the good will, the personal commitment and the economic commitment of the private sector which was ready to let the commission perform the function of transforming the centre of our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the problems of inner cities and all that is associated with it is becoming almost an international moaning game at the moment.  It seems it is not a problem that is just confined to Ireland and Dublin alone but many other cities and indeed many wealthy countries have similar problems.  However, having said that, that does not at all mean that we can hide <Col N="1953" /> our head in the sand and forget all about it.</P>
      <P>As have been said many times in the debate, Dublin was, and indeed to a large extent remains, one of Europe's great cities.  However, to a large extent neglect has set in in a fairly big way especially over the past decade or two.  It is saying very much the obvious if one mentions that many of Dublin's grandest buildings have now been reduced to rubble, or if not, have been replaced by structures that are somewhat an offence to the eye and totally out of place environmentally. The condition of Dublin as a whole, and especially the central area, is in a sorry state and it quickly needs treatment.</P>
      <P>Like many other speakers I was, therefore, quite excited with the prospect of this new change and new attitude to our capital city which the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission might offer. It seemed a new and original approach. Furthermore, I was exceedingly impressed with the array of talent that consititued the members of the commission. Other Senators have quite rightly paid tribute to various individuals. I will lump them together so to speak and say it would be rather difficult to get such a wide ranging, committed and skilled body of people that the membership of the commission could offer by way of advice and planning.  Therefore, a move of that sort was very much a step in the right direction.  Indeed, it was a big step forward not only from the point of view of tackling the problems but I would have hoped in creating a greater awareness of the problems that had to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is agreed that something must be done and done quickly with Dublin.  If not, the entire middle portion of the city will be a place that will be deserted and will therefore, slide further downhill.  The problem then is to keep up the momentum.  I agree that the proposal to establish a commission did fire many people with enthusiasm.  Of course it also raised hopes and expectations and I hope these expectations and the enthusiasm will continue and remain.  If the commission are not going to be restored, something equally effective must be put <Col N="1954" /> in place.  If this work is going to be done by the corporation it is up to them, the Minister and the Government to ensure that a proper, businesslike and meaningful approach is adopted.  There is no point in saying that such will be done if it is not going to be done.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, over a number of years, it is fact that the corporation have been rather lax in some of their work with regard to Dublin.  There has been a rather slipshod approach to Dublin. Many Senators have spoken about the plastic signs which we all agree are a total disgrace and are completely out of place. Not only are there plastic signs but there are extraordinary architectural buildings going up.  Even in an old city like Dublin, renewal is necessary in order for it to survive but some of the renewal that has taken place is of a rather vulgar variety. I need go no further than mention what I refer to as &ldquo;the black box&rdquo; in Westmoreland Street which is one of the most ridiculous buildings put up within its environs.  I am not talking about it as a modern architectural building as such.  It might be quite all right in a different place but it is completely out of place in the streetscape and environment of Westmoreland Street.  That applies to various other buildings as well.</P>
    <P>It appears that there is concern not only among Senators and citizens of Dublin but throughout the country about the fate of the city and, in particular, the fate of the inner city.  As a result of this goodwill I thrust the Minister will be able to get somebody to move quickly who will do an efficient and sensitive job. Dublin has to be looked at from a sensitive point of view.  If it has been decided that the commission is not to be restored and if the job is to be done by the corporation, a proper and well thought out plan must be worked out well in advance. Otherwise we will have more of these <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements.  It was these <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements and lack of care which led in the first place to the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>We are all very conscious of money at present.  Everything costs a certain amount of money but we have here something <Col N="1955" /> which is rather difficult to buy, that is, quite a lot of goodwill.  There is intense concern among people and, therfore, there is goodwill to do something about Dublin.  I am quite certain that is also the intention of the Government.  It will be the method and approach to the problem that people may vary on to some extent. If we have this goodwill it must be harnessed to try to rescue Dublin.  It is interesting to hear that business firms, and so on, have offered to put some money into Dublin not only commercially.  We have had a very spirited move recently by the Irish Life Assurance Company who are making their contribution to the millennium by financing a display of Viking Dublin in St. Audoen's Church in High Street.  With that sort of commitment from commercial firms and with commitment from individuals one is on the way to restoring Dublin and recovering it from the rather sorry state into which it has descended.</P>
    <P>There will be major problems in restoring Dublin back to what it was in the past.  I hope there will be practical help available from various interested people. We will need technical as well as financial help.  In this way the Government can help.  It is very important to have people living in Dublin again.  This applies to some of the splendid Georgian houses.  I was pleased to hear the other day that the Minister for Finance is sympathetic to the suggestion that income tax relief should be allowed for expenses arising out of work or maintenance carried out on listed buildings.  Some of these factors should be taken into account.  My hope is that the Government will enlist the great deal of goodwill, expertise and financial help that are available.  If this work is to be carried out by somebody other than the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  As would seem to be the case, the Government should not allow their interest to wane.  I hope the Minister will see to it that whatever work is done will be done quickly, sensitively and in keeping with the overall environmental and architectural features of this city.</P>

      <P>I will take only a few minutes.  I should like to thank the Minister for the Environment who came here last week and contributed and also the Minister present tonight.  I am thankful to all Senators who contributed.  It has been a very interesting debate especially the contributions I heard tonight from Senator Norris, Senator Robinson and Senator Hogan.  They touched on the real issue.</P>
      <P>If the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were established by a Fianna Fáil Government and I was a member of the city council I would have welcomed them wholeheartedly.  I cannot understand why certain officials of Dublin Corporation believed that it impinged on their functions.  The remit of Dublin Corporation is very wide and covers many functions.  They neglected the main arteries of our city.  The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission were there to assist them for just three years to give them new ideas and let them get on with the work until the commission would be dissolved having completed their work after three years.  Senator Norris said that at the end of the three years they would have been self financing.  I fully accept that and I made the same point in my own contribution.  They had tremendous potential and would have encouraged the private sector to become involved in a way that it has not been involved before. The initiative was there and they showed great interest in the matter.  I am sorry that has been killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The designated areas of 27 acre site is a vital aspect of our city now.  It has to be revitalised and under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, the Government have designated certain areas and given certain financial incentives for these areas to be developed.  The Government have taken a very special interest in the areas along the quays and the 27 acre site. They are all interlinked with the Dublin <Col N="1957" /> Metropolitan Streets Commission because, if you develop one part of the city, you must develop the centre of the city.  The analogy can be drawn that it is no good painting the side windows of your house if you fail to paint your front door.  That is what the Government have failed to see and acknowledge.  I am glad that my leader, Senator Manning, is not pressing this matter to a vote because we do not see it as a political issue now that the commission has been dissolved.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating what I said last week in addressing the Minister: if the Minister were to reconsider his decision in this matter it would not be considered a U-turn.  It would be considered a very brave and courageous decision and would be acknowledged by all the citizens of the nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put a few points on the record.  I very much admire our capital city; I count it as part of my own although I am from rural Ireland.  It reminds me of my younger days, going up Jones Road to Croke Park when we were playing <Col N="1958" /> there.  I understand the city's heritage and all it stands for and I would like to see it well kept.  I have special responsibility for urban renewal and I would like to see some improvements made to the quays &mdash; I am not happy with that &mdash; and I hope I will be able to have some development work started there as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Members are elected to Dublin Corporation every five or six years and the membership is made up of people from all parties and some Independents.  In my view they have served us well and I refer to all the parties across the political divide, including Independents.  It is Dublin Corporation's task to look after Dublin.  The ratepayers and the people of Dublin fund the corporation and the elected representatives are responsible. Who was going to do the work for the commission when it was brought into operation?  Dublin Corporation would have to do it and there was an overlap in the services.  I want to say &mdash; and I hope I am not being offensive to any member or official of Dublin Corporation and I would not want it to be taken in that context &mdash; that there was some room for improvement and if that improvement comes about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that Senator Doyle mentioned this because some people say tighten your belt and get the finances right but they never ask where the money is to come from.  Their attitude is to get the finances right but let it not affect them.  I say to them that they cannot have it both ways.  I will not wear that.  I am too long in the business for that.  They say get the finances right, get the balance of payments right, get the current budget deficit right.  There was some talk about private capital investment coming along but I have not seen any of it on paper.  It was all talk.  It was reported there was £X million available from private individuals or private investment, but I have not seen this investment money and neither has my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has arranged a special <Col N="1959" /> task force made up of officials from Dublin Corporation and I have no doubt but that the members of the corporation will keep in touch with that task force also.  I hope that they will come up with constructive ideas for doing the job.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that we are not as litter conscious as other countries I have visited, and that is a reality.  The inhabitants of some of our major towns are not as litter conscious as they should be and this is true also of my own constituency. We throw our waste around loosely.  That does not happen in other countries because they are litter conscious.  There is a place for their garbage.  There are bins.  You do not see those people throwing litter out of car windows or dumping it on the roadside.  We are not as litter conscious as that, and you only have to remember the tonnes of litter that were loosely left around after a recent event in Dublin.  Are we conscious of this?</P>
    <P>I hope that Dublin Corporation in conjunction with the task force will address our litter problem and I have no doubt that they have the ability and the workforce to do this job if they get the right encouragement.</P>

    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The special ground rents purchase scheme that is administered by the Land Registry under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, originally had a life of five years and was extended by legislation in 1983 for another year and again in 1984 for a further three years to 31 July 1987.  The purpose of this very short Bill is to extend the operation of the scheme indefinitely.</P>
      <P>The general right to acquire the fee simple is given by the Ground Rents Act of 1967.  That scheme is, in the case of dwellinghouses, supplemented by the simplified and less costly procedure provided by the 1978 Act, which I had the pleasure of initiating.  For a fixed fee the Land Registry undertake the legal work involved in the acquisition of the fee simple of dwellinghouses.  A considerable number of people have availed themselves of that procedure &mdash; the total number of applications received into the Land Registry between 1 August 1978 and 31 May this year was 52,742.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of such applications <Col N="1961" /> are made by persons in occupation of their dwelling house, who have the consent of the ground landlord to the purchase of the fee simple.  The current fee in these &ldquo;consent&rdquo; cases is £26.  The position following the 1984 legislation is that all fees may be revised by ministerial order but, since the scheme is self-financing on the basis of current fees, I am glad to say that no increase in fees is called for at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not purport to deal with any substantive issues for the reason that we must get the Bill through if the special purchase scheme is to continue after 31 July next.  However, the scheme is now in operation for nine years and it may be that some aspects can be improved. There is, for example, the question of assimilating the scheme more to the ordinary registration functions of the Land Registry taking into account the fact that by virtue of this legislation the scheme would be placed on a permanent footing.</P>
    <P>In the context of possible future changes, I want to mention also the question of ground rents payable to local authorities. Many such rents are for nominal amounts, payable if demanded, which are not and were never intended to be collected.  The No. 2 Ground Rents Act of 1978 gives local authority lessees the right to buy out their ground rents but it may be that since what we are dealing with here are public sector ground rents further arrangements can and should be made to enable their ground rents to be brought to an end.  That is another matter I am having examined.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is confined to repealing the provision of the No. 2 Act of 1978 which limits the period within which applications may be made under Part III of that Act.  Section 1 proposes the repeal of section 18, as amended by an Act of 1984, of the No. 2 Act of 1978 and its effect will be to ensure that the Land Registry scheme of ground rents purchase shall extend beyond 31 July next.  Section 2 is a standard provision in relation to short title, construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Before I begin a very brief contribution on this Bill, may I commend the Minister for the very moving ceremony which he and his Department organised today in Iveagh House to confer citizenship on the refugees from Vietnam who have been living in this country.  He is to be commended for the way in which the ceremony was organised and it can do nothing but good to make these people feel they are full citizens of their country of adoption and show to them and to the world that they are very warmly and generously welcomed.</P>
      <P>I will be very brief, because this is a non-controversial Bill.  Clearly there are still a large number of ground rent tenants who are anxious to avail of the scheme set up under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978.  I see it as a relatively simple and inexpensive way of buying out the fee simple of their properties and we on this side of the House fully support that.</P>
      <P>However, if the Bill is welcome and non-controversial, the whole question of ground rents continues to be highly controversial, highly contentious and capable of generating a great deal of heat if not light, especially at election time.  This is not the appropriate time to enter into that controversy.  This Bill is simple and welcome and this is not the proper occasion to go any further, but I ask the Minister to give some thought to the possibility of preparing a White Paper or some document on the whole question of ground rents.  It has been around for a very long time.  It raises its head especially at elections.  It is the source of a great deal of misinformation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question has been abused by certain political parties and activists in <Col N="1963" /> spreading false information about what is possible.  It is an emotional subject.  It is a question the justification of which many people have great difficulty in accepting, and it might be a great public service if the Minister &mdash; perhaps during the summer recess &mdash; could have prepared by his Department some short document on the history of ground rents, the current state of play and what options are open to us as a people.  It is not a party issue.  It is an inheritance from the less happy parts of our history in many ways, and simple information, simple factual statements on what the options are would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>For example, what are the constitutional difficulties in face of the abolition of ground rent at present?  What are the constitutional options open to us if we were to have a constitutional referendum on this question?  What would be the cost of compensation to the public Exchequer, to the taxpayer, should the parties in this House decide &mdash; because I suspect it would have to be an all-party matter &mdash; to go ahead with some form of abolition of ground rents?  Who are the people who would need to be compensated? Who are the people who own the ground rents?  These are some of the questions which many people would like to see resolved and they can be resolved only if there is a fair, open, factual discussion. I know the Minister's Department are busy, but the publication of a paper of this sort could be enormously helpful to the debate.  Having said that, may I welcome the Minister into the House and say that we, on this side of the House, have no difficulty whatsoever in supporting the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill is to extend the operation of the special ground rents scheme. I congratualte the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, who initiated the 1978 Act which provided a new method for the purchase of ground rents on dwelling houses.  That Act has proved to be a great success.  The number of people who had <Col N="1964" /> applied up to 31 May 1987 was 52,742. This Bill is to allow people to purchase their ground rents.  The purchaser can purchase his ground rent by paying the ground landlord's cost of the transaction. The Land Registry fee is fixed at £26 and this Bill ensures that occupants of dwelling houses can free themselves of ground rent in a reasonable and effective manner.  The special purchase scheme had a life of five years when it was initiated and since then it was extended on two occasions, on the first occasion for one year and on the second occasion for three years.</P>
      <P>It was first introduced in 1978 by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins.  On both occasions there was an increase in the fees to cover the cost of administration. I notice that there is no increase in fees on this occasion.  I would like to congratualte the Minister again for proposing in the Bill to extend the life of this scheme indefinitely.  I am quite sure the ground rent tenants will welcome the amending Bill.  It will enable those ground rent tenants to purchase their ground rent in as simple and inexpensive a way as possible.  I am also delighted to see that the Minister is considering ground rents paid by local authority tenants to local authorities and that he may introduce special arrangements which will enable local authorities to bring an end to ground rents.</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by welcoming the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill.  Many people who have ground rents will be enabled to purchase them in a simple and very inexpensive way.  I hope the Bill will get a quick and safe passage through this House as I notice it must be law by 31 July 1987.  Again I should like to congratulate the Minister on initiating the Bill in 1978.  We are delighted he is here again to have it amended effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their very gracious welcome to this Bill which extends the life of the special ground rents purchase scheme indefinitely.  I am sure it is a welcome that will be shared by ground rent <Col N="1965" /> tenants who will continue to have an optional purchase procedure that is as simple and inexpensive as possible.  This has been the reponse in recent weeks of callers to the Land Registry and to my Department who inquired about the future of the scheme which was due to expire on 31 July 1987.  There is an old trait of character in most of us Irish that we wait until the last day to do a lot of things.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to the House to know that when it was introduced in 1978, a limit of five years was put on the life of the scheme and wisely so because you cannot just create a mechanism and leave it there forever, bearing in mind the cost. It was hoped that many of the people who were genuinely interested in buying out their ground rents would use the mechanism which we set up to facilitate them and to help them to do just that. There was quite a rush at the end of the five year period.  The Bill was extended for one year and subsequently for three years with the same logic behind it.  We are going for an indefinite period this time because we believe that the well orchestrated, politically-motivated campaign that was conducted against this legislation which I introduced in 1978 has lost ground and has lost faith.  The people see that it is there for their benefit and to help them to by out ground rents.  Over 50,000 people have availed of the scheme and I hope many others will also avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that during the course of this debate Senator Manning, as leader of the Opposition party in this House, wisely and maturely but cautiously commented on the campaign that was waged against the legislation.  I am glad, like every Senator in this House, that that campaign has failed.  It was good legislation, trying to help in a very difficult area.  It was one of two pieces of legislation which I brought in around the same time.  The other No. 1 Bill prevented, as and from then the creation of any new ground rents on dwelling houses.  The House will agree that since that Bill became law no new ground rents on dwelling houses have been created.  It is a pity I suppose that <Col N="1966" /> we did not get around to thinking along those lines five or ten years earlier.  Part of the problem as has been pointed out by Senators Manning and McEllistrim, was that it is a very complex area.  There were those in the earlier years who believed that ground rents could be confiscated without compensating those who legally owned them but that could not be so.  You just cannot confiscate without compensating.  That point was been made during the course of reasoned argument on this issue.  We had a Landlord and Tenant Commission chaired by the late Judge Conroy, a friend of many of us in this House and in the other House, a man whom we all respected.  He put great effort into this question of ground rents. A genuine frustration was felt by all those who had to deal with this subject.  I am speaking knowledgeably on this because I have discussed the matter with Deputy Paddy Cooney who held this portfolio in 1977 and who genuinely wanted to try to deal with this problem.  There were, and still are, constitutional problems and difficulties, as Senator Manning has pointed out.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems in this area, other than constitutional ones, is the one of compensation.  It has been estimated &mdash; it is a guesstimate &mdash; that £35 or £40 million would be required to compensate persons who are legally entitled to compensation in the event of the ground rents being abolished.</P>
    <P>I certainly will take on board the comments offered during the course of the debate on this issue.  I am not sure if it is necessary to provide a White Paper on the subject but I am not closing the door on it in any way.  I am saying I am not sure for the simple reason that we have had quite a number of debates on the matter in this House and the information on that is already available to those who are genuinely interested in the issues.  I say that very deliberately because there were obstructionists in this case and they were entitled to their views even though I do not accept them.  We could collect all that sort of information and have it available by way of an information sheet to anybody interested.  It is very wrong <Col N="1967" /> that emotions can be whipped out at election time or that pressure groups fronting for political agencies or political parties can be used to create confusion in the minds of people who do not fully understand what is involved in this area.</P>
    <P>I am having a number of matters examined in the Department.  I will, when we are ready &mdash; and I hope it will not take too long &mdash; come back to the Oireachtas to try to improve the situation.  This scheme has worked well.  We are not interfering with the price structures.  We are happy that the fee being paid at present, £26 where there is consent &mdash; this was mentioned by Senator McEllistrim &mdash; is sufficient to cover the expenses that are there.  That fee for that type of transaction is a minor fee in comparison with what one would have to pay in the outside world if one had to engage a firm of solicitors to do the job.  It is a good scheme.  It has been in operation for nine years and it is totally non-political.  It can operate more successfully now that the orchestrated campaign against it has lost momentum and is unlikely to get off the ground again.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <P>I was making the point <Col N="1968" /> that people are getting very health conscious about what they are eating.  This is re-echoing my first point that Ireland could become the good food, the clean food, the natural food centre of Europe. I was making the point that in a restaurant last night I was sitting beside someone who was having fish, and they asked if the fish was from the Irish sea or the Atlantic.  The fish was from Dingle, and it was good fish as one would expect but the difficulty now is that a lot of fish which originated on the east coast is being sold out of boxes on the west coast.  I have just come from a different restaurant where I had my tea and there were a couple sitting at the table next to me discussing holidays. They were not talking about Ireland.  They said they were going to holiday on the Atlantic coast because it would be much cleaner.  People are interested in this subject.  They are entitled to look for clean air, clean seas and pure water, and that is what we can offer them.  We have resources which deserve to be maximised and developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the whole area of sea and water recreation, hobbies and leisure time activities.  When I was growing up in Dingle there were regular sea angling competitions at all the west coast ports. That activity has died down, and I would like to know why.  We have probably the best coastline in Europe for sea angling &mdash; sea angling festivals and competitions &mdash; and it should be encouraged because it is an activity which can take place irrespective of the weather.  It is like scuba diving to which I referred earlier.  Scuba diving is a growing sport but there are many parts of Ireland where the activity is not carried on for the simple reason that people who wish to go on diving or skin diving holidays cannot get their air tanks filled locally.  This is simply an air compressor, no more difficult than the compressor used in most garages for pumping tyres, but if people cannot get their air tanks filled they cannot use that area for diving.  These are the kinds of small facilities that can attract groups of people.  I am talking about meeting the needs of small groups because that is <Col N="1969" /> the way we will eventually build a big industry.</P>
    <P>The Irish coastline is absolutely brilliant for sail boarding and surfing.  I will not go through every sea and water sport, except to say that we have the facilities, we have the ambience, and the proper environment.  Let us keep it clean and sell it that way.</P>
    <P>My other point relates to canals and river boats.  The Shannon, the Barrow and various canals have a huge amount to offer.  I had the figures, I lost them during the day but in terms of the comparison between the number of boats per mile on the Norfolk Broads as opposed to the Shannon, there is no comparison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That is something we should be selling more of. This is a cause of wonder to foreigners who come to Ireland on a boating holiday. One of the nicest weekends I have ever had in Ireland was when I travelled by boat from Tullamore to Robertstown and back, calling at places like Edenderry along the canal.  It was a winter weekend in October and the weather was fairly bad, but it was a weekend apart.  It was something very special and I have no doubt that this kind of thing can be sold. You do not need islands off the west coast to get away from it all.  There are rivers, canals, etc. in the centre of Ireland which also give that same sense of being close to nature and to the environment.</P>
      <P>We have had the problem of the pollution of some of our inland lakes for a number of years, and I am glad to say it is a problem that has been acted on, and is being resolved at the moment.  That was a scandal.  I am not sure if the way forward is to impose more penal sentences or harsher fines on people who pollute our rivers and lakes.  These people are attacking our heritage when they pollute our waters and unless we take it personally, we will not go forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is a positive move.  We do not need to be critical of our country.  We need to be positive about <Col N="1970" /> developing the arguments for a better tourist industry.  I wish the Minister well in his job and I hope he will see that every penny is spent in a positive, practical and forward thinking way.  I welcome this Bill and I support it.  Finally, we have national natural resources that people want to be part of, that can compare with any country in the world.  They are ours, they are different and let us sell them to the world that way.  That is the image we want.  Let us keep our country clean so that people will want to return again and again.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to this House and wish to congratulate him on the good work he is doing.  I congratulate him also on behalf of his young constituents from Killinaleck. It was a pity there was no media presence in Sligo when the national award of Fir Óige was being presented. The three finalists in that contest, which deals with tourism, were from Castlebar, County Mayo, my own little village of Grange and Killinaleck.  Killinaleck won the contest and great credit is due to them because they have done great work in the interests of the environment.  In the Year of the Environment they reclaimed a two acre field from rocks, rushes and scrub and made it into a beautiful park.  It is a pity that Pat Kenny, who sends his team where there is shooting and fighting and people getting injured, did not send them down to Cavan, Sligo and Mayo to see what the youth are doing in a positive way.  It is a great pity that RTE would not send their cameras there because it would help tourism and would show the good side of youth.  The majority of our youth are great people, but they are judged by what the minority do.  I call on RTE at this late stage to send down a team to see the projects these all Ireland finalists produced.  We should see that in a proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the Bill, I ask the Cathaoirleach to allow me to refer briefly to a statement made here today in a very disparaging and disgraceful manner about our colleagues the county councillors and elected representatives of Ireland.  They were referred to in a very <Col N="1971" /> derogatory manner.  I graduated from a local, rural vocational school where I was taught to speak in a clear, coherent and civil manner.  I am very sorry that some of our university graduates in this House &mdash; not all of them, thank God &mdash; referred in a harsh, arrogant manner to our colleagues and elected representatives.  It is sad when men and women of that calibre cannot control their tongues and speak in a civilised manner after all the money that was spent on them in elaborate universities. They are a disgrace to themselves and their schools and indeed to the teachers who taught them.  The Senator tried to confuse issues when he referred to the monstrosities of office buildings.  I would like to remind him that colleagues from his own university designed, planned and organised the erection of those monstrosities.  It was not the county councillors.</P>
    <P>The Senator went on to talk about section 4 to try to implicate the councillors in this ridiculous work.  Let the Senator get his points clear and separate the two.  Section 4 relates only to where a son or a daughter wants a house on their parents' land.  If the bureaucratic machine wants to deny a father or mother the right to allow their son or daughter to build on their own land, we will always oppose it because we will be with the people.  If some of those eloquent people had been around 100 or 200 years ago, I wonder would the beautiful Rock of Cashel, a tourist attraction today, have been referred to as a disgrace on the skyline?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in trying to broaden the scope of landing facilities for the air services.  It was unfortunate for the Minister that the deal which he got was vetoed, not because it was a bad idea but because it had political implications for two other countries.  It was a pity that those people did not air the problem with the Minister for Foreign Affairs instead of penalising tourism.  We congratulate the Minister on the efforts he is now making to try to circumvent the problem and to make that deal a reality.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Joe O'Toole speak in a positive way because in yesterday's paper Ambassador Heckler said if she had any criticism of the Irish it is that we are negative.  We should speak positively.  Why are we always knocking ourselves?  We have many good things: let us discuss them and make the best of them and much of the negative thinking will vanish.  We have very good hotels and guesthouses.  One can still get very good bed and breakfast for £10 a night which you would pay in any other country in Europe, and a lot more.  In this city a person can get quite a nice three course meal for £2.50.  They talk about the price of our food but many of these people compare a cafe in a foreign country with Jury's Hotel and think the two should be on a par.  They forget they are going into a grade A hotel.  If they go into the same hotel away from Ireland, they will pay pretty sweetly and smartly. Guesthouses are doing very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tidy Towns Competition help to project a great image of our towns and villages but we are not litter conscious. Too many people throw away their litter and they do not care if it is thrown at some other man's door.  It is a pity we do not remember the words of Goldsmith, &ldquo;that if every man in front of his own door swept, the village would be clean.&rdquo; Everybody should dispose of litter in <Col N="1973" /> proper receptacles; county councils provide plenty of bins and baskets and it is a pity they are not used.  We could make our country like many rural villages &mdash; a place of joy and beauty.  The Tidy Towns Competitions are doing a great job and they get a lot of help from the tourist board which must be complimented.</P>
    <P>Nobody mentioned the fact that we have got a number of blue flags for our beaches which indicate that we have some very clean, pollution-free beaches. I am delighted Sligo was awarded three flags, for Enniscrone, Rosses Point and Mullaghmore which indicates at least 50 miles of beautiful coastline in County Sligo.  I am sure the waters in between are as good as the areas where the sampling was done.  Therefore, we have 50 miles of beautiful crystal clear coastline in County Sligo and I sincerely hope people will come to swim there.  Senator Joe O'Toole can be assured that there is no sewage in the sea around Sligo.</P>
    <P>We have many beauty spots like Drumcliffe and Lisadell in County Sligo but we do not have the personnel to provide tourists with information.  In my own area last year 33,000 people signed the visitor's book in the church beside Yeats's grave. As 33,000 signed the book at least 50,000 must have visited the area but there is not even a pamphlet providing information. Perhaps the Minister will consider providing finance because it would not cost a fortune to publish pamphlets or to have trained personnel available.  People come to see Yeats's grave but they know nothing of the history of the Celtic Cross, the Round Tower or Colmcille, and there is nobody to sell them a leaflet giving information.  We tried to establish a centre in Drumcliffe but we could not get the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are doing a good job but they seem to ignore the west, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo.  All the promotion work is on Dublin, Shannon, Killarney and Cork but not on the West.  Yet, the taxpayers of the west are contributing to tht major sales campaign abroad.  Our west costline that has the cleanest <Col N="1974" /> beaches in the EC, or at least as clean as any others in the EC &mdash; worthy of the blue flag &mdash; is not receiving the attention or promotion it should.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we have not but the Minister will be sympathetic to our region anyway.  Cork has been the beneficiary for a long time.  We must be positive. Any fool can break an egg.  It takes a great man to gather together the segments. We are great self-bashers.  We must not be expecting sunshine holidays at home.  We do not get the volume of sunshine here.  We have many amenities we are not selling to best advantage, particularly in the west.  If we could get some money we could promote the west and the very historic sites located there. Now that the west has been awarded the blue flag this is a clear indication that our beaches must be up to standard as are our fish.  If the sea is clean the fish will be good and healthy.  I should like to see the west promoted more vigorously by Bord Fáilte.  I should like to see more grants given to promote what might be termed as a personalised service with officers to advise people when they visit an area. This would mean that people could return home with some little knowledge of the history of the region they had visited.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill and wish him well in his task.</P>

      <P>Senator McMahon spoke and welcomed the Bill in general and dealt with various points of interest on the general tourism scene.  He extolled our scenery, history, landscapes which are so appealing to outsiders and to ourselves emphasising the relaxing atmosphere which visitors experience in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator McMahon sugested that we should appoint a native of a particular foreign country as an official of Bord Fáilte, somebody who would know the scene in the market from which we are trying to attract tourists.  It is true to say, in fairness to Bord Fáilte, that they carry out punctilious market research in various countries.  At one stage I think people were so employed.  I remember many years ago &mdash; before I was elected to the Dáil &mdash; being in Munich and meeting a very intense young German, who was prepared to tell me all about holidays in Ballyheige.  He referred deliberately to Ballyheige to indicate to me how well he knew his job.  The point made by Senator McMahon is a good one in so far as it indicates the importance of market research.  I have noted that.  I know that Bord Fáilte work fairly diligently in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McMahon mentioned the British tourist and the effect or impact the troubles in the Six Counties have had on that branch of our tourism.  I must say the tourism industry in my area depends very heavily on visitors from Britain.  I had an experience some years ago which the House might like to hear about in that perhaps we exaggerate the impact the troubles have had.  They have had an impact undoubtedly.  But this is my experience.  Some years ago, aided by the regional tourism organisation, a group of people who have guesthouses and hotels in the Cootehill area of County Cavan did a small tour of coarse angling clubs in Lancashire and in north west England. They succeeded in attracting over 100 anglers to that area &mdash; rich in lakes and in the kind of fishing in which they were interested.  I had an opportunity to meeting most of the 100 anglers at the presentation of prizes.  The competition was <Col N="1976" /> well organised.  The accommodation was good, the food provision, the packed lunches, all the special needs of those anglers were catered for.  I consulted most of them.  I had no brief in tourism at the time but I was interested.  Hardly any of them knew that they were within a few miles of the Border.  Very few of them knew that there was any trouble there at all.  They were interested in their fish, in getting specimen fish.  They caught them, weighed them, threw them back into the lake or river and registered them for their coarse angling register back in their club. It was a lesson to me that there are various levels of political sophistication and of tourist sophistication.  Those people got exactly what they wanted on that angling holiday.  There is a lesson in that for us when we are assessing the impact of political happenings.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the troubles did impact heavily on Donegal.  Some Senators from Donegal spoke here today about that.  That was mainly because, when I lived in Donegal, the strength of the tourist trade there came from the majority section of the Six County population. Needless to say, the troubles had a very heavy impact on that tourism. Senator McMahon mentioned British tourists, as did other Senators, as constituting the backbone of tourism in many parts of this country.  They are good spenders. They save for their holidays.  They know what they want.  They spend their money and are quite critical if the standards are not up to their expectations. They are not looking for a grade A hotel standard.  They want a solid standard and, for the most part, they get that in the parts of the country that have specialised in them.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon mentioned that local authorities have obligations.  He mentioned road signs as one weakness in their area.  It is true that there are weaknesses in that area.  The Department of Tourism and Bord Fáilte are not remiss in calling the attention of local authorities to their obligations in this regard.  We are not the only country at fault there.  I know that on the Continent of Europe &mdash; which is much boosted with regard to tourism <Col N="1977" />&mdash; in various areas, including important places like Le Havre, there are serious deficiencies with regard to signposting as well.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon mentioned the state of our beaches and the high newspaper propaganda about them.  I do not know I have no first hand evidence with regard to this but I do know that, at times, a newspaper headline is not an indication of the real situation in particular areas.  I had occasion to write a letter to one of our national newspapers which had picked out the complaints section of the Bord Fáilte report, not indicating that this represented less than 2 per cent of the total number of people who had contacted Bord Fáilte.  The headline went to the complainers.  The substantial service and success of what was provided did not make a headline at all and was not even mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission was mentioned by Senator McMahon.  While that is not my remit I know that all citizens of this country have a special regard for the capital city.  I made a study of Maurice Craig's book <i>The History of the Architecture of the City of Dublin.</i>  I know what was done for the city of Dublin in the past, particularly by the Earl of Ormonde and the Wide Streets Commission.  Maurice Craig is very lucid and expressive in the way he deals with the development of the architecture of Dublin city.  I am convinced that the Dublin City Council, their officials, the expertise they have at their disposal will not let the city down in regard to the development that had been siphoned off for the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  I know that the expertise of the architect, Mr. Patrick Shaffrey, whom I appointed to the Board of the National College of Art and Design when I was Minister for Education &mdash; who is a native of my county &mdash; will be available for anything that refers to the development of Dublin city.  It is not my role to comment on what Senator McMahon said but I am convinced that there is nobody on any side of the House that has a monopoly of concern with regard to the maintenance and development <Col N="1978" /> of our capital city.  I am convinced that as far as the Government are concerned, there would be no fall down in its regard.</P>
    <P>I remember in reading history that the Earl of Ormonde by his direct intervention did two very important things. He saw to it that the quays would be maintained, that the houses would not be built down to the edge of the river and we owe to him the fact that we have open quays and open access along the river to the heart of the city of Dublin.  The other debt we owe him is the preservation of the Phoenix Park as a natural amenity for the citizens of Dublin.  It was to be given as private property to the Duchess of Rutland, who was the mistress of George I, as Craig quaintly puts it, rewards in Ireland for services rendered in England, but the Earl of Ormonde succeeded in blocking that particular act, and she never forgave him until the day she died. When she said to him that she hoped to live to see him hang, he said to her: &ldquo;Madam, I hope to live to see you grow old.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To continue with Senator McMahon's contribution, I think he may have over-emphasised the danger to tourists of thievery by urchins in the city.  We should keep a balance.  I know the problem exists, but I do not concede that it is the major problem which Senator McMahon would lead us to believe it is.  He mentioned the lack of caravan sites, that there were two, Ballybrack and Shankill.  I know Bord Fáilte are conscious of this and are very anxious to develop a caravan site somewhere in the vicinity of Dublin. Senator McMahon mentioned the Dublin Mountains as a proper location and I would agree with him.  I think Bord Fáilte have been trying to get a private entrepreneur to interest himself in such a provision, but they have not been successful as yet.  I refute his interpretation of what I said with regard to statistics.  I said that the statistics I was using and comparing with the statistics from 1986, in fact, did compare like with like.  I was comparing the statistics of the months before the trouble started with regard to Chernobyl, before the bombing of Libya and before <Col N="1979" /> the statement of the United States President that the citizens of that country should not visit Europe, so I was actually comparing like with like.  It was a valid comparison.</P>
    <P>Again, Senator McMahon mentioned a neglect of domestic tourism.  It is important to realise that what I actually said in my speech was that on becoming Minister I became aware of the importance of emphasising domestic tourism and £75,000 of the extra money which I succeeded in getting was allocated to the development of domestic tourism.  I agree with all the Senators who said we cannot and should not be trying to compete with the sun.  We all respect the sun, love it and become very Mediterranean if we get three or four hours of sunshine &mdash; most of us did last Sunday exactly that &mdash; but we are not in that contest.  We have some things to offer that the sun countries have not got to offer and it is on those that we are going to lay emphasis.</P>
    <P>I have my own views about tourism and particularly tourism from Spain and Greece where many of our citizens spend a great deal of money.  They regard their holidays as good value for money and so on but we should counterattack.  There are sectors, even if it is very upmarket sectors, in those communities where we can get tourists in the future.  We can get them for our very upmarket hotels.  It is money into the country.  They find the sun no novelty, but the heritage we have here, the kind of country we have and our environment should be attractive to them and I have indicated to Bord Fáilte that I would like a counterattack in those countries.  Even if they are only targeting 2 per cent of the population, that would carry some profit for us in the future.</P>
    <P>A rather Delphic statement was made by Senator McMahon when he was finishing up, that I said something different in the Dáil from what I said here.  I refute that, too, until evidence is produced.  I do not believe that happened, but I would like Senator McMahon to convey to me what he thought I said in the Dáil on this debate which was different from what I said today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> The next speaker was Senator Vivian O'Callaghan, who is involved in the tourist business as an hotelier and has expertise developed by participating in the tourist organisation in the south of Ireland.  He quoted from the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report which was prepared for the Irish Hotels Federation.  That report was sound, the ideas in it were good and the indications are &mdash; they expressed them &mdash; that tourism will be the biggest industry in the world by the year 2,000 AD.  That is why we should give the industry great care and attention at present, not IBM, General Motors, or Mitsubishi but tourism and we can participate. We cannot participate too well in Mitsubishi &mdash; or with difficulty, anyway &mdash; but we can participate in what will be the largest industry before the end of this century.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan said that the ethnic tourist is very important as far as we are concerned, that fares were a severe stricture on such tourists up to now and that the access costs, the tariffs and so on, being brought down will impact heavily on the numbers that will be coming here.  He did appeal also for a five year plan for tourism and I can assure him that that is well under way.  A skeletal five year plan has already been made out.  We have various things to take into account, including the results of a very expensive consultancy study which was commissioned by my predecessor and which we will soon be getting.  We will take whatever wisdom we can out of that also, to incorporate in our five year plan.</P>
    <P>It is important to target our markets. On a number of occasions there were statements that the targets were not high enough and that we fell down on that particular aspect of tourism hitherto.  We know that Bord Fáilte have accepted the targets we have laid down for them; they are ambitious targets but Bord Fáilte are striving to achieve them in this year and they will be set targets in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan mentioned that the UK had been rediscovered.  I know that, if the UK tourism flow stopped, there are whole areas of the country where there would be no tourism at all. <Col N="1981" /> I have already mentioned one area and I do not intend to re-emphasise it. However, I do want to say that the new head of Bord Fáilte in the UK, Miss Margaret Cahill, who was in the United States for a long time, blitzed the UK early this season and the results of that publicity blitz are very encouraging.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan said that in the demographic composition of the population of the United Kingdom at the moment, there are ten million pensioners who are reasonably comfortable on their pensions.  They are able to save a certain amount and are able to take holidays.  That is an area that should be targeted because those people found they can drive safely here.  They are a little nervous about driving on the Continent and I would not blame them.  Motorists on the Continent hoot, dash around and get jumpy and nervous.</P>

      <P>We are much more civil and we should claim the credit for it when we are.  Those people would have a language problem on the Continent.  Ireland is a place where they would like to come and they should be made welcome.  This is an area we should target.  I know from my own experience and from a friend of the family &mdash; an English woman who lives in London &mdash; that there are holiday groupings among that age group and they get very good bargains.  She is in China at the moment because somebody put a holiday package together for the group to which she belongs.  About 150 of them went to China.  I am glad that Senator O'Callaghan mentioned this because it is an area that we too could explore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan said that the price of drink is a handicap.  That is all relative.  The contrast is with Britain and certainly the price of drink here is much more expensive than it is in Britain.  I will not go into the question of quality <Col N="1982" /> because it would take me too long and I would need a hydrometer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I have a receipt in my pocket for a Jameson which I bought in a hotel in Luxembourg.  It cost be between £3.50 and £4 and it was not a very big Jameson.  If we are comparing, we should compare like with like. When we compare our top hotels with the top hotels in most of the continental countries our hotels are very reasonable in comparison.</P>
      <P>I take the point and the whole country and anybody interested in tourism takes the point about the 10 p.m. closing time on Sunday nights.  Legislative proposals are en route to deal with that problem. Senator O'Callaghan mentioned the pub culture and some Senators were <i>en rapport</i> with pub culture and some were not. I do not have to declare myself but in literary Dublin most people were <i>en rapport</i> with the pub culture.  It was said, of course, that literary visitors to Dublin were amazed by the plots for short stories, plays and novels that they heard in pubs and a cynical Irishman said: &ldquo;Do not worry; they will never be written.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator O'Callaghan complained about unapproved accommodation. There is no solid evidence either in the Department or in Bord Fáilte that would enable us to deal with that problem. There are constitutional issues involved. How can one interfere with the freedom of a person to take somebody in?  The complaints made by Senator O'Callaghan were about unapproved accommodation but we do not have the evidence to make a categorical statement on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He deplored, and rightly so the impact of fish kills on the tourism product.  Any area, including my own, that has had experience of fish kills because of pollution of one kind or another has been devastated.  It is sad to see a front page of a local newspaper almost taken up with a photograph of fish which have been killed as a result of carelessness either because of silage effluent or pig slurry effluent.  In my area, Lough Sheelin has <Col N="1983" /> been a great sufferer.</P>
    <P>The Tidy Towns Competition, which was Bord Fáilte's original idea, has been a great promoter of taste in our towns. Senator O'Callaghan said: &ldquo;Plastic out and craftsman's work in&rdquo;.  That is a true summation of the whole business.  He also talked about planning and said that in his area in south west Cork planning provisions were sometimes ignored.  He instanced a place where a house has been built but the concrete slabs are still in the front garden.</P>
    <P>With regard to payola, we have no proof that tour operators, coach drivers and so on are getting money from business people to bring visitors to their premises rather than to any other premises. If any Members of the Seanad know of any such instances they should bring them to the attention of my Department without delay.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan mentioned workshops and these have proved to be very successful.  The people who participate in workshops have to pay for the rent of their premises.  He thought that the smaller hotels were not gaining much advantage from these workshops and if they did not participate they gained nothing, that participation was expensive and they were depending purely on Bord Fáilte for their promotion.  Perhaps the solution lies in a get together of a number of smaller hotels in order to be able to participate.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan expressed appreciation of Bord Fáilte and what they have done in the past.  He outlined also the conclusions in the Stokes Kennedy Crowley study.  He mentioned CERT.  I should like to put on the record of the House my appreciation of what CERT have done in the hotel training area.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan and other Senators mentioned the danger of developing a kind of mechanical tourist attitude.  If that comes we will lose what perhaps is our basic strength.  We have a natural gregariousness and an affinity with people.  If this shows, as it has been showing, in the personnel at desks in hotels and in the people who provide <Col N="1984" /> other services it is a greater boon than a shining sun.  If there is a frosty face which would freeze the warmest day in May, all the effort put into the tourist industry will be no good.</P>
    <P>I spent some time in the United States of America last summer, I am not being chauvinistic but of course I am naturally biased trying to be dispassionate and objective.  I must say that our hotel personnel, when compared with American hotel personnel, for the most part won hands down.  The personnel in the United States were efficient, businesslike and so on, but there was a certain lack of warmth which I do not think has fully penetrated into this country and I hope it stays that way.</P>
    <P>Senator John A. Murphy said that, in order to appreciate the quality of our life, it is essential to live for a while outside the country and he mentioned Boston. He said that our easy going informality was a strength in the community and a strength in an area such as tourism.  He went on to say that was the obverse of the coin but the reverse of the coin was that that easy going informality encouraged littering, not taking pollution seriously, and so on.  It was a philosophic point and there may be something in it. He mentioned Inchigeelagh in beautiful west Cork where somebody took the wheels off an old truck and left it in the most beautiful site in that area.  The local authority should shift such eyesores as soon as the local ganger, foreman or whoever reports them.</P>
    <P>He said we should give instructions in the schools.  I think for the most part the schools do this but perhaps we should have a formal programme about littering, pollution, care of the environment, love of nature and the study of the flora and fauna of our country.  He said also, and I agree with him on this, that public disapproval of littering, public disapproval of carelessness with the environment, is very important but it is part of the same process, that if the children are trained in time they, in fact, will be the organs of public disapproval later on.  He claimed that the Litter Bill to which he referred, which went through both <Col N="1985" /> Houses of the Oireachtas, was now a dead letter.  I do not believe that is so. It should be strictly and consistently enforced.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned something that is fairly close to my own heart and that is the contribution that summer schools can make to tourism.  He said that summer schools &mdash; and there is one in University College, Cork, one in University College, Dublin, one in University College, Galway, there is the Yeats summer school which takes place each year &mdash; bring people into the country.  They get their impressions at student level and they are lasting impressions.  Today's students are tomorrow's tourists.  I would support that fully.</P>
    <P>He made a plea for Bord Fáilte's support. Bord Fáilte have indirectly supported some aspects of this summer school movement already.  All over the country we have various people who have become world figures in the literary world.  I do not like to commercialise or cash in on it so to speak but for people who are devotees of Yeats, there is a summer school in Sligo each year.  Shaw was a Nobel prize winner and a native of this city but I never heard of a Shaw seminar or summer school here.  Joyce is an international figure and there is a little bit of a 16th of June display each year, and some talk about Blooms Day but, again, we have not impacted as well as we might to benefit the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased at the conference workshop which was held in the Hilton Hotel in London to find a man from Trinity College there with a stall.  He had booked out Trinity for the summer months.  This is a great benefit to our tourism industry.  A couple of summers ago there was a two or three weeks seminar on Berkeley the philosopher, on his life and works, and scholars from all over the world were there.  Again, it is a contribution to tourism.  That is not the primary purpose or objective of the summer school and far be it for me to suggest it should be.  The development of scholarship is the objective but incidentally it is a help to our tourist industry.  The <Col N="1986" /> grandfather of Henry James, who is a cult figure in the literary world wherever English is spoken or studied, was from County Cavan.  I would not mind if somebody took up this cult figure and developed a summer school for Henry James in my county.  I would not object to it at all.</P>
    <P>The walks which I mentioned in my original speech have been developed by various community councils, by Bord Fáilte, by various groups; for instance, there is the Táin walk, taking the route of the people involved in the Táin Bó Cuailgne, there is a Kerry walk, there is a Wexford-Wicklow walk, there is a Cavan Way, which links up with one in the Six Counties.  I hope somebody will have the idea of having a complete around Ireland walking tour, not necessarily a competition, but a walking tour before very long.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said he was a walking fanatic.  Indeed, he might even organise it for me later on.  He said that walkers do not mind the rain: they expect rain and that is it.  He said it does not rain that often, anyway, although there were some Senators who expressed disbelief at that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Next to speak was Senator Kiely whose contribution concentrated on the major attractions in our country and the welcome visitors should get.  He expressed disappointment that there was not a properly developed mode of conveyance for visitors to his particular part of Ireland, a licensed operation for taking people to the Blaskets and the Skelligs and so on. He made a statement which I disagree with, that somebody had stated that the General Council of County Councils in Ballybunion that 85 per cent of the people of France who were interrogated on some particular occasion did not know where Ireland was.  I believe that could have <Col N="1987" /> been so 20 or 30 years ago, that people were not very much aware of Ireland.  I suppose the sophisticated groups were but the mass of people on the Continent were not quite as aware as they have been since we joined the European Community.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche have also taught a little geography uphill and down dale in France, Italy and Spain.  I do know if you said Irlandes at one stage in Spain they would say Hollandes and think you were a Dutchman no matter what you looked like.  It is an exaggeration to say we are not known at all by 85 per cent of the people on the Continent.  It is just not true.</P>

      <P>One hundred per cent of the French know where Kerry is.  He said also that interest-free loans are better than grants and he may have a point here. If people get interest-free loans they know they have to pay back the loans and it commits them more to the development of business and also makes them think before they embark on a business which might not have a great chance of success.  He also criticised the licensing laws and the signposting.  Both of those matters have been covered already.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning said &mdash; I hope the voters are listening &mdash; that I had a difficult task and he wished me well in it.  He said that everybody regarded themselves as an expert in this field and that it was difficult to take on interest groups.  I agree with him in that.  At times, in the interest of tourism, interest groups will have to be taken on particularly in regard to litter and pollution.  To galvanise local authorities into action two areas should be part of my mission and I intend to make it so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> The burden of Senator Manning's speech was his call for a major reappraisal of Bord Fáilte on the basis that they had become part of the establishment.  He felt I was right in setting targets for Bord Fáilte and that I was monitoring their achievements.  He was not fully correct in saying that Bord Fáilte spend £23 million on advertising.  He was not quite comparing like with like when he said that £110 million of advertising was what the private sector spent each year and that £50 million was the RTE advertising revenue.  In fact Bord Fáilte had about £11 million available to them for advertising.</P>
    <P>He rightly emphasised that carriers such as Aer Lingus, B &amp; I, Sealink, Ryanair and CIE were putting money into advertising and that it is part of our duty as public representatives to try to assess the impact.  It is difficult to assess who sold what to whom in the tourism field.  The hotel groups also spend money on development.  His pertinent question was, how many visitors are tourists because of Bord Fáilte's promotional campaign?  He said that statistics were imprecise and I agree with him.  It is very difficult to come upon hard statistics.  The EEC is aware of this problem.</P>
    <P>I got a paper which I read late last night on tourism statistics.  There is a model being structured at the moment and it will have to be tested in the field afterwards at EEC level in order to assess the tourist statistics.  I will await that with interest as it is difficult to get hard facts.  If you have the grandson of an Irishman coming from London to visit his people in Clare, Galway, Donegal, Cavan or wherever, is he a tourist or is he here purely because of the ethnic connection?  If Bord Fáilte were not selling, would he think it worth his while coming here?  There are many variables and questions which are very difficult to answer.  I will say that the money Bord Fáilte spend on the publication <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> is certainly well spent.  It is magnificently produced; the writers are of top calibre; the advertisements are of the best we produce and they advertise only what is produced by way of arts and crafts etc. <Col N="1989" /> in Ireland.  They do the job of advertising Irish goods very well.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also commended Bord Fáilte on the original idea of the Tidy Towns and on their production of brochures.  He mentioned areas over which Bord Fáilte had no control such as the problem of terrorism, the weather, the weakness of the dollar and so on. These are all variables.  He made the point that Bord Fáilte complain they have not got enough money when the season is not successful and that they claim the credit when the season is good.  The year 1985 was very successful and I am convinced one of the chief reasons for that was that the dollar was on a par with the punt and was stronger than the punt at one time.  There is no point in trying to pretend anything else; that was the main reason we had a big influx of American visitors.</P>
    <P>The final point made by Senator Manning was that there was a problem of image, that our image was too vague. He said there is an image for Spain, for France and for Britain &mdash; although I would not be too sure on that one &mdash; but that in French and German magazines he could not exactly extract the image of Ireland that Bord Fáilte were trying to sell.  He mentioned wolfhounds and redheads in that connection.  I suppose what <i>Dublin Opinion</i> used to call &ldquo;Caitlín Ní hula ní haín&rdquo; with the red head may not be enough now for the hard sell on the Continent or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission already.  I gather there was some discussion about it which I did not hear. I made the point already and I will not repeat it.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning felt that Bord Fáilte were not brunt enough in their marketing, that they did not have the sharp edges they should have and were an ageing organisation.  As I said, a very expensive consultancy report has been commissioned and we are awaiting the findings of that report.  We should have the report in a week or two.  We are putting together a five year plan and all these things will be taken into consideration. <Col N="1990" /> Professor John Kenneth Galbraith was in town recently and one of the points he made was also made by Senator Manning, that all organisations as they begin to age &mdash; like us all, I suppose &mdash; should have a look at themselves and try to make themselves more efficient.  The Senator felt Bord Fáilte were not taking on the challenge in the way they would have done in the sixties, that they should be giving a lead.  I think those sentiments would find general agreement.</P>
    <P>They would find specific agreement with Senator Paddy McGowan who made the next contribution.  He indicated that one-third of the beaches of Ireland are in Donegal.  I know most them and I agree fully with Senator McGowan with regard to the pleasures of those beaches.  I know the beaches of Kinnegar, Rossnowlagh, Portnoo and Bundoran well.  Both Senator McGowan and Senator Loughrey felt they were being neglected in the north-west corner of Ireland.  As Minister for Tourism and Transport, I feel it incumbent on me to say here that I will pay particular attention to what both Senators said about that area and if I find even the slightest scintilla of evidence that that is so I will in so far as it is in my power take steps to remedy it.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan mentioned the effect that Killybegs school has on the Irish tourism industry.  CERT and the Donegal Vocational Educational Committee help that school.  It is one of those schools that has deserved well of this country.  Its contribution to the tourism industry is unquestioned and I hope it will continue to show the vigour it has shown from the beginning.  He was very hard on Bord Fáilte.  He said that he had tried for seven years to get an interview with the director general of Bord Fáilte and had failed, and that Donegal County Council asked the director general of Bord Fáilte to go to see them &mdash; I think they were two different directors general &mdash; and had failed.  Perhaps he has a legitimate grouse in that regard.</P>
    <P>He said that Donegal was outside the pale of recognition by Bord Fáilte.  He said that when there was a question of <Col N="1991" /> laying off 2,000 in the Dublin hotels there was a big brouhaha in the newspapers but if the same number of people lost their jobs in Donegal it would not excite people to the same extent.  He exhorted me to see to it that Bord Fáilte spent their money wisely and that there should be a concentration on regional headquarters. He indicated he had sent me a draft of a paper with regard to co-operation between Donegal, Derry and Tyrone &mdash; I do not know if Sligo and Leitrim are being excluded from the club &mdash; but he invited me to amend the draft and communicate with him.  I thank him for the invitation to amend the draft.</P>
    <P>Many Senators, including Senator McGowan, emphasised the importance of the industry for jobs.  Senator Fallon pointed out its place in our strategy.  It is one of the areas we have targeted for the creation of more jobs.  I have this theory that every good citizen, <i>optimus quisque</i> as the Latin says, should gear himself or herself to getting as many visitors into the country this summer and it will have the effect of increasing employment.  He evoked the sacred name of the Boyne when he was concluding and said he hoped that the tourist industry would be successful north of the Boyne.  I am in 100 per cent agreement with him.  The Boyne is invoked by all kinds of people politically and socially and in that invocation I concur with Senator McGowan.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte mentioned the price of drink and cigarettes and, in the context of the British tourist, this is very important. The British working man was a very important constituent of our tourist industry.  The fact that there are about three million people unemployed there has affected our tourist industry.  I have a friend who lives in Plymouth and nearby there are holidays camps that catered for such people and he told me that for the past few summers they were empty. Those were the people who were thinking of Holyhead and Liverpool hitherto but no longer are in a position to do so.  They are good spenders.  As I said about the coarse angling people, they save up their money and then come and spend it here. <Col N="1992" /> I think the Senator misunderstood my reference in my speech to 950 jobs.  Nine hundred and fifty jobs was the estimate of my predecessor as resulting from the special scheme that was brought into operation in 1986.  It did not cover any period before that and, as the scheme was designed as a one year scheme, it does not affect this year.</P>
    <P>He commended the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, for his attempt to bring down the price of petrol.  He and other Senators, including Senator Daly later, indicated that the high price of petrol was not due to the person at point of sale on the pumps but that the effort would have to be made further back in the supply line to reduce the very high price of petrol.  Of course, we have a big Government take as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte regretted that graffiti in Dublin scared some English visitor he had and regretted in general the graffiti that discourage particularly people from Britain when they come here.  He said it was not getting across to the working people of England that Ireland is a safe place for a holiday, and perhaps the Bord Fáilte people in Britain should take that into account.  He also indicated that those people were able to get cheaper meals in the UK.  That is a matter for argument. If we are selective in where we purchase food and know what we want and where to go for it, we are not that much ahead of other continental countries anyway.</P>
    <P>The Senator said we have many young people and that the statistic was nearly beaten to death, but that he did not think many young people were coming here. Although the German tourist has become thin on the ground recently, many young Germans are coming here particularly for the Irish music scene and they know the genuine and the ersatz in that field.  I met a group of young Germans who knew what the real Irish music genre was and they came here for that and for that only. Plenty of young people came to Croke Park recently, not to see any of our games.  Also young people have come from abroad to Slane, again not to see where St. Patrick lit the paschal candle.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte said that more should <Col N="1993" /> be invested in the industry and that he decried him of the quick buck.  I suppose the House knows even better than I do that the quick buck merchant falls in a very short time because he is known for what he is.  The Senator emphasised the importance of off season tourism.  Bord Fáilte are fully aware of this, and my Department are fully aware of it and I have communicated with them about it. The two shoulder seasons, spring and autumn, are what we have to target because that is the time as far as continentals are concerned when they may be thinking of a second holiday.  The sun holiday is all right but they have been coming in the autumn shoulder season for their second holiday.  Senator Harte also emphasised the hygiene aspect and he dragged in the health cuts by the hair of the head.  Fair play, he was making a political point, but that is in the sphere of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Many of the points made were connected with the Department of the Environment, the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and so on.  I am dealing with them in general, not in any expert way.  The Senator talked about how important hygiene was and how horrified he was at one stage when he ordered a meal and then got a look into the kitchen.  Perhaps the openness of the Greek system where they invite you into the kitchen and you can pick your own meal inside would be wonderful if it were developed in this country and you could go in and see the cooking going on and how it was being done.</P>
    <P>The Senator and many other Senators emphasised the importance of keeping our national monuments in proper order and having information available to tourists. That point was made about the Hill of Tara and I will come back to it in a moment.</P>
    <P>He made an interesting point about the lottery.  I was not 100 per cent sure what he meant but perhaps he was indicating that there should be a special tourist lottery. I might follow him along that line. It might be an attraction for some people to have a special lottery for tourists.</P>
    <P>He decried the high insurance costs, <Col N="1994" /> which were referred to by Senator Daly later with regard to self-drive cars. Again, as one would expect, Senator Harte emphasised the importance of the industry for the development of employment. That is central to the Government's thinking with regard to tourism and that is why the Government are putting special emphasis on the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In that context, Senator Fallon, the next speaker, made the point that the Government's objective is to get the public finances in order by picking areas for development and the creation of jobs. He mentioned horticulture, science and technology and tourism and he placed the matter in the proper position with regard to Government policy.  The objective is to increase employment by means of developing this industry.  I take the point, made by I am not sure which Senator, that the industry is not developed to provide employment.  It is developed to make profits, but the inevitable result of this is the creation of more employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be Senator O'Toole.  He emphasised strongly the business expansion scheme.  As the House knows, the Minister for Finance made provision for tourism to be related to the business expansion scheme.  Let me make the point <i>en passant</i> in reply to Senator Daly, who said that the self-drive car business should also be able to benefit from it, that I will be pushing that with the Department of Finance.  I am not 100 per cent optimistic that I will achieve it, but I want to put on record that I think it should be included in the business expansion scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon mentioned the Courts Bill.  I think he has some expertise in insurance and he indicated that if we got the Courts Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas it would reduce the level of compensation and, consequently, enable insurance companies to reduce their insurance costs.  I hope that is a logical sequence.  I will wait until I see it.  If the compensation costs are reduced, at least <Col N="1995" /> we in the Houses of the Oireachtas will have a lever to try to force insurance costs down.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon talked about the Shannon which is one of my pet hobbyhorses. There has been a good development at Carrick-on-Shannon.  Of course, there are developments at Athlone as well. Guinness have invested a great deal in a facility at Carrick-on-Shannon to develop that region.  That is one place where we have held the German tourist numbers. The percentage of Germans has held because they love the Shannon right down to Killaloe, an Cathaoirleach's own territory, back to Athlone, to Carrick-on-Shannon and as far north as we can get them.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney is anxious to get them much further north at the least expense. He said we will have to compete, we will have to maintain high standards and we will have to do major marketing.  He made a throwaway point at the end which is essential to an understanding of the success of our hotels and guesthouses, that is, that the repeats provide the proof of your success in a hotel, guesthouse or bed and breakfast.  If people come back, you have been providing them with the service they want.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell was not too pleased with some of the tired old propaganda &mdash; I do not know if she used that word but that is what she meant &mdash; with regard to the selling of Ireland.  I did not like what she said about the bog road and the pub and that we had come a long way since that.  Scientists, romantics and so on still take an interest in the bogs of Ireland.  In fact, some foreign scientists cannot be got away from the bogs during the summer months.  They study the fauna and flora of the area and the composition of our bogs.  They are very angry with us as they think we are going to cut away all our natural bog and that there will be nothing left.  It has a specific tourist attraction. <i>Chacun a son goût</i>, as the saying goes.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell emphasised the importance of value for money and the importance of a warm reception.  I could not agree more with that.  I have already <Col N="1996" /> said it and I will not repeat it.  It is something that we have and if we lose it and become artificial, tinny, blasé or disinterested, we are on the slippery slope. We will have lost a major strength in dealing with tourists.  I do not think the language problem is as great as she said. People can get around in all kinds of countries.  Turkey is a developing tourist country and the number of people in any country who speak Turkish fluently is extremely limited.  It is important to have people at Bord Fáilte level, in offices and so on, to give directions to people, but I do not think that lack of knowledge of the language keeps many people at home in the end.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to repeat what Deputy Fennell said but she went on to talk about the condition of Dublin Bay.  If it is as bad as she says, it is horrific.  She said she is a keen swimmer and that she was not over-convinced by the denials of Mr. Noel Carroll about the state of the water. She said Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council should be alerted to the fact that the waters around Dublin are not of top quality.  I know that Senator Fennell is a propagandist and all propagandists have to exaggerate a little to make an impact.  I hope her exaggeration in this case is great.  An Foras Forbatha, she said, are making a study and it will be two and a half years before they have the results but in the meantime Dublin Bay is deteriorating.  I hope things are not as bad as that but I will call the attention of my own Department and of Bord Fáilte to what she said.</P>
    <P>The quality of the bed and breakfast provided in farmhouses and other premises was extolled by many Senators during the course of the debate and that is the feedback we have been getting also from the various people who use that facility. They say, and I believe they are right, it is the best value in Europe.  Somebody said you could get that kind of service for £10 in Europe but that is not so.  Possibly in parts of Britain you might get that value but I doubt it very much.  The caravan and camping area was emphasised by a number of Senators.  I referred already <Col N="1997" /> to the fact that Bord Fáilte are trying to get another major site in the vicinity of Dublin and are also looking for sponsorship.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan, in a wide-ranging address on tourism, listed the circumstances that were hostile to tourism over the past few years.  He mentioned the deterioration in the value of the dollar, the access costs &mdash; we have done something about that and we hope to continue to do more &mdash; and the weather over the past two seasons.  We have pluses as well.  We have gains in the matter of access costs.  He regretted very much, as I do and as other Senators who have contributed to the debate do, the collapse, at the last moment when the voting was 11 to one, of the liberalising package that was worked out at the EC Council of Ministers for Transport.  But we will be working on a bilateral and trilateral basis to try to achieve that in the meantime before it comes up for full discussion again at the Council of Ministers.  It will not be as long as some of the pundits say it will be but the next time round, as the Single European Act will be in place, one country will not be able to block the package the way Spain did.  I am not giving any judgment as to the rights or wrongs of the dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain with regard to the airport in Gibralter.  The air strip is not on the rock and is not on the part that was ceded by Spain to Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan felt that Bord Fáilte by and large have been doing a good job and there is evidence of this in his own area.  The regional organisations are giving good back-up services.  I had the privilege of addressing a group of Australians who are in search of their roots in Ireland and for whom the Kilkenny regional tourism people put on a magnificent but very demanding seminar with regard to the tracing of roots.  The information made available to them was intellectually very demanding.  I am sure the intellectual shock did not wear off for a good few days after the course was over but they certainly expressed their appreciation.  Nobody was selling them <Col N="1998" /> short.  They came a long journey from Australia and they got very good value for money, I wrote to the local regional tourist leader in appreciation of what he had done.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan talked about the value to us &mdash; and, indeed, one of the Senators in this House knows more about it than anybody else in the world &mdash; of the sites of Knowth, Dowth and Newgrange.  It is something about which George Moore wrote in laudatory terms many years ago. We undersell that whole area.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also felt that the youth are coming to visit this country despite the fact that Senator Harte said he did not think so.  He made the point that I have already made about the price of drink and, to a lesser extent, about the price of hotels.  It is some thing we should keep in mind.  If you compare like with like, our top hotels are significantly cheaper than the top hotels in countries of similar size on the Continent of Europe.  I will not name cities but hotels in some of them are very expensive indeed.  I told the House with sorrow what I had to pay recently for a small Jameson in a hotel on the Continent.  You would buy three in this country, despite the fact that we think the price of our drink is too dear.</P>
    <P>The point that was emphasised by Senator Lanigan about our short season is one that has exercised the minds of everybody in tourism for some time.  It was in that context that I spoke about the shoulder season in spring and in autumn. There are also winter possibilities to be taken into account.  I think it was Senator Daly who referred to the singular efforts of one promoter in Cork &mdash; he happens to be from my county &mdash; who brings thousands of visitors to the south west of Ireland each winter in what is normally non-tourist time.</P>
    <P>The convention business is important. We had, as I said, a workshop in the Hilton in London trying to develop the convention business.  I appeal to Senators who are influential in their own organisations to try to think of international organisations to which they may be affiliated, or allied or have common interests with, and to try and entice them <Col N="1999" /> to come here to hold annual conferences. I can assure them that my Department and Bord Fáilte will leave no stone unturned. They will pull out all the stops to see that that conference is a success.  We had several large conferences this year and they were pronounced a success by the general agreement of the participants, and they are the customers who can tell the truth of the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan emphasised, as did other Senators, the importance of the anti-litter campaign.  He also stressed the need for a high standard of hygiene in a country where we cannot boast of our sunshine, and we should not be competing with people who can.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan took a rather morose view of the whole scene.  He talked about cliches, waffle and so on with regard to the tourist industry.  He said we never made up our minds what the tourists want.  I do not agree with that.  I would like to inform him that market surveys are constantly being carried out in the countries we have targeted to see exactly what the tourists want. When it is a question of the Conference Bureau of Ireland inviting people here, the most punctilious detail is gone into to see what exactly they want.  We have addressed the question and we have researched the market carefully and punctiliously.  It is well to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator.  We do not want over-crowded beaches, but I think Senator McGowan would agree that, if we had a scattering of people on the lovely little private alcove beaches, such as those at Kinnegar or Rathmullan, for most of the tourist season, we would be delighted.  I have been there in the past and my family and I had a private beach in Donegal for the whole day.  There is no danger of those beaches ever becoming as overcrowded as those in Malaga or such areas where hot bodies cover every square centimetre of the beach.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also said we did not want to invite gun clubs from the continent and I agree with him.  Gun clubs will obey the rules, they will play the game as it is <Col N="2000" /> played here and they will not shoot rabbits, thrushes and everything that moves in the bushes, as they have done in the past.  The Senator said the Irish people are the real asset for our tourist industry. I do not have to repeat that because I am on the same wavelength.  They come to see how different we are, not how much we are like them.  They do not come to see the mid-Atlanticism, about which he was talking.  They come to hear our language, perhaps as a curiosity, certainly as an aesthetic exercise, to hear our music. They come to see what we are.</P>
    <P>I know there was a clash about something the Senator said about section 4 decisions.  I belong to a county where there was only one section 4 decision since it was introduced, so our conscience and our slate is clear on that.  The point was made later that very few of the section 4 decisions he mentioned had anything to do with housing.  Sin mar atáimid was more or less his plea, that is our strength and I agree with him.  It is important that planning the environment and the ecology, etc. should be taken care of, but the picture is not as bad as the Senator was painting it.  We have pluses; we have developments such as Holy Cross and Ballintubber in small towns.  Patrick Shaffrey &mdash; a native of my own county, a distinguished architect, a man with a sharp eye for architectural detail, for what is good, bad or middling in our towns and villages &mdash; has been responsible for the restoration of many 19th century buildings.  For example, he made a beautiful job of the market house in Bailieboro.  He has published a number of volumes on our domestic architecture, on our courthouses and so on.  There are a number of achievements in this line which should be mentioned to counterbalance the errors and faults of which we have been guilty.</P>
    <P>We have a very high standard in souvenirs. I am not so sure that we are marketing them properly, but there has been an upsurge in the expertise in arts and crafts &mdash; in silversmithwork, knitwear, rushwork and pottery.  I could go through a list of arts and crafts where a standard of excellence has been achieved.  I <Col N="2001" /> remember wandering into a Bord Fáilte exhibition in Kevin Street some years ago.  They had some of our best craftsmen in all those fields.  They had a wonderful exhibition there and I do not know if they have ever repeated that.  The tinsel, the gaudy and the cheap have been excluded, for the most part, from our shops.  I am glad to say that is so, but it is a plus &mdash; and it should be mentioned because when we mention the warts we should also mention the good points.</P>
    <P>Quite recently in France there was an exhibition of Irish country cheeses.  We have developed a variety of cheeses in Wexford, the Burren, in West Cork and in my own home county where there are three different kinds of cheeses, including a goat cheese.  They had a <i>maître du fromage</i> in Paris who tested them, assessed them and gave a very good report on their quality.  We should emphasise that kind of development and praise those who are worthy of praise and not continually emphasise the deficiencies. There are deficiencies, but I do not think we should shut our eyes to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan suggested that perhaps the 10 per cent tax, cutting out all grants and so on, which apply to manufacturing industry should be applied to tourism as well.  He asked if tourism is going to be so good, why do the industry not run themselves by forming a co-operative? Why should the State have so much intervention in it?</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir O'Connor ar son turasóireachta an iarthair.  Dúirt sé nach raibh iarthar na hÉireann ag fáil cothrom na Féinne ó Bord Fáilte.  Sin an scéal a bhí ag an Seanadóir McGowan roimhe. Dúirt sé go háirithe nach raibh cothrom na Féinne le fáil ag na Gaeltachtaí ó Bhord Fáilte.  Is dóigh liom gur ball de Údarás na Gaeltachta é agus dúirt sé gur mhol an tÚdarás do Aire na Gaeltachta go mbeadh comhacht ag an Údarás i gcúrsaí turasóireachta; agus ceapaim gur iarr sé ormsa dul chun cainte leis an Aire sin &mdash; sin an Taoiseach is dóigh liom &mdash; agus é sin a chur in a luí air.  Beidh mé ag caint leis an Taoiseach agus leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Denis Gallagher, agus cuirfidh <Col N="2002" /> mé na moltaí sin rompu.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir go raibh sé deacair in iarthar na hÉireann teacht ar an meon céanna.  Mar shampla, i dtuaisceart Chonamara bhí meon eagsúil acu, go raibh na hostáin i dtuaisceart Chonamara, agus i ndeisceart Chonamara nach raibh ach ostán nó dhó.  Bhí sé ag cur béime ansin ar na difríochtaí, ar an éagsulacht, idir áit amháin agus áit eile, agus is dóigh liom go raibh pointe aige, go raibh sé ceart sa mhéid sin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go rachaidh Aerphort na Gaillimhe chun sochair don turasóireacht i nGaillimh, i gConamara agus san iarthar. Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil na bóithre thar moladh beirte.  Tá siad casta go leor ach bainim féin sásamh as bóthar casta nuair nach bhfuil aon deifir orm, agus ní cóir go mbeadh deifir ar éinne nuair atá sé ar a laethe saoire.  Mar sin féin, is cóir dúinn an méid cabhair is féidir linn a thabhairt don cheantar sin chun feabhas a chur ar na bóithre.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé rud éigin eile agus sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach mar chuala mé trácht roimhe seo.  Dúirt sé go raibh tionscal éisc á fhorbairt sa taobh tíre sin agus go dtagann salachar ón tionscal sin agus go raibh sé tábhachtach nach dtruaillfeadh an salachar sin na tránna i gConamara.  Luaigh sé Aire na Mara in a leith sin agus beidh mise ag caint leis mar gheall air sin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé freisin na féilte sa Ghaeltacht. Tá a fhios agam faoi rásaí na gcurrach agus rásaí éagsúla eile agus go bhfuil siad sin tarraingteach dos na daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbíonn triall ar na rásaí sin.</P>
    <P>Chuir an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ryan fearg ar Sheanadóir O'Connor mar dúirt sé gur masla dos na daoine ar an chomhairle chontae an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ryan mar gheall ar section 4. Dúirt sé go raibh áit deas chompóirdeach ag an Seanadóir agus nach cóir dó bheith ag iarraidh na Gaeil a chur suas ar na sléibhte agus gan ceard a bheith acu bheith connaithe ar an gcósta mar is dual.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke next and he talked about the conflict he came up against, when he was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses, <Col N="2003" /> between Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus. He has a particular complaint about Aer Lingus and his own experience added fuel to that complaint.  He welcomed the fact that there was now competition, cheaper fares and a better service as a result of that competition.  I already dealt with his comments with regard to the cost of car hire; I accept the basic premise of his argument that there are variables which cause this, that back tracking and leaving cars here that were hired in Northern Ireland is a feature of our tourist industry. I accept that block insurance is very costly and I asked my assistant secretary to meet insurance companies to see if it would be possible to bring down the cost.  Shortly after I became Minister, I got the figures for other areas and we are away out of kilter with regard to those costs.  I already mentioned what Senator Daly said with regard to petrol.  He shocked me by indicating that 6p or 7p of the money paid by credit card holders is taken up by the credit card companies.  That is a very substantial amount.  I mentioned that I would try to push the BES for the car hire service but that I was not too sanguine about what would happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Jack Fitzsimons spoke and I am glad he paid tribute to the lakes of my native county.  He is a very near neighbour and he has seen people going northwest with their fishing gear.  I must go down there when I get away from the Seanad.  I will bestow upon him the grand sycamore leaf for praise of my county when I establish it as an award in the tourist field.</P>
    <P>He talked about the ancient monuments and there is no better county for a Senator to come from to deal with that specific subject, his own Ceannanus Mór is sitting on history.  The ancient monuments in Kells are second to none in the whole country.  He went on &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; to decry the state of the Hill of Tara.  I do not know the remedy.  It is badly catered for and I can verify that because I have been there.  He said there was a tatty statue of Saint Patrick which should be replaced.  John Behan would be able to do a worthwhile statue in the <Col N="2004" /> modern mode of Saint Patrick for that area.  In Waterloo I saw a metal map of Tara with an indication of where each particular part of the ancient settlement of Tara was &mdash; it has been excavated and it would have to be metal or otherwise vandals would smash it.  That would be very useful in Tara.  Admittedly it might be difficult to provide a booth, hut or stall to cater for visitors, sell leaflets and so on but there should be something permanent &mdash; all the better with a guide &mdash; because it is too important a site to be neglected.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons said there was a car park there, that the waste paper baskets were not emptied and that there was a general air of tattiness.  Tara is worthy of something better.  He mentioned the pollution of Sheelin, which is almost at my back door.  It is my problem and I intend to dedicate myself to its resolution. I am glad that a number of farmers, particularly the small farmers in the area, have clubbed together with fishing interests and that there is a co-operative effort to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>He talked about pub culture and I think he agreed with it.  He talked about our flora and fauna, the importance of county museums and libraries as headquarters for local history interest and their roots which are of such great interest to us.  He mentioned derelict sites and hoped that there would be legislation to control them.  We will keep that in mind.  He complained about Dublin and the Clonee bottleneck.  I have to go through the Clonee bottleneck and it is a hair-raising experience if you are trying to make any place in time but Dublin County Council have plans for improving it.</P>
    <P>He spoke about summer guides for places like Tara and Ceannanus Mór. If my memory serves me right they are provided at the Rock of Cashel.  I will keep in mind that a summer guide in a historic place, perhaps a leaving certificate student who has an interest in history and has done it in the leaving certificate, who got some tuition on how to impart information would be a welcome addition to many of the historic sites.</P>
    <P>He praised Bord Fáilte for what they <Col N="2005" /> had been doing although they fooled him with a brochure a year out of date when he was going from the Burren to the Aran Islands.  Perhaps the severest critic of Bord Fáilte, with Senator Paddy McGowan, was Senator Loughrey.  He said he had no joy whatsoever and that tourism had collapsed in Donegal.  He talked about the closure of Port Salon hotel in Fanad which I know very well and he wanted to know if anyone from Bord Fáilte or from any tourism place, local or central, had spoken to the owners to see what could be done to have that beautifully situated hotel on the Swilly revived.  It was a <i>cri de coeur</i> from Senator Loughrey.  I do not go along with him, though, in a good deal of what he said.</P>
    <P>First, I do know that there are no sharper men than the Donegal men and that they did very well out of the £20 million Border special development fund which was dedicated to tourism and to the development of the crafts.  They got as much money out of it as did Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo put together as far as my memory goes.  That was one area anyway where they could not complain &mdash; because they were on the ball, they were out there, they were quick off the mark, and more power to them.  I am not impugning the thesis that Senators McGowan and Loughrey developed.  There is a tendency to forget Donegal because it is so far away to the north-west with the Six Counties intervening and blocking, at least transportwise, the direct line from Dublin to Donegal.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Loughrey that people in hotels, bars and so on are reluctant to serve one that there is no warmth in them.  I would regret it very much if that were the case.  I do not believe it.  Quite frankly, I have to contradict him on that.  I have not experienced it.  I do not believe it is true of Donegal and I have spent some time in Donegal every year since 1952.  I have never experienced it in Donegal itself.  I will have a chat with the Senator privately to ascertain what exactly made him say that.  There is at present in that kind of <Col N="2006" /> field a big drive to instil habits of courtesy and so on.  Natural courtesy and politesse are far better than the trained thing but I suppose a little polish may be added by training.  I know that the general manager of Dublin Airport went through an exercise of training his staff in courtesy, providing an atmosphere around Dublin Airport which has been visible since then.</P>
    <P>I must say also to Senator Loughrey that capital grant aid did help the tourist industry in Donegal.  He said it did not but I know it did.  I agree that we do not want anybody else's weather.  We do not want anybody else's social mores.  As Senator Brendan Ryan said, we are ourselves and people will come for that before they will come for a pale imitation of somebody else's mores or culture.</P>
    <P>I will call Bord Fáilte's attention to the criticism that both Senators Loughrey and McGowan made of them and seek their comments.  I repeat that certainly tourism in Donegal has suffered as a result of the troubles more than in any other Border county mainly because Donegal tourism depended to a large extent over the years on the majority population in the Six Counties who used to delight in holidaying in Donegal.  He called for Dubliners to visit Donegal.</P>
    <P>He talked about the desirability of an annual shutdown.  I suppose Senator Loughrey has had an experience that many of us had, who kept on working throughout August, and found &mdash; when we were looking for information or to establish contacts and so on &mdash; many people had gone on holiday and it was a foolishness to continue one's attempts in that month.  I know in Europe the EC shuts down completely for the month of August and to a certain extent that is true here as well.  There is an annual shutdown in areas in Britain, there always has been such because of the industrial situation. I am thinking of the Scotch Fair &mdash; I think that is what they call it &mdash; some time in July when Donegal at that time was visited by crowds of Scots people.  The Wake's Fair was the Manchester version of that.  There may be something in it that it would be helpful but if we let everybody off here on holiday at the <Col N="2007" /> height of the tourist season perhaps it would impact on our visitors as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney emphasised strongly how disparate was the tourist industry, how difficult it was to pull the strands together.  He talked about the traditional British holidaymaker.  His experienced of them is much the same as mine.  In the Drumshanbo area of County Leitrim where incidently they have a nice little swimming pool, where they have an Aras Ceóil, where Senator Mooney's father holds the Tóstal each year, they have a very nice little tourist set-up.  They depend to a great extent on that type of tourist to keep the tourism business going in the area.  Senator Mooney talked about the brand image, as did other Senators. I am sure that what these Senators had to say will be of interest to Bord Fáilte. Senator Mooney wanted a positive image of the country put across.  He talked about the wide open spaces being something that the French go in for, that the Germans fish for a certain type of coarse fish.  That is true.  By the way, I want to tell him that there has been a limitation on the number of pike that natives or visitors can take out of the rivers in my constituency for some time; there are rules on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also said he was anxious to have Acre's Lake joined up to Lough Allen.  He thought that would be a better investment than spending money on the canal in my constituency.  I will have to disillusion him on that.  The other would be the better investment, but I do not think I will be making either investment in the very near future.  Like Martin Luther King, I have a dream about that whole area &mdash; upper and lower Lough Erne, the Erne River, the link to the Shannon, right down to Limerick, the waterway there.  Senator O'Toole when he was speaking referred to the Norfolk Broads.  I was on it once and, as I said, a prow was on a stern; that was the extent of manoeuvre one had.  There are acres upon acres of lake and river in that area of the Erne and the potential for development is great.  There is an airport at Enniskillen.  When properly organised, <Col N="2008" /> there are lakes that could take you from Ballyshannon to Limerick city.  The potential for the future is great but we may have all passed on by the time its potential begins to be realised.  In the meantime it is being developed to the extent that is possible within the constraints. The political situation has also had a deleterious effect on developments in that area as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe O'Toole said it was a challenge to sell Ireland &mdash; I agree with him &mdash; and that is interesting for a Minister, and I accept that fully in the spirit in which he said it.  It is a challenge; it is not a matter of romance, it is a matter of pragmatism, of hard sell.  It is a matter of trying to preserve our product from the damage that can be done to it as a result of modern living.  He did say &mdash; and in this he was backing the view of a number of Senators &mdash; that it was important to identify the product and that, having identified it, then one sold it.</P>
    <P>I remember the particular area of Port Salon mentioned by Senator Loughrey.  I remember talking to a Scot who was a schools inspector in the Six Counties. That was his career.  He had been in the British Army during the war and became a schools inspector in the Six Counties. He always went to the Port Salon area &mdash; not to that hotel but to a guesthouse &mdash; he, his wife and family year after year. He told me that as they were leaving having had a particularly unfortunate experience with the weather that summer he took a vote, being a democratic father, of all the family in the car as to whether the bad weather would deter them from returning the following year.  The vote was unanimous: they would come back there.  The fact that they had had a bad experience with the weather that year did not indicate to them that it was a place in which they should not spend their holidays again.  This would put in context what many Senators have said and what we all know, that we are not selling the weather, although it is not quite as bad as we ourselves think it is.  As Senator O'Toole said, we have to become pragmatic and positive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> One of my pet hobbyhorses was touched upon, which was our food.  We have an opportunity to declare ourselves an additive free, hormone free area for food and we are damn fools if we do not take that opportunity.  We are only going to damage ourselves if we do not.  I know there is a cult of natural foods, of organic foods and that is a fringe grouping.  There is much sense in that.  We thought that the CND people were crackpots until sheep on the Wicklow mountains were affected by the Chernobyl explosion. There are a small group of people going in for organic food.  They will not eat an apple unless there is evidence that a maggot has bored a hole in it, to guarantee that there was no additive or poison that would do damage to their health.</P>
    <P>If we could establish an additive free, hormone free, adulterant free food reputation, we could charge premium prices for our product.  We can do it.  Will we do it?  I do not know.  The law has been put in place with regard to meats.  Some people say it is being flouted.  There is an obligation on every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas and every public spirited person to indicate that what we want is free, clean and wholesome food.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the tourist menu and its popularity.  That was established in other countries, particularly in Spain very early on.  I was in Spain in the University of Zaragoza in the year when 500,000 was the maximum number of people who visited Spain.  It is today something like 35 million people per annum or more.  This, of course, impacts very heavily on the economy.  It is one of the buttresses of the Spanish economy. They had the tourist menu and they had the paradors which were State owned because the standards were very low. Standards of hygiene were low; standards of bed and accommodation were low. They had no idea about tourism but they developed and developed strongly since then.  They developed in a way, in parts of the country, in which I would not like to see Ireland developing but it is an indication that you can jump from 500,000, admittedly with their allies, the <Col N="2010" /> sun, charter flights and so on.  That kind of increase is linked to the provision of good service.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole and I have said, hotels are not built to create jobs.  They are built to make profits for the people who are investing in them.  Tourism is a labour intensive industry.  That is the beauty of it; the personal service is basic and essential in it and no amount of development of automata of any kind will replace the person in the tourist industry. That is why it is an industry that can laugh at the future of automatic machines and so on.  There are dispensers and so on and they may cut down on the numbers, but still there will be large numbers of people required in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>We have had contact for some time between the Six County tourist people and ourselves.  Brochures covering areas from south Down, the Mournes, right down to Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Fermanagh have already been produced. On a number of occasions I have met Mr. Hoey who is the development man in County Fermanagh.  The co-operation is strong.  Mr. Hoey never misses any of our tourist functions South of the Border and we visit him in Fermanagh also.  It is unfortunate that more people do not visit Counties Down, Antrim, Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Armagh.  More people are sneaking up around the County Down coast nowadays, exploring the Glens of Antrim and going out to Rathlin Island and back through Derry to Donegal.  It is a magnificent area.  It is quite safe.  How can we expect people to believe us that this country is safe for tourists if we are afraid to travel in it?</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and other Senators emphasised the importance of camps and caravans.  I was glad, because I was less wise in this matter than the Senator.  He said standards are well improved and compare favourably with anything he experienced on the Continent.  Senator O'Toole indicated that camps and caravans compare very favourably from the point of view of costing.  He stressed the lack of picnic or lay-by areas and said that those that existed were not looked <Col N="2011" /> after properly.</P>
    <P>The Senator commended the OPW on their care and the work they did on historic sites.  He talked of tapes for information and I would commend that. He stressed what I have mentioned already, the importance of walking tours for the future.  The best idea Senator O'Toole came up with was the multipurpose leisure centre which could be used as a dramatic centre, as a meeting place and also for many purposes, both connected with the life of the community and useful in the tourist industry as well.</P>
    <P>In Enniskillen, on the shores of Lough Erne, they have developed a theatre. Senator O'Toole mentioned that it was difficult to find a theatre in our provincial towns.  Ireland is better in that regard, because of the amateur drama movement, than most other countries.  There are in the United States very sizeable cities, cities as large as the city of Cork, where there is no theatre.  We are not culturally impoverished.  I accept the suggestion that Senator O'Toole made about leisure centres in our small towns.</P>
    <P>The Senator emphasised very strongly the clean water campaign and how we should pay particular attention to it.  He is holding out very strongly for fish from Dingle.  I am a member of the ridge Angling Club at Greystones and I am prepared to eat any fish I catch when I am out fishing in the Irish Sea.  If sparks begin to come out of me some time before this debate is over, Senators will know what is happening.  Senator O'Toole said, and I am not fully aware of this, that sea angling seems to have died down along the west coast.  I know that Achill used to have a major sea angling festival and so did Moville in Donegal.  I must have a look at that area to see how much activity there is now.</P>
    <P>As regards pollution of inland lakes, unfortunately I am an expert on that as far as Lough Sheelin is concerned.  The highest concentration of pigs in western Europe is at Sheelin.  It gives employment; it makes a profit for its owners. There are two or three large owners in the area.  However, it has had an effect <Col N="2012" /> on what is regarded as one of the great trout lakes of Europe.  From the last century, even, I have guide books indicating that it was known on the Continent as a great trout lake.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise as strongly as I can that I subscribe to the philosophy that we are simply guardians of this inheritance, guardians of our environment for the time we have it and that we must pass it on.  If we allow such lakes as Lough Sheelin to die, there will be a grave responsibility on us.  I want to tell the House that about 15 years ago or so the mayfly was very prolific on Sheelin.  I remember visiting somebody at Clover House at the eastern part of the lake and leaving my car outside the caravan where the person was parked.  When I came out my car and the caravan were covered with mayfly.  Not a single mayfly has appeared on Lake Sheelin for many years now.  There was a commitment to clean the lake up and to start the cycle of life for the mayfly again.  I hope to live to see that day and to play a part in it because, as I say, there is an obligation on me, as there is on every citizen, in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Farrell, the concluding speaker, for complimenting the people from the Kilnaleck area on their efforts in the Year of the Environment to do something about a wasteland near them. The Senator regretted that it was not publicised and so do I.  Scandals are petulantly highlighted while achievements on the plus side are very often forgotten.  He hoped also that the air deal, which we fell short of achieving in the council of Ministers would be achieved because this will impact on our tourism.  I know Senator Farrell is a member of a local authority and he will be committed to keeping towns tidy and litter free.  He boasted of blue ribbons at three places in Sligo.  Senator McEllistrim who was sitting beside me indicated that two blue ribbons were achieved also, I am glad to say, by Ballybunion and lonely Banna Strand in County Kerry.  Senator Farrell indicated that 33,000 visitors had signed the book at Drumcliffe where Yeats is buried.  That is very impressive. Somebody should be appointed who <Col N="2013" /> would be able to give a little of the history of the area to visitors.  A person who goes there to see Yeats' grave usually will know a little about Yeats, but he or she can be fitted in to the general picture in Benbulben's shade.  I could not help remembering a wit commenting on the inscription &ldquo;Horseman pass by&rdquo; on the tombstone.  While the certificate examinations were on he changed that to &ldquo;Pass man horse by&rdquo; in the hope that he would pass his examination.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell said Bord Fáilte were not paying the attention to the west that they should.  Without making an objective study I do not know if this is true. However from the contributions made by Senators McGowan, Loughrey, Farrell, O'Connor and the people from the west in general, it sounds as if it needs looking into.  There is a case to be disproved after the contributions we heard.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé nuair a thosnaigh mé, a Chathaoirligh, bhí mé ag ceapadh go mbeadh díospóireacht bhríomhar againn, go mbeadh na moltaí a thiocfadh os na Seanadóirí úsáideach dom mar Aire Turasóireachta. Tá mé buíoch dos na Seanadóirí as an méid a dúirt siad, as an díospóireacht bhreá, bhríomhar a bhí againn agus tá súil agam go rachaidh sé sin chun sochair dúinne sa tír seo agus don tionscal turasóireachta.</P>
