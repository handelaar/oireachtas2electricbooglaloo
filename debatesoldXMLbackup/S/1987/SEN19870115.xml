      <P>I have notice from Senator Jim Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Communications to allow special permission for Blue Army Charter Pilgrim flights enroute from Lisbon to fly direct from Horan International Airport to the United States without the obligation of touch down at Shannon.</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House I would like to inform the House that Miss Lane has been appointed Clerk Assistant of the Seanad.  I would like to congratulate her on her appointment and wish her the best of luck.  She is the first lady to hold such a position since the establishment of the State.</P>

      <P>Before moving the Order of Business I would like to welcome Miss Lane to the staff of this House and also to welcome the precedent established by the appointment of a woman to this position.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to order items Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  As indicated yesterday, the proposal is that Committee and remaining Stages of No. 1 be taken and completed today.  In regard to No. 2, this will be taken if No. 1 is completed before 4.30 p.m.  This would mean that with the debate on the Adjournment the House will be able to finish all its business by 5 p.m.  As indicated yesterday, No. 3 will be taken at what might have been the lunch break from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

Of course we have only a few weeks to wait again for that appointment.  I thought yesterday the leader of the Labour Party in this House had inside information when he congratulated Miss Lane.  I wish her well.  We are very civilised here and it will continue that way. I wish her the best of luck in her appointment.</P>

On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he knows, in the light of recent scandals in London and New York, if there is any proposal to make insider dealings on the Stock Exchange illegal in this country?  I fail to believe that the Irish Stock Exchange is populated by saints and the stock exchanges in New York and London have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome Miss Lane and I join with other Senators in being particularly pleased by her appointment as Clerk Assistant to this House.  On the Order of Business, the Status of Children Bill has been ordered if time permits.  There are 90 very important amendments submitted by the Government and the Bill will be very substantially improved by them.  On Committee Stage on this Bill, the point was made that because of the importance of these amendments the House should revert to Committee.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we can revert to Committee Stage for the Report Stage of this Bill.  That being the case, it is not realistic to envisage completing the debate this afternoon even if it does commence, because the amendments are extremely important and will have to be considered carefully by the House. Therefore, I would welcome some indication from the Leader of the House if the debate commences this afternoon when it will be resumed and an assurance that it will be a full Committee Stage debate.</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated with the other Senators in welcoming Miss Deirdre Lane as Clerk Assistant.  I am very pleased she is the first lady to hold this position.  She is well known in other circles.  She was a prominent camogie player who won no less than six All-Ireland medals.  Her brother, Noel, was a well known player with the Tipperary GAA team for many years. I have worked with Deirdre Lane on other committees for the last couple of years.  I am quite satisfied that she is a highly efficient young lady who will fill this post with distinction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to a number of points that have been raised, in particular points raised in relation to the Status of Children Bill, I agree with Senator Robinson that it is unlikely this will be completed today.  When the business today is completed the proposal will be to adjourn until 2.30 p.m. next Wednesday and at that time to take up all the Bills that are substantially advanced. The National Monuments Bill and the Status of Children Bill are at Report Stage and in respect of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill Committee Stage has commenced.  No matter what might happen in the meantime or shortly after that, these Bills should be completed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the manner in which the Status of Children Bill will be handled, it was unusual that no amendments were passed on Committee Stage in order to allow the Minister to re-examine these matters.  Re-examination has resulted in 90 Government amendments to the Bill. A grouping has been made of these amendments which divides them into seven or eight groups.  The proposal that will be made is that the Bill will be recommitted in respect of each of these groups of amendments so that there will be a full Committee Stage debate not on each of the 90 amendments but on each of the seven or eight groups.  I have asked that copies of the groupings be made available ahead of the debate to those Senators who are particularly interested in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> Senator Brendan Ryan raised the question of insider dealing.  I am not an insider in the Stock Exchange, in the Cabinet or in the Department responsible for the control of such matters, but I am quite sure that those responsible are aware of the situation and have taken note of the fact that public concern has naturally increased in this country since recent events in the United States and in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Title>Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986:    Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 34 to 36, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  This Act shall apply only in relation to an offence committed or alleged to have been committed after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is in accordance with the well-known principle of jurisprudence that an act which was not an offence when committed should not subsequently be made an offence.  Although this is not exactly the same situation, it creates a very similar situation because something for which a person could not be extradited at the time the offence was committed can as a result of this Bill be subsequently subject to extradition.  This is objectionable and should not be in the Bill.  It is sufficient that it should apply to acts which are committed after the passing of this Act. There is not very much more I can say about it.  There is a principle there.  It is a principle which has been complied with in 99 per cent of cases.  When breached it always creates a great deal of opposition and comment.  The principle is very much the same in this case and for the <Col N="1750" /> same reasons I do not think it should be departed from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 3 and 4 of this Bill apply only to a request for the surrender of a person made after the commencement of the Act or to a warrant for the arrest of a person issued after the commencement of the Act.  The request or the warrant in question may, however, relate to an offence committed or alleged to have been committed before the commencement date. This point is dealt with in section 1 of the Bill which provides that the Bill will apply, except where otherwise provided, in relation to an offence committed or alleged to have been committed before or after the passing of the Act.  The exception referred to is in section 5.  Section 5 establishes extraterritorial jurisdiction over offences committed outside the State and that section applies only to offences committed after the commencement of the Act.</P>
      <P>There is nothing extraordinary in this provision in the Bill.  Indeed, provisions of this kind are normal when new extradition arrangements are being made.  The Extradition Act of 1965, for example, applies to offences whether committed before or after its passing.  The Extradition Act of 1965 in that respect contained a provision identical to that which we have in this Bill.  Similarly our extradition treaty with the United States which was approved recently contains a provision of that type and provisions of that type are to be found in extradition treaties in other countries.  These provisions, in my view, are reasonable.  If a state decides to put in place a particular agreement on extradition it is saying by that Act that in its view the interests of justice require that persons be extradited in accordance with the terms of that agreement. In that situation the question as to whether the offence was committed before or after the agreement was made or, as in this case, before the legislation is passed is irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that no injustice of any kind is involved here. There is no question under this Bill of a <Col N="1751" /> new offence being created and a provision being made to give that retrospective effect.  The Bill does not seek to make something criminal which was not an offence at the time it was done.  For anybody to be liable for extradition the act for which he is sought would have to be one that constituted an offence against the law of the requesting state and an offence against the law of our State at the time that the act was committed.</P>
    <P>I hope that a final point I make would have no great substance.  Were we to make the kind of provision that Senator Eoin Ryan wishes us to make we might be extending an invitation to people to carry out acts of the kind that are dealt with in section 3 of the Bill in the period between now and the commencement of the Act.  However, I do not make a big point of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture in here firstly to seek information.  With how many of the signatories to the convention do we have extradition agreements?  I understand that it is only with those countries with which we have extradition agreements that the provisions of this Bill will apply.  Which of the signatories to the convention do we not have extradition agreements with?  Some other signatories to the convention have unsavoury present records and a considerable number of current members of the OECD have at least unsavoury past records.  Offences which were committed in the past, say in Greece, that would be breaches of the law here and breaches of the law there could well have a reasonable validity to being described as political offences.  I would not necessarily say they were right, but consider acts of violence against the dictatorship in Greece, for instance.  If Greece had a right wing government who decided to deal with some of these people in that fashion, it would appear that if we had an extradition agreement with Greece it could cause problems.  Which of the countries that have signed and ratified the convention do we have extradition agreements with?  What about those countries that have unsavoury pasts <Col N="1752" /> and in particular one current signatory which I mentioned and which has a very unsavoury present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is correct in saying that this does not create an offence that did not exist before the Bill was passed but it does much the same thing and from the point of view of a person involved, the situation is much the same.  The important thing is that a person should not be put in peril of punishment or imprisonment or something even more serious than that if what he did was not likely to lead to that situation before the passing of the Act.  A person who committed an offence but an offence for which he could not be extradited and consequently could not be punished now can be extradited and can be punished.  From the point of view of the person concerned it is not a matter of great consequence whether it was an offence.  He is now in peril of being punished for something that he would not otherwise be in peril of being punished for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Senator Brendan Ryan's question is concerned, in effect we have extradition arrangements with all of the countries which have signed and ratified the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  The signature and the ratification by those countries of the convention amounts to an agreement <i>de facto</i> between those countries so that we have in effect extradition arrangements with all of the Council of Europe countries which have signed and ratified it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Senator Eoin Ryan's further remarks, as I understand it, he has accepted that we are not creating a new offence.  As I have said, for an act to be extraditable it would have to have been an offence under the law of the requesting state and of the requested state at the time of its commission.  It is not particularly appropriate to say that things should start only after the passing of the Act because, in the nature of things, it can take some time to find out that there is suspicion that a person was involved in a particular kind of act.  It would be <Col N="1753" /> wholly artificial, now that we have agreed and stated, as we would in this Bill, a particular approach to a particular kind of offence, to insert a cut-off date which is totally unrelated to the action that we want to take or to the way in which we want to treat those requests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the contention of the Minister that things will not change if this section is passed.  Unless we have a definite date for the introduction of this legislation, since the Bill is directed in the main towards Britain and Northern Ireland, cases which would not have been brought before this jurisdiction in terms of extradition could now be resurrected.  The British Government could, if we do not have a particular starting date, resurrect a particular extradition request which they could not do unless this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to say that Senator Lanigan's statement seems to refer to very hypothetical situations.  It is not accurate to say that we would now create the possibility that cases that previously could not be brought before the jurisdiction would now be capable of being brought before it.  Of course a request for extradition or a request in the case of Northern Ireland or Britain can be made of us to back a warrant for any offence which is an offence in that jurisdiction and in this.  A determination could be made by a court on foot of a claim that the offence was a political offence only after a request for extradition had been made.  It is not therefore accurate to speak of situations where requests that could not previously be made could now be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan should think back to the evolution in the approach taken by our courts here referred to during the course of Second Stage debate.  He will find that the number of potential new situations that could arise would be very few.  Nevertheless if, as I hope we will do, we pass this Bill, we are saying that we will never regard certain specified kinds of crimes as political offences or offences <Col N="1754" /> connected with political offences.  If, subsequent to that determination by us, it emerges that there is good reason to believe that a person in this jurisdiction may have been involved in that kind of crime and if we are requested to extradite that person, we should extradite him because we have said what we believe about that kind of act.  If there was a person in another convention country whom we suspected of having carried out an act of this kind three, four or five years ago, it would be quite reasonable that we should then be in a position to seek to have that person returned here to stand trial.  I do not think we should lose sight of the two-way process that is involved in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my concern about the retrospective aspect.  Under no circumstances would I excuse in any sense any of the crimes that were committed in Northern Ireland.  I am pleased that something that could be excused for political reasons is now being done away with and that the ambivalence is being removed once and for all. There was a time in Northern Ireland, in the early seventies in particular, when many young people were convinced that there was no other way of removing injustices except by those crimes.  That was an historic legacy which was left to them. With the passing of this Bill we will be in a totally different position to that which existed in the past in Northern Ireland. There cannot now be any spurious type of excuse for anyone to say that the way is not open to them politically to work for justice, for peace, for a united Ireland or for anything that they wish in that line. That day is now gone.  The Anglo Irish Agreement has changed all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about young people who got involved in the troubles in the North in the late sixties and early seventies, who have now totally put all that behind them, who have started a new life, who have seen that that is not the way forward and who might, because of the passage of this legislation, be extradited back and tried for those crimes.  I appeal that some consideration be given <Col N="1755" /> to the fact that we are now in a new situation.  While I am not in any sense trying to excuse any of the acts that may have been committed, I am very concerned about that aspect of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues that I wish to raise in connection with this amendment.  The first is to elaborate a little on what Senator Rogers said.  Whatever the present position of the security forces in Northern Ireland, in the early seventies they were seen by a large section of the Catholic population as a serious threat to their lives.  I do not want to go back over old history at great lengths but the security forces, and particularly the police, acted in such a way that if I was living in Northern Ireland at that stage I might have felt that I had a moral justification to use violence to protect my family from their activities.  It would still have been an offence to have a firearm.</P>
      <P>The circumstances under which people felt obliged to defend themselves in the late sixties and early seventies, which I do not believe exist today, were objective circumstances.  It appears to me now &mdash; and I would be happy to have some assurance that it is not possible &mdash; that if somebody was wanted in Northern Ireland for some other reason and if there was considerable evidence of their use of a firearm in that particularly troubled period in the late sixties and early seventies, then that could be used retrospectively to ensure their extradition back to Northern Ireland, their trial or perhaps their conviction for that offence, and then subsequent trial for other offences that had been committed later and which were perhaps more difficult to prove.  I worry about that in the Northern Ireland context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I am deeply disturbed, apart from Northern Ireland entirely, about the fact that there is one country, a signatory to this convention, which has been condemned in the most vehement terms by Amnesty International.  I understand <Col N="1756" /> from the Minister that we would be committed to extraditing people to that jurisdiction &mdash; that is, Turkey.  The Amnesty report for 1985 says that there are several hundred political prisoners of conscience in Turkey; that there is continuous, widespread and systematic use of torture in Turkey; that there is continuous and widespread ill-treatment of prisoners in Turkey; that there is serious concern about whether people can have a fair trial in front of military courts; that there is completely inadequate access to lawyers and that there is an inability to consult lawyers privately.  As far as I can make out from the Minister, in the case of Turkey, if somebody is alleged to have been involved in an offence which concerned the use of a firearm, they cannot plead that that was a political offence. Even if the person did not commit the offence, the pleading that it would have been a political offence would have been in the past a sufficient defence to prevent them from being extradited.</P>
    <P>It appears now that we are willing to extradite people to a country with a particularly disgraceful record on human rights.  What this raises for me is, first of all, the question of whether this convention really can be accepted in its present terms but also the possibility of the convention being extended to other countries.  I am extremely unhappy that we would be prepared to extradite anybody to a country with that sort of human rights record.  Irrespective of the offences they have committed, I do not believe we should extradite people to a country where there is not a reasonable prospect of a fair trial; where there is no guarantee that they will not be tortured and no guarantee that they will not be ill-treated. We have no such guarantees in the case of one signatory of this convention with whom apparently we have now got an extradition agreement.  I would like the Minister to explain to me how we can protect people from such abuses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan's reply to the point that I made suggested that I was making a hypothetical case.  It is a fact that under this legislation alleged <Col N="1757" /> crimes which have been committed in the past can now be brought before the courts here to have an extradition warrant carried out.  Therefore, there is nothing hypothetical about it.  It is a fact that, as and from the day that this Bill is passed, there can be retrospection in terms of the actual actions taken.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech and again on Committee Stage in the other House, stated that this Bill is not related to the broad terms of the European Convention on Terrorism but that it is in the main dealing with crimes which are alleged to have been committed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland by Irish citizens.  I do not accept that Irish citizens would have the same protection of law in Great Britain or Northern Ireland as they would have in this jurisdiction.  For that reason, I am not satisfied that there should be retrospection in this Bill.  Only acts committed after the passage of this Bill should come under the terms of the Extradition Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be a reasonable amendment being proposed. I share the concern, particularly as voiced by Senator Brendan Ryan, about having the retrospective element in relation to providing for extradition without there being the possibility of people claiming, as they would have herefore, that the offence was a political offence.  I obviously do not condone the type of conduct which would be involved.  However, we are talking about an allegation.  We are talking about a charge from a particular country.  We are talking about an allegation or charge made in relation to a past time.  That is a very different thing. We will be talking later about an amendment relating to the <i>prima facie</i> case issue, but all we would have is an allegation made by a country against a person and the request for the extradition of that person.  The allegation could relate to a time in that country when there was great difficulty and a lack of any fairness of administration, a dictatorship.  Senator Brendan Ryan has mentioned two countries, Turkey in particular, and Greece at a particular time, where we could have <Col N="1758" /> very serious concerns and very serious reservations.</P>
      <P>I have examined the convention and the explanatory memorandum to the convention. As far as I can see, there is no barrier in the convention to our introducing this amendment in the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to confirm if it is the case, that if we wished to do it, there is no impediment in the convention to so doing.  If that is the case, then we are fully discharging our obligations.  We are carrying out the intention, but we are avoiding a real risk which has been identified in this debate and which is an unnecessary risk to run in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>We are talking about confining the Bill to offences committed or alleged to have been committed after the passing of the Bill.  That seems to me to be a proper and an appropriate cut-off point.  We then know where we are for the future and we can examine closely how the Bill works for the future.  We cannot know what requests for extradition might be made on what kind of allegations or in relation to what point in time, in countries which have had a very difficult and a very dubious past.  I would ask the Minister to confirm whether I am correct in the view that this amendment would be compatible with the convention on terrorism and then to reply to the points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to go back to what the Minister said earlier about why he was opposing this amendment, that we in this country might like to have somebody extradited from a foreign country because of some particularly objectionable offence he was alleged to have committed some years ago and that we should consequently not have this kind of provision in the Bill.  The Minister is right in the sense that from the establishment point of view it would be nice to have that power; it would be nice to know that in regard to some offence that we objected to very much we could still get that person extradited, even though it happened some years ago.  From that point of view the Minister is right, but we always have to look at these kinds of <Col N="1759" /> situation.  In every Bill of this kind there is society's point of view, the establishment point of view, and on the other hand the point of view of the person who is going to be concerned.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a very important one in the sense that it contains departures from a situation which has existed for 150 years, the principle of not extraditing people who committed what were described as political offences.  In principle, most of us agree that certain changes have to be made.  Nevertheless, it is a very important departure and it does put people in peril that they would not otherwise have been in.  The Minister should look at the other point of view, that is, the point of view of the person who is likely to be concerned and affected by this Bill.  While I think it is reasonable in general terms, the changes are necessary, it should be quite sufficient to say that it only applies to offences which are committed after the passing of the Bill.  That would be the proper way to hold a reasonable balance between something that we feel should be done and, on the other hand, having regard to the people who might be affected by it.</P>

      <P>I would, first of all, like to preface my few words by saying that, whilst I agree with the amendment, at least until I heard the Minister's reply, it would not mean that I will be voting with the people who put down the amendment. I want to make that clear.  I am a little puzzled from the point of view of somebody who has had to deal with retrospective situations in life.  All the European states condemn terrorism.  They condemn it as endangering or taking human lives, or otherwise jeopardising human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the necessity to take resolute action to combat and suppress terrorism. If all the member states, all the people involved in European co-operation on security and so on do not come together to bring legislation in to coincide with the legislation of each state as it comes through, it looks as if we are putting in a clause whereby someone can be <Col N="1760" /> put on trial in retrospection for acts of terrorism.  I do not think you can legislate that way.  You should not legislate by trying to catch up on someone who is ahead of you.  Some European states will have passed Bills already and, consequently, are able to put guilty parties on trial.  Because our Bill did not run concurrently with those of the other member states I do not think it lessens any of the measures contained in the legislation to suppress acts of terrorism.</P>
    <P>I find myself at a loss with regard to retrospection.  It has always been a problem to give effect to retrospection in other walks of life because it causes tremendous difficulties.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on retrospection. We are legislating on acts of terrorism and if we legislate by sending out search parties for people who are guilty of suppression the spirit of co-operation on a worldwide basis is defeated. When you bring in legislation it should come in with the same sort of determination in mind and not on the basis of trying to arrest someone who got away with a crime.  I would not like to see anyone getting away in that sense.  I would condemn them totally but I am puzzled about legislating in a retrospective way so as to go after someone who may have got away with something and who may be in some other part of the world.  I would have no sympathy with the person if he was caught but I do not understand why it is necessary to take this line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur heartily with the remarks Senator Rogers made at the beginning of her intervention.  It is not the case that this provision now creates a situation in which the extradition of persons can be sought in respect of particular kinds of crime.  Since 1922 we have had the backing of a warrants procedure with the UK.  It was modified in some respects in 1965, but that procedure is what exists today.  There has never been a time since 1922 when the UK authorities could not request the handing over of a person to them whom they suspected of having carried out any kind of crime in <Col N="1761" /> whatever circumstances in the UK.  Even up to today if they thought there were people in Ireland who had committed crimes in respect of which a political defence might have been claimed, the authorities in Northern Ireland or the UK could, and will continue to be in a position, to request the handing over of that person.  We do not have any number of warrants outstanding in relation to crimes alleged to have been committed in the early seventies, the late seventies or in the early or mid-eighties.  Up to today, and this will continue to be the case, those authorities could seek to have people returned.</P>
      <P>I assume that, as in most cases, the backing of the warrant here would be opposed and the matter would have to go before a district court first and perhaps, on appeal to a higher court where the political defence might be claimed.  It is not by any means clear even in relation to the kinds of crimes we are now speaking of &mdash; Article 1 offences in the convention &mdash; that if such a warrant were to be given to us today and the person apprehended on foot of the warrant and brought before the court that the Irish courts would accept the political defence. I again remind the House that there has been a very clear evolution of thinking in Irish courts in relation to that matter.  It is not true to say that the provisions we are speaking of in section 1 of this Bill create a vastly different situation.  They do not but the Bill puts a certain number of matters beyond doubt in that it provides that certain kinds of crime may never be classified as political.  Senator Lanigan is wrong in alleging that for the first time certain kinds of crime committed in the past could give rise to people being brought before our courts with a request to send them to another jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson is right in her suggestion that there is no impediment in the convention to our acting as the amendment proposes.  However, at the time the European Convention on Extradition was being prepared there was a proposal to include in the terms of that convention a provision similar to that <Col N="1762" /> contained in the amendment before us. The conclusion arrived at as a result of that discussion was that it would not be appropriate to put a provision of that kind in the convention.  Largely for the same kinds of reasons I do not think it is appropriate to put it in our Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Brendan Ryan's concerns we have, effectively, an extradition agreement with Turkey.  Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Extradition. Turkey does not, however, extradite its citizens so it would be open to us not to extradite our citizens to Turkey. That is a matter which would come within the discretion allowed to the Minister for Justice and the courts in Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965.  Sections 8 and 9 of this Bill would be relevant to the concerns expressed by Senator Ryan.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan claims that what we are doing in this Bill is bringing about a departure from a principle which has existed for 150 years.  That is not the case.  This Bill does not depart from the principle that in some cases a political defence may be claimed.  It gives more clarity to the definiton of those kinds of crimes in respect of which a political defence cannot be claimed.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  In doing that it is doing something which should have been done a long time ago &mdash; give the courts a clearer base in law on which to make their own decisions.  It is not a question, as Senator Harte seems to think, of our bringing in this kind of provision because we are catching up with everybody else. It would be the ideal situation when a group of countries such as the member states of the Council of Europe finally agree on the text of a convention if they would all simultaneously sign and ratify it but there are many different reasons why that does not happen.</P>
    <P>The very simplest is that the legislative process can take longer in some countries than in others.  In our own case there was a certain view for a period that we could not constitutionally act in certain ways in relation to extradition.  It was only with the passage of time and with the benefit of a number of determinations by the courts that we came to a different view. <Col N="1763" /> It is not really a process of catching up so much as a process of the evolution of our own approach to these matters and our own ability to deal with things in the way that other countries have agreed to deal with them.</P>
    <P>If we assume that things were otherwise and that we are looking at a neighbouring country which was in the process of legislating for a provision like this or, indeed, even in the context of this Bill, a neighbouring country would come along to us and say that we have reason to believe that x and y, for example, were involved in the Darkley killings should we say, looking at the provisions of this amendment, &ldquo;Oh no, that was some years ago, we will refuse to extradite those persons, we do not believe they should be handed back&rdquo; or, should we say &ldquo;Yes, those cases would fall to be dealt with under the provisions of our law as it is now&rdquo;.  We would not be prejudging what the conclusion of a court might be if the matter came before the court because, as I have said, any person whose extradition or return was sought would continue to have the right to contest the validity of the warrant, would continue to have the right to go before a District Court and if he was not pleased with the outcome there would continue to have the right to bring the matter further.  I do not think that we would wish to say, <i>ab initio,</i>&ldquo;oh no, that is not a case that can be dealt with because the matter arose, or the alleged offence, was committed before the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  If we think of it in that way, the provisions of the Bill will be seen as much less draconian and as innovative that it is claimed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is a very difficult area and I know that you can always point to atrocities such as the Darkley case and people will feel in their hearts that if the guilty people are in this jurisdiction, by all means if they are guilty they should be brought back and tried in Northern Ireland, or indeed tried here under the other alternative legislation.  There are a <Col N="1764" /> few points I would like the Minister to think about.</P>
      <P>First of all, he said that no extraditions had been sought for any cases that had occurred in the early seventies or the mid-seventies or indeed the early eighties.  I suggest the reason for that was possibly because in many of these cases it was unlikely, particularly at the time before the courts decided to extradite people and decided that certain crimes were not political in nature, that the extradition would be granted.  This Bill is called the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986. I totally agree with the purpose behind the Bill but it is not a Bill to get vengeance against people who have committed crimes in the past.  Whereas there might well be a number of those people who would commit those crimes again and who are, unfortunately, not in the least regretting them, I sincerely hold that there are quite a number of those people who do regret and would certainly not get involved in anything like that again. The purpose of the Bill would not be defeated by doing away with the retroactive aspect because its purpose is to suppress terrorism now.  To make it retroactive is not going to stop those things happening which have already happened, unfortunately, like the Darkley murders; they have happened and we cannot stop them.  What we are trying to do is to stop any more of that sort of thing happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply point to the fact that in Northern Ireland we have a number of young prisoners, SOSPs, who are imprisoned under the Secretary of State's pleasure.  I know that the Irish Government, and indeed we in the SDLP, have been pressing on the British and need to have those cases reviewed because those are young people who got caught up in acts when they were underage and when times were different and consideration ought to be given to releasing them now.  The spirit behind that type of thinking is the same spirit in which I appeal for reconsideration of this aspect of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to prevent these things happening now from the passage <Col N="1765" /> of the Bill; I presume it is from the passage and not from the commencement we are talking about so that there is no question of people thinking &ldquo;well we have got a year in which we can do what we like&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister on the basis of that principle that the purpose is to stop it happening, to prevent it happening and to ensure that it never happens again and not to deal with the things that have happened regrettably in the past.  A number of people who may well be caught up in this have turned over a new leaf and what use is it to society to get revenge or vengeance or whatever against those people?  It is people we are concerned about and it is not going to change anything if we bring these people back now, extradite them and have them tried for alleged offences.  It is not going to change any of those things which regrettably have happened in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Rogers's contribution, it is my understanding that, for example, if the perpetrators of the Darkley murders were apprehended and their extradition was requested that they could well fail in seeking to claim that what they did was an act committed in connection with a political offence.  In other words, they could find themselves in the same position as the McGlinchey-type case before our courts and could, therefore, be extradited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned about in making a general provision, or rather in not ensuring that this Bill would be retrospective in general terms, is more the type of situation which Senator Brendan Ryan has raised in relation to countries which are parties to the Convention which until very recently were dictatorships or about which, like Turkey, we have good reason to be extremely worried not only about how a person would be tried but what might happen to them before the trial or what might happen to them when they were in custody there.  The Minister in response to Senator Brendan Ryan pointed out that Turkey does not extradite its own citizens so that under the reciprocity terms we <Col N="1766" /> would not be obliged to extradite our citizens.  It is much more likely that any request would be to extradite somebody not a citizen of Ireland but somebody who was charged with one of the offences for which it could no longer be claimed that it is a political offence and that this related to a particular period or even perhaps under present circumstances gave rise to worries on our part.  It is that kind of risk.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we are taking that kind of risk.  I do not think it will affect the situation in relation to serious offences in Northern Ireland for which it may be sought to claim that they were connected with political offences because the courts will still apply the judicial case law which has evolved in relation to them.  What I am more concerned about is having a Bill which relates to a number of different countries, where there may be a request for extradition, where the person would be put at risk of being extradited, not be able to claim that the offence was a political offence and then find themselves potentially in prison, tortured or whatever in the country or find that they were being tried for an offence for a particular period where the conduct on their part was carried out during a time of dictatorship, during a time of extreme emergency in the country.</P>
    <P>It is hard to foresee with total accuracy what the particular problems might be but I agree with Senator Rogers that the main thrust of this Bill is the convention on the suppression of terrorism, is a stand being taken by countries saying they will as of now take certain steps.  The House has approved the taking of those steps, I approve the taking of those steps but I do not think we should take any unnecessary risks.  Since the Minister has confirmed that this amendment would be compatible with our obligations as a country that has signed the convention and proposes to ratify it, I would submit we should accept this amendment because we should be very careful and very prudent about any legislation which we enact in this area.</P>

      <P>In response to my concern, the Minister referred to sections 8 and 9.  Sections 8 and 9 are fine in so far as they go, but nevertheless it would be true that in the case of Turkey, in the eyes of Amnesty International a person will not get a fair trial.  Therefore, we have no guarantee that a person could not be extradited and convicted on trumped up charges, having possibly been tortured in the interim, particularly a citizen of Turkey.  Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Lanigan have put down an amendment which would meet my reservations but as of now there is nothing in the convention which would enable the extraditing country to make any judgment about whether the person will receive a fair trial.  We can refuse extradition if we are satisfied the person is going to be prosecuted or persecuted for racial reasons or if there is evil intent involved, but provided we believe the person is going to be prosecuted for the charge under which the extradition warrant is issued we would have to extradite a Turkish citizen back to Turkey &mdash; to a country where people are liable to be tortured or tried before unfair military tribunals.  Those who drafted the Convention were being a little too sensitive to Turkish sensitivities.  I would have preferred if there was a provision in the Convention where we would have to be satisfied that the person being extradited would receive a fair trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill and this section of the Bill have nothing whatever to do with revenge or any concept of that kind. The section itself is a standard provision, common, as I said before, in extradition agreements and arrangements, a provision that was included in the Extradition Act, 1965, a provision that is included in other agreements we have outside the context of the Council of Europe and a provision that is in accordance with the approach taken by the European Convention on Extradition, at a time when similar debate was taking place in the preparation of that convention on the basis of the kind of view put forward in the amendment before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> In relation to the cases Senator Rogers had in mind, it is not the passage of this Bill that would provoke requests for the return of such persons.  If there was to be a series of requests for the return of persons to Northern Ireland it would surely have happened at the time when it became clear that our courts had themselves decided on the basis of their view of the Constitution and the law that certain offences were not to be regarded as political offences.  I would like to correct an impression I may have given Senator Rogers.  I did not say we had received no warrants for offences committed in the early or mid-seventies or any other periods I mentioned.  What I said was that we now have on hands no warrants in relation to offences committed in the early or mid-seventies.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson is correct in saying that the amendment put down would be compatible and could be encompassed in our legislation without doing any violence to the convention.  Equally the provision in section 1 could have the same said of it and, furthermore, it is in accordance with the result of a debate of the kind that took place during the preparation of the Convention on Extradition.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Brendan Ryan's concerns I would draw his attention to section 11 of the Extradition Act, 1965. Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Extradition shall not be granted for an offence which is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The same rule shall apply if there are substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.</P>
    <P>That provision is there to deal with the kind of situation that Senator Brendan Ryan has referred to.  Further, under the <Col N="1769" /> terms of the convention and in our law the offence for which the extradition of a person can be sought must be an offence not only in the law of the requesting country but also in the law of the requested country.  If, for example, the Turkish authorities sought the extradition from here of a person of whatever nationality for an offence which was an offence in Turkey but not an offence under our law, then we would not be obliged to extradite that person and that person would be entitled to succeed in resisting any such attempt.  If the accusation levelled against the person is related to something which is an offence in Turkey but not an offence here, then the extradition cannot take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be addressing the nub of my problem.  It is perfectly feasible for an unscrupulous government and unscrupulous authorities &mdash; and in the view of Amnesty International it would appear that the Turkish authorities are not particularly scrupulous about these matters &mdash; to allege that a person, for instance under section 3 (3) (vi), attempted to commit an offence involving the use of a firearm and to seek the extradition of a Turkish citizen from this country.  What the Minister quoted from the Extradition Act would provide no protection for such an individual.  Yet, the opinion of Amnesty International is that such a person is not guaranteed a free trial.  Secondly, if they were to be found not guilty in Turkey, they would be back in Turkey and according to Amnesty International would be liable to torture and ill-treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This can be discussed under a separate amendment.  At least the non-retrospective application of this Act will at least guarantee that for the future we would have no such problem, but as of now, a Turkish citizen living here could be extradited to Turkey on a warrant which alleged that they attempted to commit an offence using a firearm and could be brought to Turkey where they would not get a fair trial and where, if they were found not guilty, would still <Col N="1770" /> be under the jurisdiction of Turkey and liable according to Amnesty International to detention as a prisoner of conscience, to the possibility of torture which is widespread or to the possibility of ill-treatment.  Under the convention we have no way of protecting a person from that treatment.  One way of minimising that risk is to eliminate the retrospective effect.  A further way would be the third Fianna Fáil method as I understand it.  The Minister has not addressed this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for clarification.  I did not follow fully the point he made about an amendment being proposed to the convention along the lines of Senator Eoin Ryan's amendment we are discussing here and then being dropped.  Was that in relation to the European Convention on Extradition in 1957, the earlier convention? That would make it much more understandable. That was the European Convention on Extradition which put forward and safeguarded the political offence exception &mdash; that there would not be extradition for political offences or offences connected with political offences &mdash; and that is what is reflected in the 1965 Act.  Therefore, there would have been much less of the concern we are faced with here, of changing that position in relation to what would constitute a political offence and doing so in a way that would be retrospective.</P>
      <P>I say that in particular because it seems to me from the explanatory report on the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which was produced by the Council of Europe that there was a change in policy and approach but it was a change that evolved and is very much a change in that, for the future a certain course of action will take place. For example, on the first page in the introduction to the explanatory memorandum there is reference to the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe that there should be a narrowing of the definition of a political offence, in effect.  It says, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> The idea underlining this resolution is that certain crimes are so odious in their methods or results in relation to their motives, that it is no longer justifiable to classify them as political offences for which extradition is not possible.</P>
    <P>That is the situation we are in in relation to acceding to this later convention on the suppression of terrorism and the consequential changes in our own extradition law, that it is no longer justifiable.  That is more fairly done if one says it is no longer justifiable and therefore will apply to offences committed or alleged to have been committed after the passing of the Act.  Otherwise we are saying it is no longer justifiable and are making it no longer justifiable retrospectively.  That seems not to be fully in accord with the kind of principles which should apply.  As Senator Eoin Ryan said in opening on this amendment it is close to making something an offence retrospectively.  It is not doing exactly that, but it is saying that what was justifiable at a certain period is no longer justifiable.  But we do not do it for the future; we say it is no longer justifiable and we are making that retrospective.  Even though the Minister has referred to the consideration of a similar amendment in relation to the earlier Convention on Extradition, I do not think that is a particularly weighty argument given that that Convention on Extradition safeguarded and indeed promoted the exception of the political offence or an offence connected with a political offence and gave rise to the advice of the Irish members of the law enforcement report set up at the time of Sunningdale.  This was a mandatory principle of international law and therefore we could not depart in any way from the putting forward of the defence that the offence was a political offence or was connected with a political offence and therefore there could not be extradition for it.  The arguments in support of Senator Eoin Ryan's amendment are actually reflected in the thinking behind the convention itself and the explanatory <Col N="1772" /> report of it, that something is no longer justifiable.  Because of the way in which the acts of terrorism have increased on the European level, European states have viewed with concern the operation of a political offence exception.  The way in which it was operating was no longer justifiable.  It seems that that is better reflected in legislation which does not have a retrospective element in it.  Again, I agree with Senator Brendan Ryan that his particular concerns have not been answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Robinson's perspective on this is a little too narrow.  I take the point she makes about the evolution in thinking and approach that emerged after the drawing up of the Convention on Extradition and was to lead to a different view being taken some time later of the scope of the political offence exception.  I think what Senator Robinson meant when she used the word &ldquo;justifiable&rdquo; would be more accurately conveyed &ldquo;non-extraditable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not speaking of crimes being justifiable; they were speaking of a certain approach to political crimes being justifiable.  However, the fact is that it is recognised that there was a development in thinking which led to the terms of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the countries of the Council of Europe were preparing the European Convention on Extradition they were in fact taking, from many points of view, a far more fundamental step than they were taking in framing the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism because, for the first time, they were saying, &ldquo;we will agree among ourselves as a group of countries that we will extradite persons to one another on the conditions laid down in the convention&rdquo;.  It was within that framework in taking a fundamental step of that kind, that they had the debate to which I referred and came to the conclusion that the Extradition convention <Col N="1773" /> should adopt the same approach to the matter that we are now discussing as I have proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Taking the argument in the terms in which Senator Robinson has put it, if they took that approach while taking that fundamental step then it was legitimate, in their view at that time and the conclusion I would draw from Senator Robinson's argument is that in fact it is illegitimate for us to take the same approach in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan feels that I have not addressed his question.  If I have not then I apologise to him for that.  In fact Senator Brendan Ryan seems to be under the impression that the amendment proposed by Senator Eoin Ryan would introduce, as from now, certain protections which people do not have in relation to the concerns he expressed about Turkey. That of course is not the case.  I have reminded the House of the provisions of section 11 of the 1965 Extradition Act.  I have reminded the House that in every case where extradition or the backing of a warrant is sought a person can contest the validity of the request or warrant.  He can go before the District Court and, if necessary, to a higher court.  It is open to that person, invoking the terms of section 11 of the 1965 Act among others, but invoking the terms of that section, to plead before the court that case is, as Senator Ryan alleges it is, and that for all of those reasons that Senator Brendan Ryan has developed we should not give effect to the request.  It is up to the court then in each case to decide on the basis of the law and practice whether it accepts the claim that is being made by that person.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that there are no protections in place now.  There are protections in place.  The fact of the matter is, of course, that they have never been invoked because we have never had, as far as I know &mdash; I speak subject to correction and if I need correction I will immediately communicate it to the Senator &mdash; a request for extradition so the matter has never arisen.  It is probably for that reason that people may feel there are no protections there.  They are there. <Col N="1774" /> They are in the terms of the 1965 Act which in fact we are repeating in a slightly different context in the Bill before us.</P>

      <P>There is also another aspect of this that I would like to ask the Minister about.  What will be the position with people who, say, in the early seventies had, on the advice of their own counsel, admitted that they were in the IRA and that they had carried out the alleged offences for political reasons or in defence of their own community?  What would be the position now if a District Court produced evidence supplied to the RUC of affidavits sworn by those people at that time in the situation which existed then?  What would be the position if that were now turned against them as evidence and used in the courts as evidence that they had been members of the IRA and had committed these crimes?  I would like to know what the Minister's reply to that would be.</P>

I thought in the beginning that Senator Rogers might be referring to cases which had been determined in a court in a certain way and that the prosecution might now, for one reason or another, have second thoughts and decide to try the matter all over again.  It seems that that question is one I cannot answer.  It is one that would have to be answered first of all by the prosecuting authorities in the relevant jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>It would be a total injustice if people, who under circumstances prevailing in the early seventies where the courts accepted the concept of a political crime, swore an affidavit stating in their own defence that they were members of the IRA and that they had done things in defence of their own people or their own area, and that therefore it was political, in the new situation <Col N="1775" /> which may arise if this Bill is passed without amendments, could have that evidence used against them.  I am not a legal person and I do not understand absolutely how the law works, but as an ordinary person concerned about people's rights, I am very worried that those people would find that they had in effect helped to convict themselves in a new situation, when they had sworn the affidavit in a different situation.  It is very worrying that that should be allowed to happen.  May be the lawyers in the Seanad would like to comment on it.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I understand the scope of the question by Senator Rogers but it seems to me that the first place that that question should be put to is the prosecuting authorities, who might now decide, for one reason or another, to take a different view of a case from that which they would have taken ten or 12 years ago.  It would be up to the prosecution authorities to justify acting on the basis of that different view.  If the question relates to a case where conceivably an order for the return of a person was sought from here and a political defence was successfully claimed at an earlier time, and the matter was disposed of in that manner, the question would really then be whether a resubmission of that case here under the terms of this Bill would now result in an extradition. I could not answer that question, because it would be for a court to determine. The court would have regard to all of the circumstances of the case.  I could not anticipate what decision a court would make there.  It can only be in relation to extradition cases that that kind of question might conceivably arise, because, within the confines of the domestic jurisdiction there is no such thing as a political defence.  The question that would have to be resolved in relation to extradition is not the question of guilt or innocence but the question of whether the person is liable to be extradited and I simply could not say how a given court would react to a case where there had previously been a refusal of extradition <Col N="1776" /> and where the same matter was brought before the court to re-examine that question.</P>

      <P>It is becoming clear to me as a non-legal person that Senator Eoin Ryan's original point is reinforced by this.  The fact that it will be a matter for the courts, means that people may have sworn affidavits in a totally different situation, which will now be used against them in the new situation.  They did something within the situation prevailing in the early seventies, which could now possibly &mdash; because, the Minister, cannot give a guarantee &mdash; be used as evidence against them in a new situation.  The Minister cannot guarantee that that will not happen.  It would be a matter for the prosecuting authorities and in the case of someone being extradited from this jurisdiction into the North would it be a matter for the prosecuting authorities in the North?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of what I can and cannot guarantee.  I am not in a position to give guarantees.  I do not think I used the word.  What I said is that I cannot say how a court would decide on the issue.  I am not saying that I can guarantee what view the prosecuting authority would take of it because I cannot say what view the prosecuting authorities would take.  The initiative would have to come from the prosecuting authorities in Northern Ireland in the cases to which Senator Rogers is referring. They are not in any way beholden to me for their activities.  I have no function in the matter at all.  I cannot say what approach they would take to the kind of case that Senator Rogers has in mind.  But if the prosecuting authorities elsewhere were to take a different view, in cases of the kind that Senator Rogers is hypoth-esising at the moment, it is not now that they would begin to take that different view.  They would have taken that view, if there was any validity in it, at a time when it was established in our courts that the political offence exception was not as wide as we had previously thought it was. <Col N="1777" /> Had there been, or were there a disposition on the part of prosecution authorities there, to act in the way Senator Rogers is suggesting, we would have seen it by now.  Because, at no time was it ever the situation that a case could not be brought to us here.  Since 1922 any case can be brought here.  The only thing that is always in doubt is what decision the court will actually make about it.  Given the development outlined by Senator Robinson last night of the way in which courts approached these particular kind of offences, it would be logical to expect that if there were to be any change in approach it would have happened before now when the courts had made it clear that their view is the one they have taken now in a succession of cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming in on this point with some reluctance because I do not have any authoritative answer to the very serious issues raised by Senator Rogers.  My recollection, not a perfect recollection, is that the Supreme Court in a comparatively recent case allowed the defence of a political offence in relation to a person who had been involved with others in the perpetration of the offence and the others had at an earlier stage pleaded and relied upon and availed of the political offence defence.  I cannot remember the name of the case. It was a case decided about two years ago by the Supreme Court where in applying equity as between defendants, the <Col N="1778" /> Supreme Court made it clear that in the circumstances of that case, since the other persons involved had availed of, and had successfully contested their extradition, by pleading that it was a political offence, they would not single out the one who came before the courts after the evolution of the approach following the McGlinchey case.  That is a somewhat hazy recollection but it shows that the issue is a real one.  It is more a question of trying to formulate the risks.</P>
      <P>What I would be concerned about is that following the passage of this Bill as it stands the court dealing with this matter would have before it legislation which said that it applied to an offence committed before the passing of the Bill. Therefore there is at least a risk of this kind of situation.  Like Senator Rogers, I do not see the merit of exposing ourselves to this kind of risk.  I would prefer if we had taken a very clear stand on the convention and on our own extradition legislation, that we knew what we were doing and were not exposing people to potential risks of that kind.  I support the points she made.</P>

      <P>Some of my colleagues have been able to make a much stronger case for this amendment than I have been able to make myself.  In view of the fact that the Minister has conceded that there are certain situations which might arise which would certainly be unjust to the people concerned and in view of the fact that he, I think it would be fair to say, did not envisage them when this Bill was introduced he should consider agreeing to this amendment.  As I said earlier, the Bill will achieve 95 per cent of what it is setting out to do even if this amendment is agreed to and the Minister should be satisfied with a situation where the Bill is going to achieve most of what was intended when it was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very serious risks in not allowing this amendment and two different situations have been suggested by Senator Rogers and Senator Brendan Ryan.  There are very serious risks involved in both cases.  The Minister should accept that that is a risk and that <Col N="1779" /> in all the circumstances it would be safer to agree to this amendment.  By so doing he would be taking from the Bill in a very small way but most of the purpose of the Bill would be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it clear that contrary to what Senator Eoin Ryan has said, I have not conceded that certain risks would arise.  What I have said it that in the event that situations such as those <Col N="1780" /> hypothesised by Senator Rogers might arise it seems that they would have arisen when it became clear that our courts had taken the line they have taken in relation to the political offence exception and that that would not arise simply because of the passage of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to clarify the interpretation of &ldquo;convention country.&rdquo;  As set out there it says the &ldquo;convention country means a country other than the State for the time being standing designated in an order under section 2&rdquo;.  Section 2 provides what could be regarded as an enabling section, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may, by order, designate the countries which are parties to the European Convention. In relation to understanding what is meant by &ldquo;convention country&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill, is the Minister for Foreign Affairs required to designate a country once that country has ratified the convention, or is there a discretion which would reflect on the definition of &ldquo;convention country&rdquo; not to designate certain <Col N="1781" /> countries?  For example, going back to some of the earlier debate, there were reservations by Members in regard to Turkey but Turkey has ratified the convention. Could it be excluded from the definition of &ldquo;convention country&rdquo; if it was not designated by the Minister?  Does the Minister have a ministerial discretion in that matter or is he bound to designate it once a country has ratified the convention, whatever reservations might be felt?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;(1)  No citizen of Ireland shall be extradited pursuant to the provisions of this Act, or the Act of 1965, unless the provisions of subsection (2) of this section have been satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  No order for the extradition of an Irish citizen shall be made unless the District Court is satisfied, on the evidence before it, that there is a sufficient case which would warrant the sending forward for trial of that person <Col N="1782" /> as if the offence alleged were an indictable offence and had been committed within the State.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a)  For the purpose of subsection (2) hereof evidence may include or consist of documents referred to in section 6 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>(b)  The said documents shall be served on the person whose extradition is sought and copies shall be furnished to the Court.</P>
    <P>(c)  A document served pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be received in evidence without further proof if it purports to be signed or certified by a judge, magistrate or other judicial officer of the requesting country or place and to be authenticated by the oath of some witness.</P>
    <P>(4)  (a)  Where the extradition of an Irish citizen is being sought in respect of an offence for which that person has already been convicted in the requesting State, subsection (2) of this section shall be deemed to have been complied with if evidence is tendered which satisfies the District Court of the fact of that conviction.</P>
    <P>(b)  Provided always that no person shall be extradited if that person has been tried and convicted <i>in absentia..</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is principally to deal with the question of whether a person can be extradited without a <i>prima facie</i> case being made against him or her.  It also deals with a case where a person has been convicted, and that is a different matter, but principally it deals with the question of a <i>prima facie</i> case being made.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the amendment merely deals with the case of citizens, of nationals of Ireland.  It only provides that in the case of nationals a <i>prima facie</i> case must be made.  I know it can be argued that if we provided for this in the case of extradition to all the countries involved in the convention it would create certain difficulties and, consequently, it provides only in the case <Col N="1783" /> of Irish nationals.  It would probably create difficulties in the case of other countries because some of them do not have the procedure for requiring a <i>prima facie</i> case to be made and it would be inappropriate to that extent.</P>
    <P>What is provided in this amendment is that in the case of an Irish national for whom extradition is sought, a <i>prima facie</i> case must be made before extradition is granted.  This seems to be an eminently reasonable requirement because if he cannot be sent forward for trial in his own country without the case being made, then why should he be sent forward for trial in another country?  The arguments seem to be very much in favour of it.  It should be looked at in the context of the fact that many other countries who have signed the convention have signed it with various reservations.  A great many of the countries involved will not extradite their own national at all.  That applies in the case of Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.  They will deal with it in another way but they will not extradite a national.  I realise there would be considerable difficulties if we were to adopt the same reservations as these countries and say we will not extradite a national. Because of the position in the North of Ireland and the UK, that would obviously make the situation very difficult indeed but not impossible because they could still be dealt with under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>In this amendment in the case of Irish nationals, we are going a long way towards accepting the spirit of the convention &mdash; we will extradite them but only if a <i>prima facie</i> case is made against them.  On the one hand that is being reasonable and is going a long way towards doing what this Bill requires us to do but, on the other hand, it gives some protection to our own nationals.  It gives the protection which they would have in their own country if they were charged with an offence and under that situation they would not be sent forward for trial unless a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> That is the principal provision in this amendment.  In all the circumstances it goes a long way towards meeting our obligations under the convention and, at the same time, it provides the same kind of protection that a national would have if he was charged with an offence in this country.  I cannot see how any strong argument could be made against adopting this amendment.  There are many reservations expressed by various countries in regard to this convention.  Reservations are made in regard to <i>prima facie</i> case, to nationals, to the kind of court that the person might be tried by and in regard to who decides whether it is a political offence.</P>
    <P>In regard to <i>prima facie</i> case, extradition will not take place from the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Israel or Norway; according to a list I have here they will not extradite unless a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made.  A number of other contries have similar provisions.  The <i>prima facie</i> procedure would not be applicable to many of these countries which have an inquisitorial system.  Countries such as Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, Italy and The Netherlands have similar kinds of protections in regard to extradition which cannot be <i>prima facie</i> because it would not apply in these countries, but there are similar protections of that kind.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, an amendment to provide that our own nationals will not be put in a worse position than they would be if they were charged with an offence in this country is a reasonable one.  Against the background of these various other countries who have introduced various reservations, this would seem an eminently modest provision, a very modest protection for our own citizens and one which is in no way contrary to the spirit of the Bill or the spirit of the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It might perhaps be withdrawn. It should be withdrawn because I <Col N="1785" /> cannot accept it.  The effect of the amendment would be to impose a requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made out before our courts before extradition of an Irish national could be granted.  From the terms of the amendment it is clear that that requirement would apply in all cases. It would apply, therefore, in ordinary criminal cases as well as the kind of cases to which this Bill applies.  I dealt with this matter at some length last evening on Second Stage and I do not intend to go through all of those arguments again.</P>
      <P>I want to make a number of points because I think there are a number of misconceptions about what is involved in a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  The combined effect of this amendment, and of the following amendment in the names of Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Lanigan, would be to make extradition impossible in practical terms.  If accepted, they would also amount to a very public and totally unambiguous statement both to the people of Northern Ireland and the people of Britain that we were abandoning the Anglo-Irish Agreement and all that means to all of us.  The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen our extradition arrangements in accordance with trends to which our European neighbours subscribe. If these amendments were adopted we would throw overboard the legal advance we have been making for some time in our efforts to deal with terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill relates to acts of terrorism which can occur in any part of Europe. The reality is that we are dealing almost exclusively with cases which have a Northern Ireland connection, whether they involve violence perpetrated in Northern Ireland or in Britain.  In that context almost all of the people who would be sought here would be likely to be Irish citizens because, as I pointed out the House last evening, we have the widest citizenship laws of any of the countries that are signatories to the European Convention on Extradition.  We are in a position that is unique in Europe.  No other state in Europe, in looking at its extradition laws, has to deal with the <Col N="1786" /> situation where virtually everybody in another jurisdiction is a citizen of that state under the laws of that state.</P>
    <P>I might be asked what that has to do with the <i>prima facie</i> requirement but it has a great deal to do with that requirement particularly as it is proposed here. If we impose that requirement in relation to Irish citizens we are in practice imposing it in relation to everybody in the context of Northern Ireland.  In doing that we would be abandoning an approach which is now established throughout Europe with a couple of exceptions.  Even those exceptions have a much more limited significance than might appear at first sight.  A civil law country operates a system by which a case is made in large measure by documentary evidence.  Our system is geared to oral evidence and to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, witnesses may have to be brought before a court and be available for examination.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary earlier in the debate made the point &mdash; and it was conceded by Senator Fitzsimons &mdash; that when we speak of a <i>prima facie</i> case we are not referring simply to the provision of a Book of Evidence.  The making of a <i>prima facie</i> case at a preliminary examination under our law may involve witnesses being called and examined on sworn deposition.  The proposed amendment refers to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  Under section 7 (2) of that Act either the prosecutor or the accused or both is entitled &ldquo;to require the attendance before the justice of any person, whether included in the supplied lists of witnesses or not, and to examine him by way of sworn deposition&rdquo;.  Such a person can be cross-examined and re-examined on his evidence.  I do not need to labour the point that such a procedure would create very serious difficulties in extradition cases particularly in connection with producing witnesses from another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The amendment at subsection (2) says &ldquo;no order for the extradition of an Irish citizen shall be made unless the District Court is satisfied, on the evidence before it, that there is a sufficient case which <Col N="1787" /> would warrant the sending forward for trial of that person as if the offence alleged were an indictable offence and had been committed within the State&rdquo;. The amendment provides at subsection (3) (a) that evidence may include or consist of documents of a kind that are included in a Book of Evidence, but the amendment does not confine the type of evidence that might be adduced to documentary evidence only.  Even if it sought to do so, it seems to be quite certain that this would not and could not work.</P>
    <P>The reason I say that it would not work is that a justice is not necessarily satisfied at a preliminary hearing on the basis only of statements and other documents taken at their face value.  An important element in a preliminary case before a justice is the fact that the defendant has the opportunity to have witnesses examined on sworn deposition.  If he does not exercise that right then that fact is relevant to the justice's decision.  It is one thing to accept, as being adequate, evidence that is uncontested where the opportunity to contest it has been provided.  It would be an entirely different matter to accept the evidence where that opportunity has not been afforded.  It is realistic to say that practically every extradition case would be contested.  The amendment as it stands is not workable because it leaves open the possibility of witnesses having to be called from a foreign jurisdiction.  Even if it were modified to take account of that difficulty, I would suggest that it is not a practical proposition in the context of our general law.  I am therefore opposed to it on those grounds.</P>
    <P>There are other practical difficulties in addition to the ones already mentioned. Any evidence tendered would have to conform with the rules as to the admissibility of evidence under our law.  The general rule under our law is to exclude hearsay evidence.  That apparently simple rule would present difficulties to a civil law jurisdiction seeking the extradition of a person.  The practice in some of those countries is not to take statements direct from witnesses but for a police <Col N="1788" /> officer to testify in writing as to what witnesses said to him.  The <i>proces verbal</i> presented to an investigating magistrate in France, for example, may consist of a written statement by a police officer acting as an agent of the magistrate and relating what witnesses have said to him. Even as between common law jurisdictions, as between our jurisdiction and that of Northern Ireland or Britain, there can be considerable differences in rules as to the admissibility of evidence.</P>
    <P>There is also the point made by Senator Dooge last evening that extradition is not a one-way process.  If we were to impose a <i>prima facie</i> requirement in relation to extradition applications from, say, Northern Ireland or Britain, considerations of reciprocity would almost certainly lead them to do the same in the case of applications sent to them from here.  That would mean that a very serious impediment would be put in the way of our securing the extradition from Britain or from Northern Ireland of persons wanted here for any kind of crime including the kinds of crime that we are speaking of specifically in the context of this Bill but also in relation to other kinds of crime.  I do not think that that is a development that we would welcome.  I would regard it as being a retrograde step not only in relation to terrorism but in relation to our ability to deal with crime generally.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to make one final and very brief point, that it is not accurate to allege that there are no protections for persons without a <i>prima facie</i> case because, of course, in other jurisdictions when a person has been extradited the question arises of a committee hearing in that jurisdiction.  What we decide on here in relation to requests for extradition is the simple question of extraditability, not the question of guilt or innocence.</P>

      <P>On a point of order before Senator McDonald resumes on this Private Members' Bill put forward by Senator Brendan Ryan, I would like to refer to the very unusual context in which this Bill has been ordered today.  I do so on a point of order because I was distressed to see that the Minister caused a letter to be published in the national newspapers by her public relations officer which implied that it would be normal that this Bill would be resumed for debate today and that Senator Brendan Ryan, in publicising the manner in which the debate had taken place on the two occasions on which it had been ordered for Private Members' Time, was somehow misleading the public.  I would like to defend Senator Brendan Ryan and indeed to compliment him on having made a sufficient fuss about the very deplorable way in which the Minister failed to come in on the debate when it was ordered for Private Members' Time, which would normally have meant that it would not be re-ordered during the lifetime of this Government.  I supported Senator Ryan in the House on the occasion when we sought to have the Minister come in on the Bill in the normal way.  I congratulate him on having made &mdash; and properly made &mdash; a sufficient fuss to have so embarrassed the Minister that she has caused this Bill to be specially ordered for debate today.  It was wrong of her&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like very briefly to conclude the remarks I was making on the last day by way of saying that those of us in public life who are in day to day contact with the Minister's huge Department find very often that there is a certain amount of frustration in the way decisions are handed down by the deciding officer.  Reading sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill as sponsored by Senators Brendan Ryan, Robb, Ross and McGuinness, I cannot but give a certain amount of support to them.  The only reservation I would have is that the volume of appeals is so great that the very fact of putting them through a system of appeals tribunal could very well tend to slow them down unless we had a tribunal <Col N="1791" /> in each and every county; perhaps that would be possible.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty that one daily comes across is the inability of many applicants to put forward the case in their own favour &mdash; to make their own case sufficiently succinctly and well to gain for them in justice what very often politicians feel they are entitled to.  I am confident that the Minister, in considering improvements to this portion of the administration of social welfare will consider improving the present situation.  I know that the Department of Social Welfare and the officials do a tremendous job, but any legislation dealing with social welfare is of tremendous importance, not so much by virtue of the fact of its being social welfare, but that it is now the biggest spending Department in the State.  There are so many thousands of people depending on it.  I hope the Department and the Minister will examine this area to see what further improvements can be made in the administration of this very important part of the public service.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity this afternoon to make a contribution on this Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill introduced by Senator Brendan Ryan.  It is unfortunate that statements have been made in the press and elsewhere which allege reluctance on my part to make a contribution to this debate.  It is important that I should assure Senators and, in particular, Senators Ryan and Robinson that I am not at all reluctant to make that contribution &mdash; far from it.  I was sorry to hear Senator Robinson speak as she did here just a few moments ago.  I would have preferred if she had established the facts as set out by Senator Dooge before she had spoken, because it is uncharacteristic of Senator Robinson to be so ill-prepared as to present an outburst of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the point that I do not have a public relations officer.  The press <Col N="1792" /> officer of the Department of Social Welfare answered some letters in the newspaper which had made an attack on me arising out of the last time that this subject arose in the Seanad.  He felt it was necessary to do so to put the record straight.  An interesting aspect of that was that the same letter from the Senator appeared in the local newspaper of my own constituency for some reason.</P>

      <P>At the moment, in the Department of Social Welfare we are in the throes of examining the report of the Commission on Social Welfare who have recommended a number of major changes in the social welfare system, not least in the social welfare appeals system. There is, undoubtedly, a need to review the operation of the system and to see how it can be adapted to meet the circumstances of today.  This debate gives us the opportunity to discuss the form these changes should take and, in particular, whether the system put forward by Senator Ryan is the best one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity which this debate has given to hear the views of Senators on the system and to set out my impressions and views on the existing system and how I see it developing in the future.  I also notice that in Senator Ryan's opening remarks on this Bill he expressed the hope that the introduction of the Bill would evoke a response, stimulate consideration of the issue and, perhaps, increase the priority given to it in the Department of Social Welfare.  Judging by the contributions to the debate in this House so far, Senator Ryan can feel confident that he has already achieved some of his objectives and I can assure <Col N="1794" /> him of my concern and my Department's concern also in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have been following with great interest the debate so far and I would like to assure Senators that all the points that are being raised will be carefully considered. Let me emphasise this: I am totally committed to ensuring that we have the best possible decision and appeal mechanisms so that we can be confident that our decisions on entitlements under the social welfare system are fair and correct and are seen to be so. There are, undoubtedly, deficiencies in the present system and I would not attempt to deny this.  I think, however, that we must look at the present system in an objective way and examine its strengths as well as its weaknesses before we draw a definite conclusion as to the changes which need to be made.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to consider first the whole decision and appeals procedures that operate in the Department of Social Welfare and to put them into context. It is a fundamental aspect of our social security system and one which up to now has not got the attention it deserves.  The central issue, of course, is how to maintain the balance between achieving effectiveness and efficiency in the administration while at the same time protecting the rights, constitutional and legal, of the clients.</P>
    <P>As any public representative knows the social welfare system is highly complex and highly legalistic.  There are about 30 different social welfare schemes each with its own set of rules, regulations and conditions.  Obviously, there are some basic ground rules but because the system developed in a piecemeal fashion, responding to particular needs identified at certain times, we have a compartmentalised system that results in the myriad of conditions that have to be satisfied. When one looks back at the development of the social welfare system it is easy to understand how this has happened; the real challenge lies in deciding how best to develop this patchwork system.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recognised this and made a number of fundamental recommendations which <Col N="1795" /> would assist in rationalising and streamlining the social welfare system and, as I have said, these recommendations are under consideration.  One result of the complexity of the present system is that it creates difficulties for the clients of the system who may find it difficult to establish their rights, for the administrators who must ensure that their actions are legal and fair and, indeed for us, the legislators, who must continually be seeking ways of improving the system so that it continues to meet the changing needs of the community which it is there to serve.</P>
    <P>Each year my Department receive over 1.2 million claims to social welfare payments and benefits of one kind or another.  This represents some 24,000 claims per week on which decisions have to be made.  However, this is not the whole picture; cases are constantly being reviewed to reflect changing circumstances or to establish whether a person's situation has changed since the original decision in his or her case.  Each of these has to be processed.  This may include examining a person's record of social insurance contributions, assessing means, establishing dates of birth, domestic situation and so on.</P>
    <P>Basically there are two types of social welfare payments &mdash; one based on insurance records and the other based on means.  By far the majority &mdash; over 70 per cent &mdash; of claims received are for benefits based on social insurance records.  In these cases the person must satisfy what are called contribution conditions, that is, he or she must have paid so many social insurance contributions over a certain period, and also other conditions specific to the particular pension or benefit.  For instance, in the case of an old age pension the person must have reached pension age or, in the case of disability benefit, must be incapable of work.  In most cases the issues relating to contributions can be established fairly readily.  My Department maintain, for each insured person, a record of contributions paid over the years.  Since 1981 <Col N="1796" /> this information has been held on computer systems and this has significantly improved the efficiency of the system. The number of contributions paid is a matter of fact that can be quite easily determined in the vast bulk of cases and only occasionally does a dispute arise on this matter.</P>
    <P>The main area of contention relates to specific conditions that a person must satisfy under particular schemes.  These conditions are quite specific &mdash; it is, however, in trying to establish that these conditions are fulfilled that most difficulties arise.  For instance, to get an unemployment payment a person must, apart from satisfying a contribution test or a means test, also be both available for work and genuinely seeking work.  To be entitled to a deserted wife's benefit or allowance a woman must be deserted.  In areas like this we must be particularly careful to ensure that our decision-making processes are adequate and that adequate arrangements exist for the redress of any grievance which clients of the system may have.</P>
    <P>It is the practice in most countries to provide a formal system of administrative decision making and some formal avenue of redress for a citizen who feels aggrieved by an administrative decision. In Ireland the normal procedure is for Ministers to be held personally responsible for decisions.  More recently, of course, we had the creation of the Office of the Ombudsman and this provides people with a mechanism to ensure that the laws are being applied correctly and fairly.  Decisions and appeals in the social welfare area are an exception to the general position in relation to ministerial responsibility.  In this area there is formal delegation to decide issues to officers who are appointed by the Minister under the legislation.  As most Senators will be aware a similar situation applies in relation to the inspectors of taxes.  Our Constitution recognises the need for these types of situations.</P>
    <P>Article 37 of the Constitution lays down that any person or body of persons duly authorised by law may exercise limited functions and powers of a judicial <Col N="1797" /> nature, in matters other than criminal matters, notwithstanding that such body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The complexity of modern social legislation has meant that Article 37 has been utilised in a large number of fields by the setting up of what are known as &ldquo;administrative tribunals&rdquo;.  These can take the form of departmental tribunals where an Act vests the power to settle disputes between the applicant and the administration in the hands of a designated officer.  The best example of this type of tribunal is the decision making system we are discussing today; where both the original decision and the appeal are decided by officers of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Despite appearances, and this is something I intend returning to later, this does not mean that the machinery is merely an adjunct of the administrative process or that these designated officers are no more than civil servants carrying out the wishes of their Minister.  The Supreme Court has made this very clear.  In the often cited case of <i>McLoughlin v. Minister for Social Welfare</i> nearly 30 years ago the Supreme Court laid down that the appeals officers and deciding officers under the Social Welfare Act are required to be free and unrestricted by ministerial control in discharging their functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>The distinguishing features of the present system are that it is a quasijudicial process which involves, as I have said, the concept of legal entitlement together with discretionary elements.  All claims and questions relating to the various benefits, assistance and pensions that are administered by my Department as well as questions as to the insurability of employment are decided by deciding officers who are statutorily appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare and hold this position for as long as the Minister thinks fit.  This is a very formal process. Section 295 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, contains the relevant provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> In determining entitlement to a benefit, pension or allowance a deciding officer or an appeals officer is expected to make every inquiry necessary to satisfy himself that the relevant conditions for entitlement are satisfied or not satisfied as the case may be.  He must ensure basic fairness of procedure to the citizen. There is in our Constitution an implied guarantee to this effect.  The officers must also be satisfied that the conditions for receiving benefit are fulfilled.  The responsibility has been placed on them by the legislation and they are responsible for the correctness of their decisions &mdash; this applies as much in cases where payments are awarded as it does where claims are rejected.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the debate previously and at some length by Senator Ferris, to the process of decision making in relation to disability benefit and I would like to refer to this.  Disability benefit is paid, in the first instance, to qualified persons who are certified as being incapable of work due to medical incapacity by their own doctor.  Obviously deciding officers cannot, on their own, make a judgment as to a person's unfitness for work and their decision must have regard to the medical evidence.  In the administration of this scheme medical supervision by the Department's own doctors is also necessary to ensure that only persons who are genuinely ill and incapable of work are paid benefit. Accordingly, it is the practice to refer claimants for examination by the Department's medical referees.  The medical referee system was introduced following consultation with representatives of the medical profession and I believe the system has proved to be effective in-combating abuse, that system has stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>Where a medical referee finds a person capable of work it is normal practice to discontinue payment of benefit.  Senator Ferris is not happy with this practice in the case where the person appeals but, in practical terms, I do not think there is any reasonable alternative.  Otherwise, any person who is disallowed would automatically appeal whether or not he had <Col N="1799" /> any grounds for such an appeal.  We have a duty to exercise an adequate degree of control of the system of disability benefit payments.  If the person concerned appeals against the decision, a further medical opinion is sought from a different medical referee who also examines the appellant.  If the second medical referee is of the opinion that the person is incapable of work, benefit is normally restored by the deciding officer from the date on which it was originally discontinued. Otherwise, the case is submitted to an appeals officer for determination.</P>
    <P>In all cases where a claimant is summoned to attend a medical referee examination, the claimant's own doctor is advised of the proposed examination and invited to submit an appropriate medical report.  I might add here that a report is only, in fact, received in a small number of cases.  The medical referee will take such a report into account when arriving at his or her opinion of the case.  Furthermore, the claimant's own doctor is invited to the examination if he or she so wishes.  Again, this offer is very infrequently taken up.</P>
    <P>Where additional medical evidence is submitted by or on behalf of a claimant, for example, a specialist report, it too will be fully taken into account by the medical referee.  There is no question that reports of this type are ignored as has been suggested.  People are entitled to submit whatever evidence they consider worthwhile in support of their claim and this will be fully considered.  Where a medical referee feels that further medical information is needed he or she will arrange for it to be supplied.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to a particular disability benefit appeal case which took over two years to complete because of difficulty in establishing the medical evidence of incapacity for work.  This, of course, would be very exceptional and I imagine that no matter what type of appeal structure or system we adopt there would always be a possibility of lengthy delays in the odd case where difficult medical determinations have to be made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> It is inevitable that a control system such as the medical referee one will attract a certain amount of unfavourable mention.  People do not like being knocked off benefit.  It is difficult, however, to see how you could replace it with any better procedure that would do the required job as efficiently or as effectively. The medical referees are carefully chosen for their work and are professionally committed to doing a fair and non-biased job.  I am satisfied that every medical referee opinion is given following an appropriate medical examination and in the light of all medical evidence available to the medical referee such as the GP's report and any specialist reports, X-rays etc., that are relevant.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, also say a few words about means testing as this is another area which was mentioned as one where difficulties can arise.  The means test is a mechanism for channelling scarce resources to those in need; those with nothing receive the maximum rate of payment and those whose circumstances are better need, and receive, less assistance. The net result of the means tests is, generally, to enable payments to be made according to need.  Thus, the payment a social assistance beneficiary receives and his means, if any, from other sources, when added together, will give a standard of living on a par with that of other beneficiaries whose family circumstances for example, family size are similar.</P>
    <P>Before a decision is taken on individual cases involving means, a social welfare officer interviews the person for the purpose of determining entitlement to, and the appropriate weekly rate of, the social assistance payment.  The officer obtains information on all items which, under the statutory provisions relating to a particular scheme, must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The principal items which constitute means under the various social assistance schemes are, cash income, net income from farming in the case of farmers, value of other property, investments and capital. The value of a claimant's home is not included in the assessment.  In the case of <Col N="1801" /> certain schemes for example, unemployment assistance, single women's allowance, rent allowance, the value of any benefit or privilege, such as board and lodging, is also taken into account as means.</P>
    <P>Based on the information reported by the social welfare officer and any other relevant information the deciding officer decides on the person's entitlement in accordance with the legislation.  If a person's claim is rejected he or she is informed of the basis of the decision.</P>
    <P>The actual form of notification of deciding officers' decisions, particularly where these decisions are unfavourable, is obviously of crucial importance and Senator Ryan in his Bill proposes that certain requirements be set out in legislation in this area.  Perhaps I should outline briefly, therefore, what happens at present in the generality of cases.  When a decision is made on a person's claim the person is notified by way of a standard letter.  There are different types of letters issued for different decisions, for example, where a person is awarded a full payment, reduced payment, or where a person's claim is rejected or where the person's existing payment is reduced or increased.  These letters give the broad reason including the statutory provision on which the decision is based.  For example, where a person is refused benefit the decision will normally list all of the qualifying conditions and those conditions which are not satisfied are indicated.</P>
    <P>Where a person is refused benefit or receives a reduced payment, he is notified of his/her right to appeal the decision. This notification is highlighted on the form and the person is told that if he/she is not satisfied with the decision they may appeal against it by writing to the Department within 21 days.  In cases where means assessment are involved the amount of means assessed is notified.  In those cases where means are derived from a land and where the income and expenditure must be itemised, it is now normal practice for the person to be given a copy of the actual report of the social welfare officer which details how all <Col N="1802" /> income and expenses of the holding are determined.  This procedure has meant extra work for social welfare officers and deciding officers and has, undoubtedly, meant that they must be very particular in making their assessments.  Nevertheless, it has clearly helped to remove much of the mystery which surrounded means assessments in the past and is an area where the benefits outweigh the costs.</P>
    <P>The whole area of notification to the public by the Department is an area where procedures are constantly being reviewed and revised and I fully accept that it is an area where further improvements are needed.  My Department are conscious of the need to improve communications with members of the public.</P>
    <P>When a person appeals a decision the deciding officer may, at that stage, reinvestigate the claim if any new relevant facts or evidence come to light, for example, where a claimant for a contributory pension is refused pension because of insufficient contributions and appeals on the grounds that he feels that he has the appropriate contributions, the deciding officer can reinvestigate the claim, because of the new information, to try and determine if there were further contributions.  Only if the matter was still in dispute following this investigation would the appeal be forwarded to the chief appeals officer.  The deciding officer sends with it a statement showing to what extent the facts and contentions put forward by the appellant are admitted or disputed.  All documentary evidence furnished by the appellant is also forwarded to the chief appeals officer, who will normally refer the case to an appeals officer.</P>
    <P>The decision-making system has been in operation for many years and it has, I believe, served us well.  There is, of course, always room for improvement in our systems, be they clerical or computer, in our dealings with members of the public and, indeed, in the manner in which information and the extent of the information is conveyed to the public. A number of improvements have been made over the years and I have touched on some of these earlier.  It is an area that <Col N="1803" /> is constantly being reviewed and revised. Procedures are already in place in most of the areas highlighted by Senator Ryan in his Bill in relation to the decision-making process.  Persons are notified promptly as soon as decisions on their claims are made.  They are notified of their right to appeal if dissatisfied with the decision and there is an information leaflet which sets out in reasonable detail the whole appeals process, including I might add, the fact that the person may be accompanied at the appeal hearing by another person.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the procedures proposed in the Bill in relation to the decision-making process would not over-complicate and be a cause of delay.  As I said at the outset, a balance must be struck between maintaining efficiency and effectiveness in the administration process and ensuring that people are treated in a fair and equitable manner.  I realise there is room for improvement and I am satisfied that the reviews and the modernisation of systems that are taking place in my Department will help make the process more efficient while at the same time ensuring that people continue to be treated in a fair and humane way.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the appeals system itself and begin by giving a brief outline of the existing system.  Existing legislation provides for the appointment of appeals officers from officers of the Department to decide appeals against the decisions of deciding officers.  Appeals officers are of a senior grade and would normally have served for many years in the Department.  Normally in the course of their career they would have had direct experience of administering social welfare schemes and they are selected with the aim of ensuring that they have extensive and detailed knowledge of the system.  I am pleased that in the criticisms which Senators have made of the appeals system in this debate, they have been very careful to place on record that these criticisms in no way reflect on the calibre of individual appeals officers.</P>
    <P>On average each year about 18,000 <Col N="1804" /> appeals are decided.  Well over half of these not surprisingly involve entitlement to unemployment payments.  An appeals officer has power to decide cases summarily and in recent years up to 60 per cent of cases have been determined in this way.  The balance are heard orally and appeals officers have wide powers to summon papers and persons, to take evidence on oath and to award costs and expenses.  Their decisions are final and conclusive unless appealed to the High Court on questions of law.  An appeals officer may revise an appeals decision in the light of new facts or evidence and the chief appeals officer may revise an appeals officer's decision if there is a mistake of law or facts.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to refer to the important role of the chief appeals officer in the whole appeals system.  The person appointed is usually a senior principal officer in my Department and as chief appeals officer is responsible for the distribution and prompt consideration of appeals.  By virtue of the fact that he is empowered to revise decisions if there is a mistake of law or of fact, he also contributes to ensuring that the decisions arrived at are fair and consistent.</P>
    <P>Appeals hearings are kept as informal as possible.  Appeals officers endeavour to create an atmosphere that will not inhibit or intimidate the appellant but will enable him or her to provide all the information in relation to the case that the appeals officer needs to know to enable a correct decision to be arrived at. Appellants may be accompanied by a member of the family or by a solicitor or, with the consent of the appeals officer, by any other person.  In practice appeals officers allow any bona fide person to accompany appellants that they require to speak on their behalf and who is genuinely interested in the case.</P>
    <P>When appeals relating to unemployment benefit and assistance are being heard, other than cases involving questions relating to contribution conditions or means tests, assessors representing employer and employee interests are asked to sit with the appeals officer. Panels of assessors are appointed in the <Col N="1805" /> centres throughout the country where oral hearings are held.  Their function is to assist the appeals officer through their experience and local knowledge in arriving at decisions.  In appeals where medical assessment is a determining factor independent medical assessors are appointed where necessary.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the whole appeals process, of course, is decisions on individual claims and a good appeals system will above all produce decisions which are fair to the individual appellants and fair &mdash; I must say this &mdash; to the taxpayer in being in accordance with the legislation under which the various benefits are provided. Senator Brendan Ryan quoted certain figures in relation to the rate of reversal of decisions on appeals &mdash; 39 per cent on unemployment benefit, 46 per cent on unemployment assistance and 23 per cent on disability benefit and he quoted Professor Robert Clark in his article in <i>The Irish Jurist</i>, to the effect that reversal rates of this sort</P>
    <P>... indicate that the quality of first instance decision making is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that we can draw conclusions of this kind from the figures quoted.  The Commission on Social Welfare put their own interpretation on the figures and, perhaps, I can quote what the commission said in this regard:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The level of reversal of the deciding officer's decision is relatively high, ranging from one-third to almost half. The complexity of the conditions governing eligibility for the deserted wife's scheme may account for the high proportion of appeals upheld for those schemes.  There is a general difficulty in interpreting these figures.  They may not indicate that the original decision was wrong but that new information subsequently came to light.  They would also appear to indicate that the appeals officers' decisions are, in fact, made on an independent and impartial basis.  Furthermore, there is a consistent approach at the first tier of decision making as evidenced by the <Col N="1806" /> fact that a relatively small number of claimants appeal the decisions in their case.  In 1985 for example there were approximately 1.2 million claims for all schemes while the number of appeals in that year was 17, 228, representing 1.4 of the total.</P>
    <P>I think that this is a very good and balanced analysis of what happens and it sets the figures in their proper context, that is in the context of the whole social welfare decision-making process.</P>
    <P>A number of criticisms of the appeals system have been made in this debate, many of which were also made to the Commission on Social Welfare.  The criticisms can be divided into two broad categories &mdash; those which concern the existing procedures and whether they offend against principles of justice such as openness, fairness and impartiality and, secondly, those which are concerned with the independence of the system and, in particular, the perception that its ties with the Department undermine that independence.</P>
    <P>One of the more significant criticisms levelled at the appeals procedures concerns the fact that there is no right to an oral hearing.  There have been suggestions that if cases are decided summarily that this, in some way, denies or reduces a person's rights.  I do not accept this point.  Appeals are only decided summarily if they involve straighforward questions of fact.  Senator Brendan Ryan in his speech stated that it emerged from the Commission on Social Welfare report 1986 that up to 60 per cent of appeals are dismissed summarily.</P>
    <P>In fact, the report did not state that they were dismissed summarily and the exact reference in that report is that</P>
    <P>The Appeals Officer has power to decide the case summarily, if he feels that it can be properly determined without an oral hearing, and about 60 per cent are determined in this way.</P>
    <P>Determining a case summarily does not automatically result in it being dismissed and, although no exact figures are available for these cases, it is estimated that <Col N="1807" /> in about a third the original decisions are in fact reversed, mainly as a result of new information provided by the appellant to the appeals officer.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter Senator Brendan Ryan also considered that it was worth quoting the following from the Department's own leaflet on the appeals system:</P>
    <P>If any Appeals Officer feels an oral hearing is necessary, a place and date are set as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It would have been more helpful, however, if he had also quoted the paragraph immediately preceding that sentence which would have put it in context and clearly explained why oral hearings are not held in certain cases.  The paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>If the Appeals Officer considers that he has enough information to decide an appeal, he will make his decision without an oral hearing.  For example, if the claimant does not have enough contributions to qualify for payment, or if he/she does not satisfy a means test, an oral hearing may not be necessary. Otherwise the Appeals Officer will arrange to hold an oral hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>This clearly illustrates what the actual position is &mdash; that appeals are only dealt with summarily when they involve straightforward questions of fact relating, for example, to means tests and contribution conditions.  Appeals officers when they receive an appeal, if the information to hand is insufficient, do seek whatever additional information is required.  In the case of means tests which form the vast bulk of these cases, they will, if necessary, ask a social welfare officer to reinvestigate the appellant's means.  If an appeals officer remains unclear as to the factual position, or if there is a conflict of evidence, or if it is felt that the appellant would benefit from explaining the factual position orally, an appeals hearing will be arranged. However, where this is not the case and where an appeals officer is satisfied that <Col N="1808" /> he has obtained all the information required to arrive at a decision, holding an oral hearing would serve no purpose and would be a waste of time and resources.  Moreover, in cases where the original decision would clearly be upheld on the basis of the facts of the case, it would hold out unrealistic hopes to the appellant.</P>
    <P>It is the experience of my Department over the years that many persons who are disappointed with the decisions on their claims and appeal those decisions do not clearly distinguish between the actual provisions of the law on which the decision is based and its application. People may in fact feel that by appealing a decision they may succeed in having the decision is based and its appealing rules bent or set aside because of what they consider are the special circumstances of their case.  Giving appellants an automatic right to an oral hearing in cases where the factual position regarding their claim is clear to the appeals officer and no further clarification of that position can be gained from such a hearing could merely serve to mislead appellants into considering that despite the factual position there might be some possibility of having the decision reversed.</P>
    <P>I agree, however, that if the factual position was explained in more detail both when the claimant is notified of the original decision and if he or she appeals when the outcome of the appeal is notified that this could lessen the dissatisfaction there is with my Department's decision-making and appeals procedures.  As I have stated earlier, significant improvements in this regard have already been made and improvements will continue to be made in this area as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Another series of criticisms of the appeals system concerns the actual conduct of appeals hearings and in particular the fact that very few applicants are legally represented.  Applicants, of course, have the right to be legally represented at appeals and the appeals officer is empowered to award a fee to lawyers or other professional persons appearing on behalf of appellants.  However, in the vast <Col N="1809" /> majority of appeals, no significant legal expertise is required to determine what is at issue and I consider that this explains to a great extent why very few appellants are legally represented.  This also raises questions about the British study referred to by Senator Ryan and whether in the study they were comparing like with like. In any case, as the Commission on Social Welfare found, the reversal rates under the Irish appeals system range from one-third to almost one-half, roughly the same proportion as for those referred to in the British study in which there was legal representation.  As the majority of appellants are not legally represented in Ireland one could conclude that it is highly questionable whether legal representation in most appeals cases is as necessary as claimed.  In fact, the experience of my Department is that lawyers may not, in fact, be the persons most conversant with social welfare legislation and that other persons involved in cases, such as social workers, trade union officals and public representatives, all of whom may attend hearings, can be as helpful or more helpful in enabling appeals officers to arrive at their decisions.</P>
    <P>It is very important also in this regard that the nature and purpose of the social welfare appeals system is not lost sight of. One of the main purposes of the system is to enable decisions to be arrived at quickly and informally.  This is the main justification for any administrative tribunal and why they operate in well defined areas separate from the normal court system.  The Franks Committee already referred to in this debate listed in their report the characteristics which give administrative tribunals advantages over the courts and these are cheapness, accessibility, freedom from technicality, speed and expert knowledge of their particular subject.  The social welfare appeals system has all these characteristics and any measures that would call for significantly greater involvement of the legal profession in the appeals system resulting in appeals hearings more and more resembling court hearings could well run counter to some of the main <Col N="1810" /> purposes for which the appeals system exists.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the role of assessors and there appears to be confusion between the roles of medical assessors and that of assessors who attend hearings on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance appeals. Senator Ryan queried whether assessors, in fact, fulfilled any useful purpose at all.  Senator Ryan mentioned a particular court judgment which related specifically to the role of medical assessors and which stated that medical assessors are not supposed to take an active part in proceedings but are intended to be available merely for consultation on technical medical matters.  The role of assessors on unemployment benefit and assistance appeals which was the case referred to by Senator Ryan, is somewhat wider in that they can express views on a wider range of issues affecting the claim.</P>
    <P>The assessor's knowledge about the availability of employment and conditions of employment in the locality is of particular assistance to the appeals officer in arriving at a decision.  Having heard the views of the assessor or assessors and, if necessary, discussed such views the appeals officer makes the decision in the case.  In virtually all cases the appeals officer makes a decision on the spot in the presence of the assessors. Very occasionally an appeals officer may inform the assessors that he wishes to defer the making of his decision so as to give further consideration to the case, including any opinion that may have been expressed by an assessor.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in practice an assessor at an appeals hearing involving unemployment benefit or assistance does play an important role.  The final decision on the appeal, of course, rests with the appeals officer.  It has been the experience of my Department over the years that the dissatisfaction of some assessors with their role stems from the fact that they do not clearly accept that their role is not that of an advocate for the appellant but rather that of assisting the appeals officer, from a neutral standpoint, in arriving at a decision as to whether the <Col N="1811" /> appellant meets the statutory requirements for entitlement to the benefit or assistance sought.  Accordingly, they may be dissatisfied when the decision arrived at by the appeals officer is not the one they had hoped for but this, of course, would not mean that the decision was incorrect.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to criticisms regarding the independence of appeals officers under the present system.  The powers and responsibilities of appeals officers are laid down in the Social Welfare Acts and their independence is, therefore, guaranteed.  They make their decisions in accordance with the facts and the legislation independently of any other person and the only constraints are decisions made by the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The appeals officer's independence was stated explicitly in the Supreme Court judgment in 1958 in the McLoughlin case to which I referred earlier, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That duty is laid upon him by the Oireachtas and he is required to perform it as between parties freely and fairly as becomes anyone who is called upon to decide on matters of right and obligation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appeals officers make their decisions independently and I find it difficult to accept the inference that being civil servants of the Department makes them somehow less fit for the role of deciding entitlements, or makes them biased towards disallowing appeals. Despite the fact that Senators in this debate have been careful to state that they have no reason to criticise individual appeals officers, it is still proposed in the Bill to expressly exclude civil servants or former civil servants from being chairman of the appeals tribunals it is proposed to set up.  This proposal calls into question the fairness and impartiality of civil servants and as such I could not go along with it.  I have no grounds for questioning the fitness of civil servants to conduct appeals and I consider that no solid evidence has been advanced in this <Col N="1812" /> regard.  It has been said that as Department officials it might be expected that they would be more likely to take the Department's line in relation to appeals. I am not sure what is meant by the Department's line in this case.  The Department exist to ensure that claimants receive the benefits to which they are entitled just as much as to ensure that those who do not qualify do not receive them.  No pressure is placed on appeals officers by the Department to arrive at particular decisions one way or another. On the contrary, the only pressure that is exerted in this regard is from outside the Department through efforts to have adverse decisions reversed on behalf of people who, understandably, want to have their appeals allowed and benefit paid.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the Commission on Social Welfare in their report was that the decisions of appeals officers are made on an independent and impartial basis. This conclusion does not surprise me.  It should be clear to any impartial observer that the nature of the system is such that appeals officers have no personal interest, enticement or inclination to come to a particular decision and their only concern in each case is to make a correct decision fairly and equitably on the basis of the evidence before him or her.</P>
    <P>I consider, therefore, that the present appeals system which has been in operation for over 30 years has, all things considered, performed well.  I quite accept that there may be a problem in relation to the perception of the system and that we need to improve this perception. I am also concerned at improving the efficiency of the system in operational terms, improving the level of information given and communication with clients and eliminating the delays which, unfortunately, have become a feature of the system.</P>
    <P>I would at this stage like to comment on the appeals system under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which it is also proposed in the Bill to have replaced by the appeals system for social welfare schemes generally.  A <Col N="1813" /> person claiming supplementary welfare makes the claim directly in person to the community welfare officer of the health board and can fully explain his or her circumstances in support of the claim. Appeals officers have been appointed by me to deal specifically with appeals against the decisions on those claims.  The person usually appointed would be the programme manager of the individual health board with responsibility for the administration of the scheme in that health board area.  Such appeals officers are in a good position to decide these appeals having obtained the information on the claimant's circumstances supplied by him or her to the Community Welfare Officer and by having direct knowledge through the course of his/her work of the area where the claliant lives and of the administration of the supplementary welfare scheme in the health board area where the claim is made.</P>
    <P>A number of criticisms of this appeals system were made to the Commission on Social Welfare.  These were mainly that it lacks a defined procedure and that there appears to be a considerable degree of divergence between the approaches adopted in different health boards.  The commission has recommended that responsibility for the entire administration of the supplementary welfare scheme should be transferred from the health boards to my Department and obviously if this were done it would mean that the appeals under this scheme would be included in the arrangements for appeals generally.  This wider question of the administration of the scheme is under active consideration in the context of the examination of the commission's report generally and the question of the appeals system is being considered in this context. I am satisfied from my own information that appeals officers of the health boards operate in a fair manner in deciding appeals but obviously if we are talking about the perception of appeals officers as being independent there is a greater problem in this area in that in most cases the appeals officer is also the person responsible for the administration of the <Col N="1814" /> scheme.  I fully accept the need to review the existing arrangements from this point of view.</P>
    <P>I hope it is clear from what I have said that I fully accept the need for improvements to the present appeals system.  I am not convinced, however, that the way to achieve the improvements we need would be to set up the sort of structure proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the proposals in the Bill, of course, is the establishment of appeals tribunals with a chairman and two ordinary members each having equal voting rights.  I agree that the employment appeals tribunals and the social welfare appeals tribunals on which the proposal is based are operating satisfactorily. But the areas in which they operate, concerning employer/employee relations in the case of the employment appeals tribunals and the nature of an industrial dispute in the case of the social welfare appeals tribunals require a system involving an employer representative and a trade union representative with an independent chairman.  Such a system is not necessary in relation to social welfare appeals as there is not an employer's dimension to the cases at issue or a trade union dimension. What is at issue, normally, is whether the appellant satisfies the statutory requirements for entitlement to the benefit claimed.  A system of three person tribunals, therefore, would appear to be unnecessarily cumbersome for social welfare appeals in general and could greatly slow up the whole process.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare in their report stated:</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the service being provided by the social welfare system, it is important that the appeals system be simple, informal and speedy.</P>
    <P>The present appeals system has these characteristics.  Under this system 18,000 appeals per year on average are being decided by 13 appeals officers.  In contrast 9,000 appeals approximately were decided in 1985 by the employment appeals tribunals which currently employ one chairman, 13 vice-chairmen and two <Col N="1815" /> panels comprising 20 members each.  This indicates that a major increase in staff resources would be required if a system based on three-person tribunals were to be established for social welfare appeals especially as it would take such tribunals longer to decide appeals than a single appeals officer.  In addition the whole process would be further complicated if there had to be an oral hearing in the case of every appeal as envisaged in the Bill.  As stated earlier this only occurs in 40 per cent of cases on average at present which means that appeals officers have more time to devote to oral hearings for the cases where these are required.  I agree that cost should not be a decisive factor in the establishment of a fair and impartial appeals system but it still has to be taken into account in considering whether a particular system is necessary to achieve fairness and impartiality.  I am very doubtful that the extra cost involved for the very questionable advantages, if any, of the proposed system over the existing well tried system would be justified.</P>
    <P>It is important that the existing appeals system be developed and undoubtedly some changes, organisational and procedural, need to be made.  The present appeals system can be improved and a review of the system is currently under way in my Department in the context of a general reorganisation of the Department following the publication of the Government's White Paper on Public Service reform.  Senators will be aware that a separate executive office, the Social Welfare Services Office, has been set up which is responsible for the payment of benefits and that responsibility for policy matters remains with the Department.  This reorganisation has been done on a non-statutory basis pending the enactment of the appropriate legislation which is currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>It is in this context and in the context of the recommendation made by the Commission on Social Welfare that the review of the appeals system is taking place.  I expect to be in a position to put <Col N="1816" /> proposals to Government on the matter and Senators can be assured that the legitimate concerns in relation to the appeals system expressed in this debate and in the commission's report are being taken into account, in particular, the questions concerning the perceived independence of the appeals system from the Department and the provision of more detailed information on the reasons why claims and subsequent appeals have been rejected.  The question as to whether a separate report on appeals should be published annually including, where appropriate, policy recommendations on the lines of the Ombudsman's report would also arise for consideration in the context of this review.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the beginning of my speech I welcome this debate on the social welfare appeals system, particularly, as it is so timely in view of the review of the system currently under way in my Department.  For the reasons I have outlined I have reservations on the main proposals in the Bill for the establishment of appeals tribunals.  I will be bringing forward proposals for the reform of the appeals system in the context of the reorganisation which is now taking place in my Department and I would urge the House to await these proposals which will be designed to meet many of the concerns expressed on the matter by the contributions to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which has afforded us an opportunity of enabling the Minister to give us a very elucidating reply.  She has in her contribution given us a fair, balanced and comprehensive appraisal of the entire social welfare system, something which I have found very enlightening.  I want to take up the cudgels on the Minister's behalf.  Allegations in relation to lack of courage or reluctance on the Minister's behalf to come into this House, are most unfair, based on the Minister's previous record as Minister for Education when she had to take indelicate, difficult and at times very trenchant measures in relation to certain issues and when time and time again in the media, in the <Col N="1817" /> other House and in this House she came forward, validated, vindicated and defended them to the maximum.  My only regret is that the Minister will not unfortunately have sufficient time in the Department of Social Welfare to bring about the restructuring, reorganisation and reforms to which she has committed herself in this House today.  She has outlined the whole warren and complexities of the schemes that exist within the Department of Social Welfare, 30 schemes in all.  She has set in very stark perspective the difficulties and the vast array of complexities, decisions, appeals and so on that have to be made.  She pointed out that in annual terms we are talking about 1.2 million claims, 24,000 per week, and 15,000 appeals.  In arriving at decisions there will, at times, be miscalculations and misjudgements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, the citizens have been fairly well looked after by the social welfare system.  The people who administer the scheme have been humane in their application of it and whatever alleged misdemeanours have come about, have arisen not from any deliberate misapplication of the guidelines or the rules or regulations but by pressure of time by other demands and by the sheer pressure and burden of work.  Nevertheless, a number of us who come from rural areas have had time and again to draw to the Minister's attention and to the attention of officers in her Department the hardship that has been caused particularly in relation to areas affecting us in rural Ireland and that is the area of unemployment assistance &mdash; small farmers dole and the area of prescribed relatives' allowance.  I have been dealing, with other public representatives from the west, on an intimate level with constituents and applicants for small farmers dole and there have been a number of alleviating measures that have gone a great way towards redressing what people would regard as their legitimate grouses in relation to cutting back in this area.  I welcome in particular the introduction of the UB 35 oral appeal form and also the allowance in respect of expenses for cars, and for other expenses <Col N="1818" /> that up to now were not taken into consideration. Nevertheless, a new dimension has been introduced that is the whole area of prescribed relatives' allowance. One of the qualifications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's response to Senator Eoin Ryan's amendment even when he was technically out of order having overrun the alloted time.  There are a number of points on which I would like to have a further opportunity to clarify.  I am in favour of the principle of an amendment of this kind.  I am not entirely sure that I go along with the precise wording of this amendment, partly for some of the reasons the Minister has identified, but there are a number of important issues that arise in relation to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first one is to explain why, as I am assuming, it is drafted in terms of applying only to a citizen of Ireland, in other words, that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement would only apply to a citizen of Ireland.  Senator Dooge criticised this approach and said we should not be discriminatory in that way, that if we believed in it in principle we should do it for everyone.  Unfortunately, that is not open to us under the European Convention on Extradition of 1957.  Article 6 of that convention allows a country to refuse to extradite its own citizens and to make any other provisions relating to its own citizens.  If we are going to have any <i>prima facie</i> requirement, unless we were to denounce the European Convention on Extradition, something I would not be advocating, we could only do it in the context of our own citizens.  There is some justification for that.  We are <Col N="1820" /> entitled to be that little bit more concerned about our own citizens, if we are requested to send them to another country for trial, than about other persons who may be only very temporary visitors to the country or who may have resided here for longer.  We apply a different law to aliens generally and it is not that exceptional that we would apply it in the area of extradition.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that this <i>prima facie</i> rule would apply, as it is drafted in the Bill, to all requests for extradition for any offences.  Therefore it would be introduced right across the board.  That would be a substantial change in our existing law.  I would be satisfied to confine it to the area we are talking about, where we receive a request in the particularly sensitive context of the type of offence for which formerly under international law a claim might have been made that the offence was either a political offence or connected with a political offence and the request for extradition could have been denied on that ground. In moving away from that, there is a reason to seriously examine the possibility of requiring some degree of &mdash; I do not know how to put the word so as to fit in with countries which do not have a concept of a <i>prima facie</i> case as common law countries would &mdash; preliminary factual evidence to substantiate the charge or charges which are preferred against the person whose extradition is sought.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his response to Senator Eoin Ryan made a point he made on Second Stage also.  The Minister said that to seek to introduce a <i>prima facie</i> rule or preliminary evidence rule of some kind or some basic requirement that some factual evidence be put forward is moving against the tide and is going against the approach adopted by other European countries. There are two responses to meet that objection of the Minister.  First, Senator Eoin Ryan is correct in pointing out that a significant number of countries simply apply a much broader reserve.  They refuse to extradite their own citizens.  If we were to do that, it could be said that we were not seriously interested in extradition. That would be a kind of political <Col N="1821" /> dishonesty because of the way in which we have defined Irish citizenship and in the context of the Border and so on.  I would not advocate that we adopt that approach.</P>
    <P>There are countries that share quite a similar heritage and approach to ours, for example, the United States of America where a <i>prima facie</i> evidence rule in relation to extradition is required. Indeed, in the recent extradition treaty between Ireland and the United States the Americans required a <i>prima facie</i> rule.  The Minister is shaking his head so let me put it this way.  I am interested in having clarification on the record of this House as to whether I am correct in understanding that the United States requires, before it will extradite, that there be some establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case against a person from the requesting country and that this would, under principles in international law, provide for the invocation of a reciprocal requirement if a country so wishes in agreements with the United States.  That is my understanding of the position and I would welcome clarification from the Minister if that is so.</P>
    <P>We do not need to be concerned about the difficulties and the practicalities. They are problems to be overcome but that is a question of the draftsman wording the particular requirement in such a way as to make it one that can apply either to another common law country or to countries which have an inquisitorial system and have a different way of establishing the basic case before they proceed further to a trial.  The formulation does not concern me so much if we are agreed on the principle, but we should discuss in some detail why the principle is important. The reason the principle of having that requirement is important in the context of this Bill is that we are talking about a charge being preferred, in other words, an accusation being made that somebody was guilty of one of the very serious offences listed in section 3 (3) (a) of this Bill.  We are saying that where a request is made for the extradition of one of those persons by a party that has ratified the convention, the person whose <Col N="1822" /> extradition is requested cannot claim that what was done was done in connection with a political offence.  They cannot resist the extradition.  Ireland does not, under present law, require to be satisfied that there is the <i>prima facie</i> factual basis for proceeding with the particular trial and proceeding either to a conviction or acquittal on the basis of evidence already available.</P>
    <P>That is a very big commitment in trust and a very big step to take.  I am aware that it is an approach which we have adopted in our extradition law.  We have adopted the approach basically favoured under the earlier convention, the Convention on Extradition in 1957.  We have not applied a <i>prima facie</i> rule in relation to extradition, but we have had, as part or our extradition law, the reserve that a person could not be extradited for a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  It is in the context of moving away from that that I am certainly still worried about doing so with no reserve on our part that we want to examine the bones of the case against the person who is to be extradited under the provisions of this Bill.  I am still at the stage of looking for clarification on the point.</P>
    <P>The Minister would certainly be helpful if he would perhaps set out, in so far as he is aware of them for the benefit of Members of the House, the countries that in their extradition laws apply some variation of the <i>prima facie</i> rule, whether they be member states of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism or whether they be countries like the United States who are outside the Council of Europe framework.  It would be helpful to know their approach in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson argues that we could require a <i>prima facie</i> case to be presented in relation only to Irish citizens.  The Senator has taken my point that to go further than that and simply to refuse to extradite citizens would amount to our saying that we would not extradite. That applies also to the kind of proposal she is suggesting &mdash; to require a <i>prima facie</i> case only in relation to our citizens <Col N="1823" />&mdash; because that means in practice that we would require a <i>prima facie</i> case in relation to extradition in a very few cases. That would not be compatible with the provisions of the European Convention on Extradition.  Article 6 of the convention deals with the extradition of nationals and provides that a contracting party shall have the right to refuse extradition of its nationals, but where that contracting party invokes that right, Article 6, paragraph 2, applies.  It says:</P>
      <P>If the requested Party does not extradite its nationals, it shall at the request of the requesting Party submit the case to its competent authorities in order that proceedings may be taken if they are considered appropriate.  For this purpose, the files, information and exhibits relating to the offence shall be transmitted without charge by the means provided for in Article 12, paragraph 1.  The requesting Party shall be informed of the result at its request.</P>
      <P>That requires that the requested party would submit the case to its own jurisdiction, in order that proceedings may be taken if they are considered appropriate, which puts the whole matter in rather a different context from that of extradition. It puts it in a very different context from that which is the main basis of the convention itself which is the proposition &mdash; one which I support &mdash; that the best place to prosecute an offence is the place in which the offence is alleged to have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 12 of the convention sets out the requirements in relation to the request and supporting documents.  It would be tedious to read it out but it is specific as to what kinds of supporting documents must be sent forward.  Leaving aside the question of people who have already been convicted, it requires a statement of the offences for which extradition is requested, the time and place of their commission, their legal descriptions and a reference to the relevant legal provisions. It requires the provision of a copy of the relevant enactment or, where that <Col N="1824" /> is not possible, a statement of the relevant law and as accurate a description as possible of the person claimed, together with any other information which would help to establish his identity and nationality. That is what is required by the Convention on Extradition.</P>
    <P>A <i>prima facie</i> requirement in relation to citizens of the requested State would not fit in that framework.  In order to have provided for that we would have had to enter a reservation at the time we signed the convention.  At the time we passed the 1965 Extradition Act we would have had to enter a reservation providing for a <i>prima facie</i> requirement. We chose, deliberately, not to do that at that time for reasons which were judged to be adequate at the time and which, in my view are still adequate.  It has been suggested to me that perhaps a way around this problem would be to denounce the Convention on Extradition.  Technically speaking, this would be a way of bringing about the result that Senator Robinson wants.  We would denounce the Convention on Extradition, provide in our law for a <i>prima facie</i> requirement for the extradition of an Irish citizen and re-enter the framework of the Convention on Estradition with the necessary reservation. Even setting out those steps indicates how cynical that would seem to other countries who are parties to the convention.  To require a <i>prima facie</i> case to be made out in our courts where a request was made for the extradition of an Irish citizen would not be compatible with the 1957 Convention on Extradition.</P>
    <P>We are not moving away, as Senator Robinson seems to suggest, from a situation where we have in our law the provision that a person may not be extradited for a political offence.  Once this Bill is enacted it will still be the case that persons whose extradition is sought can claim that the offence for which they were sought is a political offence.  The circumstances in which that plea will be agreed will be more restricted after the passage of this Bill than they are at the moment.  The principle of the political defence still remains part of our law and we are still at liberty to retain it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> I would like to quote from the United Kingdom White Paper on Criminal Justice Command Document 9658 of March 1986 to which I referred last night where an examination of the issue is made.  This was the basis for the proposals now before the United Kingdom Parliament. An examination is made of the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Paragraph 50 states:</P>
    <P>The question whether the <i>prima facie</i> requirement should be discarded was discussed in paragraphs 21 to 213 of the Green Paper.  Having considered carefully the responses of these questions the Government believes that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement should be abolished.  The requirement does not offer a necessary safeguard for the person sought by the requesting state. It does, however, present a formidable impediment to entirely proper and legitimate extradition requests.  There are other effective ways in which the rights of the fugitive are protected, for example, by the double criminality rule and by the proper application of the political safeguard.</P>
    <P>There is more in an earlier Green Paper in the same direction.  I might add that that White Paper was the outcome of a process that began with the Green Paper, included wide consultations and then was a matter of some considerable and careful reflection.  As I said last night, that examination had the virtue of having been carried out in a jurisdiction which had the experience of operating a <i>prima facie</i> requirement and where it was possible to observe the effect of that requirement on its relationships with other countries.  The conclusion has been that a <i>prima facie</i> requirement did not secure the protection that it is claimed to secure and, in fact, it presented a very substantial obstacle to proper and legitimate requests for extradition.  We are talking only about a situation in which under the system set out in the convention the courts in the requested country have only one function, the function of deciding on the question of extraditability.  The have <Col N="1826" /> no function in deciding guilt or innocence; that is for the courts in the requesting country.  The only function of the court in the requested country is to decide on the question of extraditability.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson suggested that we might confine the application of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement to certain cases.  I do not think that would be appropriate. Leaving aside all the other arguments, I cannot see that that would be particularly appropriate.  What we are setting out to do in this Bill, and Senator Robinson agrees with this part of it, is to say that some types of offences may not ever be considered to be political offences.  If we are then to say that for some other kind of offences we will have a <i>prima facie</i> requirement we would certainly be running the risk of prejudging the issue of whether or not the person was guilty of the offence in deciding in the courts here on the simple question of extraditability. It might be thought that the fact that the courts here decided that a case was extraditable was in itself further evidence for the court in the requesting country to take into account when deciding on the question of guilt or innocence.  There would be a danger there that one might prejudice a case at the outset.  I do not think that that would be particularly wise either.</P>
    <P>In the case of our extradition treaty with the United States, the US requirement is not for a <i>prima facie</i> case although it has been argued that because the Americans are more up to date in their use of English they do not use arcane phrases like &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; in another language but they say what they mean in the English language or more accurately, in the American language.  In the case of a request emanating from Ireland, the requirement is that the request be supported by a statement of facts by way of affidavit or statutory declaration setting forth reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed and that the person sought committed it.  That is something less than what we commonly understand by the term &ldquo;a <i>prima facie</i> requirement&rdquo;.  It is, of course, something more than is required in the terms of <Col N="1827" /> our 1965 Extradition Act.  We could have decided in the case of that particular treaty that we would have the same kind of provision in respect of a request for extradition from the United States, but we decided not to make that requirement if the United States requested extradition from us.  It is a matter of deliberate policy.  We decided not to have that.  It is a requirement that we do not have in our relations with any other country.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the trend in countries which up to now have had a <i>prima facie</i> requirement and particularly in common law countries that had a <i>prima facia</i> requirement up to now is to move away from it.  As I said, the UK Parliament now has before it legislation which would abolish the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Australia has abandoned the <i>prima facie</i> requirement in recent years because of the difficulties it presented.  For us to come along now and to introduce a measure which would not be compatible with the 1957 Convention on Extradition, which is gradually being abandoned by other jurisdictions which have it, would not be compatible with the basic objective that we seek to achieve with other countries in the Council of Europe, particularly with the UK, of widening and deepening international co-operation in combating terrorism.</P>

      <P>We have heard a long reply from the Minister but I do not think he said anything that would give us reason to ask that this amendment should not be put through.  If he reads the amendment he will find no mention of <i>prima facie</i> in it at all.  What is in the amendment is a request that Irish citizens be protected when their extradition is sought by another country, that they would have the same protection as they would have if they were being charged with an offence here.  Subsection (2) provides that &ldquo;No order for the extradition of an Irish citizen shall be made unless the District Court is satisfied, on the evidence before it, that there is a sufficient case which would warrant the sending forward for <Col N="1828" /> trial of that person as if the offence alleged were an indictable offence and had been committed within the State.&rdquo;  I cannot see why a deliberate decision was made not to have that type of provision put into this Bill when, as the Minister said, it has been put in in relation to the extradition treaty signed between us and America.</P>

What is required by this amendment is that Irish citizens will have the same protection as they would have if they were charged with a crime here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's response not very convincing on a number of the issues which arise on this amendment.  He cites the United Kingdom's White Paper and their approach on the subject.  As I understand it, the United Kingdom has applied a <i>prima facie</i> rule across the board.  It is not a signatory to the European Convention on Extradition, so there they are changing from a very different situation that we are not involved in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they find that that approach is one that they are having certain difficulties with and, yes, because they want to ratify the Convention on Extradition.  We have ratified the European Convention on Extradition, 1957. We do not apply it across the board. What we are examining is whether we want to have some restriction in the sense of some way of assessing whether it would be appropriate to accede to a request for the extradition of an Irish citizen.  The Minister cited the American restriction <Col N="1829" /> and made it clear that it is not a <i>prima facie</i> rule.  I accept that.  It seemed to me to be a very useful formulation, one that I might well feel would be better to introduce here than the detailed terms of the amendment because I can see practical problems in relation to the details of the amendment.  I have made that clear already.</P>
      <P>There is merit, as the United States finds, in having some way of assessing the grounds on which it is sought to extradite a citizen to another country.  It may either be based on a charge of a particular offence or on a conviction.  It requires a very serious assessment of the basis of the charge and the basis of the conviction, if it is a conviction.  It also requires that the country be satisfied, as I presume we are deemed to be, as to the administration of justice in those countries because in this instance they are fellow signatories and have ratified the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  That of itself and their status as members of the Council of Europe presumably means that we are deemed to consider them to be countries to which we can extradite our citizens on the basis that we believe they would be given a fair trial and would not be subject to torture or inhumane treatment in those countries and that if that does not prove to be the case, they would have a possibility of invoking the courts or ultimately the Commission and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>It is important to come back to the principle behind this amendment which I support.  It is appropriate and proper for us to consider some restriction by way of assessment of the nature of the charge or of the kind of evidence being preferred on the basis of that charge against an Irish citizen whose extradition is requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister responded to what Senator Eoin Ryan said in moving this amendment, he stated that acceptance of the amendment &mdash; which I presume means acceptance of the principle of this amendment &mdash; would be a rejection of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I know that a certain amount of hyperbole enters into Committee Stages of debates but I cannot <Col N="1830" /> see how the Minister can say that.  All that was undertaken in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the joint communique was that Ireland would accede to the European convention. Ireland is in the process of acceding to the European convention and therefore it is our business as a sovereign country what we do and what safeguards we think are appropriate.  I accept that if we are going to ratify the European convention any amendments we devise must be compatible with the convention.</P>
    <P>This is where I come to another point on which I found the Minister's response difficult to follow.  He referred to Article 6 of the European Convention on Extradition, to which I had already referred. This permits signatories to the convention to refuse to extradite their own citizens.  If you are authorised by a convention to refuse to extradite your own citizens and if you can place a reservation on this convention on the same type of basis, it seems to me that you can introduce a vetting process to ensure that if you are extraditing your citizens there is a serious basis for the charge preferred against them by the requesting state.  To refuse the extradite your own nationals is the ultimate exercise in sovereignty.  A significant number of member states are doing that.  For reasons we have already discussed it is not appropriate that Ireland would refuse to extradite its own nationals.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed in the principle behind this amendment is much more modest.  It is simply seeking to have some vetting process to ensure that if we extradite people we do it, not just on the basis of a foreign country telling us that they are preferring a charge, but that they must put forward some formula either as required in this amendment or in some adaption of the United States formula in the treaty between the United States and Ireland.  When I asked the Minister to give details of the American approach and the way in which the reservation there was introduced by the United States in the recent extradition agreement with Ireland, he said that as a matter of deliberate policy Ireland <Col N="1831" /> decided not to do likewise.  What is the deliberate policy which gave rise to a lack of reciprocity in our relationship with the United States in relation to the extradition of citizens?  I could understand the policy if we said, as the Minister is saying in another context, whatever we do in the area of extradition we must remember it can be done to us.  Whatever we do as a state in relation to extradition from our country also binds us as a requesting state seeking extradition of persons to Ireland. That is fair enough.</P>
    <P>What is the basis of the deliberate policy in our relationship with the United States?  The United States was saying they would not extradite their citizens without having this minimum safeguard. Why did we say as a matter of deliberate policy, &ldquo;you can have your safeguard, we do not want it?&rdquo;.  It is very important that we understand that because it may be helpful in understanding the Government's approach to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal first with Senator Lanigan's remarks, he said &mdash; and he is right &mdash; that the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; do not occur anywhere in the amendment. Effectively it is a <i>prima facie</i> requirement and those two words are a shorthand for describing what the requirement is.  I made the point in my initial reply to Senator Eoin Ryan that for a number of reasons which I detailed then the requirement could not and would not work.  If it were inserted into our legal system it could not achieve the objective it sets out to achieve.  It does not particularly matter whether we use the shorthand expression, <i>prima facie</i>, to describe what the amendment seeks to bring about.  If it is disobliging to Senator Lanigan to use the phrase, I will speak about his amendment rather than the <i>prima facie</i> case.  His amendment would attempt to set in place, as I have said, a system that could not and would not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson wants grounds on which we can assess whether there is a case against a person somewhere else. If you follow that through to its logical <Col N="1832" /> conclusion, it is setting off on a road that would lead you to conclude that what we really want is a situation where if an offence is committed in another country, whether by an Irish citizen as in Senator Robinson's formulation or by anybody in the wider formulation, and the person suspected of having committed that offence is here, we should try that person here because first of all a <i>prima facie</i> requirement looks for some assessment of the evidence.  What we would be looking for in that case is a situation in which the courts here would do a part of the work of courts elsewhere.  The logical conclusion of that is to say that we would want the courts here to do the whole job that courts do elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That is what is said in effect by some of the states which refuse to extradite their nationals.  As I said earlier, particularly during Second Stage debate here, they are countries whose legal systems are very different from ours.  Their methods of investigation are very different from ours.  Their rules of admissibility of evidence are very different from ours. The differences are such that it is far easier in those jurisdictions to try a case that has been committed somewhere else.  I do not say whether those systems are better or worse than ours.  The fact is that they are different.  To graft on to our system, which is a fundamentally different kind of system, elements of the other system would certainly create awkwardness, at the very least, and would create, in my view, situations that we could not be happy with ourselves. The operation of extra-territorial jurisdiction is, in our jurisdiction, a difficult enough thing to bring about successfully. I say that, bearing in mind the fact that there are provisions in the Bill before us that establish new extra-territorial jurisdiction in certain kinds of cases.  Our 1976 Act which establishes extra-territorial jurisdiction over common offences is one which has proved to have some value, but which has not proved, nor could it ever, to be the answer to all of the cases of the kind that we are dealing with here where offences are committed in Northern Ireland or in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> The fact, incidentally, that there have been relatively few prosecutions under that Act is sometimes put down, or is presented as, an indication that there has not been any particular energy on the part of the administration here in prosecuting these cases.  That is a totally mistaken impression.  The initiative in relation to cases dealt with under that Act has to come from elsewhere, it does not lie within this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson seems to be overlooking the points that I made about the provisions of Articles 6 and 12 of the Convention on Extradition.  A close look at those articles will show that it would not be compatible with the convention to say now that we would not extradite Irish nationals without a requirement of the kind that is before us being fulfilled.  We could have said when we ratified that convention that we will not extradite Irish nationals.  In that case we would also have had to accept that we would make arrangements to bring those cases before our courts here in the way that is set out in the convention.  We could not insist on a <i>prima facie</i> requirement now because that would be incompatible with the provisions of Article 12 of the convention.</P>
    <P>In order to give effect to what Senators Robinson, Lanigan and Eoin Ryan want, we would have to depart from the framework that is set out in the 1957 convention. There may be an argument for that.  Having debated this Bill in the other House and here, I do not think that that argument is sustainable and I do not think that that would be an appropriate step for us to take, given everything that has happened both in regard to our extradition law and in relation to the promotion of international co-operation to combat terrorism in the years since that extradition convention was adopted.  I would have to make the point that the purpose for which contracting parties to that convention when they ratified it could enter a reservation about the extradition of nationals is not at all in line with the reason that is now being given for the amendments that are before us, nor is it compatible with the kind of thing that Senator Robinson has in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> In relation to the policy question involved in our treaty with the United States, the policy decision is very clear. We took the view in that agreement which was debated, certainly in the other House, that while, in principle, it is open to us in agreements with non-convention countries to have whatever arrangements we agree and while it would certainly have been open to us to include a requirement of a <i>prima facie</i> nature or a probable cause nature as in the American case, we decided we would not do it because we have never concluded any agreement with any other country that has made that requirement.  It has not been a part of our extradition arrangements with other countries and certainly not since 1965. We are following, in that connection, the clear policy that has been laid down since the 1965 Extradition Act was passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back to the American situation again, a recent Extradition Bill signed in the United States provided for extradition as between the United States and Great Britain.  The basis for that Extradition Bill was basically the same as is being presented here today.  It has been accepted by the Minister that we are not really talking about the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, that we are basically talking about extradition as between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reservation have been expressed here as to whether citizens should be extradited at all from this jurisdiction to Great Britain unless certain guarantees can be given that they will be brought to trial within a very short time and that they will get fair trial.  The reservations I am expressing here have been expressed by many people.  The situation is now that Irish citizens who are asked to be extradited by Great Britain will have under this Bill less protection than an Irish citizen who is asked to be extradited by Great Britain from the United States because of the very guarantees that the Minister has said are built into the extradition treaty as between the United <Col N="1835" /> States and Great Britain.  What we are doing here is that we are passing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister was talking about the extradition convention we have signed with the United States. The extradition treaty that has been signed between the United States and Great Britain does build in the same type of protection for Irish citizens who are looked for by Great Britain as the United States have built in to the extradition treaty between ourselves and America. The same type of people who are looked for from the United States to Great Britain are Irish citizens and they are afforded protection under the American court system.  We are passing an Extradition Bill now which will not give them the same protection as they would get if they were looked for from the United States.  The question has been asked many times as to why the Minister deliberately did not build in safeguards, in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Senator Lanigan is tempting me to be not just technically out of order but to be completely out of order because he is asking a question that does not arise on this amendment or on this Bill.  He is also, I would remind the Senator, asking me questions that were not posed at all by anybody in either of these Houses during the debate, fairly recent debates on the agreement between the United States and this country.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that Senator Lanigan, apart from asking a question that does not arise on this amendment or on this Bill, is asking a question that was not posed during the <Col N="1836" /> recent debate on the agreement between the United States and Ireland.  It is inaccurate for Senator Lanigan to claim that this Bill, in any way, reduce the protection afforded to Irish citizens in the event of extradition.  Not alone is it inaccurate, it is plain wrong, because this Bill increases the protections that are provided for Irish citizens whose extradition is sought by another country.  I have mentioned sections 8 and 9 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have also at some length spoken about the administrative arrangements which we have put in place, which will ensure that no warrant will be sent here for backing from Great Britain or Northern Ireland unless the relevant prosecution service or the other appropriate authority are satisfied that there is a firm probability of a prosecution, based on a sufficiency of admissible evidence; nor will a request be made for a warrant to be backed without a further confirmation from the Attorney General that he has examined the matter and is satisfied that it is as I have outlined it.  That is a new, very valuable and proper requirement which must be fulfilled before a warrant would be sent here for backing and before effect would be given to that request.  It is not true to say that this Bill reduces the protection afforded to our citizens.  From several points of view, it increases the protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple facts of the matter are as follows.  If we wanted to be in a position where we would refuse to extradite Irish citizens under any defined set of circumstances that was a step we could and should have taken the moment we ratified the Convention on Extradition.  That was the moment we passed the Extradition Act, 1965, but we chose not to do it at that time.  We chose instead, so far as our relations with the United Kingdom are concerned to continue with some modifications, with a system which is based on the backing of warrants.  That system has been in operation since 1922.  We decided, therefore, not to make that reservation in ratifying the Convention on Extradition.  That was the time for making it.  Had we made it, it would have <Col N="1837" /> been in a different context from that now being presented to us.  If we had made that reservation we would have had to conform with the other prescriptions of the 1957 Convention; in particular, we would have had to provide that where extradition was refused on the grounds of nationality we would submit the case to competent courts here.  I also made the point that the submission of a case in that way to Irish courts &mdash; and we have the evidence of experience for this &mdash; would create a number of difficulties in dealing with those cases.  There have been difficulties in dealing with cases where extra-territorial jurisdiction is being exercised. Even though this Bill provides for an extension in extra-territorial jurisdiction in certain circumstances, I still foresee that it will be difficult to do given the difference between our legal system and that in most other European countries and the differences that exist between our legal system and the British legal system.</P>
    <P>Effectively, for those reasons it would be very difficult for us to follow the course that would have been permitted by the 1957 Convention.  The 1957 Convention does not in any case allow a member state which does not have a reservation to operate a <i>prima facie</i> requirement or any similar requirement.  One would have to make a special reservation on that point. It would be a separate matter and quite unrelated to the question of whether or not one extradited citizens.  Countries that have made that reservation under the convention and have that kind of requirement &mdash; something like a <i>prima facie</i> case &mdash; are basically civil law countries. They are in a position to proceed with prosecutions for offences committed outside their territories in a way which is less difficult than is the case in Ireland because of the structure of their legal system and rules and approaches they have as to the admissibility of evidence.</P>
    <P>The conclusion I draw from all of that &mdash; and it is fairly clear when one goes through all of the steps &mdash; is that what is provided in this amendment and what is being sought by Senator Robinson would not be consistent with Article 6 of the <Col N="1838" /> European Convention on Extradition. Neither would it be consistent with Article 12 of the European Convention on Extradition and it would require us, if we were to try to keep anywhere near that Convention to deal with prosecutions for offences committed outside our territory which has proved, objectively, to be a difficulty in Ireland.  We would be putting a very substantial new obstacle not just in the way of extradition but in the way of the prosecution of persons for those offences.  I do not think that that is really what we want to do.  It would not be in keeping with what we have set out to do in the Anglo-Irish Agreement; it would not be in keeping with the policies we deliberately adopted when we became signatories to the European Convention on Extradition; and it would not be in keeping with the commitment we have entered into, of our own volition, to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism because we would be making it more difficult to extradite from Ireland or to secure the prosecution anywhere in that overall European grouping of people who are alleged to have been involved in those kinds of crimes.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that the discussion in the other House on the agreement between Ireland and the United States arose in the context of the difficulties in the earlier agreement by way of the finding by the court that because it represented a potential charge on the public purse it should be discussed by Dáil Éireann.  No such considerations applied in the case of Seanad Éireann and consequently we did not discuss it.</P>

      <P>I find this amendment incomprehensible.  I do not think it is a serious attempt to tackle the problem which one would imagine it addresses.  I do not know how anybody who really believes that you should extradite your citizens could believe that a <i>prima facie</i><Col N="1839" /> case, or a case like this should be necessary prior to a decision to extradite your citizens.  Senator Lanigan is right &mdash; the word <i>prima facie</i> is not used.  It might be a little different if the word <i>prima facie</i> had been used.  What is laid down is a very complicated system which makes it quite clear that all the evidence would have to be presented to the Irish court &mdash; verbally presented to the Irish court if people insisted on it &mdash; and the people giving the evidence could be examined and cross-examined on their evidence. That means that in the vast majority of cases extradition of Irish citizens would not take place.  If that is what you want to achieve this amendment will, in effect, achieve it.</P>
      <P>There is no point in pretending that Irish citizens are being denied some protection. Presumably, Irish citizens when they are extradited to any of the countries have precisely the same rights as people arrested in those countries whether or not they are Irish citizens and charged with offences.  This seeks to superimpose upon other countries' systems an additional trial.  That effectively is what it is because a person would have to be tried twice.  It is true that in respect of the first trial it would not be necessary to show beyond reasonable doubt that the person was guilty of a crime but it would be necessary to go through the prosecution case in its entirety to establish whether or not circumstances existed which would constitute a sufficient case to send a person forward for trial if the offences alleged were an indictable offence and had been committed within the State.  To suggest that is to fundamentally change our extradition law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of terrorism for the moment and talking about ordinary decent criminals as the fellow says, I was not aware that there was any dissatisfaction in the way in which the system operated between here and Britain since 1965.  I was not aware that there was any suggestion that this <i>prima facie</i> requirement was in some way causing an inconvenience or an injustice to those people who were being extradited <Col N="1840" /> since 1965 whether to Britain or to other countries.  I was not aware that there was even a single instance in the case of ordinary decent criminals in which that had been a factor.  It appears therefore that we are seeking to change the law to facilitate the fact that certain categories of bandits who previously, we assumed, could not be extradited are capable now of being extradited.  There is a new category of bandit to which this applies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying any individual. It is a new category of bandit.  It applies to a new category of bandits.  It is also interesting to see that there seemed to be no problem whatsoever within this House or indeed generally with regard to the fact that our understanding of the law had undergone a most fundamental change as a result of a series of High Court or Supreme Court decisions.  As I understand it, other than the extra safeguards to which the Minister refers, I do not think this really substantially changes the law from what it is today.  It may change the law from what we understood it was in 1965 but I do not think it actually changes the law as and from what it is today.  So effectively what we are saying is that since the Supreme Court made its decision in some way people who are charged with offences which are political in origin, if not in execution, are being extradited in a wrong way that this has given rise to injustice and that Irish citizens should not be treated in this way. There have been cases of course where there have been allegations, and they may well be true, that the administration of justice in the mainland of Britain has been less than perfect but has there been any single allegation that anyone who was extradited from this country or to the North was wrongly convicted?  I am not aware of any such allegation.  Is there any single controversial case at all?  We have had the case of a Mr. McGlinchey who was extradited and found not guilty of crimes.  He was originally convicted and on appeal was found not guilty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that proves that the system works.  I am quite happy to accept that Mr. McGlinchey emerged from that without a stain on his character for the purpose of this argument.  The combined effect of our decision and the decision of the Supreme Court to extradite Mr. McGlinchey and his subsequent, though admittedly belated acquittal, is proof that the system works.  I am inviting those who think that the system does not work to indicate to me a case since 1965 where it has not worked.</P>
      <P>I believe that people should be held responsible for their crimes and I am in favour of systems which certainly afford them the full protection of the law of the country where they commit or allegedly commit crimes but I am not in favour of a kind of a double system of protection for people who are accused of crime. There is a kind of judicial steeplechase, not with one jump but with a series of jumps which the prosecution must successfully negotiate in order to get a conviction. By establishing an earlier and substantial steeplechase here in respect of Irish citizens or anyone else which for short we call a <i>prima facie</i> case, effectively what we would be doing on the ground is saying that Irish citizens need not be extradited at all or would not be extradited at all.  We certainly would be saying it in respect of jurisdictions which do not share with us the same legal system.  We would be putting an overwhelming obstacle in respect of countries like the United Kingdom where the difficulty of transporting evidence and of maintaining people over a long period in this country would mean that except for the most extreme cases it just would not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was a question of fraud and you had 50 or 60 witnesses you would not transport all of those witnesses to this country to give evidence and establish a <i>prima facie</i> case.  The taking of that evidence might take six to ten weeks in a complicated case.  I am sure that there are some cases of particularly horrific <Col N="1842" /> murders where it would be considered worthwhile doing so but there would be a large number of offences where this just would not be worthwhile.  The effect of this is to rewrite the Extradition Act of 1965, an Act with which, as far as I am concerned, there was general agreement that it was working satisfactorily and to rewrite it not because we are examining extradition <i>per se</i> but merely because the law is catching up with the definition of political offences which has already been changed by the decisions of all courts. The law is in such a way as to enable us to accede to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  For all those reasons the amendment is unsustainable and I could not support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that if we brought in an amendment of this kind it would be interpreted that we were abandoning our campaign against terrorism.  I am not sure if these were the exact words he used but they were something to that effect.  This is the kind of rather abandoned statement that is being made in this debate.  After all if somebody commits terrorist offences in this country and we try him, it could hardly be regarded as abandoning our campaign against terrorism merely because we comply with the normal <i>prima facie</i> procedure and ensure that there is a case against him before he is sent forward for trial.  The Minister also seems to be changing his feet a bit about how we should look at this Bill because some of the time he is pointing out the difficulties this would create in regard to our relationship with European countries other than the UK while some of the time he is telling us that really this Bill is designed to deal with the problem between this country and the North of Ireland and the UK.  He cannot have it both ways.  If it is something we must look at entirely objectively and look at the mainland continental countries equally with the UK, that is one thing but if it is only really from all practical purposes, if we should only be considering it from the point of view of the effect on our relationship with the UK and the <Col N="1843" /> Anglo-Irish Agreement and so on, then perhaps there should have been a special Bill to deal with that.</P>
      <P>We have just heard about the case of McGlinchey and that proves how necessary it is to have a <i>prima facie</i> procedure. In both the McGlinchey case and another case &mdash; I cannot remember the other man's name &mdash; they were highlighted in the North as being very important enemies of the people and so on and in both cases there was pressure to have them extradited.  Finally, when extradition was given without any of the safeguards we are talking about, the courts in Northern Ireland could not make a case against them.  Procedure of the kind set out in this amendment would have been very useful, at least to confirm whether the Northern Ireland authorities could make any case against these two people.  When it came to the crunch they were not able to make a case against them.  That proves that we should have some procedure for ensuring that there is a stable case against the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some of the reservations that have been discussed. He said the time has passed, that we should have done it in 1965 and if we did not do it then it is too late to talk about it now.  That may be so.  Maybe we should have entered some reservations then and if we had done that perhaps the situation would not be as serious as it seems to some of those who are discussing this amendment.  Surely, if we should have been more careful about the reservations we entered into in 1965 that is not a good reason for doing nothing at this stage?  It should make us all the more careful about procedures in regard to extradition.  Perhaps we should have done things in the past but if we did not do them we should now try, in so far as we can, to rectify the situation to make it less unsuitable or less onerous on the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no argument for saying that if something should have been done it should have been done in 1965 and as we did not do it then it cannot be done now. Of course there were numerous reservations entered.  There are safeguards <Col N="1844" /> in other countries.  In spite of all the difficulties and in spite of the horrendous difficulties outlined by Senator O'Leary, a number of countries still insist on a <i>prima facie</i> case being made.  It still exists in the United Kingdom.  We are told the United Kingdom are going to change the law, but they have not done it yet.  Even with the White Paper or draft they have produced, they still give very strong powers to the Secretary of State before extradition takes place.</P>
    <P>These are safeguards in many countries with regard to this.  We are doing something which many countries will not do. We are proposing to agree to extradite our nationals but, as I said earlier, most countries throughout Europe &mdash; Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden &mdash; simply will not extradite their nationals. We are agreeing that a different situation exists here.  Perhaps we cannot be as rigid as that but we are saying that we will extradite nationals but only if there are particular reservations and safeguards for them.  We are not saying we will not extradite nationals but that we will only extradite them under certain circumstances. It is difficult to understand how there could be an objection to this.</P>
    <P>Reservations entered into by other countries include reservations in regard to <i>prima facie</i> cases, reservations in regard to not extraditing nationals, reservations in regard to not extraditing a person if they are going to be tried by an unusual or special court, reservations by countries when say they will decide what is a political offence and whether it is appropriate that the person should be extradited.  Under each of these headings there are eight or nine countries.  One is very impressed by the regard for the freedom of the individual, for civil liberties in all of these countries, not only in regard to their own nationals but in regard to non-nationals also.  The extent to which they have gone to safeguard people in this regard is very impressive. We are unique in the sense that we appear to have no reservations.  We are willing to extradite anybody under almost any circumstances.  We are quite unique in <Col N="1845" /> comparison to other countries in the extent to which we are willing to extradite people.  From that point of view, in comparison to all other countries we seem to be quite cavalier about extraditing people.  We do not seem to be concerned about our own nationals, let alone nationals of other countries.</P>
    <P>This amendment has been put down to try to provide some safeguards.  We are not wedded to the exact wording.  We would be more than happy if the Minister was willing to meet us to some extent and to provide some safeguard for people before they were extradited.  This would be met if there was merely documentary evidence.  Subsection (3) (a) of the amendment says: &ldquo;For the purpose of subsection (2) hereof evidence may include or consist of documents referred to in section 6 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.&rdquo;  Perhaps this confines the position, making it too precise, but if some safeguard, call it a <i>prima facie</i> case or something of that kind, was introduced to ensure that the court was reasonably satisfied there was a statable case against a person before they were extradited we would be quite happy to withdraw this amendment in return for some approach to this problem to be introduced by the Minister on Report Stage.  As it stands we seem to be dedicated to getting rid of people once we get any kind of demand from abroad.  The safeguards for both nationals and non-nationals are minimal and are derisory as compared to almost every other country in Europe.</P>

      <P>I share what seems to be a growing concern or suspicion expressed by Senator Eoin Ryan that our real problem is that there is not a willingness on the part of the Minister &mdash; and this appears to reflect the view of the Government &mdash; to consider the question of having some safeguard.  As a matter of policy the Government do not want it, so to some extent we may be wasting our time in examining the kind of safeguard that we could have.  I am convinced as a lawyer dealing with international instruments, that if we want to we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put forward a wide <Col N="1846" /> range of differing objections or reservations to what has been advanced in support for this amendment or a formulation to represent the principle of the amendment, which is that we have some way of safeguarding our citizens when extraditing them.  He seems to suggest that that would be the breakdown of extradition, that if we have a formula of that kind and extradition ceases we would have to be ready to try our own citizens as an alternative.  Does this mean that in the extradition treaty that we have entered into with the United States, we believe the United States will never extradite on the basis of it because they have a safeguard formula before they extradite?  Surely not.  Surely we are confident that the United States, notwithstanding that they have a safeguard formula, will extradite when they are satisfied that there is probable cause. Similarily, there is no basis for saying that introducing some kind of safeguard clause is identical to what a significant number of countries who have ratified the European Convention on Extradition and ratified the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism have done, which is saying, across the board, &ldquo;we will not extradite our own citizens&rdquo;.  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point is, I wonder is the Minister being fully frank with this House about our position in relation to the European Convention on Extradition and the reservation about our citizens.  Could the Minister explain, in this context, what precisely is meant by the provisions of section 14 of the 1965 Act?  On the face of it that is an exception for our own citizens.  It says, as I understand it, that we will not extradite our own citizens except in accordance with extradition practices.  We put that in at the time for some reason.  We put it in, I believe, because it conformed to Article 6.  But we did not go as far as other countries. We did not say, &ldquo;we will not extradite our own citizens&rdquo;&mdash; full stop.  We have our foot in the door for a particular and different approach in relation to our own citizens.  The thrust of this amendment is to do with our concern for civil liberties, <Col N="1847" /> our concern for the individual.  I, like Senator Eoin Ryan, am very much in favour of a good working extradition law; I have been for a long number of years. I am unambiguous about it.</P>
    <P>I got some feeling from some response the Minister made that because I had not spent time denouncing terrorism that he was not listening to me.  I would be surprised if I had to do that.  I think my reputation in that area is not under question. If I have to do it, take it as read that I unequivocally oppose terrorism.  I despise people who use the name of Ireland in any shape or form to promote terrible acts of violence against people.  I always have.  I have never had any reason to feel that I somehow have to defend myself on that ground.</P>
    <P>I am equally concerned about the protection of civil liberties, and concerned about the protection of the individual, and should be, as a country.  It is something which worries me a little.  I think it is because of the Anglo-Irish context.  It is the only reason that I can think of that we have gone overboard, because it is part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and Mrs. Thatcher might not like it if we put a safeguard in.  I hope I am wrong.  But I do not find that the Minister is addressing the real problem.  He is finding reasons why it would not be appropriate.  But he says as a deliberate policy we would not do it anyway.  That does concern me.  I would hope that we can get past that.</P>
    <P>The only way to do it is to tease out the detail of it.  I would ask the Minister to clarify for the House the context in which section 14 of the 1965 Act was introduced and its relationship with Article 6 of the European Convention on Extradition in 1957.  I would ask him to look at the provision, for example, of Article 5 of the convention that we are at present seeking to ratify, the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Article 5 is framed in a particular way which is incorporated in the terms of this Bill.  We will be able to discuss it at a later stage in Article 8 of the Bill by way of an amendment of the 1965 Act. It could be interpreted more broadly than <Col N="1848" /> is reflected in section 8 of the Act.  Article 5 says nothing in this convention should be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence mentioned in Article 1 or 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that the person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.  The way in which that is framed seems to be open to conferring on a court jurisdiction to satisfy itself that none of those grounds obtained.  If extradition can be refused if a requested State has substantial grounds for believing that could be interpreted as conferring a jurisdiction on the requested State to satisfy itself.  How does one satisfy oneself?  By looking at the basis for the case.  That is only one example of interpreting this convention depending on whether or not there is political will to introduce reasonable safeguards.</P>
    <P>If we want to introduce those reasonable safeguards I have no doubt that we can do it in a manner that is fully compatible with the convention.  It seems that this Government does not want to.  I am still concerned about that and puzzled about it.  Other than that, it may stem from the whole context on which the commitment to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was given.  If so, I regret that it was given in that context.  I would prefer that we were looking at this on its merits and able to look at safeguards on their merits as well.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan claims that he detects a certain disposition on my part to change feet in speaking about various aspects of this Bill.  I am sorry to disappoint the Senator.  I am not changing feet at all.  I have said on a number of occasions during this debate that while we must not lose sight of the fact that there is a wider European context to the subject matter that we have under discussion, in practical terms we are effectively talking about the situation as <Col N="1849" /> between this country and the United Kingdom.  As a matter of recorded fact there have been very few requests for anybody to be extradited from this country to anywhere else other than Northern Ireland or Britain.  Given the nature of the offences that we are talking about here, and our particular experience of international terrorism, we are talking in a situation where by far the great majority of acts of terrorism that have taken place have taken place in a context related to Northern Ireland.  I have been at some pains to make those two points during the course of the debate.  I may perhaps be leaning on one foot more than the other but I am not changing feet during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan also suggested that the McGlinchey case proved how necessary it is to have <i>prima facie</i> procedure. That is simply not the case.  Had we had a <i>prima facie</i> requirement extradition would still very probably have taken place in that case.  In that case there was a committal hearing, the person was returned for trial.  As Senator O'Leary has pointed out he was convicted.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind but that that means that had we had a <i>prima facie</i> requirement here extradition would have taken place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the final outcome.  I am making the simple point, as Senator O'Leary has, that that shows that the system works and it shows that had there been a <i>prima facie</i> requirement extradition would have taken place. As I said earlier on during the course of this debate, it is not at all the case that one can be sure that where a <i>prima facie</i> case is made out to exist &mdash; and this happens in our own jurisdiction &mdash; there is every certainty of a conviction.  Otherwise we would not bother with having committal hearings here at all; we would send people straight for trial.  The fact that people have been returned for trial and that a court here has found that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists is not in any way <Col N="1850" /> to be taken as out of the way if at the end of the day there is no conviction.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier on, it is one thing to show that there is a case to answer.  It is quite another thing to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person who is called upon to answer is guilty of the offence.  To claim that because, after that whole procedure has been gone through in a situation that involves two jurisdictions, there is an acquittal, that there should have been a safeguard to prevent it coming about in the first place, is coming very dangerously near to arguing that we should ensure that there is a conviction when somebody is returned for trial or to arguing that we should not return anybody for trial unless we are sure there will be a conviction.  That is not the argument Senator Eoin Ryan wishes to make.  I have not been arguing that we should have been more careful in 1965 or that the fact that we were not more careful in 1965 is a reason for doing nothing now.  We are talking about a decision in 1965 about the ratification of the 1957 convention and about the policy framework in which we go about dealing with extradition requests.  That leg of Senator Eoin Ryan's argument is so much shorter than the others that it actually lets his argument down.</P>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan also referred to the discretion that is left to the UK Secretary of State, the Home Secretary, in relation to extradition.  I am sure he is perfectly familiar with sections 35 and 50 of our 1965 Act which retain a certain measure of discretion for the courts and the Minister for Justice here.  One must look at the whole framework.  That is not a blanket or general discretion in either case, but a discretion of a particular kind that is very relevant to the basic reasons we are talking about this Bill at all, that is that we want to bring more certainty into the law in relation to what is considered to be or not to be a political offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan said we are unique in the extent to which we are prepared to extradite people.  I cannot understand how that assertion could be made when we look at a number of extraditions which have been refused since the 1965 Act or <Col N="1851" /> since 1982 as a proportion of the numbers requested.  It will be plain that there is no such thing as automatic extradition on foot of a request here.  It is wrong to suggest otherwise.  We are not unique in that respect or in that we are prepared to extradite people more or less automatically but we are unique in that there is a neighbouring jurisdiction in which by far the greater majority of citizens are also, under our law, citizens of our country. That makes it irrelevant to compare our approach to extradition of citizens with the approach of any other country. It is simply not the case that a Frenchman, for example, can say that the great majority of the citizens of a neighbouring jurisdiction are also citizens of France.  In our case and under our law 90 per cent or more of the citizens of Northern Ireland are also citizens of Ireland.  If we took the view that we should decide not to extradite citizens except in certain exceptional circumstances we would be saying that there would be virtually no extradition between those two jurisdictions. That is why we are different from other countries and that is why we have adopted in this area an approach that is different on the surface from the approach of other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan suggested that he might be prepared to withdraw his amendment if there were a response from me along the lines he has suggested. Because of the specifics of our situation, the safeguards Senator Ryan wishes to build in are ones which would obstruct legitimate requests.  It is wrong to claim that there are no safeguards in our system.  It is wrong to claim, as the Senator seems to be suggesting, that extradition should take place only where there is a certainty of conviction, and that if there is a case which concludes in an acquittal there has been something wrong.  It is quite the contrary.  That shows that the system works.</P>

      <Col N="1852" /> Senator Robinson told the House she is worried because the Minister or the Government do not seem to be willing to consider some safeguards and that we have lightly taken the road of having no reservation on this without considering the matters raised.  We spent a lot of last evening and all of today so far dealing with the questions which have been raised, and in making the point time after time that the policy we have adopted since 1965 has been articulated on the basis of the situation as we find it with our citizenship laws, with our relations with a neighbouring jurisdiction and with the proper relationships between those two jurisdictions that require us to do certain things in order to combat terrorism.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to Senator Robinson if she felt obliged to make her statement about her own view of terrorism because it seemed to her that I was not listening to her because she had not made a ritual denounciation.  I can assure Senator Robinson that that is not the case and I would ask her to reciprocate that because in a real sense both the Government and I have spent quite a lot of time before proposing this Bill in considering the very matter she has raised, the question of safeguards.  We have satisfied ourselves that, taking account of the circumstances of citizenship here for example and the context of violence here, we have with other measures which we have taken in the recent past, assured ourselves that there are proper safeguards to protect the innocent, but that there are no unnecessary obstacles that give protection to the guilty or to those who carry out some kinds of crimes that is not afforded to the innocent or to those who might be characterised as ordinary decent criminals.</P>
    <P>I do not take the view that because the US has written a particular provision into its treaty with us that they will not extradite. I read out the condition required in the US Treaty.  It is an affadivit setting forth reasonable grounds for believing that the offence in question was committed by the person sought.  That in some respects is not very much different <Col N="1853" /> from the process involved in swearing information before a magistrate prior to the production of a warrant sent here for backing.  Senator Robinson would agree that the provision in the US Treaty does not go anything like as far in setting up requirements as the amendment that is now before us.  Section 14 of the 1965 Act provides that extradition shall not be granted where a person claimed is a citizen of Ireland unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide. In the case of our dealings with Council of Europe countries the relevant extradition provisions provide otherwise.  That did allow a latitude to contracting states under Article 6 to decide not to extradite citizens, but there was also, in the event that they took that road, another requirement to be fulfilled.  We did not take that road; we do not have to fulfil that other requirement and that is perfectly in conformity with what is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Act now means, in practice, that if, for example, we were to sign an extradition treaty with a country with which we do not now have one and the country was not in the Council of Europe, it would be open to us to say that we will not extradite citizens to that country unless certain conditions are fulfilled.  I should make the point that if we were to even get to the point where we negotiated of our own free will an extradition treaty with another country, we would be saying to that other country that we had at least a certain basic level of confidence and trust in its legal system.  If we did not have that confidence and trust, we would have no business negotiating an extradition treaty with that country and that would have to be a very substantial part of the background to our decision to get involved in a discussion of that kind.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Robinson &mdash; I am sure she will apply her own judgment to this assurance but it is quite sincerely meant &mdash; that it was after very careful consideration of all of those areas that we took the view that the Bill before us should take the form it takes and that this section should be written in the way that it is written.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with two points the Minister made.  First, he was quite wrong in reading into my words the fact that if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case made against a person he must be convicted and that if he is not convicted something has gone wrong.  I certainly did not say that and do not think that. The <i>prima facie</i> procedure is an extremely good one; it ensures that people are not sent forward for trial with little or no evidence to prove a particular offence against them and it prevents them being put in an onerous position unless there are good grounds for believing that the prosecution has a sound case.  That does not mean at all that something has gone wrong if they are not convicted.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is a very useful provision and a very useful procedure and it should not lead to the kind of conclusion I was alleged to have made.  I do not see any reason why the same kind of procedure or something similar should not apply where an Irish citizen who would have the benefit of that procedure if he were sent forward for trial in this country, is going to be tried in another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the Minister said that I was quite wrong in suggesting that it was very easy to get extradition from this country and that in many cases where extradition was applied for the courts refused it.  That is true, but it is certainly not because of the statue which applies.  It is true that in many cases extradition was refused but I would say that in 95 per cent of the cases it was refused because of the one single reason that the court came to the conclusion that the offence was political consequently, in accordance with the Act and with the situation which existed in this country and in most western countries, where at least for 150 years it applied, extradition was refused.  If benefit is what the Minister feels should be given, it should be given to the courts for guarding this principle very jealously. Perhaps, they went too far.  Recent decisions of the courts indicate that they were going too far but certainly extradition was refused in almost all cases for the reason I have outlined and not <Col N="1855" /> because we have very elaborate safeguards and reservations of the kind I referred to and which apply in most other countries.</P>
    <P>I detect that I am not going to get any response from the Minister.  It is a great pity that he should be able to see one side of this problem with great clarity and argue the reasons why the Bill should remain as it is but seem not to be able to see the other side of the picture.  He is looking at it as an establishment person in seeing how useful it is to have this kind of statute and how effective it will be.  He does not seem to see it from the point of view of the person concerned in the extradition application and that something considerably less than justice may be done to people in that situation.  We are all in agreement with him in his seeing one side of the situation but he does not come any distance with us in seeing that there is another aspect of this which needs to be looked at in a reasonable way and which, if not looked at in a reasonable way, could lead to injustice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's contribution reassuring because there was a very definite impression coming across, certainly to me, that the Government as a matter of deliberate policy were not interested in considering the question of whether there should be safeguards.  It is extremely important that we not only approach this question in a balanced way but also with concern for securing whatever safeguards we believe to be necessary. Looking at it from that point of view, it seems that the main thrust of the reason the Minister gave in the particular context &mdash; I accept that context and the difficulties of the scope of Irish citizenship and the fact that there is a Border on this island with citizens living on either side of it &mdash; for not introducing the kind of safeguard that is implicitly looked for in this amendment was that it would produce an administrative barrier to extradition which he was not prepared to contemplate, that it would make extradition more difficult as a result and that that was not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> It is a question of weighing that.  How much more difficult?  Would it prevent extradition where extradition should have taken place?  Would our courts abuse that kind of function if they were given that kind of function?  What is the reason for saying that it would result in a breakdown of the system?  I do not follow that.  It would be helpful if the Minister would come a little further in rehearsing for us the reasons this type of safeguard, having been considered as he says by the Government, was rejected in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand why we must be particularly concerned about the situation in relation to both Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I accept that that is the major context of our extradition law but it is not the context of this Bill, as the Minister is well aware or of Part II of the Extradition Act, of 1965 which we are amending.  We must also be concerned about other countries.  We have reason to be concerned about other countries. We have reason to be concerned, for as Senator Brendan Ryan said so eloquently this morning in the House, about Turkey because like him, I have read the Amnesty report on the position in Turkey.  I have looked at the report of the European Commission on Human Rights who went to Turkey to examine the interrogation and detention of persons in Turkey.  That is a particularly difficult example.  Yet this convention applies to Turkey.  Turkey would be a requesting state to which we would have to extradite Irish people and there would be no safeguards.</P>
    <P>It might not be something that would happen every week or every year but we have to be aware of what kind of risks there might be. Apart from a country like Turkey about which we might have more serious reservations it is a fact that in a number of civil law countries such as Spain &mdash; the Canaries as we saw recently with an Irish citizen &mdash; Belgium and to some extent Italy, bail laws and access to bail are much more strict than ours.  We could find ourselves, without examining the substance of a request to extradite, <Col N="1857" /> extraditing an Irish citizen who could spend 18 months in a prison awaiting trial in another country and then be acquitted. One could then say the system worked, that he was acquitted, but that is not much consolation to the person concerned. There is a basis for wanting to explore the need for a certain safeguard and then drafting or devising a safeguard which complies with our obligations both under the 1957 convention and the convention we are now ratifying.  I would welcome an explanation from the Minister of how the Government addressed those issues and why, in their context, it was felt that no safeguard of this kind was needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the points that Senator Robinson was making in the last part of her remarks.  I would not be venturing further than most Members of this House would want to go if I said that, of course, it must be a matter of concern that anybody against whom it is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of any crime should spend any time in detention. That is a principle to which we would all subscribe but it is not always easy to bring about.  There are, even in the best run legal systems, numerous cases where people are detained, put under hazard and through the difficulties of a trial against whom an offence is not in the end proven.  I suspect &mdash; I would not claim to be an expert on this &mdash; that that is bound to be the case once the legal system begins to operate.  If there is a legal system in the world where that kind of thing does not happen, then we should be discussing it.  I do not think one exists that can completely get over all those difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other points raised by Senator Robinson, especially with regard to Turkey &mdash; I hope I can say this without appearing offensive or dismissive &mdash; I have already answered that point in relation to the concerns raised earlier by Senator Brendan Ryan.  I referred to section 11 of the 1965 Act and to sections 8 and 9 of the Bill before us.  It is not true <Col N="1858" /> to say we have not considered the matter.</P>
    <P>I can understand the point that Senator Robinson is making about the view that we would have, looking at it from the point of view of procedures under our system.  The Senator mentioned Italy, Spain and Belgium.  If there is a very substantial concern about those points, we should not be discussing them in the context of a Bill, the purpose of which is to restrict the scope of the political defence.  We should perhaps be talking about them in the context of an attempt to get all the countries of the Council of Europe to harmonise their legal systems. That is an undertaking which would prove very difficult to bring about but it is the context in which it should be discussed, not in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also asked if it is my belief that our courts would abuse a provision of the kind proposed by Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Lanigan if it were brought in.  I do not know. I would hesitate to say as a matter of judgment that our courts would abuse any system that was brought in.  The question is whether the system itself is an appropriate one.  There will be disagreement about it, I have spent much time stating why I do not believe that that system would conform with our obligations under the 1957 extradition convention, with the policy which we have settled since 1965, a policy with which I and other Members of this House agree and, lastly, why the specific system proposed in the amendment could not and would not work in our court system partly because, among other things, our courts would not, under the terms of the amendment, content themselves just with looking at pieces of paper.  Our system provides the right for the accused person to call witnesses, even people who are not listed, and to have them examined on sworn deposition.  I have said that would create a number of material difficulties in its operation.  That could not and would not work for the reasons I gave earlier and that is why I do not agree with the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  &mdash;Section 50 of the Act of 1965 is amended by the insertion, after subsection (4), of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>`(5)  A direction under this section may be given by the Minister, if the Court or the Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period,</P>
      <P>(b)  is not satisfied that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable, or</P>
      <P>(c)  has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned may be subjected to methods of interrogation which, if operated within the State would be unlawful or which are in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not need much explanation.  Section 50 of the Extradition Act, 1965, provides that a person arrested shall be released if the High Court or the Minister so directs in accordance with the section.  It sets out a number of circumstances in which that can be done.  This is in addition to the number of other cases in which a direction may be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is if the court or the Minister is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period.  In the discussion we just had there was a case given where a person was detained for one and a half years before he was tried and then he was <Col N="1861" /> acquitted.  We do not have to go very far from home to find instances of this.</P>
    <P>The second case is if the court or the Minister is not satisfied that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable.  We all know places where this would apply.  It is quite clear there are certain countries where one would have very little confidence in regard to the administration of justice. The Minister should have the power in such circumstances to refuse to extradite.</P>
    <P>The third case is if the court or the Minister has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned may be subjected to methods of interrogation which, if operated within the State, would be unlawful or which are in breach of article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Again, interrogation of this kind is something which we know exists in a number of countries.  It is just as serious, and possibly even more serious than the other cases which I have mentioned in this amendment.</P>
    <P>We know that all three of these cases arise and that people extradited from this country might be subject to them.  This is not to say that we are copper-fastening the situation so that people may not be extradited to certain countries.  It merely gives the Minister power to issue a direction where this is likely to be the case. There is not much more I can say about it.  The case for it is quite clear.  Because it may be administratively inconvenient to do this kind of thing is not a sufficient reason for not doing it.  The Minister should look at this sympathetically.  He should accept there is a case for it and, in the interests of justice, he should give himself the power to take action to give a direction in certain circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, in particular in view of the fact that it will affect people living in Northern Ireland.  Paragraph (a) states that the Minister may give a direction if he is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period.  Leaving aside for the moment the <Col N="1862" /> statement about a fair trial, it is well known that in Northern Ireland people are not tried within a reasonable period; the average remand now in scheduled offences is two years.  We have tried for a long time to do something about this. Since I was appointed to the Human Rights Advisory Commission in 1978 we have been trying to do something about this matter but it still has not been satisfactorily dealt with.</P>
      <P>One person called Thomas Power spent almost four years on remand awaiting trial and eventually was not convicted. In Northern Ireland that means in effect that he served the equivalent of eight years sentence.  There is not any comeback, or any way of getting compensation or of getting those years back. In my own constituency a young man was arrested in October 1985 and he is still being held.  He is alleged to have acted as a look-out when a particular crime was attempted.  I expect that by next October he will have completed his two years sentence and then he may have a chance of having his case heard.  It is totally unsatisfactory that people should be remanded for such lengthy periods.  I am concerned about the extradition of people into the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland in particular because I suspect that the remand system is abused and is sometimes used as an alternative form of internment without trial in order to keep people out of the way for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) states that the Minister may give a direction if he is not satisfied that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable. With regard to both Britain and Northern Ireland there is a very big question mark, to put it mildly, over the administration of justice and the non-satisfactory and unacceptable elements of that.  I do not want to go over again the whole ground of the Diplock courts.  The Minister and the Irish Government accept that a person should receive a fair trial within the system in Northern Ireland and I know they are trying to do something <Col N="1863" /> about it but so far the British Government have been reluctant to make changes in the Diplock courts.  At present the administration of justice in Northern Ireland in particular is far from satisfactory. I support the amendment on the basis that the Minister ought to retain for himself the power to direct in those circumstances where he is not satisfied that an extradition should not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Rogers in supporting this amendment. As we have rejected the previous amendment, this amendment would provide, while not the same thing, at least an alternative safeguard.  I am not going to repeat all which Senator Robinson and Senator Eoin Ryan have said most eloquently about the necessity of safeguards. This offers a type of safeguard which is not open to the same kind of objections as the Minister has made to the <i>prima facie</i> provision.  It does not require the bringing of witnesses from abroad to the District Court or any of the things that the Minister feels would have made the other amendment impossible to work.  It gives some &ldquo;out&rdquo; in a case where an Irish court might technically have to allow the extradition of somebody to a jurisdiction where no-one in Ireland was satisfied they were going to be dealt with properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us back, as Senator Rogers has said, to the question of bail.  Senator Robinson mentioned this earlier today and I mentioned it myself yesterday.  We have certain standards about allowing people bail and these standards are rather different from most countries.  Not only in Northern Ireland but in Britain itself and in many countries in Europe, people are held on remand without trial for what, to Irish people, would seem disgracefully long periods.  Not only at the end of this period might one have a situation where the person is acquitted, but now and again one has the situation where there is a <i>nolle prosequi</i> and the charges against them are dropped; therefore they are just simply held on bail.  I would agree with Senator Rogers that there can be <Col N="1864" /> occasions when one is distinctly suspicious that the remand system is being exploited in order to make somebody serve what is virtually a jail sentence, without having the inconveniencing difficulty of proving that they are guilty.</P>
    <P>I think this amendment offers the Minister a way of dealing with these situations. It can deal with situations where we are not satisfied with the kind of court system or judicial system that pertains in a particular country, or the way in which people are interrogated.  Senator Brendan Ryan has drawn attention to the example of Turkey.  There are other European countries, which at present have very fine democratic Governments that would not be objected to, but which are not all that many years away from times when they were fairly oppressive as dictatorships.  One thinks, for example, of Greece which at present has a democratic government.  It is not so long since the Greece of the Colonels.  I would have extremely little confidence in allowing anybody to be extradited into the system that they then had.</P>
    <P>When we enact legislation like this, we are not enacting it just for the situation as it is now but for what may happen in the future.  It is worthwhile building in safeguards of this sort which may be useful in the future.  It is not a mandatory section.  It does not make the Minister do anything, but it enables him to do it if he feels that any of these three situations arise.  It does provide a worthwhile safeguard in so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this would conform to our duties under the extradition treaties to which we subscribe. I will leave that question to the Minister to answer.  There are a number of other considerations to which we should give at least some attention.  Our agreement to extradite people to any country is not an unconditional and indefinite surrendering of our rights or authority in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a situation becomes unsatisfactory in any country, even if it requires ceasing to be signatories of a particular convention, that situation has to be faced and has to <Col N="1865" /> be dealt with.  You will probably find in reality if any country with whom these arrangements have been made is, in terms of our perception, unworthy to be trusted in this regard, in a place like Turkey, for example, that these problems will become quite apparent.  Other countries will have a common interest in ensuring, with us, that that situation is either remedied in that country or, alternatively, that the country is put outside the pale of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is true that these arrangements presuppose a certain confidence in the judicial system of other countries.  If we do not have that confidence, we should not continue to have these arrangements with those countries.  Therefore, our agreement with any country must, of course, be subject to constant review. Countries like Greece had problems in the past; if they have a problem in the future we may have to review our position with them.  There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I would not be extremely dissatisfied with the question of the court having discretion like this, if it were possible under the various extradition provisions and the convention on terrorism to which we are now subscribing.  The court would adequately fulfil that task.  I would be a little unhappy with the Minister having such power because the Minister will then be subject to political pressure in cases. Not only this Minister, but every Minister, should be protected from the exercise of political pressure in what is ultimately a judicial decision, or a decision of a judicial nature.  I would be much happier if the Minister did not have that power.</P>
    <P>The pressure on Ministers, particularly a pressure on Ministers where the request relates to the extradition of an Irish citizen and not necessarily only to the North of Ireland but to Britain, is going to be considerable.  It will eventually then become, as a result of this amendment, a political question rather than a judicial question.  I am against that.  In so far as any discretion should be granted to anybody, I feel it is to the court that that discretion should be granted.  I realise the <Col N="1866" /> provisions of the 1965 Act with regard to the Minister's position, but I am not happy that an amendment such as this, giving to the Minister these far-reaching powers to set aside the provisions of the Acts and the provisions of our international obligations would be in the best interests of the citizens of the country and certainly it would not be in the best interests of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The discretion allowed to the Minister by section 35 in Part II of the 1965 Act and sections 44 and 50 in Part III is very well defined and very properly limited.  That is as it should be. We should remind ourselves again that this Bill is intended to allow this country to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and the central part of it is a clearer definition, a statement that certain types of crime will not be regarded as political offences.  This is not, as I said earlier on, a Bill to change the legal map of Europe.</P>
      <P>Looking at this amendment, I would have to ask how the Minister, or the courts &mdash; because it provides for each of those &mdash; could satisfy themselves about all these things.  How, in particular, could the court satisfy itself?  How would a court satisfy itself, for example, that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the place to which a person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable?  What kind of inquiry would the court carry out?  What kind of evidence would it require to be brought before it?  It would surely require more than a statement from the defence that the case was of this kind.  This requires the court to be satisfied.  We should ask ourselves if, in fact, it would be proper for a court to have to decide that, in a case where a request for extradition came before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, far from clarifying the position, would open up a huge range of new areas that would be the subject of argument in court, a whole new range of justicial points which might have to be dealt with in any case that would come before the court.  If for no other reason but that reason alone, I would find this <Col N="1867" /> amendment to be impracticable and unworkable.  I agree also with what Senator O'Leary has said about the breadth of the discretion that should be available to the Minister in a matter of this kind.  I do not think that it would be satisfactory that in matters of this nature a Minister, without any apparent reference to anybody else, could make a decision of this kind.  I am quite sure that if we were dealing with the legislation that had to do only with our domestic situation and the Government was proposing that the Minister have latitude of this kind, that Members of this House would, quite properly, object very strongly to such a proposal.</P>
    <P>A provision of this kind, so far as I know, would be without precedent in any extradition treaty or any other extradition arrangement.  It is a fundamental prerequisite for having extradition arrangements that there should be a basic degree of acceptance that the system of administration and justice in the country with which one has the agreement is satisfactory. If it is the case that one takes a different view then the only logical conclusion which can be drawn from that is that there should be no extradition. There is no point in mincing words about it.  If that is the case there should not be extradition.  That is the effect of what is being proposed but I do not think that is what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>In relation to particular cases I spent some time at the conclusion of Second Stage in this House last night setting out a number of areas where progress has been made in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and in a number of other areas.  I hope to see, as do the Government, progress on those fronts continuing and even accelerating.  We must recognise the fact that progress has been made.  We want the Houses of the Oireachtas, before bringing this Bill finally into operation, to have an opportunity to review that progress.  That is why the commencement provision in the Bill takes the form it does.  That presents a proper opportunity to the Oireachtas <Col N="1868" />&mdash; not to the courts and not to the Minister &mdash; to look at the situation in Northern Ireland and to make up its mind finally on the commencement of this Bill in the light of that.  I do not think it would be either necessary for that process or appropriate to what this Bill is designed to achieve, to make a provision of this kind.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised as to whether it should be the court or the Minister who should have the power in this instance, I think it should be the Minister, but there could be occasions when the person whose extradition was sought might make a statement to the court that would convince the court that one or other of these situations existed in the country to which he was to be extradited.  He might make a very cogent and persuasive case and the court should be in a position to accept that evidence if it wants to do so.  Generally speaking, the Minister should have the power to do this.  Of course, the Minister will have the means of finding out what is happening in other countries and coming to certain conclusions in relation to a particular country.  It may be only for a limited period and would not mean that we should break off all extradition agreements with that country.  In certain circumstances the Minister may feel it is not appropriate for one or other of these reasons and he should give a direction in these situations.  The situations I have mentioned are not dissimilar to some of the directions that already exist under section 50.  Under section 50 (2) (b) the Minister should have sufficient knowledge of what is going on in that other country in order to make a decision that a person should not be extradited.  The same kind of situation would arise under this amendment.  There should be no reason the Minister would not at least have the power to give a direction if this situation existed.  In all the circumstances, it is asking very little to have this amendment agreed to so that it would at least be one safeguard in this Bill.  It falls far short of what I would like to see in the Bill but nevertheless, it would be <Col N="1869" /> some indication of concern by the Minister for people who may be put in the situation of being about to be extradited to a country where a very undesirable situation existed.</P>

      <P>I am still of the view that this is a provision which would be without precedent in an extradition arrangement and which suggests that there should be no extradition arrangement with a country of which we believe those things.  It goes a great deal further than the provisions which exist in sections 35, 44 and 50 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  It is a matter of a great deal more moment than Senator Eoin Ryan is suggesting and its adoption would amount to the statement that in relation to a particular country there should be no extradition.  There are other ways of bringing that about.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.  This Act shall not come into operation until a Resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas, indicating that both Houses are satisfied that this Act should come into operation, and the Minister shall make an order appointing the day on which this Act shall come into operation, and this Act shall come into operation accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to change the procedure for bringing this Bill into operation. At present there is a rather complicated way in which it should come into operation on 1 December 1987 but there are provisions for bringing it in before or after that.  The initiative should be left to the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="1870" /> to bring it in when they are satisfied that the situation exists where it would be appropriate to bring it into operation. That is the better way and it is much less complicated than the situation which exists at present.  The Minister has agreed that the Oireachtas should have time to think about this Bill, to observe what is happening in different countries, in particular, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, and that it should only be brought into operation when the Oireachtas is satisfied that the time is appropriate.  It is proper in these circumstances to allow the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass the resolution when they are satisfied that that situation exists.</P>

      <P>The Minister was bringing to the attention of the Leader of the House that the note at the bottom of the amendment says that acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 12 of the Bill.  I think that should refer to the deletion of section 13 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would mean that the Bill would not mention any specific date in connection with the coming into operation of the provisions of the Bill but it would provide for the Act to come into operation only following <Col N="1871" /> an affirmative resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand and respect the thinking behind the amendment but I cannot accept it.  The approach taken in the commencement provision of the Bill as presented to this House, reflects a very carefully considered approach by the Government and I would strongly urge this House to retain that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the commencement provision earlier during the debate and I should point out that in the joint communiqué issued after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in Hillsborough, ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was set against the background of progress in relation to a number of matters under the agreement, namely, public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, relations between the security forces and the minority community and enhancing security co-operation between the two Governments.  There has been progress in a number of respects on those fronts and that process is continuing.  The nomination of a specific date as the commencement date, subject to a resolution to the contrary not being passed in the interim by both Houses of the Oireachtas, serves as a very clear earnest of our firm intent to ratify the Suppression of Terrorism Convention by an early date against the background of progress of the kind that was referred to in the communiqué issued after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The commencement provision that is in the Bill is in fact a more flexible instrument than the one that is proposed in this amendment.  I <Col N="1872" /> would think that it is better suited and more sensitive to the need to review the question of the Bill's commencement in the light of developments.  It gives to the Houses of the Oireachtas full control over that matter and full discretion in the matter.  It is better calculated to bring about the result that we wish to achieve than the provision as it would be if this amendment were to be accepted.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to sit again on Wednesday next.  I did indicate here today that we would meet at 2.30 p.m. but in the hope of avoiding two days sitting next week it is now proposed to sit at 12 noon.  Accordingly it is proposed to adjourn the Seanad and to sit at 12 noon on Wednesday, 21 January.  It is probable that the business taken up then will be the legislation which is in progress and nearly complete and in particular the National Monuments Bill and the Status of Children Bill both of which are at Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 21 January, 1987.</P>
