      <P>I have notice from Senator Nuala Fennell that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House to-day, she proposes to raise the following matter.</P>
      <P>The severe underfunding of the Council for the Status of Women which represents 250,000 women and 55 affiliated organisations.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed closure of the National Social Service Board.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Fennell and O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fennell's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senator O'Toole may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
      <P>I want to remind Senators that written notice has to be given of the matters again or else they will lapse.</P>

Also, on the Order of Business, in view of the fact that at the present time, the offices of most Senators are cut off because of a gas leak, and in view of the fact that many people cannot get to their notes and papers, may I ask the Leader of the House to have a certain flexibility today in regard to the Order of Business if this situation persists?</P>

    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1987    [Certified Money Bill]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1080" />
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to reduce the expense and administration involved in financing capital programmes of local authorities.  The present system involves an expensive roundabout of payments with the Exchequer making a loan to the local authority and then providing the local authority with the money needed to meet the loan charges.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to fund the relevant capital programmes in future by way of direct Exchequer grants.  This Bill will allow the Minister for Finance to write off the principal and interest outstanding on the existing subsidised loans.</P>
      <P>Though the Local Loans Fund goes back about 100 years, it was formally established by the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935.  The purpose of the fund was to provide loan finance for local capital programmes such as housing.  Initially, a limit of £5 million was set on the advances that could be made from the fund.  This limit was increased by a series of amending Bills, the most recent being the 1986 Bill which raised the limit to £4,500 million.</P>
      <P>Currently the major programmes financed from the fund are local authority housing, sanitary services and local authority mortgages for house purchase.  As capital spending by local authorities grew, the burden of repayments increased and subsidies on loan charges were introduced.  These subsidies gradually increased over the years until the current situation arose where the Exchequer provides the funds for most of the repayments on loans made by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsidies available range from 100 per cent for local authority housing to between 40 per cent and 60 per cent for sanitary services.  In fact, the only major unsubsidised programme left is the mortgage programme.  The effect of having a full subsidy on loan charges is that the Exchequer provides the loan and then provides the money needed to repay the loan to itself through a complex and costly series of payments.  Even where the loan charges are only partially subsidised <Col N="1081" /> the State provides, by way of the rate support grant, funds to meet the balance of the repayments.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to break this expensive and time consuming circle of payments by giving direct grants to local authorities to finance these capital programmes in future.  In addition, it is proposed to write off the outstanding balance on the loans previously issued from the Local Loans Fund in the case of programmes where the repayments were fully or partially subsidised.</P>
    <P>Total advances from the fund stood at about £3,560 million at the end of 1986. It is expected the write off will be about £2,700 million.  The balance outstanding in the fund relates to unsubsidised loans which will not be written off.</P>
    <P>There will be no cash loss to the Exchequer.  Where a fully subsidised loan is written off obviously the cash position of neither the local authority nor the Exchequer will be changed.  Where a loan with partially subsidised loan charges is written off the rates support grant will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the unsubsidised portion of the repayments. Thus the writing off of the principal and interest outstanding on subsidised loans will have no adverse effect on the finances of either the Exchequer or the local authorities. However, it will lead to savings in the costly administrative system required to supervise the present system of payments.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, the only major unsubsidised scheme left is the local authority mortgages.  As this scheme is self-financing and the repayments are unsubsidised, there is no circle of payments and there is, therefore, no need to alter it.</P>
    <P>An incidental effect of this legislation is that it will reduce the total figure in the national debt statement by eliminating double counting.  The statement at present includes the Exchequer's liability to subsidise repayments of principal by local authorities despite the fact that this liability is to the Exchequer itself.  The Exchequer borrowing necessary to provide the advance to the local authorities <Col N="1082" /> in the first place is also included in the statement.  Thus the national debt is overstated in the finance accounts.</P>
    <P>It is overstated only by the amount of the Exchequer's liability to subsidise the repayments of principal by local authorities. So the reduction in the national debt statement will be less than the total amount that it is proposed to write off. As indicated earlier, this will include the full amount outstanding on loans which are only partially subsidised.</P>
    <P>When the loans are written off, the gross debt will be reduced because the theoretical liability to subsidise repayments will have disappeared.  I should say that the element of double counting is explained each year in a footnote to the finance accounts.  The Central Bank and the OECD are fully aware of the position. What is at stake now is a technical accounting change and it must be stressed that the burden of the debt will not be lessened in any way and the reduction in public borrowing remains a high priority.</P>
    <P>In summary, this Bill will allow the system of funding the capital programmes of local authorities to be greatly simplified.  It is intended to substitute grants for loans and to adjust the rates support grant from 1 January 1988.  This change will have no adverse effect on the funds available to local authorities for their capital programmes.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Finance may waive the repayment of any unpaid balance, including interest, on a loan advanced from the Local Loans Fund.  Section 2 provides that from time to time a statement of such waivers shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 3 provides for consequential amendments to two other Acts which have sections dealing with the writing off of sums outstanding on loans from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am so pleased to find that he is happy to come into this House and that he feels a sense of familiarity with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> The Explanatory Memorandum which comes with this Bill is a particularly good one.  It sets out in a clear, concise, factual way the purpose of the Bill and was particularly helpful in the course of preparation for debate on it.  This is a technical Bill which simplifies and streamlines public accounting procedures.  It is a long overdue administrative reform and as such it is welcomed by my party.  The Local Loans Fund was established in 1935 under the Local Loans Fund Act.  Before this there was a non-statutory fund which was financed by a grant-in-aid which was voted annually.  The origins of that measure go back about 100 years.  We are, indeed, seeing a change today.  Much has changed in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>When the fund was first established on a formal basis in 1935 a limited £5 million was set on advances from the fund.  The most recent amendment in 1986 increased this limit to £4,500 million.  The actual position on the ground now is that the majority of loans to local authorities are loans in name only.  Something of a fiction has arisen over the course of time. There is a 100 per cent loan for local authority housing and subsidies, as the Minister said in his speech, on sanitary services range between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.  One hundred per cent subsidy means that the Exchequer provides the loan and the repayments.  Even where there is a partial subsidy as is the case with sanitary services in the 40 per cent to 60 per cent bracket, the Exchequer in effect meets all repayments, some through the Local Loans Fund itself and the balance of course through the rate support grant.</P>
    <P>The whole exercise has been carried out by way of an elaborate, circuitous and expensive method of payment.  In many instances there have been some six or seven stages involved from start to finish.  The whole operation, as I said, was something of a fiction and it is high time it was reformed.  As a reform we welcome it.  Today's measure is introduced specifically to simplify the system and to call a spade a spade.  From 1988 onwards grants will be given for all the programmes which previously qualified <Col N="1084" /> for subsidised loans.  The Minister must then have the necessary powers to write off the outstanding principal and interest due on all existing loans.  This writing off, I am pleased to hear the Minister state, will have no net effect on either local authority or Exchequer finances.  Overall the net cash position will remain the same.  I am pleased to hear the Minister state that the house purchase mortgage will continue to be provided.  As these are not part of the unwieldy mechanism which the Bill seeks to change, there is no need, of course, to alter the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has stated there will be no adverse effect on the amount of funds available from the Exchequer to the local authorities and that the administrative costs of providing these funds will be reduced.  I also welcome the fact that under section 2 of the Bill details of any waiver action taken by the Minister will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on a matter which has been controversial in the context of this Bill and which was raised specifically outside the Houses, and, indeed, on Report Stage in the Dáil in relation to this Bill.  I would be interested, when he replies to second Stage, if he could expand and elaborate on the double counting mechanism inherent in calculating the national debt.  Will the movement from a loan scheme to a grant type scheme eliminate some of the double counting and would he explain how the double counting occurs and tell us whether he believes this measure will affect the figures in any way?  I understand it will not in any real or any concrete way reduce our liabilities but I would be glad if he would expand on that point. As I say, it has been controversial both within and without the House.  The net question is: does it in any way affect our overall debt liabilities?</P>
    <P>There is concern in local authorities that this change will impact adversely on their cash flow and, indeed, at a committee meeting on finance of my own local authority &mdash; Waterford City Council <Col N="1085" />&mdash; the question was asked by those on the finance side and by the senior executive people.  They were concerned lest the passage of this new measure would adversely affect their already critical and precarious cash flow.  My own local authority are starting with an opening deficit of some £600,000 and they are a Council where local authority charges have not won popular support from the Minister's own party.  The situation is quite critical. Reassurances as to how this measure will be implemented with the minimum of impact on the cash flow of local authorities would be welcomed in the course of the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>The manner of the implementing of this measure is seen by local authorities and not only my own one &mdash; Waterford City Council &mdash; as having enormous significance particularly now as they sit down to debate their estimates and to discuss the financial situation which must, of course, be resolved by the end of November.  The net question, therefore, is how is this going to be implemented on the ground.  Obviously, any hint or any suggestion that there would be a further reduction in their overall funding, which is already insufficient by virtue of the 14 per cent cut in the rates support grant, is an area of concern of them.</P>
    <P>It is tempting, of course, to broaden this debate into a discussion on the method of local authorities financing.  We all, I suppose, in different parties have our own views on this.  We were fortunate in this House in being able to have a three hour debate on local authority funding and I imagine Members will confine their remarks to the specifics of this Bill which is a relatively confined measure.  I certainly intend to be pertinent in my contribution.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to comment on the persons who were employed in this elaborate and circuitous method of ensuring that the local authorities got the necessary funding.  These people were employed either at local level or at Central Government level.  Is it planned to redeploy these people?  Does the Minister envisage great savings in terms of finance or man hours?  I also would like to ask <Col N="1086" /> what is the actual saving in administrative costs.  If the Minister could quantify that it would be helpful.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will sum up by saying I welcome the Bill.  It is a small measure.  I hope there will be further eliminations of costly, wasteful and ridiculous procedures in an attempt to streamline bureaucracy which should always be seen to be straightforward, uncomplicated and modern in its method of application.  I am happy to support this Bill in the knowledge that this is, in fact, the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to welcome the Minister.  This is a major Bill in many ways but yet a simple Bill and one that will receive a general welcome in this House.  Basically the Bill is a clear attempt to simplify and to make easy public accounting procedures.  It is an attempt to simplify the system of financing of the various capital programmes operated by the local authorities.  The actual position now is that most of the loans to the local authorities are loans in name only.  Having granted a 100 per cent subsidy, having provided a loan, central Government also provide the repayments. There is a real belief that central Government lend almost exclusively to the local authorities for various capital programmes.  This Bill will confirm that that is, in many ways, a myth.  Realistically it is a grant scheme.  The Bill is coming clean and telling what the exact position is.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the local loans fund goes back almost 100 years but that it was formally established in 1935 by the Local Loans Fund Act. The area of sanitary services and the area of local authority housing have expanded as a direct result of what we have known as the Local Loans Fund.  We are pleased to note that this will not change on the passing of this Bill except in the very practical way of better and more specific administrative procedures.  Effectively the Minister is now saying: &ldquo;Let us call a grant a grant&rdquo;.  From 1988 onwards this will, in fact, be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The natural consequence of this move is that the Minister has the power to write <Col N="1087" /> off any outstanding principal and interest due on existing loans and this is clearly referred to in section 3 of this Bill.  Like the previous speaker, I also welcome section 2 which provides that from time to time a statement of such waivers shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Again it has been made clear that the administrative changes in the Bill will not affect the finances of the local authorities but will save central Government some finances as a result of reducing various administrative costs.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Bulbulia, I congratulate the Department for providing us with an excellent straightforward Explanatory Memorandum. It makes the point that, for example, the loan charges for local authority house construction are subsidised 100 per cent since 1977.  The rate of standard subsidy for sanitary services programmes ranges from 40 per cent to 60 per cent.  In so far as any residue of loan charges on subsidised services remains as a local authority liability, the authorities can draw on the rates support grant to meet the residual charge.  I believe that in the case of capital schemes that are not getting the maximum grant such as major sanitary schemes, the capital funds will now become capital grants and the subsidy normally paid twice yearly when the loan charges are needed will have the rates support grant reduced on a monthly basis by an amount equal to the subsidy.  In the knowledge that this could be the position in the future a local authority could be penalised in some way as a result of not getting money on time. Could the Minister comment on that and, if that is the position, perhaps some form of compensation might be available for the various local authorities?</P>
    <P>There is a temptation on this Bill to go into other areas of local government being discussed at length throughout the country at present.  Reform of local government is long overdue.  I know the Minister for the Environment is working hard on this problem and I hope we will have something worth while in the near future.  It has been promised now for the <Col N="1088" /> past 15 to 20 years.  It is peripheral to this Bill.  This Government and Governments over the years have been rather unfair to local authorities, for example in the higher education grants area, when you consider that the local authorities have had to pay out all the higher education grants.  The cost of grants in Westmeath to date this year is £636,000 but, unfortunately, we will not get that money until February or March.  Therefore, there is a bank interest charge which could amount to maybe £30,000 or £40,000. As part of the ongoing streamlining and simplifying local authorities would welcome a quick response from the various Government Departments if they are working and acting in an agency capacity.</P>
    <P>Also peripheral to this Bill my hope would be that, having made a start as the Minister has made a start here, there would be further examination aimed at tidying up transfers of finances to other bodies.  Hopefully that would have a beneficial effect in the future and result in savings all around.  The Bill is welcome in general.  It is a clear opportunity to streamline and tidy up the administrative system.  I think all Members of this House will welcome this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I also want to welcome the Bill.  I applaud the Minister for having introduced it.  We need more of this type of legislation to deal with the bureaucratic maze which exists in many Departments at present.  The Bill provides for reform which will reduce and streamline the administrative procedures which exist in relation to the subsidisation and repayment by local authorities of loans from the Local Loans Fund.  This administrative procedure is both expensive and time-consuming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Loans Fund is the source of loan capital for local authorities.  Loans which local authorities draw down from the Local Loans Fund are used to finance the various capital programmes of the local authorities such as house construction, mortgages for house purchase and the various sanitary services schemes.  Over the years subsidies were made available to local authorities to <Col N="1089" /> enable them to meet their repayments. Since 1977 the loan charges for local authority house construction have been 100 per cent subsidised.</P>
    <P>I do not know how I would be regarded if I lent somebody £5 and said I was charging £1 interest on the loan and then gave that person £6 to enable him to repay the loan to me.  Yet that is exactly what was happening in the case of loans raised by local authorities from the Local Loans Fund.  If I were to do as I have stated I would be regarded as an object of ridicule.  It was certainly time to reform repayments by local authorities to the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has stated that the new procedure will not involve any extra cost for the Exchequer and should lead to savings in the administrative costs and overheads which are currently involved in organising and supervising the present cumbersome system of payments.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the change of itself will have no effect on the amount of funds available from the Exchequer each year to local authorities for their various capital programmes.  I wish to join with the other speakers in welcoming this Bill and in hoping that we will see more of this type of legislation in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me thank Senators who contributed and many others who would probably have been as interested and would probably have liked to say what has been said.  It is a small Bill and I think we have nearly all contributed in the same way.  Those who have not spoken would probably have had much the same to say. I am glad everyone has welcomed the Bill as in the Dáil.  It is necessary to eliminate these wasteful circular transfers costing huge amounts in administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this before and Senator Bulbulia raised it again &mdash; question of double counting.  It was farcical and at least now it is being corrected.  But farcial as it was, as I said in my Second Stage speech, it was taken care of by <Col N="1090" /> an example given or a statement at the bottom of a particular page of the finance accounts showing what was happening. To put on record again exactly what the position was, the finance statement at present includes the Exchequer's liability to subsidise the payments of principal by local authorities despite the fact that this liability is to the Exchequer itself.  We had to show it as a bill to be paid to the local authorities but, nevertheless, we were the ones to receive it in the end.  The Exchequer borrowing necessary to provide the advance to the local authorities in the first place is also included in the statement.  We had it on both sides.  The new procedure will eliminate the necessity for that.</P>
    <P>The national debt was overstated in the finance account by a substantial amount. That obviously has consequences.  There is no point in saying it because when we covered it in the Dáil &mdash; well, Senator Bulbulia referred to the publicity outside. The fact of the matter is that it has a consequential effect in relation to the debt as a percentage of GNP but it does not change our overall indebtedness.  We still have to pay every penny we owed yesterday or on 31 December but by this change is will appear to be a smaller percentage of GNP on 1 January than it did before.  That does not change £1 of what we owe and what we will have to pay.  There is absolutely no change in the debt; it is important that we clearly understand that, as Senator Bulbulia requested.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that there will be no change in relation to the local authority capital finances.  It is not the intention that anybody will be worse or better off from the point of view of the Exchequer or the local authority.  The intention is that we eliminate the circular transfers and the administrative costs that are involved in it which brings me to the next point illustrated by Senator Bulbulia. There are about 20 staff involved mainly in the Office of Public Works and the savings will be about £250,000 in that area and this will enable us to have redeployment in other areas where there is greater pressure and necessity for <Col N="1091" /> additional staff.  That is the saving; it could be more but, roughly speaking, it is around £250,000.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Fallon is taken.  It is not our intention to leave the local authorities any worse off.  While there might be administrative delays on the Exchequer side or on the side of Government, sometimes the local authorities themselves are to blame.  We are having discussions with the local authorities about this matter and with the Department of the Environment and it is not our intention to have any delays or to in any way leave any of the local authorities worse off in 1988 than they might consider themselves to be.  I think that covers the points made.  I do not know if there was any other point but I am sure if there was we can pick it up in detail on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>May I comment?  Local authorities pride themselves in the fact that all their proceedings whether on finances, the estimates or business generally are by way of open discussion.  In other words, the press of the world can be there to listen and learn.  Here, I am glad to say, is a further attempt to continue that good work of open discussion. The Minister is clearly saying that the Minister for Finance shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas &ldquo;a statement in accordance with subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.

He made reference to the fact that discussions are ongoing between officials of Departments and local authorities and that he felt he could give assurances that local authorities would not be adversely affected, that there would not be undue delay and that local authorities were sometimes guilty of delays themselves. How will this measure be implemented with the minimum of disruption to the financing of local authorities with no impact adversely or otherwise on their cash flow situation which is already precarious?</P>

      <P>I will deal very briefly with the point made by Senator Fallon.  It is a very relevant point and I am glad to have an opportunity to put it on the record that we are not trying to avoid any questions that might be raised.  The reason for this section is that there are about 15,000 loans and it would be impractical and would serve little purpose to oblige the Minister to supply the Oireachtas with details of each loan written off.  That is the position.  What we will be doing under this section is, in relation to each category, housing, sanitary services, etc., giving the number of loans written off, the total amount advanced on such loans, the total amount of principal being waived and the total amount of interest being waived.  That will be done periodically under group headings under this section and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator Bulbulia's point, the intention is that as 1 January is reached we will not make any demands on local authorities from here on and in the course of the year we will be writing off the loans. That is the way it will proceed during 1988.  We could spend hours going into detail in relation to any loan to any local authority.  The administrative process which will be implemented through the Department of the Environment and the local authorities on the one hand and the Department of Finance on the other will <Col N="1093" /> be designed to ensure that no local authority is worse off and equally, to ensure that the Exchequer is not any worse off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I took up office, I have been very conscious of the vulnerability of the Irish coastline to the threat of oil pollution particularly from oil tankers.  Ireland is in an especially vulnerable position due to its proximity to major sea routes, the length of our coastline and the severity of the weather which can affect the seas around the country.  I am most anxious, therefore, to take whatever steps are necessary to reduce the threat of major oil spills and to minimise the impact of any incidents which might occur in the future.  The absence of a legislative regime covering liability and compensation for oil pollution damage from oil tankers was one major gap which needed to be filled. Accordingly I took the necessary steps to have a Bill covering this area introduced in the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main aims of this Bill are first, to ensure that oil tankers entering or leaving Irish ports have adequate insurance to cover their liability for oil pollution damage; secondly, to provide supplemental cover where oil tanker owners' liability is exceeded and, thirdly, to establish a legal framework for recovery of costs connected with oil pollution incidents. The Bill and consequential regulations will enable Ireland to ratify the <Col N="1094" /> International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and its 1976 protocol and also the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, and its 1976 protocol.  These conventions are generally referred to as the Civil Liability Convention and the Fund Convention.  For the information of Senators I have placed a copy of a booklet which includes both conventions in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>The Civil Liability Convention obliges owners of ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo to have appropriate insurance to cover liability to a specified limit for oil pollution damage.  The liability limit is £116 approximately per ton up to a maximum of £12 million approximately whichever is the lesser.  The equivalents of these figures are set out in section 10.</P>
    <P>The Fund Convention provides for the establishment of a fund financed by oil companies for payment of compensation for oil pollution where shipowners' liability is exceeded up to a current overall maximum of £46 million approximately. This limit will be increased to approximately £52 million from 1 December 1987 and it is the equivalent of this figure which is referred to in section 21.</P>
    <P>The units of account referred to in sections 10 and 21 are special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund.  The actual equivalent in Irish pounds will depend on the exchange applying on a particular day.  The unit of account for both conventions was originally gold francs and this was changed to special drawing rights of the IMF in the 1976 protocols to both conventions.</P>
    <P>At present Ireland is reliant on voluntary international schemes for compensation in the event of oil pollution damage from ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo.  These agreements are the Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement on Liability for Oil Pollution, TOVALOP, and a Contract Regarding a Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution, CRISTAL.  TOVALOP and CRISTAL were intended to be interim solutions and to remain in operation only until the Civil <Col N="1095" /> Liability and Fund Conventions had worldwide application.  While the scope of TOVALOP and CRISTAL is similar to that of the international conventions, it is not possible to incorporate their provisions into national law.</P>
    <P>As regards the liability of oil tanker owners, sections 7 and 8 outline the situations where oil tanker owners can limit their liability and where they can be exempt from liability.</P>
    <P>In the event of damage from oil pollution, owners of laden oil tankers will have strict liability for such damage except in a few particular cases, namely, when the damage results from an act of war or a grave natural disaster, or the damage is wholly caused by sabotage by a third party, or the damage is wholly caused by the failure of authorities to maintain navigational aids.  If the oil pollution damage is proved to have been due to the personal fault of the tanker owner, he will not be able to limit his liability.</P>
    <P>The liability of the Fund Convention is covered in sections 20 and 21.  The Fund Convention becomes liable if claimants are unable to obtain full compensation under the Civil Liability Convention for one of the following reasons: no liability arises under the Civil Liability Convention; the owner is financially incapable of meeting his obligations under the Civil Liability Convention and his insurance is inadequate; the damage exceeds the owner's liability under the Civil Liability Convention.</P>
    <P>However, the Fund Convention does not have to pay compensation if the pollution damage resulted from an act of war, or if it cannot be proved that the damage resulted from an incident involving one or more ships, or was due to the wilful misconduct or personal fault of the owner.</P>
    <P>In relation to those claiming compensation under this legislation, I have included a provision in section 12 whereby, after a court has decided that a shipowner is liable for oil pollution damage, the court may order the payment in court of the amount of the owner's liability.  I feel that this provision will be a useful safeguard to claimants. <Col N="1096" /> Furthermore, under section 13 where a ship has incurred a liability for oil pollution damage, any other ship in the State which has the same owner may be detained.</P>
    <P>Section 16 outlines the provisions in relation to the insurance of Irish registered ships carrying 2,000 tonnes or more of oil in bulk as cargo and all other ships carrying these quantities of oil to or from Irish ports.  All these must carry insurance certificates showing that the vessels have appropriate insurance cover. Inspectors appointed by the Minister for the Marine, surveyors of the Department of the Marine, sea fisheries protection officers and harbour masters may carry out inspections of ships to ensure that the required insurance certificate is carried on board.  If a ship does not have the required insurance certificate, it may be detained.</P>
    <P>The fund of the Fund Convention is financed by persons in the contracting States to this convention who receive crude oil and heavy fuel in these States after sea transport.  Section 19 provides for receivers of these types of oil in Ireland to make the appropriate subscriptions to the fund.</P>
    <P>The penalties in section 38 are divided into two categories.  The greater penalties of a fine up to £1 million and &mdash; or imprisonment of up to give years in the first subsection are for offences such as a ship ignoring a detention order, a ship not having the required insurance cover and an oil receiver failing to make the required payment to the fund.  The lower penalties in the second subsection are for persons who impede inspectors and harbour masters in the carrying out of their inspection functions.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will greatly improve the position in relation to liability and compensation from oil pollution damage caused by oil tankers and I am hopeful that it will have a speedy passage through both houses.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill, the main purpose of which is to enable Ireland to give effect to two <Col N="1097" /> international conventions, the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, commonly known as the Civil Liability Convention, or CLC, and the 1971 International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, commonly known as the Fund Convention, or the FC, and the 1976 protocols to these two conventions.  The opening sentences of the 1969 convention make a laudable preface to this Bill when it states:</P>
      <P>The States, parties to the present convention, conscious of the dangers of pollution posed by the worldwide maritime carriage of oil in bulk, convinced of the need to ensure that adequate compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by pollution resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from ships, desiring to adopt uniform international rules and procedures for determining questions of liability and providing adequate compensation in such cases have agreed this Convention.</P>
      <P>This preface to the 1969 CLC is, in fact, the guts of this Bill, the main provisions of which are: (1)  to ensure that all oil tankers, whether within or without the State, have adequate insurance to cover their liability for oil pollution damage; (2)  to provide supplementary cover where the liability of owners of oil tankers is exceeded; and (3)  to provide a legal framework for the recovery of costs connected with oil pollution incidents.  The pollution resulting from the accident to the giant tanker, the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>, in 1969, made it clear that the 1957 International Convention on the Limitation of the Liability of Seagoing Ships set limits which were totally inadequate to compensate for pollution damage on a scale which modern super tankers are capable of causing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This disaster revealed, as the Minister has indicated, many gaps in the law and, in particular, it raised doubts whether in some circumstances clean-up costs were always recoverable and it highlighted the <Col N="1098" /> considerable jurisdictional difficulties in bringing proceedings at all.  As a first step an international legal conference was convened in Brussels in 1969 by IMCO, the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, which adopted the CLC, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage.  The 1969 convention provided that, subject to certain exceptions, shipowners should be liable, regardless of fault, for oil pollution damage caused by the escapes of oil from a loaded tanker.</P>
    <P>The 1969 convention also raised the limit for the shipowners' liability set by the 1957 convention, but not far enough to ensure full compensation.  Indeed, the exemptions from liability could have left some victims entirely without compensation. A second conference was, therefore, convened by IMCO in 1971 and they adopted a further convention setting up an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage.</P>
    <P>These two conventions, the Civil Liability Convention and the Fund Convention, provide an interlocking system of a fund, shipowner liability and compulsory insurance.  The CLC makes it mandatory on the owners of oil tankers to have appropriate insurance to cover liability to a specific limit for oil pollution damage.  The liability limit is £116 per ton, approximately, up to a maximum of £12 million, approximately, whichever is the lesser.  The FC is supplementary to the CLC and provides for the establishment of a fund financed by the oil companies for the payment of compensation for oil pollution where the liability of shipowners is exceeded up to a current overall maximum of £46 million approximately.  The Civil Liability Convention had 57 contracting States as at 1 June 1987 and the Fund Convention had 35 contracting States as at that date.</P>
    <P>In addition, as the Minister has indicated, to these two international conventions, there are two important voluntary international schemes set up by the tanker owners and the oil companies respectively.  Ireland is at present reliant on these schemes for compensation in the event of oil pollution damage from oil <Col N="1099" /> tankers.  One of these schemes is the Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement on liability for Oil Pollution &mdash; TOVALOP. As its title suggests, it is an agreement between tanker owners to pay larger sums in compensation for oil pollution than they are obliged to pay under international law currently in force.</P>
    <P>The second scheme is a voluntary fund set up by the international oil industry to pay compensation beyond what is available under national legislation and TOVALOP up to a certain maximum. The second scheme is called CRISTAL which, as the Minister has indicated, is short for Contract Regarding a Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution. It is a kind of super TOVALOP. While the scope of TOVALOP and CRISTAL is similar to that of the two international conventions, it is not possible to incorporate their provisions into national law.  This Bill will give effect to the two international conventions and the 1976 protocols of these conventions.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for civil liability for pollution damage.  Under section 7 of part II in relation to oil pollution damage, the owners of laden oil tankers will have strict liability for such damage except in a few cases as provided for in section 8 of the Bill where the shipowner proves: (a)  that the damage results from an act of war or a natural phenomenon of exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character, which is generally termed &ldquo;an act of God&rdquo;; (b)  the damage was due wholly to a deliberate act or omission of a third party intended to cause damage for example, sabotage by a person outside the ship; or (c) the damage was wholly caused by the negligence or wrongful act of any Government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of lights or other navigational aids.  If oil pollution damage is proved to have been due to the personal fault of the tanker owner, he will not be able to limit his liability.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, the IOPC Fund, which was set up in 1978 under the Fund Convention.  The <Col N="1100" /> IOPC Fund is a worldwide intergovernmental organisation established for the purpose of administering the regime of compensation created by the Fund Convention.  Section 20 (2) of Part III provides that the supplementary compensation available under the Fund Convention becomes payable if claimants are unable to obtain compensation under the Civil Liability Convention for one of the following reasons: (a)  where no liability arises under the CLC; (b)  where the owner is financially incapable of meeting his obligations under the CLC and his insurance is inadequate; and (c)  where the damage exceeds the liability of the shipowner under the CLC.</P>
    <P>The Fund Convention does not have to pay compensation if: (a)  pollution damage results from an act of war, etc.; (b) it cannot be proved that the damage resulted from an accident involving one or more ships; and (c) the pollution damage resulted from any wilful misconduct of the shipowner.  Tankers carring 2,000 tonnes or over of oil in bulk or cargo must carry insurance certificates showing that they have appropriate insurance cover.  As the Minister has indicated, for offences under the Bill the penalties rise from a fine not exceeding £1,000, or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both, to a fine not exceeding £1 million or imprisonment not exceeding five years or both.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the present state of the law relating to oil pollution damage is far from satisfactory.  I believe that the speedy passage of this very important Bill which will give effect to these two international conventions will go a long way towards improving the position of a claimant who seeks compensation for damage or losses suffered from oil-pollution without imposing an impossible or unreasonable burden on the shipping industry.

      <P>Before I address myself to the Bill, I would like to mention to the House that the all clear has been given to the area of pollution downstairs.  The problem with the gas leak has apparently <Col N="1101" /> been solved so anybody who wants to get back to their offices can do so now.  As I said before we will have to have a full examination into the cause of that leak and why, since there have been leaks before, there has been this recurrence.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is appropriate that he is coming to the House with a Bill as important as the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987.  Anybody who has seen the results of oil pollution cannot but welcome this Bill.  Anybody who has gone around our coastline and seen the depredation caused by oil, whether from a leaking ship out at sea or as a result of an accident in one of our bays, knows that it is about time compensation should be paid.  Unfortunately, the damage done when oil leaks from a ship cannot always be compensated for by the payment of cash because there could be an environmental problem that might never be resolved.  Anybody who has seen the damage done to birds, to our beaches, to fish and particularly shellfish, would have to welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the Bill is to allow Ireland to become party to the international conventions &mdash; the Civil Liability Convention, 1969, and the Fund Convention, 1971.  There are a few questions I would like to ask.  I would like to know how many of the countries involved in the transportation of oil have signed these international conventions?  Have all countries in which ships are registered become part of the international conventions? At times it is virtually impossible to find out who the owners of ships are.  We saw an instance of that in Country Cork last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill covers goods carried.  It covers the oil being carried but in many cases the oil is carried in ships that are not fit for the job they are supposed to be doing. Many of these ships have not been repaired up to international standards. Indeed, mention was made of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> by Senator Kennedy.  A sister ship of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> went down in the Indian Ocean some years ago and no explanation was given.  It is now thought there were structural faults in that ship <Col N="1102" /> that caused it to go down and yet the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> was allowed to sail for many years after that accident.  The carriage of the goods is covered if there is a pollution problem.  Nevertheless the dangers of spillage from some of these ships because of structural faults or bad maintenance still exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the main aim of the Bill is to ensure that oil tankers entering or leaving Irish ports have adequate insurance to cover their liability for oil pollution damage.  If a ship which is passing through Irish waters has a spill, the ship can go through Irish waters, spill going through Irish waters, leave Irish waters and may not be able to be brought into an Irish port so that claims can be made against it.  I would like to ask the Minister if there is any way ships passing through Irish waters can be proceeded against outside the State under this Bill, the Civil Liability Convention of 1969 or the Fund Convention of 1971?</P>
    <P>There is mention in the Bill of a grave natural disaster and, in the event of damage from oil pollution, owners of laden oil tankers will have strict liability for such damage except in a few cases, namely, when the damage results from an act of war or a grave natural disaster. Would a storm at sea be considered a grave natural disaster?  In the case of the ship that pulled into Country Cork as a result of a storm, would the owners be able to plead that they should not have to pay compensation because they had to pull in as a result of a grave natural disaster which was a storm of an exceptional nature?  The question I am asking is: can a storm be considered a grave natural disaster?  If this is so, there is a need to have an amendment made to this Bill.  I am not too sure that making an amendment here would have any great consequence unless storms are covered under the Civil Liability Convention, 1969, and the Fund Convention of 1971.</P>
    <P>The carriage of oil is a particularly dangerous business to be in.  Because of that it is a business which needs to be monitored extremely carefully.  Because the carriage of oil has not been as profitable <Col N="1103" /> during the past number of years as it was when oil was very dear, I suggest that there is not the same amount of money going into the maintenance of these ships as there should be.</P>
    <P>The welcome I give to the Bill is a very genuine one because it goes a long way towards showing the owners of tankers and oil companies that they cannot get away with bad maintenance of their ships or that they cannot get away with the type of pollution they have caused in the past.  I am glad the fines which can be imposed on them are quite high.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that where there is not adequate insurance cover to compensate for damage done the Fund Convention becomes liable if a claimant is unable to obtain full compensation under the Civil Liability Convention.  In cases where no liability arises under the Civil Liability Convention, the owner is financially incapable of meeting his obligations under the Civil Liability Convention, his insurance is inadequate and the damage exceeds the owner's liability under the Civil Liability Convention there is a method, other than going against the owners, if there is a higher compensation need than is covered by the owners.</P>
    <P>As I said the Minister is very welcome to the House and in particular, I welcome the bringing in of a measure of such importance as this.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the introduction of this Bill in the Seanad.  I want the Minister to explain why there has been such delay by Ireland in ratifying the two conventions which are at issue here.  The Minister in his speech introducing the Bill pointed to the especially vulnerable position of Ireland.  He pointed to that because of our proximity to major sea routes, the length of our coastline and the severity of our weather. Other contributors to this debate have pointed to the very serious damage which has been caused to our coast by oil tanker pollution.  We have suffered continuing damage, damage which is still persisting and probably has not yet been fully calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> I ask that question in all seriousness and I am not making any party political point about it.  The two conventions in question were brought into effect some time ago.  The International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage has been adopted for 18 years and the protocol to it was adopted in November 1976, 11 years ago.  Similarly, the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage was adopted in 1971, 16 years ago, and the protocol to that was adopted in November 1976, 11 years ago.  Why is is that we have been so slow &mdash; not exclusively I hasten to make clear &mdash; in this area of ratifying conventions relating to protection and insurance cover for oil pollution?  We seem to be very slow at ratifying international conventions generally, in the human rights area and in a number of other areas.  Specifically it seems to be a very pertinent question so that we can learn from our failures and our omissions in the past.  If the Minister is in a position to do so, I would be grateful if he would explain in his reply to the Second Stage debate why there has been such delay?</P>
    <P>I note in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill that the position as stated is that it is not anticipated that there would be any additional Exchequer costs incurred in implementing the Bill and it is not anticipated that there would be any staff implications for the Departments of State, State bodies and local authorities.  A potential reason for delaying ratification would be if there were substantial costs or if there were substantial staffing implications.  Apparently that is not the case with this measure.</P>
    <P>That raises another issue.  The Bill provides for the appointment by the Minister of inspectors and provides for the carrying out of certain monitoring functions under the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with the point as to how confident he is that these can be totally and adequately discharged within the present staffing allocation in the Department?  It would be necessary to reassure the House that, not withstanding the fact that there <Col N="1105" /> would be no new staffing commitments under the provisions of the Bill, the requirements as set out in particular for appointing inspectors and for monitoring the ships in question, their tonnage and that they carry the necessary insurance cover would be fully established.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like the Minister, in his reply, to deal with the position of harbour masters.  Would it be fair to say that the ports which have harbour masters will have a greater possibility of cover under this Bill than other ports?  Is the Minister satisfied that the cover will be adequate notwithstanding the absence of specific authority to a harbour master in a particular port?</P>
    <P>Like other Senators I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  We need no reminding of how urgent and necessary it is.  We have to examine and reflect on the delay on Ireland's part in ratifying these important conventions.</P>

Cé go raibh moill ar an mBille, is dócha gur fearr deireannach ná ró-dheireannach.  De réir a chéile atá muintir na tíre seo ag foghlaim gur beag eile atá chomh tábhachtach leis an timpeallacht seo in a chónaimid go léir ann agus tá an fhairrge mar chuid den timpeallacht sin.  Tuigim go maith go bhfuil rógairí an tsaoil amuigh ansin ar fhairrgí móra an domhain agus go dtarlóidh timpistí nach bhfuil leigheas againn orthu ach tá sé thar a bheith riachtanach go mbain-fear lán-úsáid anois as an gcomhacht a thabharfaidh an Bille seo dóibh siúd a bhfuil sé de chúram orthu fairrgí na hÉireann a choinneáil slán.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Lanigan i dtaobh na báid mhóra sin a bhíonn amuigh nó a bhionn le feiceáil amach ón chósta seo, againne agus a fhiafraigh den Aire an mbeidh aon chomhacht againn rud ar bith a dhéanamh futhu siúd ó thaobh scrúdú a dhéanamh orthu agus mar sin de.  Pé rud a dhéanfar amach anseo chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le <Col N="1106" /> híocaíocht de bharr truailliú, b'fhearr go mór, ar ndóigh nach dtarlódh a leithéid ar chor an bith.  Is cuma cén moladh a thugtar don Bhille, mura gcuirfear an dlí i bhfeidhm, ní bheidh san obair seo go léir ach cur amú ama.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill which I am sure will be welcomed by everybody, even those remotely interested in the environment.  It has taken us a very long time to realise the gold mine that our seas really are, although foreigners realised it years ago.  In recent times we have had the very unpleasant experience of seeing several oil spillages along our beautiful shores.  Regardless of what the financial climate is like, Ireland cannot afford disasters.  It does not matter what compensation comes our way; we cannot put a monetary value on the flora and fauna along our 2,000 miles of coastline.</P>
    <P>Not only can this country ill-afford damage to the environment; it cannot afford the kind of rescue operations carried out by the richer nations when they have a major problem.  Having said that, we perform very well in emergencies when all the stops are out.  But it would be far less expensive for us in every way if we were to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.  In other words, prevention is much cheaper than cure.</P>
    <P>For this reason, if for no other, we should pay particular attention to Part V of the Bill.  A high standard of inspection of ships and ports is of the utmost importance and it is essential that our methods of inspection are adequate.  Also we should be in a position to act very swiftly in case of emergency.</P>
    <P>What we lost after the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster cannot really be quantified and, indeed, long after the public were getting reports of a satisfactory clean-up I was receiving information about heavily polluted strips of coastline way beyond the emergency area.  The kind of operation carried out on that occasion would not, for instance, be suitable in more sensitive areas such as a valuable salt marsh or a sea lough such as Lough Inagh.  The methods used in the open sea could be very damaging to some marine habitats <Col N="1107" /> and less severe operations should be prepared in case of an emergency in any of those areas.</P>
    <P>In making claims for compensation we should not forget that many voluntary organisations spent hours upon hours working on these cleaning up exercises for which they received no money whatsoever. Although we cannot quantify the environmental damage caused as a result of a tanker spilling oil, if we pick just one bird species as an example it might give us some idea of the overall effect which this kind of situation can have on our wildlife.</P>
    <P>When the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> broke up at least 2,000 guillemots died as a result of the oil spillage.  How does one put a value in pounds or pence on a guillemot, razorbill or a gannet, not to mention the fish, the plants and all the other marine life found along a stretch of coastline?  It is worth mentioning this in order to emphasise how terribly important it is for us to do all in our power to try to prevent any such disasters happening in the future. Whatever about accidents, we cannot excuse carelessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question but that the public are now more acutely aware of the quality of their environment than has been the case heretofore.  This applies not only in Ireland but in many other countries including those of our EC partners.  It is worthy of note that the Single European Act in its references to the environment underlines the urgency of tackling environmental problems and it also underlines the need for information and access to information on various environmental problems including the problem of oil pollution.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on moving so quickly in introducing this important Bill.  After all, the Minister and his Government are in office less than eight months.  The Bill fills a serious gap in our legislative arrangements in that there will now be legal requirements covering liability and compensation for oil pollution damage from oil tankers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Echoing Senator de Buitléar, one of <Col N="1108" /> our great natural assets is our coastline which because of our geographical location is near many major sea routes. The beauty of the coastline is for the most part, though regrettably not in all cases, characterised or added to by pollution free waters.  These provide a great natural amenity not alone for our own citizens but for our tourists.  Tourism is one of our key industries and we must make every effort to preserve and develop our amenities.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us addresses the problem of reducing the threat of major oil spills, thereby removing our reliance on the voluntary international schemes for compensation for oil pollution from tankers. The Bill gets to grips with that vexed issue by ensuring that, where oil damage is proved to have been due to the personal fault of the tanker owner, he will not be able to limit his liability.  Furthermore, in section 12 where a court has decided that a ship owner is liable for oil pollution damage, the court at its discretion may order the payment in court of the amount of the owner's liability.  More than that in section 13 the Bill makes provision that the owner of an offending ship can have any other ship which he owns in the State detained.</P>
    <P>A recent reminder, and a serious one at that, of the risk to our coastal waters was represented by oil spillage from tankers. In the case of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster serious though it was &mdash; and I regret that Senator de Buitléar has found evidence that there is still some damage resulting from that disaster &mdash; it is only fair to put on record the splendid work done under the leadership of the Minister and his Department in tackling the problem of cleaning up as far as possible the 300 tonnes of heavy crude oil that escaped form the wreck of the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i> With characteristic initiative and energy the Minister tackled the oil spillage problem by having a survey conducted on the scope of the problem.</P>
    <P>Full credit is due to the divers from the Cork area who conducted the survey, backed up by UK consultants, and assisted in the continuation of the clean up job.  The Cork divers deserve our <Col N="1109" /> thanks for the skill and courage they demonstrated in that operation.  The benefits of modern technology were also evident in the case of the clean up in that the most modern technology was applied to the task by Irish people with back up from experts in the salvage area from Holland.</P>
    <P>I touched on the EC a moment ago and I would like also to refer to the fact that the EC have established a task force to deal with major pollution incidents at sea.  This was announced in September by the EC Commission in the wake of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster and is, therefore, of considerable importance to Ireland and to other EC member states.  The issue was raised by Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, a member of the European Parliament and in reply to a question he posed the European Commission took the opportunity to reveal its new plans. The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster was debated in the European Parliament as far back as last December and a resolution calling for EC action was adopted.</P>
    <P>This EC task force comprises several dozens of specialists from different member states.  Their services can be requested and supplied within minutes of news of an incident reaching the Commission. The establishment of the task force, the Commission believes, will give the Community the capacity to react promptly and efficiently.  This is an important initiative for Ireland as well as the other EC countries.  I now commend Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, MEP, for his initiative in pursuing this matter at European level.</P>
    <P>Turning specifically to the Bill and to domestic legislation, the Bill before us will greatly help to prevent a repetition of disasters like the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  The Bill, though in this instance limited in scope to reducing the threat of major oil spills from tankers, represents an important step in bringing our outdated maritime legislation into the 20th century. This legislative area has been neglected. There is no question about that.  The <Col N="1110" /> speed with which the Minister has introduced this Bill augurs well for further legislation from his Department.  Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, could give us an indication of his intention to update among other things the Merchant Shipping Acts so that our maritime law will match the realities of the eighties and beyond.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to congratulate the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, my fellow Clareman, on his excellent work in that Department to date and to link with that the Minister of State Deputy P. Gallagher.  They have set a fast pace in reform in the area of marine affairs.  I wish them both every success in the challenging years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the Minister to the House and the speed with which he has introduced the Bill.  It is long overdue and should have been introduced some years ago. We should not have waited for a disaster such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> to bring the problem of this type of damage to our environment to a head.  Like the previous speakers, I congratulate both Ministers on the way they handled the incident involving the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  Prior to that there was an incident in west Kerry which was our first spillage, a serious spillage off the coast of Ireland.  At that time the nettle should have been grasped and something should have been done about the pollution of our environment. That disaster caused untold damage to the countries of Kerry, Clare and Cork. The seepage from that tanker off west Kerry was around for a considerable time.  The mop up and dry up operation carried out by the local authorities in Cork, Kerry and Clare cost an enormous amount of money.  No local authority had made provision in their Estimates for a clean up operation such as that.  That is one of the reasons I welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance policies of companies entering and leaving ports or entering our waters and the viability of those policies must be questioned.  How are we to know that these companies have proper insurances entering and leaving our <Col N="1111" /> ports?  Is there a special type of insurance policy that will have to be shown to the inspector or the Department of the Marine?  Considerable amounts of moneys have been spent on our tourism, particularly on our western seaboard.  An amount of damage was done to Cork and Kerry as a result of the two oil spillages. Not alone did it interfere with the tourist industry and the people in business in those areas, but it also interefered with our local people for whom we provide these amenities.  Those people must be protected also.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator de Buitléar speak on the wildlife aspect because, as a wildlife man myself, I saw at first hand the amount of damage done to the various species of wildlife off the west coast of Ireland.  As well as that considerable damage has been caused to our breeding grounds, our fishing stock and our herring grounds in those areas.  I would like to know who is responsible for the removal of wrecks from our shores in the event of ships coming onshore due to storms and so forth.  Is it the local authority in the area, or is it the Department of the Environment? Will the new Insurance Bill that is going through the Dáil make money available to remove the eyesores from our shores?  As well as that I would like to know &mdash; perhaps it happens to all ships that come to our shores &mdash; when ships come in with a load of oil they clean out their tanks a few miles off our shore.  Is that aspect covered by this Bill or is there a limited mileage around our shores where this pollution could be prevented? I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in complimenting the Minister of State on introducing this Bill in the Seanad.  It is easy for me to do that.  It is right and proper to recognise the importance of the Bill.  I am sure I do not have to tell the Minister the serious consequences of pollution for our western seaboard and, indeed, the whole country.  The overall dangers of oil pollution to this island cannot be overstated and cannot <Col N="1112" /> be over-emphasised.  The introduction of the Bill is important.  It is more important to have good policing and to have some method of identifying polluters than it is to have good legislation.  If you have good legislation you must also have detection. Depending on Greenpeace or outside agencies to forewarn us of danger is not right.</P>
      <P>The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that no additional Exchequer costs will be incurred in implementing this Bill when it is enacted.</P>
      <P>I hope we can police the new measures now being introduced.  It is nice to see the penalties on paper.  The offender is a risk taker, a man who has a vessel with which he takes risks.  He uses a &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; tanker or a leaking tanker.  There is some deficiency in the vessel he is using. Tragedies happen with tankers as they do with other vehicles.  If the vehicle is overloaded, or if it is run without a proper service you are looking for trouble.</P>
      <P>It has been proven beyond doubt that there are tanker owners who neglect maintenance and who run tankers that are at high risk.  I am concerned as to how we can bridge the gap between having good legislation and implementing it effectively.  I totally support the proposal that we must be part of an international organisation to take effective action.  We should also have our own detection system, that is important.</P>
      <P>At present, some local authorities are obliged to keep detergents in stock.  I question the effectiveness of this, the cost and how efficient we will be if we are ever called on to use those detergents to dispel or disperse oil spills.  Whether we are talking about the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> or other tragedies, we are not forewarned.  It is not a planned visit to our ports that will cause us a problem.  When there is a problem with a boat the captain puts in to the nearest port he can reach.  We have many ports and coves around our shore where they seek shelter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, so great is the problem that it is nearly impossible to police it.  I would welcome a statement from the Minister <Col N="1113" /> of State that we have the resources to detect &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; tankers coming into our ports in times of storm.  There are two stages: No. 1 is the detection of the problem; and No. 2 is the clearing up of the pollution after it happens.  Perhaps No. 3 is compensation for damage afterwards. There is no point in codding ourselves that we are big enough to have all the resources.  We need an international organisation contributed to substantially by the people who are making a profit in oil.  We must have the ability to detect a pollution problem before it happens. That will be our greatest safeguard.  It is fitting that the Bill was introduced in this House and I join with other Senators in welcoming it.  My deepest concern is our ability to implement it and to police it after it is enacted.</P>

Molaim go mór na Seanadóiri as ucht an méid a bhí le rá acu.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed here today.  It is very gratifying to note the welcome which this Bill has received in this House.  I also thank Senators for indicating that they want to give this Bill a speedy passage through this House and hopefully it will have a speedy passage through the Dáil in order that we have this Bill enacted at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the countries that had signed the Bill and all of those who have become part of the convention on international standards.  If ships passing through our waters, not necessarily arriving at or leaving this country, have an oil spillage we are covered by this Bill.  In regard to the words &ldquo;grave national disaster&rdquo; in the Bill we are compelled to have the exact wording of the conventions and the protocols. We feel that the wording is <Col N="1114" /> adequate.  References have been made by a number of Senators to a &ldquo;grave natural disaster&rdquo;.  At the end of the day that will be a matter for the courts to interpret.  An example is the hurricane we had last year.  It does not necessarily mean that would be covered but it is an example out of time, out of season, with no forewarning.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the Civil Liability Convention 1969, the Fund Convention 1971 and the 1976 Protocols. The Civil Liability Convention 1969 goes back some 18 years and the Fund Convention 1971 goes back 16 years.  The 1976 Protocols go back some 11 years. Since they were not adding any cost to the Exchequer the Senator asked why the Bill was not introduced before? Obviously we are the first Government since that time to take this problem seriously.  The Department of the Marine was set up by this Government.  We now have a specific responsibility for this.  We have taken the initiative and have introduced this Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987. I hope it will be enacted very soon.  I do not want that to sound like a facetious answer, but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to Exchequer costs as did Senator McGowan.  It is anticipated that no additional Exchequer costs will be incurred in implementing this Bill when it is enacted.  It is also anticipated that there will be no staff implications for Departments, State, State bodies and local authorities.  I am quite satisfied that there will be no additional Exchequer costs.  As anticipated there will be a number of officials responsible for the inspections: officials appointed by the Minister, existing harbour masters, existing sea fishery officers and all of those will take on board this extra duty to ensure that there is ample cover.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also referred to the question of harbour masters and asked if harbour masters were in some ports would they be in a better position to detect a problem as against smaller ports. The simple answer is that most of the oil coming in to many of the ports will be <Col N="1115" /> coming into the larger ports but it does not necessarily follow that if a port does not have a harbour master it has got a problem.  The Bill provides for harbour masters, inspectors appointed by the Minister, surveyors, sea fishery protection officers.  All of these will have a part to play and whether it is in an area where there is a harbour master or otherwise, I do not think that will be detrimental to any area that does not have a harbour master.</P>
    <P>Since the conventions of 1969 and 1971 the Government accepted in principle the duties and liabilities of both conventions subject to legislation being introduced.  I accept that it has taken a long time but thankfully it is before this House now and hopefully will be enacted very soon.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan refered to the number of countries which are covered.  All the main shipping nations have acceded to the conventions except the USA which does not, in fact, operate a fleet in our area.  The US is more likely to be a member of the voluntary schemes.  While it was not obligatory to pay and to contribute towards the schemes, practically all of those involved in shipping did.  It was in their interests to make contributions to ensure that they had cover. One question was not asked but I think I should refer to it: will this result in dearer oil prices as as a result of the introduction of this Bill?  I believe that, because most of the carriers involved contributed voluntarily, it will not add in any way to the Exchequer costs.</P>
    <P>Senator de Buitléar is more knowledgeable than any of us about wildlife and the preservation of our natural amenities. Tá a fhios agam go maith chomh tábhachtach is atá an fhairrge thart ar an oileán seo agus ceapaim féin go gcuideoidh an Bille seo leis an fhairrge agus leis an timpeallacht a choinneáil glan.  Chomh maith leis sin, beidh árachas ar fáil chun cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh siúd a gcaillfeadh dá mbeadh spillage mar seo ann.</P>
    <P>I also appreciate the point made by Senator de Buitléar that it is impossible to quantify.  I do not think any of us can suggest that we can quantify the loss as a <Col N="1116" /> result of spillage in relation to our wildlife and our environment.  These losses could have a knock-on effect for many decades if they had an effect on our breeding grounds, as referred to by Senator Kiely. It is difficult to quantify but having this insurance will certainly assist us in resolving the problems.</P>
    <P>I take the many points made by Senator Hillery and thank him for references to the job carried out by all of those involved in the clean up after the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster.  The officials in my Department and all of those concerned with the environment and defence, all the voluntary bodies and the local authorities did an excellent job in ensuring that the clean up job was completed very quickly.  We realised the extent of the disaster and the effects which it could have if we did not take the initiatives which we took on assuming power in March of this year. He also made reference to the Community and to one of its members.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank the EC Commission who helped with technical assistance in the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> case which was very much appreciated by all of us and, indeed, helped financially with the clean up operation. It is important to state at this point that a claim has been lodged and we are optimistic that we will be successful in securing a substantial amount of money as a result.  The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987, does not cover a <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> situation.  I do not think it is necessary but we had better put it on record that this covers vessels carrying oil as cargo, not vessels carrying another type of cargo and carrying oil as fuel.</P>
    <P>The Merchant Shipping Bill which is in the pipeline at present will introduce stronger measures to be taken in a <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> situation.  We have in preparation a sea pollution Bill.  I was asked by one Senator to indicate the further Bills which are to be introduced.  That is an anti-pollution measure which is to be taken and relates to all ships as a preventative measure.  Work has begun on consolidating and updating the Merchant Shipping Acts.  This is a major undertaking <Col N="1117" /> and is very high on the priority list of my Department and, indeed, the priority list of the Government.</P>
    <P>While Senator Kiely referred to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> he also referred to the <i>Ranga</i> which went on the rocks off Dún an Oir four years ago.  That was a matter for the local authorities and I have not got information available to me now in relation to the claim made at that time.</P>
    <P>The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster was dealt with under the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977.  The question of coverage in relation to the pumping out of the bilge of a boat would not be covered under this Bill.  That is covered under the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977.  To allay any fears in relation to the pumping out of the bilge and the effect it could have on the environment and breeding stock, that is covered under the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to the additional Exchequer cost incurred.  As I stated earlier in my reply, I do not believe there will be any as inspections will be carried out by the harbour masters, the protection staff and officers to be appointed and given responsibility by the Minister.  Senator McGowan referred to the question of penalties and cover.  We feel that the two levels of penalties in the Bill are adequate.  However, if we find at any stage in the future that they are not, we are always open to suggestions and will have another look at them.</P>
    <P>The question was raised whether we could have the resources to detect defective tankers coming into our ports.  If the hulls are not properly maintained the owners will not be able to get the required insurance.  In other words, insurance companies carry out inspections each year and no insurance company would cover defective boats.  We are talking about cover of up to £12 million per boat or £116 per tonne, whichever is the lesser. I am satisfied that every step will be taken to ensure that there will be no defects in the hull or any other part of the boat.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered the many valid points raised by Senators.  I appreciate the interest expressed by Senators and <Col N="1118" /> the welcome given to the introduction of this Bill.  As I said at the outset, one of the main reasons for introducing this Bill so expeditiously is that the Minister and I were extremely conscious of the vulnerability of the coastline to the threat of oil pollution, particularly from oil tankers. Ireland is perhaps more vulnerable than any other country.  I am pleased that a Fianna Fáil Government introduced this Bill.  Unfortunately, it was not introduced at an earlier stage.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 34, subsection (7), lines 47 and 48, to delete &ldquo;which is not a recognised bank.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason I put down this amendment is that I am not convinced of the Minister's need to make an exception in the case of banks or associated banks.  If the Minister can give me an assurance that this does not leave any loopholes in the Bill I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.  I would like to know the precise position and the thinking behind this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Senator's amendment some thought.  I am aware of the arguments the Senator could make but I am not convinced about them at this stage.  I take the view that, in general, a director should not regard his company as his own personal bank.  I said so in so many words on Second Stage and the Minister for Industry and Commerce also made that point.  When dealing with banks we have to be a bit more realistic <Col N="1120" /> as a bank is in the business of lending money.  That is why a special regime is needed in this legislation which is covered in Part III of the Bill.  In my view there is nothing wrong with the banks lending money to their directors or companies which they control provided such arrangements are not open to abuse whether by means of ridiculously low interest rates or any other unduly favourable terms.  We specifically covered these matters in the Bill.  These safeguards are provided in section 32 of the Bill.  Section 32 (7) (a) and (b) provides, for example, that such loans or quasi loans can only be made on a normal commercial basis. There is no question of loans being made below the commercial rate.</P>
      <P>Provided these conditions are met, we are safeguarding against abuse in this area by banks or their directors.  I do not see any objection to allowing the banks to lend without limit in the light of these safeguards.  We are recognising that a bank's business is lending money.  We are saying it is perfectly acceptable for a bank to lend money to one of its directors or, indeed, to a company which he or she controls as it would to any other person of the same financial standing but unconnected with the bank, provided there were no special deals or soft loans for the bank director in question.  I want to stress that as long as there were no special deals or no soft loans, it would not make sense to exclude money being loaned to bank directors because it is the bank's business to lend money, provided that the same rate of interest is charged and that the whole thing is at arms length.  There are special procedures in the legislation for disclosure in regard to the whole business of loans.  Senators can be assured that there are safeguards in the Bill which will make sure that there are no special deals or soft loans.</P>

      <P>This is a formal amendment which is intended to rectify an inadvertent error in the Bill.  Section 32 (8) elaborates on the conditions specified in subsection 7 (b) and not 6 (b) as stated in the Bill in relation to loans to directors which money lending companies, including banks, are allowed to make up to an aggregate of £50,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to section 32 (5) (c). I have been told by a number of business friends that the import of subsection (5) (c) in conjunction with subsection (6) (a) and (b) is that this could cause a situation where all expenses incurred by directors would need to be approved by the shareholders of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my friends who move in these circles, this could mean that the marketing manager of a major Irish company like Waterford Glass, or Irish Distillers, or whatever, would be required to explain to a meeting of shareholders whom he had entertained on various trips to the United States, or Europe, and so forth, and how much he had spent on those trips.  They feel this is unreasonable in a very competitive climate, as most companies will have their own built-in safeguards in this respect.  The bigger companies involved in this type of activity <Col N="1122" /> would have their own fairly rigid accounting procedures and would be operating in that particular framework.</P>
    <P>I may misunderstand the Bill, but certainly this point has also been made by the Consultative Council of Accountancy Bodies who also feel that the directors may incur significant expenditure when marketing products abroad on behalf of the company and this could impose detailed rules on directors while ignoring other significant costs.  On the face of it, it seems to be a fairly draconian measure and I would like the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has raised a very interesting point which has also been made to me.  There are two options for such a person.  The first option is to get the prior approval of the shareholders. The second is dealt with in subsection (6)(b) which means that, provided the loan is paid back within six months of the AGM, prior approval would not be necessary.  In practice that could give a person 12 months if the loan was paid back half way through the year. The intention is to ensure that it is short term and not a long term thing that remains on the balance sheet.  The intention is to make sure that if someone has expenses arising out of their job as a marketing director they can, in fact, be put up for that person and provided they are cleared off within six months of the AGM of the company prior approval is not needed.</P>
      <P>The point has been put that the six month period is too short.  It seems to us to be a practical enough section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously this point of view has been expressed to the the Minister in the course of the past few months by people in business.  Does the Minister feel he has satisfied the particular point? On a point of clarification, are we talking about something over and above the normal expenses which a marketing manager or official of a company may incur in the promotion of his or her job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. <Col N="1123" /> It depends on how it is undertaken.  If a bulk sum is made available to a director in such circumstances that makes it a type of loan, these conditions very much apply to it.  It is not meant to catch the ordinary day to day expenses of the average director but in circumstances where a lump sum is up front to carry a person through the months ahead, as it were, what we are trying to avoid is loans being called by another name in that, if a director is given £10,000 or £20,000 as future expenses, that is not just another way of getting around a loan provision.  We are trying to make sure that does not happen. It is to avoid some creativity on the part of accountants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not fully happy with this section.  The Minister began to spell out the purposes of this section in his last contribution.  I am not sure whether the Minister is fully happy in his own mind that it is not unduly rigorous or cumbersome to go back to a board of directors.  The major companies will undoubtedly have their own fairly rigorous internal accounting procedures and these companies do not have any particular interest in making themselves liable to abuse of the law or whatever.  I certainly would not ask for an answer just now but I wonder if the procedure is not over-cumbersome and may have the effect of hindering people who are operating in a competitive environment that little bit more than is necessary &mdash; using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is reading me correctly.  I am uneasy about certain aspects of it.  I will have a very close look at it between now and Report Stage. I want to make it clear that in circumstances where we are saying loans cannot be made &mdash; and that is a major section of the Bill &mdash; it would not make sense if we were to allow them by a different name whereby the managing director could say to the marketing director: &ldquo;Look, loans are forbidden as you know, so instead of that I will give you £7,000 or £8,000 and let us call it an <Col N="1124" /> advance on your expenses and that will get around the legislation.&rdquo;  There is no point in legislating against loans if we allow them to be called something else.</P>
      <P>I do not want to interfere with the efficiency of business and I do not want to lay down bureaucratic rules for business either, so from that point of view I will see if we can find a niftier way of doing the same thing.  Very often it is not that easy because the most likely way to get around the loan provision would be to do precisely that, which is to say to an individual: &ldquo;We will advance you expenses.&rdquo; Putting six months on it still allows that to happen.  If a person is going abroad on a business trip and they have to get a £7,000 or £8,000 advance for the trip, we are covered there because that would come back within a six month period obviously.  It is six months of the AGM, so it could give the person up to 12 months to pay it back.  It really is an anti-avoidance measure as much as anything else.  I will take a very close look at it.  I will take on board the Senator's view that it might inhibit the free flow of business. I do not want to do that but I do not want to make meaningless all the sections we have already written up on the forbidding of loans by allowing a loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very open mind on this as well.  I can see certain difficulties at the AGM of a company, where all the shareholders are entitled to attend. Somebody who is travelling abroad may very well incur very substantial expenses and they may well be in the form of a loan.  This may be the subject of uninformed questioning at an AGM.  I just wonder if there might be some way in the normal audited accounts of the company this sort of expenditure could be shown without the need to go to an AGM as indicated in the Bill.  I will not push it any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is paid back, there is no need to go to the AGM.  The idea is that it should be paid back within six months of the end of an AGM which means that you could have up to 12 <Col N="1125" /> months to pay it back if the advance is made at a strategic time.  Anything after that is really a loan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is section 32.  It limits the amount of a loan to a director to £2,500.  I spoke on this last week and I think it is a little bit restrictive.  I believe that it should be linked to the net asset value of a company or maybe to say 10 per cent of the paid up share capital of a company because as it stands at the moment, as I read it, it would appear that a company with, say, two £1 shares paid up, could actually take a loan of £2,500 from that company and in these times of very difficult trading, where you have to trade with companies where you can get business, even though the loan is £2,500, in some instances it may be £2,500 too much.  In other instances, it may be £10,000 too little.  Perhaps before the Bill is finalised, the Minister would look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We received a number of suggestions from the Members of the other House and the business community, all suggesting to us that the figure of £2,500 might be too low.  We are looking at that.  I would be interested in Senators' views as we go through the Bill as to their reasoning for that because it seemed to us to be a sensible figure.  The Senator suggested linking up net assets and so on.  Ideally that is the way we should do it, or link it to turnover, because £2,500 to a big company is different from £2,500 to a small company, but with the bureaucratic system you would set up you would be into a mini-audit on every situation and the amount of policing in that would just bog it all down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be simpler to pick a figure and stick with it.  Then it is clean cut and above board.  I appreciate that makes life <Col N="1126" /> difficult perhaps for smaller companies over bigger companies.  Bigger companies would want a higher figure.  I think it is better to leave it at a definite figure in the legislation than to get into the business of trying to police what could turn out to be thousands of companies. We are having a think about the actual figure and that is something we will talk about as we go through the Bill.  I want to point out also that the Minister can change the figure in the Bill under section 43.  The Minister can actually change the amount in the Bill at any time by order if he feels it is the wrong figure.  We will think about the £2,500 as we go through the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>

      <P>The discussion over the past few minutes has outlined the difficulties the Department had in drafting this Bill and it is not something that one would wish on anybody.  Looking at it purely from a lay person's point of view, I would tend to feel that £2,500 is a low figure.  I would be speaking from the other point of view.  It is a low figure and perhaps the case made by Senator Mulroy is right.  At the same time, in many companies it would be too high a figure.  As a global figure it seems low to me in terms of comparing it with the cost of things, just on that basis.  I certainly would not have a difficulty about increasing that amount, with perhaps some kind of fail safe clause.</P>
      <P>I also accept that you cannot relate it to something like turnover or some figure within the company because it is not going to be available, and it would be an unfair condition to build into it.  I accept that.  But could there be some kind of fail safe clause, that somebody within the company would have to recommend.  I am not sure how it could be done.  I dislike putting forward suggestions that I cannot follow through but my gut feeling would be that £2,500 seems a bit low in that case.</P>

It is something which we should not do today but if the House is in agreement I will have a very close look at.  I am now of a mind to increase that to a more realistic figure and I will have a look at how we might build in a safety value.  That is not going to be that easy.  If we decide £2,500 is too low, we should just come up with another figure and put it in there and allow the same safeguards to apply.</P>

However, we do not think it is clear enough that the reference in line 21 which is, and I quote, &ldquo;subsection (2)&rdquo; is, in fact, to subsection (2) of the main section 33 rather than of section 32.  Amendment No. 19 simply makes the meaning clearer. We are just trying to make it clear that the reference in line 21 is actually to subsection (2) of section 33.

It obviously has to be precise and legal but if a message could go to the draftsman that language which reasonably intelligent people &mdash; the bald headed man in the back of the Clapham Omnibus &mdash; could understand, it would help our discussion of this enormously.

      <P>Section 33 overall is laying down rules for determing whether a particular transaction falls within some of the exemptions in section 32.  Section 32 lays down a number of exemptions to this whole business of loans.  Section 33 then lays down technical rules for deciding whether a particular transaction is within those exceptions or not within those exceptions.  That is the simplest way I can try to explain it whether the <Col N="1129" /> technical drafting actually does that is one for the Senators to decide.</P>
      <P>I am reasonably happy that in drawing up rules as to what is and what is not an exception, the draftsmen tells me it is necessary to couch it in this kind of language to make sure that the thing is not got around.  To an extent we have taken their view.</P>

Also guilty of an offence will be a person who procures a company to enter into any such transaction or arrangement knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the company would thereby contravene the provision involved and the penalties for this are outlined in section 184.  It <Col N="1130" /> deals with the criminal liability for contravention of the items that are prohibited in section 31.  Section 31 lays down a number of areas that are prohibited and section 35 then deals with the criminal liability for that.</P>
      <P>Section 184 is on page 141 and it deals with the penalties, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000, or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both.  That is really the intention of section 35.</P>

In one of the later sections I will be referring to the fact that I regret that on the responsibility of directors in a section further on it has not been given further scope.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has been prepared for the purpose of completeness. Section 36(1), as Senators can see, provides for disclosure requirements in a holding company's accounts in relation to loans by such a company to its directors while section 36(2) provides for such requirements in the case of loans to such directors by a company other than a holding company.  There is a gap, however, in that while the disclosure requirements for an individual company <Col N="1131" /> require among other things, disclosure of a loan made to a director of the company's holding company, section 36(1) does not do this in the case of a holding company's holding company.  By way of example, a holding company in a group can often merely be an intermediate parent and can itself have a further holding company.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed here would extend the requirements in section 36 (1) so as to require that a transaction between a director of a holding company, on the one hand, and that holding company's own holding company in turn, on the other hand, must also be disclosed. It is going further back up the chain. Senators will be aware of the complexity of company structures these days when very few companies have not at least one or two holding companies back up the tube.  We had not gone far enough back the tube in the original drafting and we are now doing that.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this.  It is absolutely crucial.  To put it into context, what is happening at the moment with companies changing names or changing premises and continuing to trade could actually be done by a sophisticated holding company structure.  If this change had not been made in the legislation you could still have people setting up holding companies rather than different companies and moving back up and operating on the basis where they might be untouchable.  It is critical that these links in the chain are included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 39 sets out special disclosure arrangements for banks by virtue of section 36(6).  The detailed disclosure we are requiring in this case of loans to directors of normal companies will not apply to banks.  For banks the more limited requirement will be to disclose the total amount lent, the number of directors involved, and so on. However, to offset this less wide ranging regime for disclosure in the case of banks, section 39 sets out some further special arrangements for banks.  The first of them in section 39(1) requires the banks to keep a register containing copies of all loans, quasi-loans and other relevant agreements for a period of ten years from the date of the loan and so on.  It has been represented to me that the period of ten years proposed is unduly onerous and this amendment will reduce the period involved to five years.  I think that is a practical amendment in this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten years is a far more reasonable period than five years.  I disagree with a point the Minister has just made.  It is not more onerous to keep it <Col N="1134" /> for ten years rather than five years.  The transaction has to be noted.  What we are saying here in this Bill is that after five years you can burn it.  The original drafting which required the bank to keep a copy of any transactions with its directors coming under this section for ten years is far more fail safe from our point of view. I will put it this way to the Minister.  Many a loan would not be paid back within five years.  Five years would be a normal repayment for any kind of loan.  You are really in many cases asking people to keep a record of it for a further couple of years after that.  It seems that five years is a very short period of time.  It is particularly short in relation to the amount of time it takes, say, the Fraud Squad of the Garda or some other crowd to investigate the workings of a company.</P>
      <P>In the past five or six years attempts have been made to work out internal loans and movement of finance between holding companies within a group.  This was impossible to do.  I recall one infamous case of a very large company which went bust in connection with the construction industry.  I remember the best known receiver in Ireland saying, when the Fraud Squad were called in: &ldquo;If the best firm of accountants in this city could not get to the bottom of it in two years, good luck to the Fraud Squad.&rdquo;  It seems that the time period we are talking about here is quite reasonable.  We are not asking them to do something extra.  That is why the argument about its being more onerous does not stand up.  We are just saying: &ldquo;Hold on to your records for another couple of years.&rdquo;  The records are not very heavy.  It is not as if we are talking about large files.  We are just talking about something quite small because the number of directors in a bank is not going to be large, and the number of transactions involved is not going to be very large.  I am not convinced at all by the argument that we need to change this from ten years to five years.  I would like to hear more on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with what Senator O'Toole has said.  I think the Minister did not really make the case for <Col N="1135" /> reducing it to five years.  He said it was felt that five years would be more in accordance with current practices, procedures, and so forth.  Senator O'Toole has made a fairly compelling case.  The extra problems for those concerned from the five to ten years would not be sufficiently onerous to merit change.  We are talking about confidence coming from this Bill, confidence that all the proper procedures will be followed.  We have seen how matters can be frustrated, held up and hidden for four, five, six, seven or eight years.  I would like the Minister to think a little bit more about this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that if the banks are exempt in the loans areas and they just keep the register rather than make the same disclosures as everyone else in the preceding section, I cannot see why they should continue to get exemptions and concessions.  Therefore, what is relevant in trying to get hold of people in an earlier section should be applied where you have made an exception to the banks.  The banks have been exempt on the question of loans except for the keeping of a register.  If we are really trying to make sure that everyone complies with the law we should tie up the loopholes. Ten years is the period in which to do it in and not five.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies there is one example I want to give which I would like the Minister to consider.  I am not sure if I can refer to the best known bank in the smallest State in Europe, which is ensconced in the middle of a capital city of a Mediterranean country &mdash; I am talking about the Vatican bank.  The investigations into the death of a director of that company have now continued for four years and they still have not got to the bottom of it.  If under this kind of legislation the books could be closed in a year's time, or in less than that, and frustrate an investigation that would be totally wrong.  That is a case in point.  The financial structures are so complicated it can take a long period of time to find out what exactly <Col N="1136" /> has been happening and where exactly money is.</P>
      <P>If, for instance, this was done through a system of loans or money transferred to holding companies in different States and back again, in other words to launder it through a series of holding companies, it could well take a couple of years before somebody would smell a rat and it would take a couple of more years before it was fully investigated.  I think the Calvi example is a perfect one of how international finance can put down the shutters and make it almost impossible to get the bottom of things.  It is in everybody's interest to keep it as open as possible. That is an example of where we might need ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it depends on how you come at this Bill, by and large. On the one hand one could come at this Bill from the point of view of directors in general not being of good intent and therefore assume that everything might go wrong and try to catch everything that might go wrong.  That is one way to come at it &mdash; to assume that most directors want to do the wrong things.  The other way to come at it is to assume that directors, by and large, want to do the right thing and in that context not to place too onerous a burden on business.</P>
      <P>I want to stress, from an overview of this Bill which is very important, that I am particularly keen that we catch the cowboys in this Bill.  I am also determined that in this Bill we do not further stifle small business and business in general that we are desperately trying to get off the ground.  Every time I look at a section of this Bill I have to remind myself that that is precisely what we want to achieve at the end of the day &mdash; to prevent the crooks and the cowboys but at the same time to ensure that people who genuinely want to run their business properly have nothing to fear from the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also do not want to get them into the business of form filling.  The small firms association and the exporters' associations and all the associations I deal with continually lay before me the thousands <Col N="1137" /> and thousands of bits of paper the State throws at them every year.  As a general philosophy I am trying to reduce the onus on particularly small companies in dealing with the State, not increase the amount of bureaucracy and burden laid on them.  That is a general philosophic point which I know Senators would agree with.  Having said that, I am taken with the points made.  Perhaps the volume might not be that great.  I will agree to withdraw the amendment and let it stand at ten years.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of the Bill provides that a bank has to make available at not less than 15 days notice transactions it has entered into for inspection by the members of the company.  Is 15 days not a rather short time?  Normally people go on holidays for 15 days and that could be the period people are away. I note it says not less than 15 days but certainly that would be interpreted as 15 days, would not less than 30 days or more be more suitable so as to give people an opportunity to examine the books of the company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel strongly about that, but 15 days is a pretty normal time to allow for the inspection.  Overall section 39(2) provides that the bank or its holding company must, before its AGM, <Col N="1138" /> make available for inspection by shareholders, a statement containing the particulars of transactions, arrangements and agreements which but for the fact that they are exempt from doing so, the banks would be required to disclose it in its annual accounts.  The statement must, in addition, also be made available for inspection by the shareholders at the AGM itself.  However, unlike the Companies Register provided for in subsection (1), the details which have to be disclosed before that AGM are those which the bank would be required to disclose only with respect to the last complete financial year preceding the meeting, that is, not the preceding ten financial years as in subsection (1).</P>
      <P>This subsection is also subject to subsection 40 which means that any relevant transactions, arrangements and agreements which do not exceed £1,000 in value for any one person can be ignored. I take the point made by the Senator.  I think 15 days would be about the right figure.</P>

      <P>Section 47 substitutes a new section 195 in the 1963 Act and has to do with the particulars to be contained in the Companies Register of Directors and Secretaries.  As regards directors, subsection (2) would currently require particulars to be kept in the case of each director of any other directorships of companies registered in Ireland.  Such information is obviously useful for anyone who is trying to establish a director's track record and the track record of any other companies that he or she may have been involved in.  It has been suggested to us that those who are interested in establishing such a track record would find it useful if the Companies Register of Directors also contained information about offshore companies with which a particular director was associated.  This is the intention behind the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the argument put forward but I have some difficulties. I am not speaking against the amendment.  I support the idea of the amendment but I am unclear about a number of things.  First of all &mdash; perhaps it is somewhere else in the Bill and I missed it in my reading of it &mdash; concerning particulars required under section 47, including this one concerning companies or holding companies or whatever incorporated outside the State &mdash; on whom is the onus to provide that information? This information must be kept.</P>
      <P>Is it specified somewhere else in the Bill who, in fact, has to give the information? Are there penalties on a director for not disclosing that information?  I remember reading in some section that there was a requirement on directors to provide certain information but I just want to be re-assured.  First of all, on whom is the onus to get the information? On whom is the onus to provide it?  Secondly, how can we look at the area of those companies incorporated offshore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also raise another point on that? We are now in the European Community <Col N="1140" /> and in this Bill we have talked about keeping lists of directors, etc.  I am wondering is there scope here for a pan-European or a Euro agreement where there would be a transfer of information on the directorships of companies?  Given the type of international co-operation there is in other areas, the areas of law, of customs and various other places, it seems that it would be something we might look at, that our Companies Office might have access to information from other Companies Offices.  Perhaps the Minister could respond to that particular point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of who is responsible, the legislation puts the responsibility on the company to get this information and maintain it on its register and to supply it to the Companies Office. The onus is being laid on the company as an incorporated body.  With regard to its extension elsewhere to offshore companies &mdash; that is clearly the intention. While I am reasonably sure that it can be policed, I must confess that I am not certain because while it is legally required to get the information whether one gets it or not is obviously another day's work.</P>
      <P>I am happy about what this section does.  It is very important when dealing with directors that you can establish their track record with other companies.  That is what the legislation says.  What we are trying to do here is to extend that to companies of which they may be directors outside the State.  I am satisfied they would actually get that information.  I have to get information with regard to the EC situation.  I do not have that at my finger tips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not clear about a particular point.  The Minister made it clear that the onus is on the company to provide the information.  I accept that.  Take a particular situation where a company needs to be investigated. I also take the point that most company directors do not tend towards evil.  In a sense trying to legislate always for the exceptions probably makes bad legislation.  At the same time, I want to <Col N="1141" /> understand the position where I am a company director and an investigation of my company shows that the information which I have on a particular director is not complete.  In other words, it has now come to light that this person is a director of another company which we were not aware of.  I have now, as company secretary, not supplied the information required.  It was not my fault that I did not do it, I attempted to find it, but I was not given the information.  Under the legislation, the Minister said that the company is in breach of legislation at that point.  What I want to know is, who do we move against and how do we move against them in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could consider bringing in amendments to put the onus on each director to supply the information.  I wonder if it is necessary to be that specific about it?  What we are saying to each company is that you need to get this information from any director. Implied in that clearly is that the company should not take on board any director if they are not satisfied they have got the full information.  We have to put the onus on somebody and we felt that in putting the onus on the actual company before they would take any director on board they would make sure they had got all the information required about that director.  You could argue that further tightening is necessary and put an additional onus on the director.  That, in some way, might take the pressure off the company.  In the end, it is important that the legal entity of the company in putting together a board of directors should be obliged before they take any director on board to satisfy themselves that they have the information which this particular legislation would require.</P>

      <P>I agree completely with the point of view the Minister is putting across.  I agree with the amendment and I agree with what is being attempted in this case.  I am worried about the situation where we are perhaps actually building in a loophole here.  The company wants to do its best, is acting <Col N="1142" /> honourably and has been frustrated by one dishonest director.  I cannot frame a particular amendment here because I do not want to make the Bill cumbersome. Perhaps there is a loophole here and the Minister could examine that point.  I do not know what is the answer.  I believe it is right to put the onus on the company to provide the information.  That has to be done.  I agree with that but it seems it would be unfair to hold the company responsible for the dishonesty of an individual over whom they did not have control. It seems there is something contradictory there.  It would be difficult for a company to find themselves in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look at that. Again, the major argument is that if we lay it on each individual would be director to come forward with all this information, do we go beyond that delicate stage to where we are discouraging people from becoming directors of anything?  That is a point I want to be very careful about. If some one comes up to you and says; &ldquo;Would you like to be a director of a company?  Here are the following 45 sheets; would you fill them in and send them back?&rdquo;  You might say; &ldquo;I will be a consultant or something; I am not going to be a director because I cannot just get into that.&rdquo;  We might just overdo it a little bit.  The 1963 Act always laid the onus on the company.  If the company have the legal responsibility of getting and supplying the information then we are being a bit more sensitive about discouraging directors.  There is a view which I get from business at the moment that it is increasingly difficult to get people who are legitimate business people to come forward and take on the onus of being a company director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is increasing evidence of people supporting companies in other ways, becoming a consultant to a company, because the directorship is too onerous. That is very much a bit of business practice I have seen.  If you make it overonerous on the individual director as opposed to the company, I think that would be the result.  It is a matter of <Col N="1143" /> judgment.  There is the risk of making it increasingly unattractive.  By laying this section on the actual director you might be just up-front scaring off people whom you actually need to do a job in running the company.  It is not a country that is coming down with directors who are ready to step forward to put their names in and take on all these onerous duties which we are proposing.  The balance is probably just about right, particularly given our need to get more companies up and running.</P>
    <P>Some might see it as a stress to any would-be director listening anywhere. We want directors in this country to come forward: we want them to establish businesses. Well-meaning, honest directors have nothing to fear from this legislation. It is not a witch hunt against directors.  It is to enable us to weed out the cowboys. I have to say that at every possible opportunity. This is simply saying to the company through its company secretary the Companies Registration Office needs the following information on all your directors. I think for the moment that is enough.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister very much.  This hits the balance.  It is more or less right in this section.  It is a fairly delicate one and there are, in fact, later sections in the Bill dealing with directors where I think the Bill itself does the very thing the Minister is arguing against.  I will leave that until we come to these sections later.  The Minister has got it right in this one.</P>

      <P>I also agree with what the Minister and Senator Manning have said.  The last thing I want to do is to tie down companies especially small companies with tiers of bureaucracy and forms to be filled.  I know in dealings with Departments how difficult it is to get through all the paper work.  I certainly do not wish that on anyone.  Perhaps the Minister might take away the idea and come back and assure us that somebody who was guilty of not disclosing relevant information would be covered as is done <Col N="1144" /> in other sections.  I want to be assured that somebody who does not give clear information to the company is in some sense wrong or guilty or could be held to be wrong or guilty.  This could well be done without changing this section at all. In the sections which deal with disclosure of information it could be implied that failure to provide relevant information would be an offence and that relevant information would be the type of information which we seek to put together in section 47.</P>

      <P>I shall certainly think about it.  I have listened very carefully, but I am very concerned about the balance of the legislation.  It is a major concern of mine in this whole legislation to ensure that we continue to get people setting up businesses and becoming directors. I am genuinely worried that people may take a view of this Bill that it says, whatever else you do in business from now on, do not be a director.  Be everything else, be a consultant, be an adviser, be a non-executive director, be a chairman, be in attendance at the board, be all those things but do not be a director. I really want to make sure that that message does not get out.  For that reason I will think very much about what the Senator said but I am not disposed at this stage to go along with it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 46, subsection (3)(a), line 6, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This really is just a repeat of the arguments which I made some minutes back on the question of keeping records in the bank.  This section requires the company to maintain on record a list of directorships held by each of its directors for the preceding period of time.  The preceding period of time mentioned here is five years.  I am saying it is too short a period.  I think it is too short a period because of the experiences we are having <Col N="1145" /> of the length of time that it takes to investigate the affairs of a company.  This is not something that puts an extra onus on the company.  All we are saying to them is that they do not have to burn those records for another five years.  We are not saying to them they have to do something extra each year.  We are just telling them to hold on to the records.</P>
    <P>I take it that there is no statute of limitations on this legislation here, that it can be followed back.  If that is the case then it strengthens my argument for having the information for some longer period.  It does not include further form filling.  It is important to say that.  It does not put any extra work on the company director, or the company secretary or anybody else.  It is just a matter of holding on to the records.  Neither does it make life more difficult for the Companies Office or for the Department.  All it means really is that a list, a sheet of paper in effect, is held for some time longer than is stated in the Bill.  I am not asking a lot and in all honesty I do not believe it is putting any extra work on the company; it is not putting any extra work on the Department and it could be very useful for the investigation of companies particularly when we know the kind of synergy companies have and the way they can interweave with holding companies, with companies incorporated offshore and the length of time it takes to carry out the investigation.  I recall that one of our judges was sent out earlier this year to investigate the movement of moneys in particular banks through Europe and Central America and I think she spent something like two months out there and still has not got to the bottom of the matter, even with access to all relevant experts and experienced people.</P>
    <P>We are talking of long periods of time here.  I would like to feel that information could not be destroyed.  It is one of the most important things in terms of investigation and in the guarding of rights and privileges <i>et cetera</i> that information would not be deliberately destroyed. What we are saying here really is that after five years you can take it out and burn it.  What I am saying is just leave it <Col N="1146" /> there in the company; just maintain the records, hold on to them for a longer period of time.  It is not any more difficult, surely, than holding the annual report of the company for a period of time.  It is certainly not much more onerous than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to consider what the implications are &mdash; as I read it, it says &ldquo;particulars of any other directorships of bodies corporate incorporated in the State held by him or which have been held by him shall be kept on record for a period of five years&rdquo;.  A particular person could have been involved in a number of companies that have failed, failed for legitimate reasons.  It is a bit unfair.  As the Minister said earlier we want to encourage people to become directors of companies.  If a director has been involved in, say, three companies that have failed for legitimate reasons in years one to five and this information has to be entered into the register of a new company that he is being appointed to, that would be unfair.  Certainly it would act as a deterrent to directors becoming involved in new companies.  I believe that five years is adequate.  We do not want to put any additional obstacles in the way of attracting directors to companies.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I accept the point Senator Mulroy is making.  I am not making the case here in terms of a hit list as it were.  I will be talking about that later on in terms of the Companies Office legislation on another day.  It is not intended here that people, because they happen to be in a company that has failed should be in any way excluded.  We are only saying that when a director joins a company certain information is made available.  As I understand it &mdash; and the Minister can respond to it &mdash; it does not have to be public information; it is information that is just there, not for the general public, I presume it is information that has to be available if an investigation should take place.  It does not have to be published information, as far as I know.  When a director joins a company I think this <Col N="1147" /> information is kept there.  Information has to be put together anyway.</P>
      <P>It may well be as Senator Mulroy says that a person joining a company today should not need to give information about where he or she was more than five years ago.  I accept that argument.  I am going a bit further.  I am talking about somebody who joins today with a particular amount of information and this information is put on the records.  Let us say it only goes back five years, I feel that that information should be kept for another five years which I know is a slightly different point.  I accept Senator Mulroy's argument on the point he made.</P>

      <P>The five-year information, of course, will be kept.  There is no question about that and it will also be with the Companies Office.  My problem is going to ten years.  I have no objection to laying the extra five years on the banks because of the few transactions and the large resources, but in this case my real worry is the transition arrangement, not so much the overall principle.  There are over 100,000 companies in Ireland.  I would worry about laying it on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete subsection (9) of section 47, the inclusion of which in the section is incorrect.  It was first inserted <Col N="1148" /> into section 195 of the 1963 Act by way of an amendment to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982 but there was specific reason for its inclusion at that time.  The 1982 Act introduced new requirements for notifying the Companies Office about a company's first directors.  Such first directors from 1982 onwards now have to be notified to the Companies Registration Office before incorporation of the company.  Therefore, the present subsection (9) of this Bill was in effect a transitional provision for the purposes of the 1982 Act only and as such is now redundant.  We should omit it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could explain to Senators that because of the complexity of this Bill we are trying to get it right.  We have a lot of work done up to section 47.  We are ready with that. We have dozens of submissions for the next sections of the Bill.  We are wading through those and should be ready to come back to the Seanad in a short time, perhaps two or three weeks &mdash; sooner if we possibly can.  We will try to arrange it with the Whips.  I want the House to understand that that is the reason for the <Col N="1150" /> delay.  We are not organised yet with the taking on board of submissions: we will be in about two or three weeks.</P>

What I suggest as regards the matter of work on this Bill which is a very intense Bill, is that we do not have very, very long sessions on it but try to get through it quickly without huge chunks of time spent on it, so that we can get it right.  Of course there is a small number of people participating in the debate.</P>

      <P>I agree totally.  It is worth while taking this Bill in groups of sections because it allows one time to study those up and it is only on short-term memory anyway.  It is very useful. Without being patronising, I am very impressed by the procedure.  It is my greatest involvement in legislation since I was elected and I feel the Minister has done everything possible to listen to the arguments being put forward and has accepted and rejected as he deemed wise. It is a model on how legislation should work.  Whatever agreements or disagreements I may have with him &mdash; and there will be many &mdash; it is important that inputs to legislation are taken seriously and I do believe the Minister has done this.  I would like to think here today that we have done more than certain parties which do not recognise this House have done in their history.</P>
