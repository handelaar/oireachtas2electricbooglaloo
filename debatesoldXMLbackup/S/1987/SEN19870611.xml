      <P>I have notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>That building would commence on the new primary school at St. Paul's, Lisduggan, Waterford.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The necessity for the Minister for Health, in view of the grave hardship being imposed on the community, to enter into immediate negotiations directly with the junior hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have to disallow Senator Joe O'Toole's matter as it is repetitious of last night's debate on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about a matter raised on the Order of Business yesterday morning, Senator Joe Doyle's point regarding the division bells.  A meeting of the Committe on Procedure and Privileges was held yesterday afternoon at which a directive was given to the OPW <Col N="932" /> to install the said bells in 88 and 89 Merrion Square before next Wednesday, 17 June.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  If Item No. 1 is not concluded by 12.30 p.m. we will adjourn the debate in order to take Item No. 2 from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.  We hope to come back to Item No. 1 at 2 p.m. to try to complete it by 3 p.m., and then to conclude on the motion.  The Department of Agriculture are anxious to get this Bill passed as soon as possible and that is why I am trying to fit it in today.</P>

      <P>Motion No. 30, in the names of myself, Senator Ferris and Senator Harte, concerns an omission from the Local Government Act whereby employees of local authorities can lose part of their pension and part of their lump sums.  At present the local authorities are negotiating with the unions and this matter would have a bearing on it.  This is an urgent matter and I ask the Government Whip when is it likely that we can take this motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting Senator O'Shea on this item I would like the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss when the Labour Members of this House may have a motion in our names discussed.  We have a motion on the Order Paper but unfortunately because of all the other problems of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we have not had an opportunity to raise the matter.  Although we are not a group as such, because we do not have sufficient numbers, I would like a formal structure set up.  On fair play alone, we should get some opportunity of having our motions discussed.  I ask the Government Whip to remember that when the roles were reversed we always had a procedure where the Government of the day did their own business but the Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and Independent Members were always treated in rotation <Col N="933" /> to give everybody an opportunity of having a motion which could be subscribed to by other Members.</P>
      <P>I formally put it on the record that I request the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider giving the Labour Members of the House an opportunity to allow their motions to be discussed in Private Members' time.  Many of these are relevant, such as the one mentioned by Senator O'Shea, a matter which is coming up currently in some local authorities because of a lack of funding by the Department and which creates problems for the employees, their unions and the county managers.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senators Ferris and O'Shea, we certainly will not cut them out.  They will get their turn. However, it will not be exactly the same as it was in the past.  It is all right to say that everybody was dealt with fairly the last time &mdash; which they were &mdash; but everyone entitled to put down motions had a group here.  You must have five Members to have a group.  I feel it would be wrong to exclude the Labour Party simply because they have only three Members in this House.  Definitely we will try to accommodate them but they would not be entitled to the same time as Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Independents who have much larger numbers.  The next motion coming up has been put down by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We may consider giving the Labour Party the next one.</P>

      <Col N="934" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>When we reported progress when last we were discussing this Bill, I said how important the advisory and education services are to the agriculture industry.  We have a long way to go to compete with our EC partners. Some of our EC partners produce four or five times as much milk per hectare as we do in Ireland.  The average income of our farming community is the lowest in Europe.  It is most important that whatever money these charges accumulate be put back into education and the advisory services.  People do not like to be charged, but with the present financial constraints it is impossible not to do so. There is a danger &mdash; and I see from the Minister's opening address that it was expressed in the Dáil &mdash; that these charges might make it prohibitive for farmers who could not afford the advisory services to avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that there will be full consultation between the Department and ACOT, prior to the introduction of any charges, on the level and the criteria to be used in the formulation of charges and that the Minister's approval is ultimately necessary for the making of charges.  The Bill provides adequate safeguards and the overall interest of the agricultural sector will be fully taken into account when the fees which ACOT may charge are being determined.  It is very important that farmers' circumstances be taken into account.  I know some farmers will be in a position to pay and they should pay, but there are farmers who, although very anxious to avail of the services, may not be able to afford them.  This should be taken into consideration and I have no doubt the Minister will take it into account.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will improve our farming position and improve the advisory services and educational facilities for farmers, especially <Col N="935" /> young farmers.  This is all very important for the future of the farming industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to open my remarks by stating that the Bill is very vague on the amount to be collected in charges for agricultural advice.  I assume this year the amount to be collected will be £1 million because a provision has been made in the Government's budget to raise £1 million in charges from this sector.  No indication is given in the budget or in the Bill of how this £1 million is to be collected.</P>
      <P>The Bill, when it becomes law, will give ACOT the right to charge for services or advice to farmers.  The Government, through the Department of Agriculture, will decide on how the money is to be raised, and &ldquo;how&rdquo; is the crucial word here.  There are grave dangers in the methods of implementation.  Apart from training and education, ACOT spent £13.38 million on advisory work.  The main areas of advisory work include the category one service to the middle band of farmers, the campaigns, scheme work, responding to farmers' requests for advice and services, farm business and service groups and activities.  The State spends almost £13.38 million on this development work.</P>
      <P>ACOT will now be asked to earn £1 million from farmer requests for advice and services and will, therefore, get £12.38 million from the Government for development work.  In my opinion the amount of time ACOT spend on development work should reflect the contribution from the Government for this work.  The Government in return for the money spent on development work want, as stated in their programme, more suckling cows, more ewes, more forestry, a better environment, fewer farmers depending on the State, the servicing of Government schemes and the production of quality products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do farmers want?  From my knowledge of working and mixing with farmers I believe farmers would prefer one agency or one person to advise on the range of problems facing them rather <Col N="936" /> than a multiplicity of advice from different centres.  The modern farmer wants advice on subjects, ranging from insurance, taxation, farm accounts, advice on transfers of property to will settlements, etc.  Therefore, the traditional role of the adviser advising on animal and crop husbandry, manure, lime, sprays, grassland management etc., is changing because we now have better educated farmers and that type of advice is available in the co-ops and even in the local creamery store.</P>
    <P>How will the £1 million be raised?  Will each region be asked or expected to bring in a <i>pro rata</i> income?  If that happens it will put extreme pressure on areas such as the west.  If £13.38 million was allotted for the advisory service in the agricultural budget £12.38 million will come from the agricultural grant and £1 million from farm charges.  If each region has to raise a certain amount, the pressure will be on the adviser to collect that amount.  In other words, he may have to devote a lot of his time and energy to meeting his target &mdash; within the paying sector of farmers, whoever they may be when the Bill becomes law.  Or will the adviser have discretion in the matter?  Will he have discretion to use his incentive to charge what he considers a reasonable amount for a visit or advice?  These matters are crucial to the proper working of the scheme for the benefit of all farmers and the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that relatively more of the ACOT advisory budget is spent on the grants scheme and development work generally in the west, the less favoured areas, than in the east or south.  Charging for services will result in a limited number of high income farmers benefiting most from the ACOT services.  They will benefit from the £12.38 million provided by the taxpayers while contributing only £1 million which, in turn, in the case of those type of farmers, can be claimed back as an expense for tax purposes, probably reducing the real income from what is planned to about £.65 million.  That is another crucial point which has been overlooked in the Bill.  The £12.38 million <Col N="937" /> must continue to be spent on development work, the benefit of which accrues to society at large as well as to a broad spectrum of individual farmers.  This benefit takes the form of increased exports and increased activities in other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>The following or similar criteria should be used when setting income targets for charging for services in the district, county, or region, or whatever way it is broken down.  There are 28,000 farmers above the £10,000 annual income level and about one quarter of those are in the 12 western or under-developed areas. Roughly half the country's farmers are in that region, but only one quarter, approximately 7,000, have an income of over £10,000 annually.  It should also be broken down into the number of farmers with a milk quota or number threshhold, for example, a 25,000 gallon quota, or 30 dairy cows, or above 50 livestock units of dry stock.</P>
    <P>The relative demands by the Government work and ACOT work in response to farmer requests for advice and services in the district county or region should also be taken into account when breaking down the figure of £12.38 million. Adequate statistics are available in global form to estimate the numbers involved and the costs can be apportioned between the development work and responding to farmer requests for advice and services, whether it be in the district, country or region.  Income targets from charges can, therefore, be arrived at globally.  Procedures for charging for services can then be implemented flexibly without having to assess individual farmer's incomes or go through the complicated procedure of counting stock, etc.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there should be flexibility on how the targets should be met.  The Bill should exempt some categories of farmers from these charges to ensure that they will continue to receive proper advice, especially in the west where farms are run on a family farm basis.</P>
    <P>ACOT were set up in 1979 and came into operation in 1980.  Prior to that the <Col N="938" /> county committees of agriculture and the General Council of the County Councils of Agriculture, both bodies on which I had the privilege to serve, were responsible for the provision of services to farmers. There is no doubt that State spending on agriculture is costly &mdash; a total budget of about £28 million, excluding education. A remarkable statistic is the cost of the Department's involvement in research and advice.</P>
    <P>According to the comprehensive public expenditure programme, a total of 223 of the staff of the Department of Agriculture are engaged on duties directly attributable to this State programme. The total cost in the 1986 Estimate was £3.49 million in pay and £447,000 in non-pay elements.  In recent years in some areas of the Department of Agriculture, the expenditure on staffing was not reduced when work loads were reduced.  The crucial question is: why there should be over 220 staff in the Department soley administering advice, research and education?  It is like the current cutbacks in health boards.  All the cuts seem to be at the nursing and hospital level with little cutback at administrative level.  Surely, when the State set up ACOT and the Agricultural Institute to provide research and advice, they should be the only administrators of these services within certain budgets.  Why have we the ridiculous situation of administrators administrating the administrators? This adds considerably to the cost and uses a great deal more than the £1 million, or in real terms after tax savings, the £0.65 million proposed to be raised in charges.</P>
    <P>This year ACOT and the Agricultural Institute have suffered major financial cutbacks.  There is no evidence available that the administrative section has suffered the same cutbacks or any cutbacks. In fact, the opposite may be the case, as the revised Estimate for the Public Service forecasts a 5 per cent increase in 1987 for Department of Agricultural salaries, wages, and allowances.  Another major cause of alarm is the cutback in the agricultural education grant.  A young farmer now attending an agricultural college <Col N="939" /> pays a fee of between £700 and £1,200 for a one year course while his or her counterpart attending an AnCO training course pays no fee at all.  This may have serious repercussions for farmers in the future as any boy or girl entering farming, and born after 1 January 1968 will have to have a certificate in farming to qualify for a farm grants scheme.  In other words, agricultural education is a compulsory matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I ask the Minister, before he decides on how he will raise the £1 million, to have a serious look at the administrative side of this budget to see where savings can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my constituency colleague, Deputy Kirk, and wish him well in his new portfolio as Minister with responsibility for horticulture. The Minister has clearly identified an area of import substitution in which this country can produce and export produce to Europe.  Horticulture is perfectly suited to the Irish soil and climate and played a more important role in the past supplying our needs than it does today.  There is natural public resentment at having to rely so much for a great part of the year on imported apples, potatoes, celery and so on.  I am confident that Irish consumers would like to see much greater self sufficiency and would buy Irish without hesitation providing that the quality was good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is virtually identical to the Bill introduced by the previous Administration. I do not think anybody is anxious to see provision being made for the imposition of new charges.  Nevertheless, there is almost general agreement that those who benefit directly from a valuable but costly service should be expected to make a contribution towards paying for that service.  Undoubtedly the provision and maintenance of a nationwide on-farm service, staffed by highly trained professionals, is expensive.  I understand that ACOT's budget is now approximately £28 million, 80 per cent of which is acquired from public funds.  As the Minister mentioned, ACOT provide <Col N="940" /> agricultural services to around 70,000 farmers.  Therefore, it is obvious that there is a growing awareness on the part of farmers of the value of professional advice in planning and developing their enterprises.  This trend must be encouraged. The Minister has already indicated that charges for ACOT services will be reasonable.  I am convinced that these will not deter the progressive farmer from seeking ACOT advice when required.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's assurance that there will be full consultation between his Department and ACOT prior to the introduction of any charges and that account will be taken of the position of farmers who have a low income or who are in financial difficulty. I understand that the Bill will include a complete update of the ACOT advisory service.  This is necessary because farming is our primary industry and the whole structure of our economy is dependent on its growth and development.  I have every confidence in the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, and his Ministers of State giving the necessary leadership to continue and develop the agricultural industry which is so vitally important to Ireland.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in my comments on this Bill.  Enough has been said about the state of agriculture over the past two days.  When the Bill was being discussed and the state of the nation I wondered whether I was looking at the same Bill as other Senators.  Last week the Minister kept his comments to a minimum. Judging by the length of the Bill, it is not too meaty.</P>
      <P>Farmers are worried about the enactment of this Bill because they see minimum charges being imposed to collect £1 million.  Like all levies on any sector of the community, people who are being asked to pay always wonder what increase will come next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For far too long ACOT instructors were under utilised because farmers did not take too kindly to some of the advice being offered.  They saw many of the <Col N="941" /> instructors as academic farmers who knew very little about practical farming and were unwilling to take much of their advice seriously.  We are fortunate that their attitude changed significantly over the past decade in particular.  As a result our agricultural production increased significantly and more important, it increased in the areas in which it was needed most, in the smaller farms, farms in the more disadvantaged areas and in other areas where up to now agricultural production was at a minimum.  Undoubtedly, the increase in production was due to the work of the ACOT instructors who got their act together very well, and made it clear to the farmers that they knew what they were speaking about.  They spoke the language of the farmers and organised various courses.  Far from being seen as in any way elitist or academic, they became the friend of the farmer and accordingly were utilised very much, or at least more than they had been down through the years.</P>
    <P>Following completion of all that good work we have a Bill before us today &mdash; admittedly with an amount of money being invested in ACOT &mdash; asking farmers to contribute £1 million.  This may not be too great a demand on them. However, we worry about where that £1 million will come from and the fact that it may prevent some people from availing of ACOT services.  If that happens it will be regrettable because, undoubtedly, those who stop using the service will be those who need it most, those whose level of production at the moment does not allow them a sufficient income from farming. The only way to increase their income is to increase production on their farm and increase the number of farming options available to them.  You can only do that by giving them advice.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will not end up in a vicious circle, stopping people paying for the service, decreasing their income, and not giving the good advice which is so necessary for them.  Discretion is allowed under the Bill and it will be up to the ACOT officials to decide where and what level of charges to impose.  Many of the more specialised farmers have actually <Col N="942" /> moved away from ACOT into the area of special advisers in agencies which were set up by people who saw their opportunity. The ordinary ACOT advisers should be down to earth and available to ordinary people.  A certain percentage of farmers have become so advanced that they see very little benefit to be gained from the ordinary advice being offered by ACOT and they have taken advantage of what is called the commercial advice which is available at present.  As a consequence, people who can best afford to pay for ACOT services under the new Bill, who are obviously the better off and the more developed farmers, will not stay with ACOT.  Many of them have moved into the area of commercial advisers.  I hope this Bill will not stop the remainder of the big farmers availing of the ACOT service.  If that happens, the smaller farmers and the middle income group farmers will be left to pay the bill for ACOT services and that would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  The powers of the committees of agriculture have more or less disappeared over the past seven or eight years.  For example, ten years ago the budget of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture was £500,000. Last year it was down to about £50,000. Our powers are at a very minimal level. The budget is so strict that members attending meetings do not get travelling expenses.  It is a credit to the members that they are still attending in great numbers and it shows their commitment to agriculture.  The committees of agriculture discuss agriculture on a very down to earth, local basis.  I do not intend to be critical of the Department's officials &mdash; two of whom are here &mdash; but in the Department of Agriculture we need a down to earth level of involvement.  The committees of agriculture provide the necessary level of involvement and on numerous occasions we have spoken about this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill was first proposed by the Coalition Government.  At that stage the committees of agriculture were concerned <Col N="943" /> not so about the fact that £1 million was being sought &mdash; because you cannot put up much of an argument about that &mdash; but who it would come from and what the £1 million would become next year and the year after.  Now the roles are reversed.  A new Government have been elected and I am glad to say that our committee of agriculture have not changed their mind or their concern about the Bill.  At our second last meeting, five weeks ago, another motion was passed and sent to the Department expressing concern and asking for the scheme to be withdrawn, which I presume it will not be.  I read in the Minister's speech last year that the cost of the ACOT services is £28 million per annum. In any figure of that size there must be room for saving.  I admit that the £28 million provides a great return to the economy.  If every £28 million invested in every industry brought the same return as this £28 million invested in agriculture, training and advice, there would be no need for any of the cutbacks that are taking place today.</P>
    <P>As a person who availed of some ACOT services, namely, the educational courses and the green certificate in farming, I have some practical knowledge of the type of service being offered by ACOT to farmers today.  I admit that the service is top class.  Young farmers in particular over the past couple of months have been struck a few severe blows by, for example, the removal of the installation aid.  Installaion aid this year cost a minimal amount of money.  I think it was £500,000.  I know that each year that amount of money would have increased and would have become a substantial figure over the next couple of years.  The scheme was an investment in the future. Certain funds were available from the EC and the Government had to match them pound for pound.  That caused problems for the Department of Finance in present circumstances.  I would like to put on record my disappointment at the removal of this scheme.  Those hit by its removal are young farmers.  They will also be hit by the charges being levied by ACOT <Col N="944" /> because young farmers are far more inclined to take the advice of ACOT.  The number of farm visits to young farmers was much greater than the number of farm visits to their parents down through the years.</P>
    <P>During the debate last week some Senators asked if this Bill applied only to people in the non-disadvantaged areas. Once again they were making their plea for the poor farmers of the disadvantaged areas.  Five or six years ago if farmers in my county were told they were to be classified as qualifying for a disadvantaged areas scheme they would have considered it an insult.  It is seen now by the general body of farmers that the disadvantaged areas scheme allowed major benefits to flow to the farmers within those areas.  There is much clamouring left, right and centre from farmers to join the disadvantaged areas scheme. There are many applications before the Government at present and very little appears to be happening about them.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions of this Bill, if implemented, will not differeniate between the advantaged and disadvantaged areas.  So far as I can see the disadvantaged area farmers have the major advantages because of the various grants available.  Those who are outside the scheme are facing the greater difficulties. If, or indeed when, the scheme is introduced the Minister should ensure that it applies both to the disadvantaged and advantaged areas in order that they will not be split further apart.</P>
    <P>There is, unfortunately, still within Irish agriculture a two tiered system.  I am not speaking about the advantaged and disadvantaged areas but about the big farmer and the middle and the small income group farmer who can be classified together.  Farming organisations are far removed from the body of opinion expressed by small and medium sized farmers.  The land tax issue was a classic example.  When you have to canvass for any election you get a very good idea of what the majority of people are thinking. The majority of farmers, as far as I could see, were than willing to pay and, indeed, were hopeful that the land tax would <Col N="945" /> come in.  If you were to judge by the comments of the farming organisations you would get the impression that 90 per cent of the farmers were totally against it.  I am deviating now from the ACOT Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not see the bigger farmers removing themselves from the ACOT service and leaving the smaller farmers and the medium income groups farmers with ACOT.  ACOT might react by trying to offer more specialised services which would remove the ordinary ACOT services from the people who need them most &mdash; the medium and the small sized farmers.  If ACOT try to react too much to those who are questioning the value of their services and the need for many of the educational courses which are becoming available, and if ACOT try to provide the type of consultancy services available, there is a grave danger that they will move away from the ordinary down to earth approach of the vast majority of our farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will bring farming people to their senses and let them see that everything is not free and everything cannot be provided free.  Agriculture has been hit strongly over the past ten or 12 years by people who say farmers will pay for nothing.  Any proposal which may take money from a farmer, or any levy, will be opposed most vehemently and any excuse will be found for resisting every proposal.  Some people will say our concern about the Bill is more of the same and more of the syndrome of farmers not being willing to pay for anything.  In fairness, that is not true.  There have been very few references to the doubling of the disease levy charges which occurred in recent months.  It is rarely referred to in the newspapers.  Neither do we hear about the levies on milk, the co-op levies, the EC levies which farmers have to pay. I often wonder about communications between the farming organisations.  It is a pity to see such divisiveness in society at present.  It is up to each farmer to state his case better and to show that he is paying for the services he is availing of.</P>
    <P>The Bill will contribute in some way to the cost of the available services.  While <Col N="946" /> farmers will not be grievously hurt by having to pay the £1 million, they will not be too happy about it because their concern will be for increases in charges in the years ahead.  A subsection states that the Minister may vary as from such date the charges which will be levied. That is what everybody is worried about. We do not expect the charges to vary downwards.  It is only natural that they will increase as the cost of the service increases.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, while the service is relatively costly, it is very good value for money and it has served farmers well over the past number of years.  Accordingly it has served the economy very well.  I do not want to say I am opposed to the Bill because I have to admit it was my party who introduced it.  We are supporting it although some Government members are concerned about what will happen in the future.  As a result of the Bill, I hope farmers, instead of running away from charges and services, will see the possibility of making a service they pay for more relevant to themselves and use it more.  If they see the £1 million which they are putting into the ACOT services as an investment in the future of ACOT and an investment in their own future, it will be well worthwhile.  The benefits in the Bill will, I hope, accrue to the farming population in general and to the economy over the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to avail of this opportunity to extend my good wishes to the Minister. Deputy Kirk, in his new post.  It is the first time I have had an opportunity to address him in this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to say much on the Bill other than that I am supporting it.  It is a recognition of the need for farmers as a unit in society to pay their share. Every sector of society must contribute to the general well being of the country and the well being of their own industry. We hope this Bill will provide a worthy ACOT service for farmers.  The kind of general <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude which existed in agricultural advisory services over the past ten or 15 years was no help <Col N="947" /> to the industry.  The Minister intends to levy a charge for these services.  People in the industry will be aware that when they decide to avail of the services of an adviser or, indeed, to avail of the advisory services generally, they will have to pay for them.  They will treat the service in a serious way.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that they will be reciprocating in the sense that the quality of the service will be as good if not better than that afforded to farmers in the past.  This is important because obviously there has to be a little give and take.  If farmers are expected to pay they will expect the quality of the service to reflect the type of financial input they have made.  We are aware, of course, that the contributions will not pay for the service.</P>
    <P>Like health charges, or anything else, once people have to pay they expect the service they are paying for to be worthy of the industry in which they are involved. That assurance given here today by the Minister is important.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford made a few valid points on the public perception of the importance of farmers' contributions to any service in the future.  For too long there has been a feeling abroad, particularly among urban dwellers, that farmers would not subscribe and objected vehemently to subscribing to any service of which they were availing.  There was some degree of validity in that observation in the past.  This is an indication here today that farmers will be paying for some of the services and this will offset to some degree the comments made by certain prominent trade unionists and others that farmers are not prepared to pay.  I represent a reasonably large agricultural constituency and I am not aware of anybody in the farming community who is vehemently opposed to the levying of these charges as long as they remain reasonable.</P>
    <P>The kind of charges currently being framed would not fall into the unreasonable category.  It is an indication by farmers that they are prepared to pay their fair share.  Once the service is up and <Col N="948" /> running and the charges levied, it will contribute to redressing this imbalance and divide that appears to be developing in urban and rural communities.  If that rift were allowed to continue it would be tragic, because there are very few people living in the urban areas who are generations off the land.  It is unfair and unwise of many media and public commentators generally to continue to contribute to the widening of this chasm that appears to exist between urban and rural communities at present.  Farmers do not object to paying their fair share irrespective of whether it is taxation or the levying of charges.  This Bill will go a long way, at least as an intermediate step, towards ensuring that farmers will in future be paying for these services.</P>
    <P>The importance of the service to the farmers cannot be highlighted enough. During the election campaign practically all the major parties highlighted the need to upgrade the agricultural industry. They tried to make it a little leaner and in better fighting shape to take on the kind of confrontation we are encountering from the Danes and the Dutch and other competing agricultural nations in the EC markets.  The only way we can do that is to have an advisory service worthy of the industry.  I accept entirely the Minister's commitments here today that that service will be of a quality that will, if availed of, bring farmers into the kind of conditions that would make them viable into the next century.  That is basically what this service is all about.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that, once the service is up and running I believe there will not be any great resistance from farmers.  They are concerned because it is a service they did not have to pay for in the past.  For anybody who has to fork up for something he had free in the past, it is a little painful in the beginning.  I accept that.  Generally, farmers who are serious about their business are prepared to pay.  The assurances given by the Minister in relation to the level of the charges and the fact that he is prepared to consider having escape clauses for people who are pleading <Col N="949" /> inability to pay and so on are welcome.  I would in a general way welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which was introduced in the term of the last Government and is being followed on by the present Government.  I have listened with interest to the debate both here and in the other House.  I wish I could share the optimism that has been running generally through the debate because I do not feel it will be the success that many speakers on both sides of the political scene have indicated.  Some Senators on this side of the House might feel that, since it was introduced by our Government, they would have to support it. Even when it was introduced by the Government, which I wholeheartedly supported during the last term, I was not enthusiastic about it because, quite honestly, I would like to put on the record of this House that I would forecast it as a failure.  I believe it will fail.  Agriculture has been referred to down the years, during my lifetime and long beforehand, as the backbone of the nation, our principal industry, one to which we should have paid greater attention in the past. There were lost opportunities because we had not brought into farming the technology that was becoming available in our lifetime.</P>
      <P>The services of the county committees of agriculture throughout the country have been underrated in many respects. Some people may say they have been abused; but, no matter what service is available, naturally you will have some abuse.  But I believe they have adequately and superbly paid for the efforts, time and money put into them over the years. This will bring a fundamental change in our chief industry.  Our advisers will be put in a new role.  They will now be seen as tax collectors; and, no matter what you call the charge, it will still be seen by the farmer as an additional tax he has to pay.  My fear is that fewer farmers will avail of the service in the future, and I believe that in the long run we will lose millions of pounds instead of gathering in £1 million from the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that it was costing £28 million for the total service &mdash; £23 <Col N="950" /> million from both central and local Government, the other £5 million, so far as I know, coming from the EC grants. The service was provided for 70,000 farmers, 29,000 of them according to the Minister &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is correct &mdash; with an intensive service and with almost 170,000 farm visits at a cost of £7 million.  We are talking about the expenditure of £7 million on the service of our main industry and we are asking that £1 million of that £7 million be recouped. If this were to happen in industry there would be an outcry.  It is happening in the farming industry and it has been tossed around for so long that people may be inclined to slide over it.  But I would like to put on the record of this House my forecast that, whatever Government bring it in, we will in the future regret it. My reason for saying that is that we will not save £1 million; we will lose far more money, because many farmers particularly at this time, are finding that to stay in business, to educate their children, to provide for their families they must diversify.</P>
    <P>I am not too worried about the 29,000 farmers.  I am not too clear whether the 170,000 farm visits were to the 29,000 farmers or to the 70,000 farmers.  I do not think it was too clear from what the Minister said; at least, it was not too clear in the way I read it.  That is only a minor matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen the Minister go further and categorise the 41,000 farmers who are using the service because the 29,000 can obtain a service anyway in the commercial area.  They do not have to come to ACOT.  Very many of them may turn to the commercial area where there is ample advice available, for payment, of course.  Many of the 29,000 farmers may feel that they may get a better service outside of ACOT.  No doubt they will have a look at it depending on what the charge will be.  There has been absolutely no indication from the Minister as to what the charge might be.</P>
    <P>My concern is about the 41,000 farmers that the Minister did not categorise and did not give us any details about and, indeed, maybe many other farmers who <Col N="951" /> are not mentioned in the Minister's figures at all.  Because of the times we are living in, with butter mountains, milk lakes and radiation of vegetables and the supermarkets one does not know in farming, what direction one must take next.</P>
    <P>Many farmers have now to diversify. This is a time when they will need advice and the services of ACOT.  Indeed, many farmers who never availed of it before will need it now and we are going to charge them at the very worst time in their whole operation, when they find that they must diversify because the income is not coming from the farming they have been used to doing.  Now they must turn their attention to maybe a half acre or an acre of cabbage or carrots to supplement an income from a dairy farm or a sheep farm.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have mentioned the wrong one there.  The forecast is that sheep farming is the up and coming thing and they are all advised to keep sheep.  All right, we are now advising farmers that sheep is the business to be in.  If a farmer who has been operating outside the sheep area over the years now finds that to educate his children he must have a look at the rearing and fattening of sheep and he knows nothing about it, he will then need the advice of the ACOT services or some other body.  While he or his father, who operated that land beforehand, could have had this service free of charge, we are now asking that man to pay for the service at a time when he is finding the going rough.</P>
    <P>This will bring about the most fundamental change in farming in our time. I wonder if the idea of charging has been gone into sufficiently or have we looked at the effect it has had in other areas. Take the other portion of our island, for instance.  Northern Ireland.  ADAS have suggested a charge which has come into operation in Great Britain but it has not yet come into operation in Northern Ireland.  In a recent survey there, it was found that 16 per cent of the farmers who are now availing of the service will, if charges come into operation, avail of it.</P>
    <P>This is a frightening figure.  We are <Col N="952" /> dealing with the same land.  Whatever comparison can be made with the Continent &mdash; Germany or France, for example, about which there were comparisons made in the other House &mdash; I believe the greatest comparison is on our own island, where we have it in Northern Ireland.  A survey which was carried out indicates that no more than 16 per cent of those availing of the service today will avail of it if the charges that are now in operation in Great Britain come into operation in Northern Ireland.  The Minister should take a very strong look at that survey to see if he can make a comparison with that and, indeed, many parts of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the charge will be.  I hear certain figures being tossed around, a charge of £50 per annum for perhaps a package deal rather than a charge for every time the service is requested.  Has the Minister or, indeed, his predecessor, looked at what it would cost ACOT to implement the charge? How will it be operated?  I assume it will be left to the individual areas to operate it as they see fit.  But if one area operates it on a charge per phone call, or charge per visit, what will be the cost of that? Who will collect it?  Are we not then putting our advisers as pointsmen out in the field.</P>
    <P>The more sensible approach to it would be a charge for a package deal but then you also have difficulties if you do it that way.  If there is a package deal and you have a farmer who perhaps never availed of the service before and now finds that he must diversify because of the difficulties he is having with his bank account, and with keeping bread on the table, and he now finds that he must avail of it half way through the year must he also pay the £50?  There are many farmers who will require three visits per year.  Is one of those farmers required to pay the £50 the same as the farmer who has one visit per year or, indeed, the farmer who may resolve his difficulties by one phone call?</P>
    <P>Much of the agricultural advice is given by telephone to somebody who, perhaps, has gone into a new area of farming <Col N="953" /> because of necessity.  Some morning he goes out and discovers a colour running through the leaves of his cabbage or whatever he has gone into.  His fears can be allayed by a simple phone call.  Will that phone call cost him £50 if his particular area office decide on a package deal of £50, or will there be a scaled down cost to that farmer?  Will a ten minute or 20 minute conversation on the telephone cost him £50, or whatever the charge is? I believe we are running ourselves into more trouble for the sake of £1 million.</P>
    <P>When we were attracting industry into this country in the sixties we thought we could not get big enough industries in. The bigger the industry, the greater the Government or the Minister shouted, the greater the banner headlines on the papers.  What is the story there today?  It is the industry with one, two, three or ten people employed that we are looking towards and that we are encouraging. What are we doing here?  We are supplying a need through the ACOT services to the big man and we are eliminating the small person, or the person who is now getting into difficulties.</P>
    <P>I feel so strongly about it that I do not think I can over emphasise the dangerous area that we are now getting into for the sake of a meagre £1 million in the greatest industry in the country, the industry we are depending on, the backbone of the nation.  We are now asking them for £1 million but we may lose millions as time goes on.  Can you imagine a full time farmer in the west of Ireland, a farmer on the dole, or many part time farmers who are unemployed, availing of a service that will cost them £50 and which is now free of charge?</P>
    <P>I believe they will turn the other way. I do not know what they will do.  We are doing nothing to help them out of their difficulties at the most crucial stage on agriculture, I suppose, in our life time. Farmers do not know which way to turn when they find themselves in difficulty or how they can diversify.  They will have to pay for advice as to whether they should diversify at the worst time in their lives when they find that they have to diversify to stay in business, or become unemployed, <Col N="954" /> or sell off their farms and change from one area to another.</P>
    <P>I did not like it from the beginning.  I have yet to be convinced that we will benefit from it.  I see it bringing about the greatest change in the area of farming in this century.  We are now advising that farmers should go into sheep.  Many of them may be forced into taking the advice now being given from official quarters that sheep farming is the thing to be in.  Many of them know nothing about sheep and they will need advice.  They will need advice to decide whether they will even get into it.  Will we charge them for that advice?</P>
    <P>We are not going into the commercial area.  Much of the advice we are giving through ACOT is not available in horticulture but in agriculture it is available in the commercial area.  We are going half way into that.  Can you be semi-commercial? I believe there will be a big fall-off in those availing of the service. There will be a slimming down in the utilisation of the service.  That, no doubt, will bring a slimming down of the service. We will be moving further and further away from advising farmers on how to carry on business in this new world of technology and we will be leaving it open to those in the commercial field.  You cannot be semi-commercial.  You are either fully in the area, make the full charge and admit that you are doing it, or give the service free.  We would be well advised to continue the service we have been giving.</P>
    <P>I know of many people throughout the country who have had to go into part time poultry rearing to take one area.  We have already cutback the service to those people.  People going into poultry today must have 500 birds before we offer them the service.  If a person sees the necessity to supplement his farm income, to rear a few turkeys for the Christmas trade, he either must go in over 500 and avail of the service, or do it without the service. If he decides on 200 or 300 turkeys, which would be sufficient for anybody who knows nothing about it, that service is not now available to him.  Even without these charges that is not now available.  I <Col N="955" /> regretted that, when that decision was made.  It was threatened a couple of years ago and it was made quite recently.</P>
    <P>We are to do it in other areas now. I am not concerned about the 29,000 farmers who have had intensive service because, no matter what the charge is, they will avail of it and feel it is worth their while to pay it.  I am sure the charge will not be excessive for them.  They will get a return from it.  It is the 41,000 I am concerned about.  We do not know what category they are in or what service they got.  Many of them may have availed of the phone-in service where the advisers are available at the end of a phone and many problems are resolved over the phone.  Will that phone call cost £50 to the farmer?  I know the Minister will say he can have a visit from the adviser for that, or he can have three visits in the year for that.  He does not require it.  He only needs a little advice on something he has been dealing with and now, with the new methods of growing, the new sprays and all the new angles in producing, he may need a little advice which he can get with a ten or 20 minute phone call.  Will he have to pay £20, £30 or £50 for that phone call?</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have had to go so hard on this, but I feel pretty strong about it.  I come from an agricultural background.  I have had to diversify and I know what I am talking about.  I know the farmer needs the service most when he has to go into something that he is not used to.  I am not in farming today but I still have an interest in it as I believe every Irish person has.  It is the backbone of the nation and our greatest industry.  I hope we are not doing ourselves harm and that we are not putting a nail in the coffin of the advisory service which has been so valuable to farmers down the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank all of those who contributed to this debate.  The contributions generally were very wide ranging and covered many facets of the agricultural industry and sometimes went <Col N="956" /> beyond the scope of the Bill.  If I might take the liberty of going beyond the scope of this Bill I should like to congratulate all the newly elected Senators, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Cathaoirleach and to say that as a former Member of this House I appreciate very much the quite outstanding work that is being done here in particular when Bills are introduced in this House before they go to the Dáil.  This is of considerable benefit.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill there is general agreement on all sides of the House that there should be some contribution to the cost from those who benefit from ACOT and from the advisory services.  I share the concern expressed by the Members in relation to the lower category income farmers and those in financial difficulties in relation to the introduction of this Bill, but I would like to remind the House that this is an enabling measure which will merely allow ACOT to draw up a scheme of packages to bring in £1 million.</P>
      <P>There are categories of farmers who are quite able to pay for these charges. It would not do their balance sheet any harm to pay for charges because even at this stage, with all the material that is available now and the difficulties of public finances, the reality is that some people still feel that there are free services available and that there are free lunches.  The reality is that we are gone past that stage and that somebody has to pay for everything that is going.  In relation to advisory services, the general taxpayer or somebody else has to pay for them.  In this instance we are talking about introducing enabling legislation so that those who can afford to pay will be asked to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial number of highly developed farmers have good incomes.  I draw the attention of this House to the An Foras Talúntais farm management survey of 1985 which showed that, of the 70,000 full time farmers interviewed, almost 13,000 earned up to £15,000 per annum and 14,280 earned over £15,000 per annum.  In that survey it was estimated that a substantial number of farmers had an average income over £25,000 per annum.  It is only fair and reasonable <Col N="957" /> that farmers who are earning incomes in that category should be asked to contribute to something from which they are benefiting from to a great degree.  I would go further and say that the people who will really gain from that are the smaller farmers, some of them in disadvantaged areas.  There are people outside disadvantaged areas who are sometimes more acutely disadvantaged because they are not able to avail of headage payments or some of the entitlements of the disadvantaged area farmers.  By getting some of the finances into ACOT from people who can afford to pay then a wider range of services can be made available, in particular for the poorer sections of the farming community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the service to the farming community generally, ACOT will be able to provide seminars, courses, advice per telephone and generally provide a far better range of services.  They are getting £28 million this year, which is a substantial amount of money in any terms. This Bill will enable ACOT to earmark £1 million to be contributed by the farming community and by those benefiting most from it.  In the whole area of services now provided by Government agencies there is a realisation that those benefiting from a particular service should make a contribution towards it.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that before any scheme of charges is drawn up it will have to be agreed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I want to assure Senators that the position of the less well off members of the farming community will be taken into account before ultimately ministerial approval will be given for a system of charges.  I am satisfied that in the overall interests of agricultural sector a level of fees will be introduced which will not cause hardship to any section of the farming community. It will in fact allow ACOT to provide a wider range of services.</P>
    <P>I should also add that, if in the light of changing circumstances the Minister for Agriculture and Food considers that fees or terms should be varied or terminated, <Col N="958" /> he will have the power under the legislation to vary, terminate or alter the terms or conditions of any scheme of charges which might be drawn up.  Consequently, I have no hesitation in reiterating the position I outlined in the Dáil, that is, that it will be possible for ACOT, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food, to produce a system of charges which will take into account the situation and, in particular, the financial and development situation of farmers in the different categories.</P>
    <P>This might be done by making available a range of packages which would give due consideration and weight to the particular advisory needs of the various categories of farmers and their ability to pay.  I wish to re-emphasise that no farmer will be left without an advisory service if he is unable to pay for it or if the payment will cause undue hardship to him.  We are asking farmers who have a substantial income, in some cases in excess of the average industrial wage, to contribute towards the service from which they benefit.  I am also satisfied that there are adequate safeguards in the Bill to ensure that the charging of fees for advisory services will not inhibit ACOT's key role in the promotion of the efficiency of Irish farming and assisting its development to its full potential.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State <Col N="959" /> has said that a service will not be denied to anybody who is unable to pay &mdash; in other words, that the service will still be available to everybody.  The Bill states that the Minister can vary or terminate any charge proposed by ACOT.  How does the Minister see himself, or indeed any other Minister, in the position of knowing when he should terminate charges? First, we will have farmers who will not be willing to declare their hand.  But, if some farmers who are willing to declare their hand say, &ldquo;Look, I require this service but I am unable to pay for it&rdquo;, will it be on an individual basis or will it be based on a category of, say, a certain income?  How does the Minister feel that he will be in a better position to decide than the local ACOT committee?  I believe it is the reverse and that the local ACOT committee or the local adviser who would be in a far better position to know whether that farmer can afford it. I cannot understand how the Minister can see himself as being able to decide whether a farmer can afford a charge or not.  I cannot envisage the Minister being called upon to either reduce or to terminate a charge because the category of farmer we are talking about here is not organised.  It cannot be done in that way. It will have to be done on an individual basis.  Even if it was coming through an organisation, I believe that most farmers would not be prepared to show their hand as to their financial position or otherwise through their local organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in response to Senator McMahon that, in the first instance, it is a matter for ACOT to draw up a formula in relation to the introduction of charges. Then in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and subject to his approval, a package would be devised on a level of advisory services.  Nobody who indicates his inability to pay will be denied an advisory service.  In the package &mdash; I do not want to pre-empt what ACOT will draw up by way of a formula &mdash; there will be a level of service available <Col N="960" /> to people and, in any case where it would cause undue hardship, people will not be denied an advisory scheme or service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not satisfied me.  I am sure if we were to stay here all day I would not be satisfied.  First, I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment; I overlooked that when I stood up because I did not expect to be called so quickly to speak.  I wish him well in his position.  I am sure, if his Administration lasts long enough, we will have many a tussle.  However, that will be for the betterment of debate and for the farmers generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister's answer has not satisfied me because the category I am concerned about will not be asking for the advisory service, or if they ask and they are told that there is a charge, they will back off. My concern is that these people will back off and they will not use the service any further.  We could argue about that all day and we would get nowhere because it looks as though it is going to happen anyway.  I hope I will be proved wrong in what I said earlier and in what I am saying now; I do not want to be proved right. At the same time I feel so strongly about it that I have to voice my opinion.  Can the Minister indicate to us if there will be a uniform charge throughout the country or will each county devise its own charges? He is reluctant to say if it will be a package deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if it is left to individual areas they will go for a package deal. That is putting the advisers in a most invidious position.  There are people they have been serving down the years and if these people do not enter into that package deal and require the service, the advisers will have to say: &ldquo;I am sorry; you are not in the package deal; I cannot talk to you about that; I can talk to you about the weather but I cannot talk to you about your crops or how they are progressing, or whatever problem you might have with them.&rdquo;  Could the Minister elaborate as to whether there will be a uniform charge throughout the country, whether it will be on an individual phone <Col N="961" /> call or farm visit basis, or package deal? Obviously it has not been determined yet, but I would like to know at this stage if people in County Dublin and County Meath will be paying the same amount as people in Leitrim and Sligo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I must say I am not in a position to give a categorical reply to this question because I do not want to pre-empt what ACOT will come up with.  It is their responsibility in the first instance to draw up a formula for the introduction of charges.  The basis for this enabling legislation is that there should be a contribution from the farming community who can afford to pay.  That will be in their terms of reference, to bring in a relatively small amount of money from people who can afford to pay.  That formula will be devised and drawn up in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and, subject to his approval, it will then be introduced. Again, if any hardship is caused I would assume that the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the day will be aware of this from his various contacts, meetings, clinics and so on.  He can instruct ACOT to modify, change or ameliorate the formula, which is subject to his approval in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not a bit more forthcoming.  Quite honestly, I cannot believe it has not been gone into in greater detail.  Where do we get £1 million from?  Surely we must know how many people, approximately, will contribute to that £1 million.  If we make a charge, how do we know it will not bring in £2 million?  Some backroom work must have been done.  I am disappointed that the Minister is not giving us more information in that regard.  There must be some planning.  Surely, it would not do any harm if the Minister gave an indication as to what the charges are likely to be.  The sooner the farmers know about it the better because farmers are planning for next year.  It would be as well that we should have as much information as <Col N="962" /> possible, as soon as possible, about the proposed charges.</P>
      <P>If I were Minister for Agriculture in a year or two &mdash; it is most unlikely &mdash; I do not see how I would be in a position to say that you cannot impose this charge; it is creating too great a hardship for a particular farmer.  Am I going to get the farmers' accounts on an individual basis? This category of farmer is not organised in that way.  They cannot say: &ldquo;There are 28 farmers in this county who cannot afford it&rdquo; or &ldquo;There are 210 farmers in this county who belong to this category and they should not be charged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My real concern is that that person will never ask for the service.  We are frightening him off from availing of the service.  That will have an effect on our national cake and on the national income. That is my real fear.  This charge is a niggardly way of getting £1 million.  The Minister's predecessor was doing the same thing; I am not just saying this to the present Minister because he is not a member of the same party.  I would have said the same thing to the Minister's predecessor if I had had the opportunity, and if the Bill had got that far.</P>
      <P>It is a niggardly way of looking for £1 million.  In seeking this £1 million we will lose much more.  Surely the Minister can give us some indication of what is planned. Where does he get the figure of £1 million?  He must know the estimated number of farmers who will contribute that £1 million.  Otherwise he could not come up with the figure of £1 million.  I am pressing the Minister to give us some information on what the charges are likely to be, or how they are likely to be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel Senator McMahon is a little unfair to the Minister.  I doubt that the Minister could say exactly how much the charge will bring in.  It could be £1 million; it could be £2 million.  Senator McMahon is worried that people will be afraid to avail of this scheme and afraid to look for free services.  Every county has an ACOT committee of agriculture and a number of advisers who know their people.  They know the people who will <Col N="963" /> have to get the service free and the people who will have to pay for it.  If they do not know, there will be a committee also.  In passing I would like to say how sorry I am about the committee of agriculture which was there since the Department of Agriculture was established back around 1900.  That committee was always regarded as the most important committee in every county.  It is a sad thing to have to say that today it is the one committee in every county that has no money to pay the travelling expenses of the members to attend meetings.  The members of the committee in each county are prepared to make a sacrifice but they would like to see everyone else making the same sacrifice, which is not happening in other committees in the counties not involved in agriculture.</P>
      <P>As far as the charges are concerned, we all know that at one time farmers were paying rates and getting this service free. There are no rates now and it is only right that there should be a charge.  Unlike Senator McMahon, I am not worried about who is or is not able to pay.  I am convinced that people who are unable to pay will be looked after.  We have a number of agricultural advisers and a good committee in every county who will see to that in the same way as is done with other services under other Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give any further information because it is a matter for ACOT to introduce a system of charges which essentially will be derived from farmers who can afford to pay.  I want to reiterate that there will be no instance of any hardship being caused because of this.  The approval of the Minister for Agriculture will be necessary before any package of charges can be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present you have charges introduced for farm visits from the farm development office.  A system was devised there very quickly and at present farmers receiving grant aid pay a contribution towards the cost of the visit by the farm development service.  As everybody knows, in the creamery industry <Col N="964" /> there are various levies paid each month by farmers for particular services.  I want to compliment the farming organisations and some of the co-ops because they have set a headline by contributing to scholarships. The IFA, FBD, Kerry Co-op are already allowing farmers and farmers' sons to avail of scholarships to various agricultural colleges because they realise that they are in the business of developing Irish agriculture, not restraining it.  In that context they are making a contribution to the overall level of service.  I would envisage that this legislation will allow ACOT to have a broader range of services and that a relatively small amount of the contribution will be paid for by the people benefiting most from it.</P>

    <Title>Closure of Dublin Plant: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, expresses its grave concern at the sudden closure of the Hyster Plant in Blanchardstown, Dublin 15 and in view of the consequent 250 job losses and the substantial State investment in the plant, calls on the Government to take immediate action to ensure the continuance of the industry and that all facts leading to the closure are made public.</P>
      <P>May I place on record my appreciation of the Leader of the House for making time available this morning for a discussion on a matter of great public concern and interest?  The closure of the Hyster plant at Blanchardstown is a bitter blow for many people.  First of all, it is a bitter blow for those whose jobs are gone almost literally overnight and in such a brutal way.  It is a bitter blow for the IDA which had invested so much hope and so much of the taxpayers' money in this venture.  It is a sad blow to the Government's job creation programme and also a bitter blow to our overall economy and our morale at this point in our history.</P>
      <P>The whole episode is one which raises some very serious questions and which invites, in the words of <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, the most rigorous post mortem.  The questions which must be asked, and which we will be asking this morning, are ones which the Government will want to answer fully and openly.  I say this not in any sense of party or political recrimination.  Questions concerning jobs and peoples' livelihoods are of far greater importance than any political differences in this House.  Nobody in any party will want to make any capital out of this catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which the closure was effected leaves a very bad taste all <Col N="966" /> around.  The idea that people should arrive, first thing in the morning, to find the gates locked against them, without explanation, without any plans worked out for redundancy, without even the courtesy of an explanation is something which flies in the face of any standards of decent industrial relations.  The Hyster firm has not done itself, or the image of multinational companies in this country, any service whatsoever by the way in which it so brutally effected the closure of this plant.  I wonder if the Government were aware in 1982 of the reputation of Hyster for sudden closures and sudden pull-outs of this kind when it finalised the original deal?</P>
    <P>The immediate priority for the Government and the IDA &mdash; and it is not going to be an easy one &mdash; is to try to ensure that alternative industry is found for the Blanchardstown area and in particular for use of the plant in question. Apparently, Hyster are simply getting up and walking away from the whole mess. The plight of those who are thrown out of work is not so simple unless some similar &ldquo;hi-tech&rdquo; industry can be found. The fact is that these people may never work in this country again.  Many of these are young people who invested their hopes in this new plant, who have taken out mortgages, who are in debt, who began to build up their families on the basis of the future held out for them and the expectation that they had a secure future.  These people will now find themselves saddled with debt and may well find that the only path open to them is to emigrate.  We cannot afford to lose these highly skilled people.  We owe it to them to make every effort to find some sort of alternative employment of a similar kind. I know that this will be the priority of the Minister and of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>Serious questions must be asked as far as the IDA are concerned in all of this.  I hope that the IDA will come forward with full and open answers to these questions, some of which were raised in the other House yesterday.  Since Hyster began operations in 1982 in this country the IDA have pumped in a total of over <Col N="967" /> £15 million in capital, in employment training and research and development grants to the Hyster company.  It is not known how much Hyster itself put in, but it is believed that the ratio is small, certainly far smaller than could be expected in a joint venture of this kind. It is also believed that the IDA were preparing to invest almost £40 million of taxpayers' money in the project &mdash; £28.9 million in capital employment and other grants and a further £11.3 million in research and development grants.  Fortunately, that money has not been invested.  The question which people will want to know the answer to is how much, if any, of the £15 million of taxpayers' money we are likely to get back.  The answer would seem to be little, if any, of that money.</P>
    <P>The sheer scale of the loss itself raises enormous questions about how the plant came into existence.  It was conceived in a blaze of publicity five short years ago. At that time we were told &mdash; and I am afraid when it comes to hyping up possible successes in advance the IDA are rarely found wanting, and the coming into existence of this project was surrounded by a blaze of publicity &mdash; that eventually there would be 1,500 jobs. There are many of us who, from experience over the years, are very sceptical of the job promises made by the IDA, because these promises are of jobs when the plant is in full production.  It is something less than fully honest to assure a community that 1,500 jobs will be available almost as a certainty when that promise is dependent on so many other factors.  Experience would seem to indicate that the IDA have rarely succeeded in fulfilling the full allocation of jobs promised at the beginning of many of the plants which they succeeded in bringing to this country.  A more realistic less highkey approach by the IDA in terms of promises of this kind might be a welcome departure in their policy.  It would be welcomed all round, in which case the impact of the losses might not be so great.</P>
    <P>In 1982 it was believed that the IDA had pulled off one of the great coups of <Col N="968" /> the decade by swiping the Hyster plant virtually from under the noses of the Northern Ireland Development Authority. We must now ask if in the zeal to pull off this coup the whole project was rushed through without being subjected to proper critical evaluation and whether the need of the IDA to get the plant at any cost meant the suspension of proper critical judgment.  It must be asked whether the Government and/or the IDA, or both, entered into a venture with a very high degree of risk, without properly safeguarding the public investment involved.</P>
    <P>We are told in <i>The Irish Press</i> today that a special Cabinet meeting was held on a Sunday, 19 May 1982, to rush through the deal and have it announced in time for the by-election which was taking place in Dublin west at that time. I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that at that Sunday Cabinet meeting, held suddenly, all the proper assurances were given and received that the taxpayers' money would not be put at risk as part of a venture which was unlikely to succeed.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that all of the proper procedures were carried out, that the advice of the Department of Finance was fully listened to and that all attempts were made to ensure that this was a prudent venture which would not put at risk huge amounts of taxpayers' money.  There are many people who believe that this may not have been the case.  I would like a detailed assurance from the Minister that all the proper steps were taken, that the risks were not inordinate and that the whole deal was not arrived at in a game of high stakes poker, where Hyster simply hawked their wares around from one country to the other, playing one country's bid off against the other, so that in the end it was capable of getting a deal here which perhaps no other country would accept.</P>
    <P>There are other more fundamental problems.  The Hyster collapse raises a fundamental problem about the whole overall thrust of IDA policy.  Over the years &mdash; probably the whole country, the <Col N="969" /> IDA, different Governments and political parties &mdash; we have all relied on overseas investment to do much of the work of job creation for us at the expense and to the detriment of the development of many of our indigenous industries. Heavy reliance on overseas investment is fine when it works.  Much of the time it has worked in this country.  What happens when, as apparently happened in this case, international markets suddenly change?  We find then that international companies not surprisingly owe us no loyalty. Their first imperative is to defend their own interests and they will act accordingly.  That has happened here.  It may happen again.  Unfortunately, in the current economic uncertainty it probably will happen again.  That particular eventuality does not seem to have been guarded against in the general thrust of IDA policy and in Government policy over the years in their attempt to base so much of our job creation and our industrial development on an over-reliance on investment in international companies.</P>
    <P>It is clear now that this over-dependence on this strategy, and not putting enough emphasis on the development of our own indigenous industries, may well have been a mistake and may be at the root of the problems which we are talking about here today.  I would like to recall in conclusion one further point about the Hyster operation.  It may be remembered that a couple of years ago the then Minister responsible, Deputy John Bruton, refused to accede to a request by the IDA for further State investment in Hyster. The Minister was not happy that the Hyster plant at that stage had a healthy long-term future.  What also may be remembered is the extent to which the Minister was virtually taken on by the IDA on that occasion when he was first publicly challenged to state who made industrial policy in this country.  He was asked was it the IDA or was it the Government of the day?</P>
    <P>I believe that in some ways the IDA, because of their undoubted successes, but also because of the tremendous success they have had in presenting their own <Col N="970" /> image as the great success story, have to a certain extent created an immunity from proper public scrutiny both of their policy and of their operations.  I am not just talking about the huge amounts of public money needlessly invested in the elaborate and luxurious new IDA head offices.  I am talking about the capacity they have to create the impression that they know best as far as industrial policy is concerned.  That particular instance did not show the IDA in a good light.  They were prepared to use their undoubted muscle in the areas of media and public relations to try to reverse a Government decision.</P>
    <P>We can see with hindsight that, unfortunately, in that particular case the Minister was right.  We were safeguarded from further huge losses of public investment in that company because no matter what had happened the shifting international markets probably would have meant that that money would have been further good money going after bad.  It is time that we in this House and in the Oireachtas as a whole made a very searching examination of the role and functions of the IDA, their strategies and the scope of their policy.  The whole area of industrial policy should be given much greater time and attention here in this House and not simply be the preserve of any State company, however good they may be.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister a full reply to the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like, as the Minister for Finance did yesterday in Dáil Éireann on behalf of the Government, to express my profound regret that the Hyster project at Blanchardstown has not prospered and that as a consequence some 225 people will lose their employment.  I also regret that the company's efforts and the significant State investment have not proved successful. However, it is necessary despite our deep disappointment and concern that we should be objective and restrained in our approach to the public debate on this matter.  In my view we should refrain from any extreme comment <Col N="971" /> which would undermine the work being undertaken by our development agencies in their endeavour to create employment opportunities for our unemployed. There are regrettably all too many of these.  We must build up our economic strength through the development of new, export-oriented industries. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.</P>
      <P>Investment in industry, either by the private entrepreneur or by the State, is a risk business.  It would be unrealistic to expect that there will not be shortcomings and failures.  We should not, in my view, over-dramatise these setbacks.  By all means we should try to learn from them, modify our procedures, try to identify at an earlier stage that they are not developing properly, and minimise the costs and losses that can arise.  I am confident that the IDA and the Minister in Government are only too well aware of the necessity to benefit from their experiences in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Hyster project was an ambitious one involving, as it did, the establishment in Ireland of an integrated stand alone &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; industry incorporating, as the Minister informed the Dáil yesterday, research and development, specialised training, production and marketing within the Irish location.  I understand that the company was successful in the area of research and development.  Many Irish graduates gained experience and found employment in it in that it developed the &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; product. The failure, I understand, was rooted in the marke place.  The failure occurred because of a drop in the demand for one of the products.  The demand failed to develop as strongly as expected because of changes that have taken place in industry's requirements and the large scale warehousing of industrial products. There was failure in the case of a second product to achieve significant sales against strong competition from other companies in the marketplace.  Such failures and setbacks of new products are not uncommon.  Senators will, I am sure, be able to recall from their own experience many such instances.  Such setbacks <Col N="972" /> have been encountered by large companies which are household names both here and abroad.  Consequently, I wish to express my support for the IDA and the Government in their continued efforts to foster overseas industrial development and to urge that they should not be deterred by the occasional setback.</P>
    <P>I call on this House to so express its support and to give every encouragement possible to the finding of an alternative project to fill the void left by this closure. I should like to conclude by addressing myself to the part of the motion calling for the continuance of the industry, given that the IDA have for months been in discussion with the company trying to achieve this and that the parent company has, as the Dáil was informed yesterday, advised that the closure decision is irrevocable. I consider that all our efforts should be concentrated on finding alternative employment.</P>
    <P>While I very much appreciate the action of the workers in the immediate aftermath of the company's closure announcement, nevertheless I appeal to them to exercise restraint and to do nothing that would lessen the opportunity of attracting an alternative industry into this area.  The lessons of the past in this regard will, I hope, not be forgotten. I hope the company will meet its full obligation to its workforce and that they, in turn, will not allow themselves to be misguided into doing anything that would frustrate the efforts &mdash; which are ongoing &mdash; to find the best possible solution to their problem.  In fairness to the IDA I should say that they have made every possible effort to avert this closure. However, there is a great sadness and tragedy in that the vast majority of the workforce are young people in their mid-twenties with young families and very high mortgage repayments to meet.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment yesterday in Dáil Éireann when he said every effort would be made to locate alternative industry in the Blanchardstown area.  As an earlier speaker said &mdash; and my own personal opinion is &mdash; one of the best ways of tackling our <Col N="973" /> serious unemployment problem is to identify home-based, viable, small industry. Small industry, by its very diversification of product and process, avoids mass redundancies in the event of the closure or the failure of any particular product.  Small Irish industries must be clearly identified and given the &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; technology and machinery which will enable them to manufacture a competitively priced product which will sell on the European market.  I would like to see in the future more effort being made in this area.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier small industry will go a long way to solving our unemployment. There is a vast market of 320 million people which, as yet, has not been tapped.  We regret very much the sad closure and the heartbreak of these people employed in Hyster.  I am confident that the company, together with the IDA, will in the short term find an alternative industry for that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to offer my sympathy to the people who are losing their jobs.  I am certainly sorry to see the business going out of existence.  I hope that the rescue efforts will be successful. That is not much consolation to the people who will be outside the door.  I heard the appeal Senator Mulroy made just now.  I have heard such an appeal in this House on quite a number of occasions, not in the same words but in exactly the same tone.  It referred to giving the IDA a chance and an opportunity because they are doing a good job. I am not arguing because I do not have enough facts at my fingertips.  The general public are entitled to know a lot more about the functions of the IDA and how they go about their business.  We cannot continually come to this Chamber, and the other Chamber, and listen to the story of Ferenka, Fieldcrest, Mostek and Hyster.  Although AIB and the ICI have nothing to do with the IDA, nevertheless they are still relevant to the debate.  We cannot keep coming in here when there are millions of taxpayers' money at stake saying: &ldquo;Look, the IDA are doing a good job.  We have lost 225 jobs here.  That is <Col N="974" /> not the full story.  We are trying to get them back.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The full story is that we do not really know whether, in fact, the IDA are just a bunch of bureaucrats who have not got sufficient grasp of the situation.  We have not got sufficient knowledge about them and whether, in fact, they have done a detailed investigation into the Telesis report.  We have no knowledge as to whether they paid any attention to Charles Carroll's summation of the Telesis report in 1983.  Charles Carroll was a senior marketing specialist at the IMI and the director of the PIMS programmes. We know they are a crowd of fairly clever people who are motivated in a certain way and who will go out to try to encourage employment.  We do not really know exactly whether they have sufficient &ldquo;know how&rdquo; to protect the taxpayer.  We are entitled to know that.  The director general should tell the nation.  He has been on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; telling us about the problems with regard to specific industries.  We want to know what the problems are with regard to the IDA.  It is not a new problem.  I have not got the names of my fingertips, but we can go back some years in other parts of the country &mdash; not in Dublin &mdash; to where factories were opened up by the IDA and suddenly went out of business.  The next stage was that people were being retrained.  There were many rescue operations. You could pick up a lot of people around the country who are trained in about five or six skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a company cannot stand the pace and suddenly the rescue situation must be started up very rapidly, there must be something wrong with the investigative process.  For example, let us take the situation now.  Our economy is a small economy.  We cannot make comparisons with the American or the Japanese economies. It must have been well known that the Japanese were &ldquo;big&rdquo; into the question of the type of trucks being manufactured and that to try to compete with that sort of thing was not feasible in Ireland.  We have got to know what exactly the situation <Col N="975" /> is, how far the position was investigated, what was foreseen and what was not foreseen.  I am not levelling accusations but do not forget that this firm seemed to be set up rather hastily coming up to an election.  I wonder if, in fact, it was not rushed through without detailed study.</P>
    <P>There is roughly over £20 million in question in total.  Let us take the figure of £15 million, £12 million of which the IDA explained as &ldquo;people-related&rdquo;.  It has gone into training and employment incentives.  That £12 million is not recoverable for the Irish taxpayer so we are entitled to know all about it.  They go on to tell us that the incentives were unusually complicated.  What was unusual about the incentives?  What made them complicated?  Who complicated them?</P>
    <P>I am calling now for a statement from the IDA as soon as possible on this whole question.  A sum of £20.6 million of taxpayers' money is at stake.  They were looking for more from the Coalition Government last year but they did not get it.  We are entitled to know, on behalf of the public, the level of ineptitude which is in existence or what the problem is.  Was that displayed by management, or is it actually the fault of the IDA?  Who is at fault?  Who is at the root of the insolvency?  Were the proper financial implications examined?  Were the IDA given the fullest possible information when they were setting up the deal? Quite frankly, it is very hard, even for an ordinary punter like myself, to accept that insolvent situations just emerge in a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The IDA have been telling us that they have been trying to rescue the plant.  The fact of the matter is that such a problem does not crop up overnight.  It happens over a very long period.  The danger signals must be evident to the principals. If they showed themselves to the principals then they must have shown themselves to the IDA.  They must have had some indication beforehand that this type of problem was liable to crop up.  Was <Col N="976" /> any sort of consideration given to this? Frankly, I am a little bit upset about this whole thing.  Most of the time of the trade union movement is taken up with dealing with the question of people being laid off. In this case they certainly cannot blame the trade unions, or strikes or anything else because the company would not hear tell of a trade union.  Trade unions were not encouraged at all.  It brings out the cynicism in people like me who believe that unemployment is not a mere accidental blemish in this economy.  It seems to me that, if we are not prepared to delve into matters like this very deeply, and be more investigative about it, we can suggest &mdash; and society is no different now from what it was in the 19th century &mdash; that unemployment is an essential mechanism of the system and that it has a definite function, that is, to maintain the authority of the master over the man. That cynicism is bound to grow if we do not get to the root problem of redundancy, unemployment, lack of competitiveness, etc.</P>
    <P>That is one argument.  There is another argument about being able to absorb the people being taken off the land and so on.  Then there is the argument about the creation of unemployment because of the new technological age.  I am not talking about that.  I am talking about the number of jobs actually lost through bad management. We had to sit down and listen to the whole business of the PMPA.  We had a very sorry period over that.  We saw the disastrous waste of money in Dublin Gas and we can see its effects to the present day in Dublin Gas.  Where are all the investigators?  Where are the people with the brains and the knowhow, the entrepreneurs who can see the pitfalls?  Are they in the IDA?  Why is there such a magnitude of failure?  The company do not lose money.  In most cases it is the taxpayer who is ultimately caught.  It is a bit late now to ask the question whether better expertise would have helped, whether it was a question of organisation or whether new management was needed.</P>
    <P>It is puzzling for the ordinary Joe to understand this: all these people with all <Col N="977" /> these brains come out of colleges and institutions and are given high salaried jobs and facilities to protect the taxpayers of this nation, yet we are not certain if the job is being done right.  I was called on one occasion to fill in as a substitute where a factory had gone bust in Athy.  I do not know whether I took the discussion up wrongly or not &mdash; it is quite possible &mdash; but I do not think I did.  I cannot even think of the name of the place now; it is a good few years ago. Part of the deal was that one of the IDA people would be a director and that meant that they would have knowledge of something.  But, through some communication breakdown or some difficulty, there were goods from this place in Athy lying in the docks in Waterford for about three or four weeks and the shipping company would not put it on board because the parent company in Germany had gone bust.  What sort of situation is that, if that is accurate?  I am not pointing the finger at people in the IDA for being dishonest or anything else. But I am entitled to know, the same as everybody, whether they are handling the matter competently on behalf of the Irish taxpayer?  That is what we are after.</P>

      <P>At the outset I very much welcome this debate as it demonstrates very clearly that the Seanad is aware and is deeply concerned about the serious unemployment and economic situation which exists in Ireland and indeed in Dublin today.  The first thing I would like to do is to offer my sincere sympathy to the workers at Hyster, who will now unfortunately lose their jobs and also to their families.  It is surely a very traumatic thing to be told that you now face life on the dole and the bleak future that that involves.  I would appeal to the management of Hyster, to the IDA and indeed to the Minister to do everything possible to try to save these jobs. However, if that is not possible, it is vital that a very satisfactory redundancy package be negotiated for these workers and that alternative employment be sought for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest closure in Blanchardstown <Col N="978" /> highlights very clearly the serious jobs crisis which now exist in the Dublin area &mdash; our capital city of one million people. A report issued last week by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce regarding the employment situation in Dublin makes frightening reading.  There are now 98,893 people out of work in the eastern region.  The unemployment rate in Dublin is now 19.2 per cent of the labour force.  This is above the national average. The report also concluded that the level of manufacturing employment in Dublin city has declined by over one-third since 1971.  Indeed, in the country as a whole we have a quarter of a million people unemployed.  We are losing 6,000 industrial jobs a year.  We have zero economic growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>These facts and this latest Hyster closure must raise serious questions regarding our industrial policy.  The taxpayer cannot be happy with the fact that £17 million of their money is now lost on a factory which was only set up in 1982. Nobody can be happy with a situation where a relatively minor decision taken in Portland, Oregon, can have such serious consequences regarding our employment situation in Dublin.  The wisdom of depending so heavily on the foreign multinational company to meet our employment needs now needs to be seriously questioned.  This closure is but one of a series of pull-outs by multinational companies in recent years.  A radical review of our industrial policy is now called for. In 1980, some 240,000 people were employed in manufacturing industry in the Republic of Ireland.  Of this, 80,000, or one-third, were employed in new IDA overseas firms.  Dermot McAleese has estimated that 50 per cent of Irish industry is controlled by foreign interests. These are startling facts.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been very successful in attracting foreign firms.  The Telesis report states that, of every five foreign investments in Europe in the seventies, Ireland attracted four of them.  Capital grants, fiscal incentives and our industrial policy ensured they came here.  There have, of course, been a number of advantages <Col N="979" /> to this success.  Initial employment effects were good and it had a very favourable effect on our balance of payments as our exports continued to grow. However, experience has shown that these jobs were not stable.  In addition, these new foreign industries had very few linkages with other sectors of the Irish economy.  The Telesis report suggests that we are paying far too much for these firms and are not being selective enough.</P>
    <P>These criticisms must now be given serious consideration.  What we need to do now and what the IDA must do now is to encourage in every way indigenous manufacturing industry.  They must promote the exporting native industry.  Our economy will never develop fully until we have a strong native industrial base.  This we have lacked since the foundation of the State.  Our new industrial policy must promote this.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would appeal to the Government to proceed without delay with their programme for economic recovery.  I welcome very much the establishment of the Custom House Docks Authority to develop the 27 acre site at the Custom House docks and we all hope this will play a major role in providing much needed employment in our capital city.  The Hyster closure, as I have said, now raises serious questions regarding the operations of the IDA and regarding our industrial policy.  I believe that the time has now come for the Minister to undertake a radical review of the role, function and policy of the IDA.  Having said that, however, I take this opportunity of wishing the IDA continued success in their endeavours in providing employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would also like to be associated with the expressions of concern in relation to the unfortunate people who have lost their jobs in the Hyster closure, but I would like to address myself to the more general situation with regard to our industrial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tragically from a national point of view from time to time when we hear of closures like the one we are discussing here <Col N="980" /> this afternoon, we tend to take up the position of shooting the messenger because we do not like the message. Surely our industrial policy which endeavours to attract multinational companies to come here is, by its very nature, a high risk business.  Nobody has ever come before this House, or the other House, and said he could give a categorical assurance that this industry would be in existence, ten, 15 or 20 years hence.  Obviously we are entitled to presume that the company have sufficient confidence in their product and in their general organisational abilities to ensure that they will be in a position to continue manufacturing here over that period.</P>
    <P>By the very nature of any business today, not necessarily in a manufacturing scenario but in any facet of industry or of employment that we wish to examine in our present economic climate, or in the worldwide economic climate, can we give categorical undertakings that such business will be in existence ten or 15 years down the road?  One only has to look at the business Senator Daly, the Acting Chairman, is in, its volatile nature and its deterioration in a very short time.  My own business is a similar case.  It was booming ten years ago, yet it is in disarray today.  Who would have said ten or 15 years ago that the tourism industry, or the motor trade for example, would be in a shambles today?  We, as politicians, must take a fair amount of the blame for this because the demise of the multinational has been on the cards for quite some time.  We, as politicians, have been overly preoccupied by the razzmatazz end of the industry.  We are all there on the day the factory is being opened.  We are all very happy to get our names in the paper if there is even a suggestion of a factory coming to our home towns.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade we have not availed of the opportunity in this House or in the Dáil to pursue any kind of an indepth appraisal of the performance of the IDA.  There is a definite tendency in that organisation to build empires.  They tend towards elitism in the sence that they feel they know more than everybody else about the provision of industry and <Col N="981" /> its well being.  Senator Harte made that point.  We are paying them to be the experts and we expect them to have the expertise but that does not give them a total corner on the market of intelligence or understanding of how industry works. Quite often it is felt, by virtue of the demise within a short period of some of the industries the IDA brought in, that they do not cast a jaundiced eye on any of the industries they are bringing in. They tend to bring them in on the chance that they will succeed in the long term as was well as in the short term.  The activities of the IDA <i>vis-a-vis</i> Hyster need some examination.  There must have been a tendency to respond to a degree of political pressure.  Perhaps the reference to the by-election is valid.  Certainly that Government were not different from any other Government in office at the time of a by-election.  The need to expedite the consideration of an industry for a particular constituency is nothing new.  Let us not suggest for a moment that that did not happen today or yesterday.</P>
    <P>We are talking about £16 million or £17 million of taxpayers' money at the end of the day.  We as active politicians, must accept some degree of responsibility in that we have not taken it upon ourselves to appraise on a regular basis, not just every decade or every now and again, the performance of the IDA or to examine their level of accountability which is really what we are talking about here today.  Senator Manning touched on that throughout his contribution this afternoon. There needs to be a more efficient mechanism for accountability than we have at present.  He commented on the confrontational response to Deputy Bruton's inquiries two or three years ago which was totally unacceptable to me. That sliver of almost contempt for the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to any query we raise with that organisation is not acceptable.  We wrung our hands, for example, when Fords closed.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of that to which I should like to refer.  First we got a total commitment from the Minister of the day that Fords would not be let walk away <Col N="982" /> with 1,400 jobs.  Three years later they are still walking and the site is still vacant. In fact, it is being dismantled at present. It was a traumatic time for Cork; in fact, 22 per cent of the population of that city and county are now unemployed.  The kind of commitments the people of Blanchardstown will get in the next couple of days will need to be examined very carefully because they will be as hollow as the one the people of Cork got three years ago.  They would not necessarily want to be too confident about the assurances they will get about a replacement industry.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the debate we should focus on is that the commitment should he honoured.  A serious vacuum is created by the problem of Mostek and Hyster in that area of Dublin.  A commitment should not only be made but should be honoured and be seen to be honoured at the behest of this House and the Dáil.  It should not be a pious undertaking on the day of the debate in the House that we will replace that industry with something else.  The fact is that it rarely is replaced.  We should review the activities of the IDA.  I hope the Minister will refer to this because I am aware that, in certain Government policy documents published prior to the last election, a commitment was made to a sizeable review of the activities of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite honest.  They are carrying out the brief we have given them quite well.  However, there is a distinct danger, in the discussions on the collapse of a multinational here today, that we will take up the position that we do not want any more multinational companies. I come from a constituency that would take a couple of dozen multinationals if we got them.  I will continue to exhort the IDA to strive might and main to provide them.  Nobody in this House is saying that.</P>
    <P>I get a bit annoyed from time to time. All of a sudden now, &ldquo;small is beautiful.&rdquo; I accept that there was a time when we had great difficulty in getting the IDA to look at any small industry.  They had no interest in small industry.  They were only <Col N="983" /> concerned with thousands of jobs, but now they had a death bed conversion on that one as well.  Even if we achieve total success in filling the small industry and the native manufacturing industry vacuum, we must never lose sight of the absolute necessity to continue to strive to get sizeable multinationals to set up here. There are extremely successful multinational companies operating here at present, giving good employment, giving good conditions of employment, producing a good product and doing well for this country.  We should never lose sight of that fact.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a debate that took place in another forum a few years ago on the departure of a multinational from my own region.  Some companies felt we made them very welcome.  They received assurances from local communities that nothing was impossible.  We promised to provide them with any form of assistance we could.  We have done that very successfully in every community in this country. We must not lose sight of the commitment the IDA give on our behalf when they go to Oregon, or Washington, or any other part of the US or, indeed, in Europe.</P>
    <P>One of the IDA'S primary attractions in the IDA'S armoury of attractions to bring people into this country, is the level of welcome for that industry and its principals in an Irish town, city, or village.  It is significantly different from the type of welcome they get when they go anywhere else.  When the IDA are endeavouring to induce sizeable industries to go down the country, for example, to the west, the south-west or the north-west, the community acceptance and the general aura of good feeling towards these industrialists induce them to come here instead of going to Scotland, or Holland, or Belgium where considerable inducements are being provided nowadays.  We must not lose sight of that fact either in the teeth of Hyster's unfortunate demise.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we should certainly avail of the opportunity as a matter of priority to examine the terms of reference and the accountability of the IDA.  That is the <Col N="984" /> most important thing that needs to be said here this morning.  I would also like to sound a word of caution that we should continue to create the correct climate and to ensure that any efforts the IDA are making at present to induce industrialists to come in here are not inhibited in any way by anything that may be said or done in the Houses of the Oireachtas during these debates.</P>

      <P>As the Senators will be aware from the various press reports and the replies given in the Dáil yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ray MacSharry, the announcement by Hyster Automated Handling Limited that they were ceasing operations at Blanchardstown came as a great surprise not only to the Government but to the Industrial Development Authority also, who, up to the very eve of the announcement, had been in ongoing discussions with Hyster on proposals to restructure the Irish operation.  I would like, therefore, to commence by reiterating the regret expressed in the Dáil yesterday by the Minister for Finance at the development and to join with him in expressing my sympathy to the workers who so suddenly found themselves faced with the prospect of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This news is particularly regrettable in so far as the operations at Blanchardstown represented the establishment of an integrated stand-alone operation incorporating research and development, training, production and marketing in this country.  In this respect it met the industrial policy criteria followed by successive Governments and enshrined in the 1983 White Paper on Industrial Policy.  Senators will, I am sure, recall that it has been a frequent criticism of overseas promotion policy that it has failed to attract projects which incorporated these desirable features.  I think it appropriate also to mention that both Telesis and NESC advocated that there should be positive discrimination in favour of new or expansion projects with desirable characteristics such as key business functions, stand-alone projects, and <Col N="985" /> significant potential for service supply linkages &mdash; characteristics all of which applied to HAHL as originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>HAHL, a subsidiary of the US-based Hyster Group, was established in Blanchardstown in 1982 to develop, manufacture and market a range of automated materials handling equipment destined mainly for Western Europe and the United States.  The Hyster company was long recognised as a world leader in lift trucks.  Established in 1929, Hyster manufactured industrial trucks, construction equipment, tractor attachments, personnel work platforms and other materials handling equipment.  In 1981 Hyster had sales of $584 million and was among the 500 listing of top US companies.  Employing 6,700 people worldwide, the company had seven manufacturing bases in the United States at that time.  The totally integrated Irish project &mdash; incorporating research and development, manufacturing and marketing elements &mdash; was to provide a high level of employment for graduates and skilled workers.  The integrated advanced technology &ldquo;new generation&rdquo; nature of the project made it particularly attractive for Ireland.  It was to be the world headquarters for Hyster's automated materials handling systems and it was hoped that the project would create substantial spin-off opportunities in terms of linkages with universities and other third level education centres.</P>
    <P>In 1982, the Industrial Development Authority agreed a significant support package for the Hyster project for Ireland.  A breakdown of the cash grants paid to Hyster is as follows: capital grants (machinery and equipment), £2.9 million; training grants, £6.2 million; employment grants, £3.5 million; and research and development grants, £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, the IDA provided Hyster with a custom built factory costing £6 million.  As can be seen from these figures the cash grants of £15.1 million paid out to Hyster by the IDA were mainly &ldquo;people orientated&rdquo;, consisting in the main of training and research and development grants.  While much criticism <Col N="986" /> is now being made in retrospect of the level of grants paid to the project, it should be borne in mind that the IDA faced very stiff worldwide competition in their efforts to attract Hyster to Ireland. Evidence of this fact can be found in the expressions of regret by the then Northern Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Prior, when it became known that Hyster proposed locating in Dublin despite the very attractive package of incentives offered by the Northern Ireland Development Agency.</P>
    <P>The Hyster operation in Blanchardstown planned to provide jobs for 450 people within five years.  The products involved were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Automated Storage and Retrieval Equipment (ASR);</P>
    <P>2.  Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and</P>
    <P>3.  Conventional Warehouse Equipment (High Rackers, Pallet Trucks).</P>
    <P>In relation to the grant aiding of the Hyster operation at Blanchardstown all normal procedures were followed.  The Industrial Development Authority, as is usual, made proposals to the Government. The Government and the Department of Finance examined these in the normal way and the grants were approved in line with normal established criteria. It is interesting that in the 1984-85 period the Coalition Government at the time &mdash; many of those who are now making cheap political capital out of the unfortunate closure of the factory &mdash; were prepared to approve a project involving State funds of £14 million as against a £1 million up front from Hyster.  This project was to be located at Annacotty, County Limerick. Fourteen million pounds would have been put up by the State if Hyster were prepared to put up £1 million.  However, unfortunately or fortunately, whichever it was &mdash; I am not prepared to suggest what might have happened had the project gone ahead &mdash; the company did not put up the £1 million.  It is rather unusual that Ministers of an administration who were quite prepared to agree to that type of grant aiding should at present be <Col N="987" /> making a lot of political capital out of the tragedy that has taken place.</P>
    <P>Allegations have also been made that the IDA are not responsible to anyone. The Government took on board the findings of the Telesis and NESC reports, and the White Paper on Industrial Policy in 1983 incorporates the main findings of these reports.  The White Paper now sets out clear guidelines for the IDA on how they must operate.  The Government set the policy and the IDA carry it out.  I regret that some Members of the Opposition have sought to make cheap political capital out of the closure of Hyster.  We all regret the event and sympathise with the workforce and their families.  Innuendo has been made that the decision to grant aid the project was related to the Dublin West by-election in 1982.  This is not so.  The decision was made after a full and proper investigation into the viability of the project.  It was a policy decision and not a political decision at that time. It is easy when a project fails to throw blame irresponsibily all round.</P>
    <P>IDA bashing at this point in time is becoming fashionable.  This is unjustified. The IDA have done and are doing an excellent job in marketing Ireland as an ideal centre on the periphery of Europe with easy access to the vast European marketplace.  However, we rarely hear anyone compliment them on their successes. Opposition politicians who go for the easy option of crying when failures occur and silence at success stories should analyse the lack of balance in their own expressions, which too often are totally one-sided.  It is important to note that in the first three years of the project, from 1982 to 1985, sales and employment targets were met and in fact actual employment levels exceeded target levels for each of those years as follows:</P>

    <P>However, during the course of an IDA <Col N="988" /> review of the project, in early 1986, it emerged that significant shortfalls would occur in sales and profitability targets for that year.  The project was failing to develop as planned for a number of reasons.  The principal ones were as follows:</P>
    <P>There was a downturn in the world market for the company's major product category &mdash; Automated Storage and Retrieval Equipment (ASRs) failed to develop as envisaged because of the effects of &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; stock management techniques.  This particular management approach is a fairly new phenomenon and as a consequence of this the market predicted for ASRs worldwide did not develop on the scale expected.</P>
    <P>Sales of Hyster's second major product category &mdash; Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) proved insufficient to absorb the overheads of the Irish plant and a longer than planned for time was taken to perfect the new product.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the project was a major departure for Hyster into sophisticated products which had to be developed, manufactured and sold into totally new markets for the company. The plan was that the Irish operation, being fully integrated, would have sole responsibility for all stages of the operation from concept through to design and manufacture and subsequently for marketing worldwide.  By its very nature the type of operation is high risk because of the amount of R&amp;D which must be carried out.  Nevertheless successive Governments have appreciated that this type of fully integrated, stand alone overseas operation is the kind we wish to attract to these shores and this is set out clearly in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    <P>At the peak stages of the project, towards the end of last year, 289 people were employed and a range of new products had been developed at the plant for markets worldwide.  The IDA had paid £15 million to Hyster mainly in relation to the people-related activities of the <Col N="989" /> investment.  The most significant proportion of grants paid related to the comprehensive advanced training programmes, the research and development activities and employment grants. Some £2.9 million of IDA grants related to capital investment by the company.  In addition the Authority provided a custom built factory at a cost of some £6 million. This factory was to be purchased by the company in the period 1988-92.  The company was also the recipient of grant assistance from Córas Tráchtála of £0.553 million.  When it became apparent during the course of the 1986 review of the project that it was not developing on course, the company undertook a review of the whole business operation with the IDA. This indicated a need for a restructuring of the company's plans, particularly in the light of its failure to achieve targets.</P>
    <P>The Hyster company was up until Tuesday of this week in discussion with the Industrial Development Authority on a modified business plan for the company, concentrating on those elements which might have potential for providing the basis of a viable business over the long term.  Any such plan would have involved a fundamental restructuring of the Dublin plant, involving the transfer of its AGV production to one of Hyster's US plants while at the same time introducing certain new products and activities in order to increase the volume of throughput at the Irish plant.  In the event, however, the company informed the IDA of their decision to close the Irish operation entirely with the subsequent loss of all jobs at the plant.  The IDA have advised that the company's decision is irrevocable.</P>
    <P>While the loss of this operation has come as a great disappointment, the immediate priority for the Industrial Development Authority will be to pursue every avenue open to them in order to provide new opportunities for employment of the Blanchardstown workforce. This House can be assured that no effort will be spared to achieve that goal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> Notwithstanding this setback, however, the Industrial Development Authority's foreign industry programme continues to sustain 80,000 jobs in Ireland with a growing proportion of companies incorporating research and development, marketing and other key responsibilities into their operations.  The Industrial Development Authority strategy, as dictated by the White Paper on Industrial Policy, to have these key elements located here in Ireland, continues to be the best way forward towards establishing a solid industrial base for this country.</P>
    <P>I might point out here, because it has received very little attention from the media, that in the Hyster case the company invested around £4 million of their money in the project, money which is now lost to the company and which can only be seen as an indication of the company's belief that the Irish operation would prove viable in the long term.  As I have said previously, it was only in 1986 that results began to fall seriously short of targets resulting in serious losses at the plant, a situation which has continued and has ultimately led to the most unfortunate decision now taken by Hyster to close the Blanchardstown plant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of repayment of grants, the Industrial Development Authority are, I understand, entering into discussions with the company on this particular point and expect to issue a statement today dealing with this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the continuance of the industry at Blanchardstown, the Industrial Development Authority were working directly with the company over the past three months towards achieving that very aim.  It had been hoped that a modified operation would continue at the Blanchardstown plant but the company themselves ultimately took the decision to close down the operation entirely.  If this decision remains irrevocable, then, as I have already said, the Industrial Development Authority will leave no stone unturned in their efforts to attract an alternative industry to Blanchardstown.</P>

      <P>Senator Harte and I are annoyed at the tone the Minister adopted because we raised certain fundamental questions which we were entitled to raise about the disbursement of public funds. We raised questions about the way in which the whole question was processed. We have had some information from the Minister today, but I certainly take great exception to any suggestion that we indulged in IDA bashing in this House. The questions raised by Senator O'Callaghan, Senator Harte and myself, among others, were of a very fundamental nature: whether the IDA have been too insulated from public scrutiny of their policies, whether the IDA have too strong or too dominant a role in the shaping of industrial policy and, most of all whether there has been an imbalance between large multinationals and indigenous local industries and whether we are at some risk.  The Minister has, to some extent, answered some of these questions.  I certainly believe it is our public duty at this stage to raise these questions.  I regret the tone the Minister adopted in his reply and the suggestion that Senator Harte and I were making political capital, cheap or otherwise, out of the plight of the lost jobs and the loss to Blanchardstown which has occurred.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, however, I hope, and I think everybody in this House sincerely hopes, that the efforts of the IDA and of the Minister's Department to secure an alternative industry for Blanchardstown will be successful because at the end of the day that is what really counts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank Senators Ross and Murphy for putting down the motion.  It affords us an opportunity to show accountability to the general public.  Any of us who are committed to the question of disclosure of information certainly appreciate that.  It also shows that Senators are not afraid to think in critical terms about our power and functions, or the lack of them whatever the consensus turns out to be.  It is only right that we should go as far as we can with the debate in the interest of public concern.</P>
      <P>Since we are the people affected by the degree of power and functions bestowed on us, it is a good idea that we start to have a critical look at ourselves.  In the final analysis we are the ones who are answerable in the sense of checking ourselves to see whether the powers and functions we have serve to protect the public interest.  It also gives us a chance to let the public know about the methods of election and selection and what we here think of those methods.  Even though we will differ, I doubt if we will separate on the question of the right of the public to know and to understand and, therefore, to enable them to put a more enlightened point of view and a greater depth into their future criticisms. So much for the preamble; I will now deal with the subject matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If most of us did not know of the well-intentioned motive behind the placing of <Col N="993" /> the motion and appreciate the high calibre of the mover and seconder, we might be inclined to the view that there was an air of tempermental impatience with people who vote for and those whom they elect to this House.  We might also be tempted towards the view that the movers believe that certain institutions or organisations produce the only honest ones and that they alone know the score. I refer, of course, not to the mover or the seconder but to the argument about the nominating bodies.  As elected representatives we are entitled to express our views without fear or favour, but that also imposes on us the obligation to ridicule ourselves out of any despairing idea that everything is wrong because it is not 100 per cent right, or that some untried panacea is better that what we have got.  I am glad to say that the mover of the motion recognises this as well and that he did not see any great panacea.  I respect any individual approach to things but I cannot accept the argument that, if only we had the right conditions and good surroundings, we would perform magnificently. This brings me back to the vocational nominating body argument as advanced.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee that those selected or nominated for vocational reasons alone would produce novelty or originality. They may not be live, original people.  I can speak from experience because I dealt with many people in my lifetime who just do not learn from experience, or else they will be mandated one way or the other and be, therefore, a body no different for the elected Seanad resulting from the present methods.  I do not mean to be uncharitable but in circumstances of electing or selecting for specialities we could find ourselves without the right mix and finish up with an orgy of specialisation instead of the wider scope we now enjoy.  I agree that the use of pieces and patches of knowledge, as practised here from time to time, lends itself to being disconnected and distorted. But the fact remains that, because of the system we use and because of the cross section of occupations of the people who elect us, the checks and balances are also <Col N="994" /> in place in the sense that the scope for the wider debate exists as distinct from the specialisation concept.</P>
    <P>The use of half truths, the defects of mental myopia and the suffering of blind spots is not something peculiar to the Dáil or Seanad.  It certainly is not the fault of the people who elect to both bodies: it abounds in all walks of life.  By going the road of specialisation or specific interest alone for the purpose of election or selection are we not risking a furtherance of arrogance on the Irish national family by pushing the idea of class structures which would soon be dominated by the more forceful, who would use their economic power to further social divisions?  We could be talking of aggravating an already differing order of society.</P>
    <P>By confining the method of election or selection we could be advancing the philosophy and ideology of people remote from the choice of the majority of those who constitute that society.  For example, the power of remote financial interests to impose their own controls could well get a boost if the Seanad was dominated by special interest groups mostly geared to business and commerce &mdash; for example, irresponsible multinational organisations are about who owe allegience neither to national government nor international authority and who dictate the speed of technological development no matter what the consequences are on employment.  At least, in the heel of the hunt, under the present system we can hold back indefinitely the creeping in, as can emerge in a specialisation situation, of the soulless society. Presently we can challenge irresponsible decisions by faceless men.  Under any system based on specialist qualifications or vocational business organisations alone, the faceless men could be more than well represented in this House.  I appreciate Senator Ross' observations on the unemployed, the under-privileged, etc., getting representation in the House, but I have only to remind the House of the unemployment marches many years ago when people lay on O'Connell Bridge and there were only about 60,000 unemployed. <Col N="995" /> A man called Murphy became their leader and was elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  God help the poor chap; he was surrounded.  Any special interest groups or people of that calibre would have to do the same as Mr. Murphy.  They could not find anything to advance their cause in the House because society was ganging up on them.  Therefore, it is not true to say that the unemployed could have a real voice in the House.  They would have no more luck with Bills or motions than say, the Independents.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Private Members' Bill. The last Government were guilty of not moving on this issue.  I adjourned the debate on one Private Members' Bill, which has been going on for the past two years and am waiting to continue the debate.  Perhaps through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges something can be done in that respect, or looking at select committees in a favourable way would be another way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the concept of cost-benefit analysis would grow in the system advocated under the motion to the detriment of what we have left of the social benefit analysis.  At the moment people make their choice every four years or so and then they are powerless.  The reason for this is not the way Senators are elected.  It is one of those things that happens in society generally, not only here, but in many cities throughout the world.  If we are really concerned about the fact that people have little influence over the powers and functions of the Seanad, the real answer lies in the devolution of power to local government. Local government people have more direct links at all levels, especially with the community, than this House has.  This would give local government an opportunity to widen the area of choice and to make the choice a little more real for people they are close to.</P>
    <P>Another matter to bear in mind when talking about the manner in which Senators are elected to this House and about county councils is that most county <Col N="996" /> councillors represent about 1,000 votes and they have to get them from the general public to whom they are answerable. They also represent a very wide spectrum of people and collect their votes from a broad stratum of society.  They are shrewd operators and they are the people who, when you sit on a one to one basis with them, will tell you whether you are for real or not.  Any one who has canvassed around the country has come up against situations that we would not like to come up against too often.  The county councils, urban councils and the town commissioners have at hand the raw materials to achieve broad aims for themselves and their community.  If we are serious about the question of power, apart from having a look at ourselves, we might also look at the whole question of devolution in a more effective way.</P>
    <P>We have to stop thinking that ordinary people cannot be responsible and concerned and cannot be interesting to talk to.  They are very interesting to talk to. They are well read.  Most of the people we visit when canvassing have <i>The Irish Times</i> on the table.  I do not often read <i>The Irish Times</i>, I read <i>The Irish Press</i> or the <i>Independent.</i>  They get their information from <i>The Irish Times</i>, as do many other people.  I cannot differentiate between special interest groups and the set up we have now because, in the final analysis, there is a broader mix of shrewd operators who have to get themselves at least 1,000 votes before they are elected.</P>
    <P>Another concern in a situation like this is where do you try to get more specialisation. I do not claim to be right on this but it is worthy of consideration.  It is like the pursuit of absolutes.  That can become very inhuman and tortuous.  Many of us may have had some experience of that. Of course, it is not like electing an Administration. You cannot hire a pragmatist and a prefectionist who will be a good pigeon holer and get things done quickly. On the question of following the procedures of Government through the various committees, there is an aspect of administration running through the whole machinery of electing people which manifests itself in the debates and <Col N="997" /> in Government action and reaction.  In the final analysis, if people had to go through interviews, and so on, it is doubtful that we could get a better mix.  This is a very difficult matter to argue.</P>
    <P>If you are not sure what the situation is liable to be, the best way to deal with it is to carry on on the basis of humanistic compromise.  That is the way we function here.  My concern is that when we talk about specialisation you would think we were talking about altruism.  Even if we were talking about altruism I do not think altruism is possible in the sense that it means being selfless.  I believe that you cannot but be in some way a selfish person.  If you do something for somebody or advocate it you get gratification from doing it so there is an element of selfishness there.  We will not change that situation by bringing in the people who are specialists.</P>
    <P>We talk about adjusting the environment we live in.  It might be a good idea if we started to adjust ourselves instead of the environment and started thinking in terms of settling our own problems inside the House.  In a bicameral Parliament it is difficult to say what power can be given to the second Chamber and where to draw the line.  It has to be a slow process but that does not mean there cannot be reform, or a good concrete proposal put forward and accepted.  It does not say we cannot be effective on select committees or and that we cannot advocate more of them.  It does not say that we cannot consider the question of holding up a Bill for more than 90 days, as at present, as a further check and balance.  There is a lot of scope here.  We must adjust ourselves to this rather than trying to adjust the environment.</P>
    <P>The people who elected me have their own values, aims and standards of conduct. Before I talk to them about what might develop, or what I might do as a Senator, I always bear in mind that these people have been through the mill with the public and that the 1,000 votes they average are a hard earned 1,000 votes. They are right at the nub of the situation.</P>
    <P>I would be afraid to back the motion because I do not think there is a possible <Col N="998" /> way of overcoming some of the difficulties I see in it.  I cannot see that you can do so, for example, by confining the Seanad electorate to nominating bodies or some other method of selection.  To use the vernacular, many &ldquo;lame brains&rdquo; get through in every exercise.  I am not suggesting there are any &ldquo;lame brains&rdquo; here, but it is possible for such a person to reach a certain level in an organisation and to be selected and put into a body like this &mdash; and maybe two or three of them.</P>
    <P>Going back to industry years ago, the people I used to hate dealing with were engineers, because when you were dealing with a personal problem they were talking to you in terms of cubic capacity and square roots.  There are a lot of imponderables in this thing.  I am in favour of giving more scope to Private Members' Bills.  I do not think the Government should be afraid of it, because they have faced up to a rather difficult task and I admire them for that. I would advocate having more select committees and, if we wanted to have a debate again on whether we have made any advance on that, then certainly we should have another debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have to question the motives, particularly in relation to one section of the motion.  Senator Murphy was at pains to explain that it was not a holier than thou attitude that was being adopted in putting forward this motion.  He emphasised that fact strongly.  It suggested to me that he felt that it must have been a holier than thou attitude and he was at pains to explain that it was not.  But, borrowing the phrase from Shakespeare, &ldquo;Methinks that the gentleman doth protest <Col N="999" /> too much&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting by any means to this motion; in fact, I actually welcome it. But I feel that some of the arguments proposed in the motion smack of self-righteous and pompous arrogance.  It was mentioned that a number of Senators were defensive in their contributions.  I do not accept that.  We have a duty, when any group of people are attacked in the manner in which local representatives were attacked, that we have a responsibility to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>I am one of the mere party political hacks so generously described by Senator Ross.  I may not have a high intellectual capacity or be on a high intellectual plane &mdash; I am just an ordinary mortal &mdash; but I can think, would you believe it, and I have opinions to put forward.  I strongly resent being labelled in such a derogatory manner.  I resent the strong implication in the choice of words that local authority elected representatives are a bunch of inferior beings in some shape or form.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that the proposers of the motion, surveying things from their respective ivory towers, may not be aware of the invaluable contribution which local authorities and local councillors make to the affairs of the country. The vast majority of them, apart from their duties as councillors, are members of voluntary and other organisations.  In many respects they represent the views of those important bodies.  Many of the members of local authorities, long before they became county councillors, were members of these other bodies to which Senators Ross and Murphy refer.  They worked selflessly and tirelessly on behalf of the people and deserve more than to be referred to in such a shabby and degrading manner as they have been in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross stated that his problem was that the Seanad was too far party politically orientated and should be taken out of the realms of politics, having already stated that it is a cosy club and to a large degree irrelevant in the eyes of the public.  One does not need to have a degree to predict what its image would be <Col N="1000" /> if we were to accept part of this motion.  It would become so far removed from the people that it would be some sort of an exclusive self-perpetuating mutual admiration society.</P>
    <P>Ken Whitaker was referred to as being a man who was unable to get elected to the Seanad because of the system.  I recognise, appreciate and congratulate Ken Whitaker for the magnificent contribution that he has made to the affairs of this country.  However, I would say to the proposing Senators that, if they were so concerned about Ken Whitaker and the fact that he could not be elected to the Seanad, they should have advised him that perhaps he should have gone on the Universities panel and he might have had more of a chance of being elected, seeing it appears that only the best are elected from those panels.</P>
    <P>If we accept that the elections to the Seanad should be taken out of the political arena and become the preserve of nominating bodies only, I would like to ask one simple question, how many nominating bodies do not have some sort of a political base?  The vast majority of them are composed of people who have political affiliation in some shape or form. Would we then instruct those bodies that no member could hold a political view and that those who do should resign?  I find it difficult to accept that the people who are proposing this motion do not themselves hold some strong political views one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Mention was made that the campaign to elect Senators through the county councils and local authorities was degrading. At least the electorate have the opportunity to meet the candidates and to assess their suitability.  The proposers of the motion are elected by a group of people, the vast majority of whom never meet them and do not even know them. I am one of those individuals.  I have voted a number of times in Seanad elections. I have a vote on the Universities panel and I have never met any of those candidates except for three of the successful candidates &mdash; I have spoken briefly to three of the successful candidates since I came into this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> Senator Murphy stated that the Seanad should become more vocational.  What does &ldquo;more vocational&rdquo; mean?  Is it a little bit more vocational, much more vocational or totally vocational?  You cannot make a blind statement like that and leave it suspended in mid-air.  There is a real need for the system of a bicameral Legislature.  One of the main arguments in its favour, as stated by the Minister for the Environment in the House, is that it helps to safeguard against ill-considered and over-enthusiastic actions by the Lower House and provides a further means by which more detailed consideration can be given to a Bill.  A properly structured and constituted House contributes invaluable expertise to the parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>Many outstanding people have been Members of this House and have made outstanding contributions.  I was elected to the House, having been nominated by the Irish Vocational Educational Association, the governing body for the vocational educational committees.  I am extremely proud to have received that nomination as I am actively involved in that area of education and I hope to reflect and articulate the views of that body in this House.  I would say to the proposing Senators and, in particular Senator Murphy from the National University panel, that I have a vote on that panel and I am very pleased that in future I will be able to match the person to the literature.  I want to assure him that I shall be very objective when in casting my vote.</P>
    <P>I am a new Senator and it just strikes me that Senator Ross saw no difficulty at all about giving up his Seanad vote but did not elaborate on the fact that the votes that he was talking about giving up represent for local authorities, as Senator Harte has mentioned, 1,000 votes per individual councillor whereas on the University Panel it is just one single vote. That distinction has to be made there.  I wonder would he be as quick to give up his vote if it represented 1,000 votes while, in effect, in his case it was just one vote.</P>
    <P>I would have to agree with the second <Col N="1002" /> part of the motion and I take the point involved there in relation to looking at the reform of the proceedings within the House.  I was very pleased with proposals outlined by the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan.  We can do very much to enhance and advance the image of the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to support the other speakers in their total rejection of Progressive Democrats' proposal to abolish the House, and to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their excellent contributions to the House.  The PDs have set themselves up as being some sort of the moral conscience in the political arena.  They are a bunch of do-gooders in actual fact, and my experience of do-gooders over the years is that they achieve very little and that they are generally regarded as disillusioned and frustrated people who seek a popular platform upon which to voice ill-conceived and misguided ideas.  Could I hasten to assure the university Senators that I do not hold any special opinions about their positions here?  In actual fact, I am very glad they are here; one particular individual at least has ideas very close to my own.  I regard them as being Members of this House with whom, on occasion, I would hold common views and with whose views I would differ on other occasions both individually and collectively. Again, I should like to thank the proposer of the motion although I question some of the motives behind it. It does give us an opportunity to debate the whole workings of the Seanad and I hope that moving on from here that we will as a unit within this House all work in close co-operation and association for the improvement of the House in general in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, obviously a man committed to this House and a man committed to the system of local government.  Unfortunately, like the previous speaker I have not got a vote on the university panel although due to my position since being elected to this House I would be qualified <Col N="1003" /> for three votes on the ordinary panels.  I can only exercise one of those as a member of a county council and a borough council and now of this esteemed House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the motion that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to carry out an urgent review of the powers and functions of Seanad Éireann and the methods of election of its members.  I accept that the motives of the proposer and seconder were not based on a holier-than-thou attitude and, that even though it might have seemed like that in one case, it was a genuine effort to get the debate going on this subject. However, I should like to respond to the invitation from the opening speaker in this debate, Senator Ross, who asked Senators to respond to his views on the subject following his contribution.</P>
      <P>I find some of his views extraordinary and certainly demanding of a response. His contribution dealt mainly with the method of election to the Seanad on the vocational panels.  Noticeably, no great amount of his contribution dealt with the method of election on the university panel.  I shall attempt to deal with his contribution in the order in which it was delivered, which may not necessarily be the order of importance.  As reported at column 627 of the Official Report, Volume 116, according to the Senator it would appear to be a crime to be a Member of this Seanad and to be a member of a political party.  This must be contradicted.  He names Senators elected to this Seanad who stood for the Dáil &mdash; and he includes my own name in that regard &mdash; and he concludes from that, that the Seanad is therefore very much their second preference.  If he had done a little more research he would have found that a large number of Senators never stood for the Dáil again after being elected to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall speak for myself only in this regard.  I first stood for this House in April 1982.  I was a Seanad candidate again in December 1982.  I had the honour of being elected to this Seanad <Col N="1004" /> in April this year.  Since I was first a candidate for the Seanad in April 1982 I never stood for the Dáil nor indeed have I sought a nomination to stand for the Dáil.  Even if I did seek a nomination for the Dáil, or even if I were a Dáil candidate in every election, it would not make me any worse a Senator.  Anybody who stands for the Dáil from any party, or as an Independent, feels he or she has something to offer and that would in fact, I believe, make them a better Member of this House.  It is certainly an experience to stand for the Dáil just as it is a great experience to be a Seanad candidate on any panel.</P>
    <P>At column 628 Senator Ross advocates that we should deprive outgoing Senators, TDs and all county councillors of a vote in the Seanad election.  He sees no reason why he as an outgoing Senator should have a vote in the next Seanad election.  There might be some logic in that because outgoing Senators perhaps have a little advantage in being a Seanad candidate next time in having a vote, while other candidates on that panel or other panels might not have a vote but there can be no logic at all in trying to deprive TDs, county councillors and county borough councillors of a vote in Seanad elections.  It is one of the few real powers councillors have left which they can exercise themselves.  They certainly appreciate and respect that right because you will always find, unlike the panel to which the Senator was elected &mdash; I do not know what the electorate for it is but it is a very small proportion of the electorate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>About 58 per cent or slightly over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Slightly over half the electorate vote.  On the vocational panels 100 per cent of the voters vote in every Seanad election.  That is how seriously the voters take their obligations and their duties and it is also a most democratic system.  On each of the panels, to be elected a candidate has to get between 80 votes on the agriculture and labour panels to 120 on the administrative panel and <Col N="1005" /> more on the cultural and educational panel.  Those 80 or 120 councillors have themselves to be democratically elected to their councils before they have a right to vote.  They would represent in combination between 120,000 and 200,000 voters.  That is the number of people necessary to elect enough councillors to give a candidate a quota on any panel.  A vote is not easily earned by those councillors. Many of them stood a number of times for election before they were successful.  Other speakers dealt with the amount of voluntary work which is part and parcel of council work which it is necessary for a councillor to do sometimes when he is a councillor and often before he is even elected to the council.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross referred to the Seanad campaign for the 43 seats on the five panels.  He described the election in four very strong words as &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo;, &ldquo;degrading&rdquo;, &ldquo;humiliating&rdquo; and &ldquo;absurd&rdquo;.  That is very strong language from a Senator who never took part in that election.  It is extraordinary that he can so describe a campaign.  I was on that campaign on three occasions and I must say, contrary to the general belief, that I enjoyed the campaigns I was on.  I found them &mdash; rather than the four words the Senator used in describing them &mdash; educational in many ways and stimulating and I found very helpful the courtesy with which councillors dealt with candidates. I found that also a lesson in political science.  I highly recommend it to Senator Ross instead of the comparatively easy panel he is on.  After one campaign I am sure he would change his view of councillors and their families in view of the very helpful and courteous manner in which they receive candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a change is necessary here &mdash; I am not convinced that it is &mdash; perhaps the country might be divided into regions for the election, say, the European constituencies. I will just take that as an example.  This would give candidates more time to sit down with councillors throughout their areas and find out what people really think.  One way of discovering what direction you are going in is to meet people who represent parties, <Col N="1006" /> no parties or Independents on local authorities. There are no better persons than local councillors to put Oireachtas Members on the right track about the direction we should be taking at national level.  Let us not attempt to do away with one further contact between local councillors and Oireachtas Members.  It should be the lifeline between the local areas and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of column 629 of the same volume of the Official Report the Senator makes an extraordinary accusation, which has to be answered, against Seanad candidates.  I was one of those as was everybody else elected here.  He states that they do not even know who the candidates from the other parties are on their own panel and that the campaign consists of back-stabbing and deals.  That must be contradicted.  This shows how far from reality the Senator is, because anybody who indulges in back-stabbing at any level will soon end up dead politically. There is no shrewder person than a councillor to spot that kind of carry-on and to react accordingly.</P>
    <P>Since Senator Ross put on record the names of the people who stood previously in general elections, I will put on record the candidates on my panel which was the Agricultural Panel.  They were Paul Bradford, Cork, Tom Bruton, Meath, John Coleman, Cork, Peter Finnegan, Meath, Tom Fitzgerald, Kerry, Richard Hourigan, Limerick, Tom Hussey, Galway, George Jeffers, Cork, Rory Kiely, Limerick, Joe Lennon, Louth, Matt Loughnane, Galway, Nicholas McCabe, Louth, myself, Padraic McCormack, Galway, Michael Queally, Waterford, Sib Rooney, Meath, Willie Ryan, Tipperary, Lorcan Allen, Wexford, Donal Brennan, Dublin, John Connor, Roscommon, Michael D'Arcy, Wexford, Michael Ferris, Tipperary, Seán Keegan, Westmeath, Frank McDermott, Westmeath, Charles McDonald, Laoighis-Offaly, Patrick McGowan, Donegal and Martin O'Toole, Mayo.</P>
    <P>I knew every one of them during the campaign and further.  I had a fair idea how they were all doing on the Agricultural <Col N="1007" /> Panel.  Senator Ross picks out one man who did not get elected on a panel.  This candidate got 20 votes.  That was a great vote considering that he did not undertake the drive around the country and sit down with the councillors.  In other words, the full story and the full education are in the canvass.  Nobody got elected to this House on any of the panels without a thorough drive around the country.  I did 8,200 miles myself in the course of the campaign, I am not complaining about that because I believe it was the best education I ever got.</P>
    <P>As well as this debate in this House a further debate is taking place in the media.  I have here a cutting from the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  It quotes Deputy McDowell, the current Progressive Democrat spokesman on nearly everything. He describes the Seanad as a convalescent home attached to the Dáil, and he does not want councillors to have a vote either.  This is colourful language for a person so newly elected to public life, although not new to contesting elections, having been himself a candidate for a different party in the No. 10 area for Dublin Corporation in 1979.  On that occasion he was rejected by the people, receiving about half a quota.  That was his first attempt to become an elector for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I refer to the report of the all-party committee in 1967, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution chaired by the late Deputy George Colley whose daughter is now a well-known PD Deputy.  Also on that committee was Deputy Bobby Molloy, another leading light in the PDs.  The 1967 committee concluded:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that what most countries expect in providing a second House is that they will thereby have a safeguard against ill-considered or hasty action on the part of the first House.  A second group of public representatives will have the opportunity of examining legislation and commenting upon it.  The first House will thereby be given time for reflection on <Col N="1008" /> the utility of the measures which it has proposed.  Furthermore, a reasonable opportunity will be given to affected interests to organise public opinion in relation to controversial matters.  In addition, important technical matters may receive in the second House more comprehensive treatment than it has been possible to give them in the first House.</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from that Committee on which those leading lights of the PDs served.  Of course that was before Deputy McDowell's time and the new-found wisdom of the PDs.</P>
    <P>I want to make this Seanad work.  I will support party moves to that end because people from all walks of life get elected to the Seanad.  There is a great cross section of views and opinions in the Seanad.  If, as the Senators suggested in the course of the debate, the right to vote was taken away from councillors on the panels, I do not think we would get this cross section of representation in this Seanad.  County councillors and borough councillors are people elected from every walk of life.  We have farmers, teachers, labourers, builders, workers, unemployed &mdash; every type of people of both sexes &mdash; on councils and corporations.  As most Senators said there are no better people to judge the issues when they come to vote.  None of us can be elected here without the support of 80 to 120 of those people.  Every voter has the opportunity &mdash; because if he does not get that opportunity the person will not be elected &mdash; to sit down with candidates.  I spent some time in houses when canvassing.  I spent an hour or two hours with councillors, if necessary, and by the time I left I knew a lot more about the problems in that county and that Seanad voter had a better opportunity to assess my capability of being a Senator.  I thank them for their good judgment in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to speak in the Seanad.  I would like to congratulate you.  Sir, on your election as Leas-Chathaoirleach and I would also like to take the opportunity <Col N="1009" /> to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.  I am sure that over the next few years we will have him in this Chamber on many occasions for, as usual, the great contributions from the Minister.</P>
      <P>Our system of government, the conduct of our affairs and our politicians have been attacked severely in the past. While in a healthy democracy the questioning of the organs of State is a very desirable and healthy thing, it is a worrying feature if all this criticism does not come from the general mass of the population but seems to stem from a small minority.  This minority is represented by those on the far Left and the far Right, by the intellectual liberals, whose arrogance presumes an innate right to influence events without any reference to their number, and by groups of individuals, who, because of exposure in the national media, become fonts from which all knowledge and wisdom must flow &mdash; this without any experience or qualification in the subjects on which they pontificate. Their influence is further increased by the coverage they receive in the media.  That is partially due to the fact that by being controversial they help sell newspapers and partly by the fact that the media generally consist of their own ilk who, over a few gin and tonics in trendy bars, decry the standard of those awful public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this whole debate has stemmed from the formation of a new party, the Progressive Democrats, and the desire to come up with policies that could gain popularity for that party with a certain section of the electorate.  You could call that section begrudgers.  They form that part of the electorate that can never be satisfied no matter what Government is in power or what policies that Government pursues for the betterment of our country. One of the first popular questions asked was: why should Ministers and Ministers of State and others after a term in office be able to draw a pension as well as their salaries?  Next, the idea of abolishing the Seanad was mooted by the same party; and then just recently there was a Dáil question, regarding the travelling <Col N="1010" /> expenses and salaries of Senators.</P>
    <P>This is a very low type of politics.  I cannot understand the reason for this question or the logic behind it.  Would the asker of that Dáil question regarding Senators' travelling expenses like to put down a similar question on the expenses and salaries of others such as county managers, county engineers, the highly-paid in our health services or ones which she would be familiar with, her former colleagues in the media, in RTE, reporters and commentators?  Or, are they a protected species?  Is it only councillors', Senators' and Deputies' expenses that should come up for public scrutiny and media criticism.  Forty-three of the Senators in this House are elected by public representatives.  These are hard-working councillors, getting no pay whatsoever only their travelling expenses, and they too come in for far too much media criticism.  If we are to let the public know the incomes of public representatives, then so be it.  But let us also clean the slate, once and for all, and let the public at large know what incomes others have, in the public service, health.  State and semi-State bodies, what they are receiving by way of travelling expenses and salaries &mdash; let it all come out.</P>
    <P>Of course, nearly every newspaper in Ireland jumped on the bandwagon reporting what Senators received in travelling expenses and their salaries.  This edition of <i>The Kingdom</i> of 2 June 1987 carried the healine &ldquo;Handy Expenses&rdquo; and the writer went on to say &ldquo;I noted with more than passing interest a reply to a Dáil question tabled by Deputy Geraldine Kennedy, PDs&rdquo;.  You would wonder why he should note &ldquo;with more than passing interest&rdquo;.  Why was it not just another news item?  He had to put in that it was more interesting because it was Senators' travelling expenses or public representatives' travelling expenses.  In regard to that article, he was referring to the expenses of Senator Daly and former Senator Jim Deenihan.  I regard both Senator Jackie Daly and now Deputy Jim Deenihan as two very hard-working legislators.  They are on the opposite side of the political arena to me.  I know them <Col N="1011" /> very well and I think headlines like this in any newspaper are downgrading to the newspaper itself and to the content of the newspaper.  It should go out loud and clear from this Seanad that it is time for this sniping to stop.</P>
    <P>Now the proposer of this motion used the term, &ldquo;political hacks&rdquo; to describe the Senators of this House who belong to political parties and who have been democratically elected to this House by democratically elected public representatives. I am a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and I was elected to this Seanad on a nomination from the Central Fisheries Board and I will to the best of my ability represent the views of the fishing community in this House.  I will go farther and say I think that, as a fisherman, I can represent the views of the fishermen better than any other Member in this House &mdash; and I am not trying to downgrade any Member.  However, I know what fishing is about.  Could Senator Ross, or any Senator who supports his views, tell me why, just because I am politically active, I should not as a fisherman be allowed to stand or be elected to this Seanad?  I would hope they would answer that question.</P>
    <P>I am a professional fisherman; I have been nominated by a professional body, and I have been elected democratically to this House.  The proposer of this motion has been nominated by a small number of University graduates.  He has been elected by a large number of privileged University graduates who are not representing any professional interest here.  Is there such a thing as a professional graduate?  I do not know; it is up to Senator Ross to answer that.  The only interest group there that they can justifiably claim to represent &mdash; and that in a totally unfair fashion, democratically speaking &mdash; is the pampered, elitist and privileged group who have been fortunate enough to be able to avail of our excellent and generous educational system.  &ldquo;Political hacks&rdquo; in this House have all been nominated by professional bodies and have been democratically elected by public representatives and not <Col N="1012" /> by a tiny elite who elect the university Senators.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, this Seanad is made up of people from all walks of life.  It is representative of people of all professions.  I would like at this stage to compliment the Taoiseach on the choice of people he nominated. Each one of the 11 in his or her own profession has contributed greatly to making our country a better place to live in.  This Seanad is made up of people from all parties plus Independents and, generally, the debates here are excellent. The final result of the business conducted here is generally satisfactory.  As far as I am concerned, there is no need whatsoever to change the function or powers of this Seanad.  It should be used more effectively and vigorously.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned in a contribution to this debate that we should have Question Time to Ministers introduced in the Seanad.  I disagree with that because of the amount of time involved for the Minister and the cost factor in preparing answers.  I would prefer the Seanad to recommend to the Dáil that the Dáil abolish Question Time.  Questions in the Dáil are possibly promoting particular interests of TDs and others.  Time would be saved if we abolished Question Time and the time saved could be used in dealing with the real problems facing our country and our economy.  Question Time is, to me, time-wasting.</P>
    <P>Article 16.1.10 of Bunreacht na hÉireann states:</P>
    <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twentyone years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Article 18.2 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>A person to be eligible for membership of Seanad Éireann must be eligible to become a Member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Are the proposers of this motion suggesting that the constitutional rights of <Col N="1013" /> former TDs, future TDs or politically active people should be set at nought? Article 20 of Bunreacht na hÉireann also sets down the duties and responsibilities of the Seanad as far as legislation is concerned. Do the proposers of this motion intend to ignore this, or do they propose to hold another expensive referendum to change it?  Apart from the Articles quoted, other Articles of Bunreacht na hÉireann refer to the Seanad and its powers and duties.  It referred for instance, to the Council of State of which the Cathaoirleach is a member.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the House of Lords, the US Senate and to the New Zealand systems.  These systems are not applicable to us.  The evolution of the House of Lords and the US Senate stems from different systems of Government and different historical backgrounds and cannot have application here.  Reference to these systems have the same legitimacy as reference to the systems of Government in the head hunting regions of New Guinea.  I am sure Senators Ross and Murphy would not suggest a system of selective cannibalism.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has served the needs and interests of this country well.  It has had as Members, people who have given valuable service and advice to the Oireachtas. It has initiated important and far-reaching legislation.  It is a great pity that in recent times a section of politicians, namely, the Progressive Democrats, have chosen a path to downgrade rather than upgrade the Seanad.  Their comments are self-promoting, unnecessary and insulting to this Seanad.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate enormously and all the comments that have been made in it from all sides and from all angles.  It is indicative of the interest in this debate that it had to be extended twice by the wish of the House, which is most unusual in the Seanad on a Private Members' Motion.  I thank the Leader of the House and all the parties for allowing a full and frank discussion of all the different points of view which have been expressed.  It has been useful and worthwhile. <Col N="1014" /> It may have been self indulgent. We may have been a little defensive about it, but that is only natural.</P>
      <P>I cannot reply to all of the points which were made because they were many.  I cannot even remember them all.  The reason I think it is important that this motion should have been debated is that the Seanad itself is a matter of public concern and has come under a lot of fire recently from the Progressive Democrats. Whether or not they are riding a cheap populist tide, it is up to us to defend ourselves and to improve ourselves. Nobody in this House would contest the fact that the Seanad is under fire or that the Seanad is not a popular institution.  It is not an understood institution, or a body respected by the people.  They do not know much about us but what they know they do not regard as particularly relevant. That is what we should start responding to in this debate, and to a certain extent we have.  I do not think we have done so fully but we should.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about media coverage and many complaints have been made about it.  I, personally, do not blame the media for not giving the Seanad a lot of coverage.  The reason the Seanad is not given a lot of coverage is that the Seanad is not selling newspapers. It is as simple as that.  The Seanad does not sell newspapers because the Seanad does not appear to be relevant to those who sell newspapers.  It is up to ourselves, as a result, to make the Seanad appear more relevant.  That is what I think this debate is partly about.  It is about becoming more relevant so that the media actually want to cover it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I made &mdash; and I think too many people took it personally &mdash; was that the Seanad to a large extent merely reflects the business that is going on in the Dáil.  Newspaper proprietors, owners and editors regard it as repetition of what is going on in the Dáil.  Indeed, it is in many cases repetition of what is going on in the Dáil.  Still we do not get enough coverage.  Were we to carve out a different role for ourselves, a different identity in the public mind, to discuss different issues from different angles, we would <Col N="1015" /> get more media coverage.</P>
    <P>It has to be admitted that many of the debates here have already taken place in another place.  The same points have been made and the same party political points have been made.  It is not really great media coverage to cover a similar, almost identical, debate for a second time.  If we are not to complain about the media, we must give them something to write about.  Some of the time we are not doing so.  This debate has given them something to write about.  I make no apology to those who say the motives of those who proposed this debate were publicity-orientated. On issues like this I will deliberately court publicity.  I will look for it. There seems to be something wrong in raising an issue which is sensitive to Members of this House and then going out and trying to get the media to cover it.  On any issue of this type, or any other issue which I consider is important, I will look for, and positively court, the press so that they will cover it.  I make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should ask ourselves what we, as a body, have achieved in the past few years.  Can we point to any particular achievement of the Seanad and say; &ldquo;We did this, that, the other.  We gave a lead on this particular issue.  We stopped that.  We initiated that.&rdquo;?  I am afraid by that yardstick our record is lacking. We have not been a particularly innovative body.  We have not been an original body.  We have not done things which have stuck in the public conciseness, where the public have said: &ldquo;The Seanad has done this, which is important to us.&rdquo;  That is, I am afraid, our fault.  I want to refer to the whole thrust of what I said at the beginning. Perhaps the language was too colourful. I apologise if the language, the nouns or the adjectives, offended anybody, because they were not meant to.  I have no gripe against any particular Member of this House.  Every Member of this House has a worthwhile contribution to make.  The point I was trying to make was that I felt that, if we were to carve out <Col N="1016" /> a relevant separate identity for ourselves, we should be less party political in nature.</P>
    <P>This is not at all an advertisement or a promotion for Independents or University Senators.  It is just an argument against reflecting what happens somewhere else.  You only have to see, not only those cases of people who have stood for the Dáil here, but the tone of the motions which are put down by political parties.  Two weeks ago the Fine Gael Party put down a motion, which was discussed, about health cuts.  To me that is repetitious of what happened in the Dáil. It will not achieve an awful lot.  You have a vote on it, it will be defeated, and they will all happily go back to their constituencies, as they refer to them, and say: &ldquo;Well, we tried to do something in the Seanad about it.  But we could not&rdquo;. I do not believe that this House should be used for blatantly party political reasons. We are doing that too much.  Other issues from other angles should be discussed. The only way, I submit, to do this is to promote more vocational bodies having direct input into what happens here.  I see nothing wrong.  Senator Fitzgerald, with party politicians.  I like party politicians. I prefer them to Independents, in fact.  I find they have more definite things to say. But I do not think that they should necessarily be in here.</P>
    <P>I was asked to talk about the system of election which exists in the Seanad for the 43 Members who are elected.  I have said some very critical things about them. I say to Senator McCormack that I did not make any criticism of any councillor's families.  I feel that was probably going a little bit far.  I criticised the system of councillors having elections.  I did not mention their families at all.  In fact, I feel sorry for their families having these constant visitors around election time, but I made no criticism of them at all. What I did mention quite specifically was back-stabbing, people going around not knowing who was standing in that particular panel on the opposite side but knowing who was in their own political party.  I happen to be, and have been for the last three or four Seanads, an elector <Col N="1017" /> in this particular constituency.  The question that I, as an Independent, always ask people who canvas my vote is: &ldquo;Who else is on your panel?&rdquo;, which seems to me to be a reasonable question.  In the vast majority of cases the reply is only those people in their own party.  They are the people they have to beat.  Frequently when I ask them &mdash; and I do not mind which party they are on &mdash; who is on the other side, they do not know.  I speak from pure personal experience.  It has not just happened once; it has happened time and time and time again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I like interruptions.  I want to deal with one or two specific points. Senator Willie Ryan who made probably the most honest remark in the speeches which I heard during this debate, defended specific the Seanad as it stands now.  As far as I can see from Senator Ryan's and Senator Fitzgerald's speeches, they did not want to see any changes at all.  That is perfectly understandable. But Senator Ryan went on to make the very point which I am trying to emphasise now.  He said that many people did their apprenticeship here for the Dáil and that everybody here &ldquo;wanted to get to the Dáil eventually&rdquo;. Those were his words.  I do not think that is necessarily true.  That is what is wrong. He went on to say that Senators worked 365 days a years, 18 hours a day, and that they do the same work as a Deputy.  They are very badly rewarded, as he said for such work.  I do not believe they should be doing that sort of work.  What he was saying was that they are very vulnerable people who work very hard and who are very underpaid and ill-rewarded for it. That, I think, is absolutely wrong. Nobody should be expected to duplicate the work of a Dáil Deputy in the Seanad. Nobody should be expected to do what <Col N="1018" /> he refers to as &ldquo;constituency work&rdquo; 18 hours a day.  That is not what they are paid to do here.  I am afraid it is expecting much too much of them to do it.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia made several remarks with which I do not agree.  She said, in particular, that there was an element of superiority in what I said about the other Senators elected. Nothing could be further from the truth. What I was pointing out was that what I wanted to see was people coming from different backgrounds with different loyalties. I went through all sorts of sections &mdash; and listed them in my opening speech &mdash; where I would like to see particular representation coming from.  I tried to emphasise.  Senator Bulbulia, that those who are under-privileged in society should be the first to be represented in this House.  There was no element of superiority.  I was critical of the system, because I do not like the system.  It produces a certain sameness in the people involved, but certainly I was not referring to superiority in what I said.</P>
      <P>One of the things I do not think Senator Bulbulia should be doing in this House &mdash; and using the House to do, is to attack a political party and to make political points against a political party in a scripted speech, a party with which she had very well-known flirtations not so very long ago.  It is a pity that the House should be exploited for her and her own domestic political purposes to attack the Progressive Democrats.  That may or may not be in the past, but it was an irrelevant point.  It was a point which might domestically suit her, but I do not want to see the Seanad being used for the local newspapers or for local benefit for particular parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also say that I was challenged by Senator Bulbulia to mention any specific cases of back-stabbing in the Seanad campaign.  Senator Bulbulia canvassed me during the campaign three times.  I will say no more than this, but that she was not immune completely from saying things about members of her own party. I do not blame her for this.  I am sorry to have to repeat a private conversation &mdash; I did not repeat it but revealed elements <Col N="1019" /> of it.  But, if I am challenged with that, I am told it is &ldquo;arrogant nonsense&rdquo;.  I have to come clean on it and say she is not alone in it, but they all do it.  Everybody runs down members of their own party. I withdraw that.  Not everybody does it; some members do not.</P>

That is something which I deeply regret.  That is a charge which sticks.  That is something which should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Lanigan's offer to set up a committee &mdash; I have not got time to deal with procedures &mdash; to actually tackle the procedures which have been criticised here and to tackle the problems of Adjournment Matters which are far too narrow and which are again used for local political advantage, and to tackle the problems of Question Time on which I do not agree with Senator Fitzgerald. It would enliven the proceedings of this House enormously to have the cut and thrust of Question Time.

      <P>I am pleased that the Minister of State at the Department of Education is here this evening to respond to the debate.  A Leas-Chathaoirligh, at the outset, may I indicate to you that I have offered some of my time to my Labour Party Seanad colleague from Waterford, Senator Brian O'Shea, who is on the staff of this school?  It is in direct response to the wish of the people who attended a public meeting in Waterford on Monday night last to discuss this school that the public representatives in the Waterford constituency should approach this matter on a non-party political basis.  It is in earnest of my wish to observe that that I have offered to share my time with Senator O'Shea, who has an intimate knowledge of this school since he is a member of the staff.</P>
      <P>The school in question, St. Paul's primary school in Lisduggan, is situated in an area which houses approximately 9,500 people.  It is a good area.  The people there are hardworking but, like so many places in the country, it is an area which experiences a fairly high level of unemployment.  There are 600 children at this school and 22 teachers.  It is no exaggeration to say that these children are being schooled in what is, to my mind and, indeed, the minds of all people who attended the public meeting on Monday night, the most substandard school building in Waterford city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have visited the school.  I have seen the very real difficulties there for myself. I should like to commend the senior principal of the school, Patrick Bacon, the junior principal, Mary McCarthy, the board chairman, Nicholas Power, the <Col N="1021" /> Parish Priest, Fr. Power, the cleaning and ancillary staff and everybody who has anything to do with this school.  Certainly they are working in very adverse conditions. The children, too, are experiencing a degree of disadvantage because of the nature of the infrastructure of the school.</P>
    <P>The substandard section houses 220 pupils or thereabouts.  They belong to the senior section of the primary school and range in age from nine to 13 years.  Today, and for several years past in this senior section, which is in deplorable condition as I have already stated, the pupils are experiencing great hardship.  Certainly, the public representatives at the meeting were informed in no uncertain terms by all present that they felt enough was enough.</P>
    <P>This school was opened in July 1968 in the Manor of St. John, an old family residence which had been vacated by its former owners.  The opening at the time was seen as an emergency measure and was accepted by all concerned as an attempt to meet the educational needs of the children in the area.  This was the latest housing development in Waterford and was expanding with great rapidity. Parents and teachers proved more than reasonable in their acceptance of these less than ideal conditions at the time. One is tempted to ask if this very reasonableness is now being viewed as a passive acceptance by the Department who are not, or who not certainly seem to be, viewing this school as a priority case.  I want to emphasise to the Minister of State that the people in Waterford see it as a priority.</P>
    <P>Many inspectors from the Department of Education have visited the school.  In 1984 an architect was asked to submit plans.  These were gone into in fine detail. The project was actually costed at £485,000 in 1987.  The parish commitment to that would be in the region of £50,000 to £60,000.  The people there are prepared to take on the burden of that kind of debt to indicate their wish to have the children schooled in acceptable surroundings.</P>
    <P>There are many ironies attached to <Col N="1022" /> all of this.  Last year, for example, good grants were given to the school.  Purchased with these moneys were a television, a video, a computer, a tape recorder and some basketball equipment, all of this fine new equipment.  The school has a curriculum which is as good as that of any other school in the country.  All the equipment, purchased by State funds, is being used in what are positively Dickensian surroundings.</P>
    <P>There are administrative problems which I witnessed when I visited the headmaster. The secretary is in one part of the school and the senior principal is in another.  I met the senior principal in a tiny office in the substandard section of the school.  If he had occasion to speak to the parents of a child, the three of them could barely fit in the one room.  I saw 37 children in a classroom which was probably fine in its day when it was constructed in the prefab but which, in terms of today's spatial allowance for pupils, is too small.  These 37 pupils were very tightly packed in together.  I know from having talked to parents that this breeds a certain irritability in children.  It is more difficult from the teaching point of view to run a class when students are a bit more congested than they should be.</P>
    <P>Thousands of pounds have been spent by the board of management on remedial work.  At this stage it is a matter of throwing good money after bad.  Frankly, the options for repair have run out.  It is impossible to open the windows in many parts of this sub-standard section, because if you do they will fall out.  The school has adopted the expedient of boarding up many of the windows, which makes the rear part of the school look fairly embattled.  All in all it is a depressing environment for education and is quite unacceptable.  It is an embarrassment to the teachers and it is a serious handicap to them in their efforts to instil some pride in their community in the pupils they teach.</P>
    <P>Currently, the roofs in this flat roof building leak in many places.  Five rooms in all are quite severely affected by this. The doors and the windows are rotting and the toilet facilities leave a lot to be <Col N="1023" /> desired.  These prefabs, which are on a solid concrete base, have been in existence since 1970.  Normally one expects a ten to 12 year life expectancy from such buildings.  It is quite obvious that in 1987 they have far overrun their time.  In fact, those who were around when they were put in were told by officials of the Department that they had a certain functional obsolescence, which is a marvellous term and which is meant to indicate that they have a life span.  They have certainly come to the end of that life span from what I have seen.</P>
    <P>The crucial issue, the bottom line and the question which I hope the Minister will answer here this afternoon is when will permission be given to go to tender in the case of St. Paul's primary school. Already the go-ahead has been given to draw up plans, and permission for the bill of quantities has been given.  Could permission to go to tender be given in October or November so that this school can be included in the 1988 Estimate and can a start be made in the spring of next year?</P>
    <P>The board of management, the staff, the pupils and parents need hope.  They need assurances that their genuine needs are recognised and will be responded to by those in authority.  It is not good enough, in 1987, for pupils, teachers and all connected with this school to experience the degree of substandard facility which is their lot at present.  I earnestly entreat the Minister to be positive in his response, despite the fact that there are constraints on spending.  Indeed, all present at the meeting recognised that. They did not feel they were asking for something which was not their due.  They have been patient and I want the Minister of State to recognise that.  They need hope and encouragement.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <P>At the outset I thank Senator Bulbulia for affording me half of her time to deal with this very urgent and important Adjournment Matter.  As she stated, I am a member of the staff of that school.  I have been there since 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> The St. Paul area in Waterford has grown from a green field in the sixties to its present population of 9,500.  The school was opened in 1968 at a time when a number of larger schools had been built in urban areas but the expected numbers did not materialise, leaving spare classroom space that never came into use. That famous term, already alluded to, &ldquo;functional obsolescence&rdquo; was used.  The first section of St. Paul's school was built with a limited time span in view.  It was a prefabricated, wooden framed building.</P>
    <P>As St. Paul's school developed the numbers increased very rapidly.  At the various stages both teachers and pupils suffered short term hardship.  There is an old house near the school, the Manor of St. John, a very historic building which is in community use.  It was there that the school started.  At various times classes were held in the Manor of St. John while extensions were under construction.  A room in the parish Church was used at another time.  For a period two teachers and two classes shared one room, one group going in for the morning period and the other group going in for the afternoon.</P>
    <P>There has always been excellent parent support for the school.  The standard in the school has always been extremely high.  The spirit of co-operation between the school and the community brought the school through the period of growth and development, with its many difficulties. As time went by, the school reached the stage when it became necessary to divide it into a senior and a junior section.  The senior school remained in the original building and the junior school was placed in the two later extensions which were built in the conventional style with a much longer life expectancy and much better facilities.</P>
    <P>As the years passed, however, the senior school gobbled up money on necessary repairs.  Despite all this, there was a perceptible deterioration.  Sums of money made available from the Department of Education in recent years proved totally inadequate and the board of management began discussions with the Department to have the building <Col N="1025" /> replaced and to add necessary facilities so that the school could operate to its maximum potential in the interests of its 295 pupils.</P>
    <P>The type of conditions which obtained in the school are certainly not conducive to full job satisfaction for its 11 teachers. Some years ago a school uniform was successfully introduced into the school. This has added to the pupils' pride in their school and in their area, but the physical appearance of the school, both inside and out, does not stimulate the pupils.  The school environment plays a very big part in developing the pupils aesthetically.  Unfortunately, the building as it stands does not help this.</P>
    <P>There are also the health factors. There are leaks in five classrooms.  There is a type of mineral felt roof on the early section and once that starts to leak it is very difficult to deal with.  Indeed, in recent times teachers were forced to leave classrooms because of leaks and at present two classes in the senior school are occupying classrooms in the junior school.</P>
    <P>However, until six months ago the board of management and the teachers were happy that a six classroom extension, with a general purpose room, a new principal's office, a medical room and a library would be provided in the near future.  The teachers who were consulted at various stages during the design process saw an end to their problems and were prepared to continue on in the less than satisfactory conditions in the short term.  About six months ago all progress stopped.  Letters to the Department of Education went unanswered and the teachers, earlier this year, informed the chairman of the board of management that, unless something was done in the immediate future, the matter would be referred to the INTO for appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The problems with the school building relate not only to leaks.  Ventilation is another severe problem because windows cannot be opened.  The toilet facilities are inadequate.  Because the school was designed piecemeal there are different levels on the school site.  This involves a <Col N="1026" /> certain level of unnecessary danger in the play area.  Indeed, because the school was not designed as a unit there are many problems regarding access from one area of the school to another.</P>
    <P>The proposed replacement which, in effect, is an extension of the junior school complex, will rectify many of the existing problems relating to lay-out.  Because of the different levels of the school complex, the back playground is often flooded in heavy rain.  This causes huge problems in terms of access to and exit from the senior school classrooms.  The senior school has no general purposes hall and has only limited access to the general purposes hall in the junior school.  The remedial class is in a converted hallway and dampness comes through the tiled floor.  The remedial teacher has to place heavy duty polythene on the floor to protect rolls of paper and other materials from the dampness.</P>
    <P>The teachers, parents, pupils and board of management have been more than reasonable throughout the life of the school.  Up to six months ago it appeared that the unfit building would be demolished and that at long last a satisfactory school complex would be provided for both the senior and the junior school. For six months now the school has been ignored and the patience of the parents and teachers has finally run out.  It was proposed at a meeting with parents last Monday night to withdraw children from the school until there is a firm commitment to provide the badly needed and long overdue replacement building.  The teachers have referred the matter to the INTO for strong action and the district representative is about to undertake a full investigation and then report on the conditions in the school to the national executive of the union who will then decide on the next step.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a community that has made great strides in spite of many economic difficulties.  There is quite a level of unemployment in the area, but the parents have put tremendous effort into helping the school.  I could not begin to describe the many ways they have helped over the years.  The attitude of the <Col N="1027" /> staff, of the board of management and of the parents at all times has been one of dealing with difficulties as they arise.  We have compromised on many issues so that the school could function as effectively and efficiently as possible despite all difficulties. But we have reached the stage now where, unless this building is provided very rapidly, much of the work that has been done in the school is put at risk. For instance, we have no proper library room.  There are library books in the school but the access of pupils to those books is limited because of the lay-out of the school and the absence of a proper display area.  We have computers, videos, etc. but our major problem is that there is no effective area to bring the pupils to.  The new technology which has been provided &mdash; and I recognise the generous grants that came from the Department of Education and which helped to provide these &mdash; is not being utilised to the full and the pupils are not benefiting to the full.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely imperative that a commitment be given that money will be provided for this school in the Estimates as soon as possible.  If the money is not provided before the spring of next year it means that the staff and the pupils have to spend another winter in this building. That in itself is totally unacceptable.  We want a commitment that this will be the last winter that the pupils of St. Paul's are subjected to these conditions.</P>

      <P>First, I apologise for being slightly late and holding up the House.  Secondly, I wish to thank you for welcoming me on my first occasion to address this hallowed House.  It is a pleasure for me to do so.  Long may this House continue to do the good work it has been doing.  I have a keen interest in the debate that has taken place in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Bulbulia and Senator O'Shea for their contributions on the question of the improvement of Lisduggan national school.  I am aware of the serious situation that exists there.  The <Col N="1028" /> Department of Education are concerned about the condition of the buildings and are anxious to proceed as quickly as possible with the improvement.  However, we have serious difficulties to contend with, which I will outline for you in a moment.</P>
    <P>As both Senators have said, the school is divided into junior and senior schools and there are prefabricated classrooms which require to be replaced.  The need for replacement was brought to my Department's attention in September 1982 by the local inspector.  Having had discussions about the matter with the school authorities, it was generally agreed that the temporary accommodation was unsuitable and should be replaced.  In February 1984 the chairman of the school's board of management made formal application for grant-aid for the provision of six permanent classrooms and the appropriate ancillary accommodation.  The processing of the application commenced in February 1984.  My Department agreed in principle to grant aid the cost of providing an extension which would bring the permanent accommodation of each of the schools up to nine classrooms.  In August of 1984 my Department authorised the reverend chairman to employ his own design team to prepare architectural plans and the planning process has now reached the stage where an acceptable plan has been produced.  The next step in the proceedings will be to negotiate with the school authorities for a suitable local contribution.</P>
    <P>The planning of the project has not been without complexities but it is sufficient to say that the way is now clear for the conclusion of this phase of the planning process.  I have little doubt that it will be possible to reach agreement with the school authorities on the local contribution element of the cost.  It will, of course, be necessary to carry out the usual check on enrolments trends.  This is a standard procedure when any major building project reaches a decisive stage in this case the prelude to the preparation of the tender documents.  When the matter of the local contribution has been settled &mdash; and I am instructing my <Col N="1029" /> Department's primary building branch to take up this matter with the school authorities as soon as possible &mdash; the project will be listed for authorisation to proceed to the preparation of the tender documentation.</P>
    <P>The timing of the authorisation will depend on the availability of capital to finance the project.  This is where the difficulty arises.  I must point out to the House the extreme difficulty we are faced with in the Department of Education at present in that at my last count we had approximately 60 projects at this stage &mdash; ready for receipt of tender documentation &mdash; but held up for the simple reason that we cannot allow them to go out to tender until we are in a position to finance them in a fairly reasonable period of time following on invitation to tenders. The entire 1987 allocation had been expended by the previous Government before they left office.  Therefore, at present I am faced with the difficulty that, the full allocation for 1987 is expended, and I have approximately 60 projects sitting there waiting to go to tender.</P>
    <P>Since I took over this position in the Department of Education I have had a stream of deputations and questions in the Dáil and representations from Senators and TDs and school managers around the country about their particular cases.  It is clear that there are several hundred cases of a similar nature to Lisduggan. Clearly, it is going to take quite some time before those cases reach commencement of construction stage. Approximately 25 cases went to tender this year and that does not include the 60 waiting in that position at present. Lisduggan is at a stage behind those 60 and therefore it gives an indication of the pressures that are on at the moment. In fact, I have asked my Department officials to give me some indication of what length of time it would take to deal with all the plans which are now on the planning boards.  They tell me at the present and most recent rate of progress it would take approximately eight years.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, faced with a very serious problem.  I have chosen to spell out exactly to everybody what the extent <Col N="1030" /> of this problem is.  My Department are now in the process of trying to give priority to the various schemes.  We will decide what are the most urgent cases to be proceeded with on the basis of unfit and over-crowded accommodation and we hope to come forward with those priority lists for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>Our second objective at present is to try to reduce construction costs as far as possible.  At present my Department are actively engaged in trying to design buildings which will be of first-class specification standard but at the lowest possible cost.  We will be attempting to replace existing structures rather than constructing new schools, because the day of building new schools at a cost of £400,000 and £500,000 is gone.  We have to go back to simpler methods of design and cheaper methods of construction, and we are engaged in that process at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I have to view Lisduggan school.  I will take careful note of the points made by both Senators today.  I will have an official from my Department visit the school to give me an up-to-date report on its condition, to establish exactly how serious it is in relation to other projects which are ahead of it in the planning stages.  But, I have to be bluntly honest and say that we will have no progress in regard to this school this year.  I am concerned at the fact that we may not have much progress next year either if we proceed with the projects which are ahead of Lisduggan in planning.</P>
    <P>In order to establish how serious the problem is, we will have an immediate look at the school and consider it in the context of how it rates on a priority basis with other schools throughout the country. Perhaps I did not understand this while I was on that side of the House. Listening to the story which I heard today from both Senators, which I am satisfied is correct, and the facts about every other project throughout the country, it is very difficult to know exactly what to do, or what schemes or projects should be allowed to go forward.  We will look at all the projects and decide which are of <Col N="1031" /> urgent priority and try to deal with them. Hopefully, I will be putting those priorities before politicians and attempting to get agreement on the worst cases and therefore we will proceed with them.</P>
    <P>The number of man-hours lost in my Department in dealing with representations from all of us, including myself, is much too great.  We are clogging up the system.  If we can agree on what the priorities are, understanding that only so many can go ahead each year for the next two to three years, we can allow our officials to get on with the job of dealing with the planning of those projects and, in particular, get on with the job of attempting to do it on the basis of reduced costs as far as possible.  I am quite satisfied that costs of up to £40,000 per classroom are far too high and costs of building schools at £350,000, £400,000 and <Col N="1032" /> £500,000 are far too high.  If we are to continue with this level of what I described as Rolls Royce building, it will be a long time before we reach the cases that are in need of immediate attention.</P>
    <P>I hope that is satisfactory.  I am sure it is not, but I feel an obligation to spell out the reality of the situation.  I would love to be able to say to the Senators that Lisduggan school will be put to tender before the end of the year but I have to be mindful of the situation.  I will certainly have this school examined and report further to both Senators having done so and, at that stage, perhaps, we will be able to see where it rates in the priorities with other schools around the country.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 17 June 1987.</P>
