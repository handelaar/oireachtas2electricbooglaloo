	<P>I have received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the processing of medical card applications continues to be provided in Ballybofey, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to resolve the stand-off between his Department and Killarney jarveys on the ongoing horse dung issue, which needs consultation and dialogue involving all the parties and the licensing authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to confirm if an application has been made for financial assistance from the EU globalisation fund to assist workers made redundant from Waterford Crystal and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to comment on the plans he has for the Cork docklands and if he will comment on the deliberations and work of the Cork Docklands Development Forum.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Doherty, Coghlan and Coffey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Buttimer may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>Last night in this House we saw a pathetic display of weakness from the Green Party, a party that was demolished in the recent elections.  Last night the Green Party did not back the Government, of which it is part.  If it is not going to vote for the Government, why does the Green Party not pull out of Government?  Why does it continue to keep Fianna F&aacute;il and this ineffectual Government in power?  The behaviour last night was a sign of weakness, not strength.  It illustrated exactly what the Irish people know, that the Green Party in government is not listened to by Fianna F&aacute;il&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and is unable to get its core principles implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ask questions of the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that the Government is seeking refuge in the Oireachtas recess.  There is much important, unfinished business to be done in this House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of areas are extremely important and require further discussion, debate and review by this House.  The report of an bord snip nua is being presented to Government today.  Presuming the report is published, we will not be in session to discuss its vital recommendations.  The implementation plan for the Ryan report was meant to be published in July.  Again, that report should be discussed in this House.  That vital report was critical of society and we should be here when it is given to Government so that we will have an opportunity to discuss its recommendations.  If we owe anything to the victims whose plight was outlined in the Ryan report, we should be here to discuss the recommendations and the report of the Minister of State with special responsibility for children and young people, Deputy Barry Andrews.</P>
        <P>We have yet to hear whether the Minister of State has information for this House on the bilateral agreement with Vietnam.  Does the Leader have information for the House in that regard?  Hundreds of families are waiting to hear the outcome of the visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to Vietnam and whether agreement can be reached on this critical bilateral agreement for many families.</P>
        <P>This House will adjourn today, at a time when thousands of people are losing their jobs and the unemployment rate is fast approaching 15%.  No job creation programme has been put forward by the Government.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not come to the House to explain how the Government proposes to assist hard-pressed families, hundreds more of which each day are newly faced with unemployment.  We will oppose the Order of Business on the grounds that the Seanad should sit next week to get on with the task of addressing these important issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from the points raised yesterday by my colleague, Senator Coffey, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow us to discuss last week&rsquo;s decision by the Cabinet to exclude new applicants to the fourth round of the rural environment protection scheme.  This is an important source of income to many small farmers, being worth an average of more than &euro;8,000.  Many farmers are dependent on this revenue as part of what is a meagre income by today&rsquo;s standards.  We should show solidarity with the farmers protesting against this decision in Dublin today.  Will the Leader facilitate even a short debate on the matter?</P>
        <P>It is odd that the Seanad will not assemble even for a short period in the coming weeks to discuss a report as significant as that of an bord snip nua.  Despite the many challenges the State faces, it seems we must put something as trivial as scheduling ahead of the national interest.</P>
        <P>With apologies to Senator Daly, I ask the Leader to allow a debate at some future date on how we might become more like the House of Lords.  Last evening, the British Government suffered a defeat when Members of the House of Lords voted to remove a clause which would have brought an end to the common travel area between our two islands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The interesting point is that Britain&rsquo;s immigration Minister agreed to accept the amendments.  It would be nice to have a similar parliamentary process in this State, whereby the Upper House could vote down an amendment without it resulting in the collapse of the Government.  A more mature approach and an openness to good ideas would be welcome.  That would lead to a more empowered Legislature.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>An issue that is of grave concern to me and many others is the decision of the European Court of Human Rights to hear a challenge to our abortion law before its grand chamber of 17 judges by three Irish women.  Quite apart from the merits or substance of this case, it is a very serious matter if any international body to which we are party should question our law on this most fundamental and significant of human rights and human dignity issues.  Moreover, it would raise questions about the propriety of our continued membership of a body such as the Council of Europe and our adherence to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights if what we end up with is a bastardised form of human rights which does a violence to human dignity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The preamble to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is the most widely ratified convention internationally, contains language to the effect that the child, by reason of his or her vulnerability, requires physical and legal safeguards before and after birth.</P>

	<P>How is it intended to fund the management of the swine flu pandemic in the State?  I attended a briefing yesterday at which Dr. Tony Houlihan informed us that it is expected that up to 1 million people, or 25% of the population, may succumb to the virus in the coming autumn and winter.  Up to 1,000 people may require life support in the hospital system.  In the past, budgets were set aside to deal with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the decision to recall pork products.  How is it proposed to deal with this pandemic without choking the entire hospital system?  This is an unknown virus and the impact of infection on such a potentially large scale is unknown.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the matter in the House.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has accepted that the contents of the report by an bord snip nua should be debated by the public.  It is also important that the report be debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It merits a recall of the House to facilitate that debate.  It should not be left to languish over the summer.  Moreover, the recommendations contained therein should be kept entirely separate from the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, the outcome of which is of great importance.  We must all concentrate our minds in order to ensure people are not confused by issues not relevant to the treaty itself.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman has expressed concerns that elderly people may have been inappropriately sold certain investment products.  Institutions who engage in such activity should be named and shamed.  Such behaviour is an absolute disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Recent speculative newspaper articles have suggested that an bord snip nua report recommends that Shannon Development, the enterprise body for the mid-west region, should be wound up or, at best, amalgamated with some other organisation.  This has been greeted with dismay in the region, where Shannon Development has delivered a fantastic service for decades.  It has pioneered broadband provision, opened some 60 technology and business parks and recently secured the &euro;500 million LNG project for north Kerry.  Oireachtas Members in Kerry, Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary and the south midlands are fully supportive of the work of Shannon Development, as are all local authority members in the region.  The chairman of the board, Councillor John Brassil, is a colleague of mine in Kerry and one of the best councillors in the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No names should be mentioned.  There is to be no canvassing.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authority members are very much in touch with local opinion.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that Shannon Development, unlike some organisations and quangos of which there are so many in the State, is self-financing, generating income from its own activities.  It is not too late to do something about the recommendation in the report of an <Col N="1331"/>bord snip nua, if what we have heard is accurate.  Since the days of the French Revolution, tribunals have been noted for throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  This may be a classic example of that.  Nobody is expecting an bord snip nua to present a love letter to the public.  We all know a hard rain will fall, as Bob Dylan said.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>An bord snip nua must know what it is about before closing such an important body.  Will the Leader raise this issue with the Minister as a matter of urgency before the report is published?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a nice photograph in <i>The Irish Times</i> today accompanying an article outlining how a Dublin mother of ten from Stillorgan, Ms Ann Stapleton, was called to the Bar yesterday.  The article observes that this &ldquo;must be a first for the Law Library&rdquo;.  I congratulate Ms Stapleton on her achievement.  However, since <i>The Irish Times</i> is the newspaper of record, I must point out that my mother, Mary Regan, the mother of 13 children, qualified for the Bar in 1990 at the age of 75.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.  I hope the Senator has a question for the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stated some time ago that trust in Government has been eroded.  He should look no further than his own party in this regard, including those who are Members of this House.  During yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009, Senator Boyle stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I hope that in a short timeframe legislation of this type will not be needed and we will live in a more peaceful, prosperous and safe society.  On those grounds I support this Bill, albeit reluctantly.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Hiding behind the numbers that Fianna F&aacute;il Senators could muster yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should put a question to the Leader on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a question coming for the Leader. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hiding behind those numbers, they abstained on this legislation.  Contrast this with the statement of Senator Dan Boyle last week on the Defamation Bill and blasphemy law, which he said was archaic and should be made obsolete.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should deal with today&rsquo;s Order of Business, not business that was discussed last week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>During the European election, Senator de B&uacute;rca stated that the Green Party would not be proposing this measure.  It is a blatant form of dishonest politics when people can get up and say one thing, while voting the other way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.  It might be the last sitting day of this session, but we do not want a comedy here.  This is serious business.  Senators should put questions to the Leader on the Order of Business and if not I will call the Leader to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a serious note, I am disappointed that we have had no debate on the fishing industry despite the four requests I have made since Easter.  I am acutely aware that the Minister was ill for some time.  I accept that situation but he should attend a debate on the fishing industry as a matter of priority when we return from the recess.  I also wish to support my colleague who sought a debate on farming, which is well overdue.  That should also be a priority when we return for the new session.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to raise an issue that is of great concern to me having been born in a coastal area.  It concerns the current search off the Cork coastline for two people who are missing after a fishing expedition.  Unfortunately, this is a far too frequent occurrence along our coastline.  Many people living inland have no idea of the severity and ferociousness of the Atlantic swell, which can sometimes hit our coasts five or ten metres high &mdash; as high as a two-storey house.  Far too often, people from eastern Europe in particular, who have no knowledge of the Irish coastline, go fishing.  In this unfortunate case, a father took his 13 year old boy to do some fishing on Cod Head on the Beara Peninsula.  Such accidents occur all too frequently, I ask the Leader to use the influence of the House to suggest that local authorities should erect warning signs in remote coastal areas.  It is obvious to most local people that it is unsafe to fish from rocks in these areas, but such accidents have occurred in Clare and Kerry also.  Every year we lose seven or eight people off our coastline in such circumstances.  We should have a debate on the safety aspects involved, as well as demanding that the dangers should be signalled.  There is a long summer ahead, but some people are foolhardy enough to go rock fishing in areas that are absolutely unsafe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business on the basis that the Seanad should be sitting longer.  Recent days have shown the need for more sitting time.  Yesterday, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill was railroaded though the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Second Stage was guillotined and speakers who wanted to contribute could not do so.  We were unable to give any thought to amendments on Report Stage, which is a pity.  Senator Mullen already referred to the House of Lords.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1333"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is yesterday&rsquo;s business, which is over and done with.  We are on today&rsquo;s Business and are dealing with questions to the Leader on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Leader why he cannot give more time, given that the House of Lords was able to block the 42-day detention powers in England.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Never mind the House of Lords.  Head off to the House of Lords if you want to, but we are not having it here.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that we could not put any amendments through in the Seanad last night.  I also want to ask the Leader why we are not having time to debate the report of an bord snip nua.  The Seanad should be sitting for that next week.  We are all under the impression that the report will be published at some stage next week.  There has already been widespread selective leaking of some of its recommendations.  One in particular gives me great cause for concern &mdash; the report that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children may be merged with another office.  I ask the Leader for a debate on that because, in the wake of the publication of the Ryan report, it is vital that we continue to have an office with an independent role in scrutinising conditions for children, particularly vulnerable children in care.</P>
        <P>I also wish to ask the Leader for a debate on rape law and how we can improve conditions for rape victims.  I have just come from the launch of the 2008 report of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, which highlights the need for more debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I dislike ending on a discordant note, but I thought it was ludicrous of Senator Mullen to suggest that we should consider leaving the Council of Europe just because, as I understood him to say, three women are exercising their right to take a case to the European Court of Human Rights on an issue that is vital and which, they say, concerns a breach of their rights under the convention.</P>

	<P>Oh Lord. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;regarding the European Court of Human Rights.  We have also mentioned the European Court of Justice in this House before now.  All of these bodies intrude into domestic situations here.  I am always flabbergasted by people, whom one would regard as logical and sensible, who argue for human rights on the one hand, but have no difficulty at all in abrogating the rights of people to the most fundamental right of all, which is the right to life.  We had it on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill yesterday and have it in this whole area.</P>

	<P>One of our national newspapers has a misleading headline this morning.  It stated that the economy was going to shrink by 11% over the next 18 months, but that has no basis in fact.  If one reads the article, it properly states that the governor of the Central Bank has stated that the economy will contract this year by about 8% and by perhaps 3% next year.  In fact, it has already contracted by about 11% or 12%.  Most economists consider that from the peak we will ultimately be down by about 16%.  I wish to emphasise one matter raised by the governor of the Central Bank &mdash; that further fiscal corrections must be done by way of cutting expenditure.  In my opinion and the opinion of many economists, the focus should be on payroll costs which must be brought back to &euro;15 billion.  In that regard, I wish to express my concern at the recent findings of the Labour Court which is awarding almost a 5% increase at a time when the economy is facing such challenges.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked him two questions already.  Given that we have had no debate on the Cork docklands area, unemployment is heading towards 15% and yet again there has been a guillotine on the Ryan report, will the Leader explain why the House is going into recess today?  Why can we not sit until the end of July?</P>
      
        <P>My final question for the Leader is about a matter of grave urgency.  From 24 July, people who have traditionally carried their pension books to the post office on a Thursday or Friday will no longer be able to do this but will be paid electronically through a nominated post office.  This will have a major impact on many old age pensioners.</P>

	<P>From 24 July a pensioner cannot go to the post office with his or her pension book and pensions will be paid into bank or post office accounts, which will result in serious emotional and psychological difficulties for many elderly people.  I ask the Leader to communicate to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, as a matter of extreme urgency, that she should desist in this and that we need further discussion in this regard.  I have had numerous telephone calls from pensioners about this.</P>

There is one issue about which I am deeply concerned, namely, the reduction in fees to pharmacists.  I was advised the Minister was to come to address the House on this but I hear this morning that she may not be in the House until September.  There are many other issues I have raised.

	<P>We are preparing to adjourn today in extraordinary times.  A cynic might say it is part of the ritual at the end of the year that the Opposition calls for an extension of the session and for longer debates, but today is different.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We are living in extraordinary times.  People have made extraordinary sacrifices and next week they will be asked to make more in order that the Government can aggregate &euro;5 billion.  Given the circumstances, with unemployment at almost 15%, the impending report of an bord snip nua and the overall gravity of the situation, we need to show a particular type of leadership.  We need to take extraordinary action as we are not in ordinary times.  We must extend our term and our debates.  It will be a bold strike and it is not something we want but something we must do.  We must remain in touch with a public that is shell-shocked.  I met people last night who are in a state of shock from the fear of college fees and <Col N="1337"/>a plethora of other expenses.  This needs a response from the Oireachtas.  I ask the Leader to extend the Seanad term and place the Seanad at the vanguard in dealing with this.</P>
        <P>One issue which was raised eruditely by my colleague yesterday and again by Senator Mullen today was that of the rural environment protection scheme.  I have one question for the Leader on this.  Given that the removal of the scheme will push a large contingent of farmers into the farm assist programme and that 60% of the money comes from Europe while the other 40% is spent in the local economy, is it financially sound, apart from the environmental factors, which the Green Party should be speaking about rather than engaging in nonsense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It will come as a surprise to Senator Mullen when I agree with him on the issue of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The House of Lords.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>No, not the House of Lords, I speak of the three women who are taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights on the matter of abortion.  It is high time we in this country decided our laws for ourselves.  As a mature democracy, we should do so.  I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to introduce legislation to deal with this issue at home so that nobody can accuse any other body, parliamentary or otherwise, of usurping the powers and the authority of the Irish people.  All too often the question of abortion is bundled into other issues, such as the Lisbon treaty, and becomes clouded.  It is high time we debated that issue here.  We see the number of people who are going abroad to procure abortions &mdash; they no longer go only to the UK &mdash; yet the issue is ignored time after time and it comes back to haunt us.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Government read this morning&rsquo;s story with some horror, thinking this was just what it does not need when the Lisbon treaty referendum is approaching.  This is what happens when issues are not dealt with properly and legislation is not introduced.  I agree with Senator Mullen that it is time this country decided its own laws in this regard and put options before the people.  I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to make this a priority so it does not come back to haunt us and so that other authorities concerned with human rights are allowed an input before the Irish people determine this issue for themselves.  If we had a debate that was open and honest and simply about the facts, with the humanity and compassion that is necessary when dealing with this issue, we would all be a little surprised at how mature is our country.</P>

	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Mullen&rsquo;s call for an amendment to the Order of Business.  I have two issues with regard to passports which I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs so he can work on them over the coming months.  The first relates to a Czech-born fugitive in the United States who holds an Irish passport that he purchased here ten or 15 years ago.  We have passed legislation to make sure this will never happen again, but apparently the Government has examined, as far as I can see, without any <Col N="1338"/>great vigour or determination, the possibility of removing the fugitive&rsquo;s passport.  This man has been accused of bribery in the United States and is claiming that because he has Irish citizenship the law does not apply to him.  We should have some procedure for withdrawing Irish passports from people who purchased them during those days.  I do not believe we are pursuing these efforts with sufficient vigour.  We must ensure that those of us who travel with Irish passports are regarded as genuine.  The danger is that if these passports are being used in such a way, every time we go through immigration when entering another country its officials will look upon our passports with disdain.</P>
        <P>The British had planned to do away with the common travel area and, as far as I gather, one now needs a passport, or certainly photographic identification, to travel from Northern Ireland to the island of Britain.  If that is so, it is good news because it gives us the opportunity to break the common travel area between Ireland and Britain and join the Schengen countries.  Ireland and Britain are the only two of the 27 member states which are not part of the Schengen area.  Irish people would be able to move through the same passport and emigration control points used by citizens of the other 25 member states if Ireland were part of the Schengen area.  The fact that the British Government decided to remove the common travel area between Ireland and Britain is extremely good news.  The fact that the measure was not passed by the House of Lords last night is merely a stumbling block on the road.  Ireland should be part of the Schengen area.</P>

	<P>I take on board Lord Mullen&rsquo;s point with regard to his suggestion that the Seanad might become more like the House of Lords.  I know what the Senator meant and I do not believe he wants to give up the Republic just yet or is suggesting that we should rejoin the British Commonwealth.</P>
        <P>I am deeply concerned with an bord snip nua&rsquo;s proposal to get rid of Shannon Development.  It is a serious matter for an bord snip nua to suggest that an organisation which is making a profit and which is not costing the State anything be closed down.  An bord snip nua has probably moved outside its remit in this regard.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to pursue the matter when an bord snip nua&rsquo;s report is published.</P>
        <P>I also ask that the Leader take up with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources the issue of Eircom&rsquo;s provision of services to users in Kerry.  In the 1970s, the Black Valley was famously the final area of the country to obtain access to electricity supplies.  Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Connor who lives in the Gap of Dunloe is seeking to have his telephone connected and was sent a bill for &euro;29,000.  To be fair to Eircom, the connection fee is only &euro;107.  However, the company decided to charge him &euro;29,226.65&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I am forced to draw a particular conclusion from what has happened.  Many explanations have been offered in respect of this matter.  The road to Damascus&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

The Bill contains extremely important measures and an indication must be provided with regard to whether those measures will be implemented in full.</P>
        <P>I support the call made by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly in respect of the REPS issue.  I ridicule the behaviour of Fianna F&aacute;il Senators who sought a debate on the report of an bord snip nua but refused to seek that additional time be provided in order that such a debate might take place.  There is no more lethal sign of the disconnect of these Houses from the people than the refusal of the Government to allow the report to be debated in public.  The report will probably be available as a free supplement with most Sunday newspapers during the summer.  However, the Government will not allow the matter to be debated in the House.  Shame on the Government.  It should make time available for a debate on this report.</P>

	<P>In recent weeks, the House engaged in a well informed debate on the Lisbon treaty and some fine analysis was put forward by Members with regard to why the previous referendum was not successful.  The House also discussed the guarantees the Government has obtained to lay to rest some of the concerns expressed by the electorate, among which were neutrality and taxation.  In addition, there was the pro-life issue, which would be seen as a matter to be decided upon internally by the State.  The news today that an international court could potentially set aside the guarantee relating to the latter is not a good omen for the forthcoming referendum.  This could be the banana skin of which we are all afraid and which could affect the result of the referendum in the autumn.</P>
        <P>I hope the Government will get the opportunity to ensure that this matter will not take priority over the main debate on the Lisbon treaty.  I am of the view that everyone accepts that the issue of abortion is a matter on which the State should decide.

	<P>The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to a proposal the Leader has put forward on the Order of Business.  We understand why people did not want Report Stage of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 to be taken immediately after Committee Stage.  Regardless of what the Leader might say, effectively a guillotine was applied in respect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Leader previously gave assurances to the House that it would only be in rare or exceptional circumstances that we would be obliged to deal with all Stages of a Bill in one day.  However, he is at it again because he has proposed that all Stages of the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2009 be taken today.  When other Senators and I sought clarification in respect of this matter recently, I thought the Leader had indicated that this would no longer happen.  In such circumstances, I support the calls that the Seanad should sit next week.</P>
        <P>Senators Prendergast and O&rsquo;Sullivan highlighted the need to debate the proposals contained in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, which is also known as an bord snip nua.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to the leaked proposal in respect of Shannon Development.  The report is available to the Cabinet for consideration.  In fairness, the Taoiseach publicly stated that the report should be published and made widely available.  When will the report be made available to the Members of both Houses?  If the Leader does not propose to extend the Seanad sitting into next week &mdash; he should do so &mdash; when will Members be afforded the opportunity to debate the report, rather than having it debated in public and the House being made irrelevant as a result?</P>

	<P>Yesterday in the Seanad, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, reflected on one of the great achievements of democracy, namely, the peace process in Northern Ireland.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It was built upon unprecedented partnership between the British and Irish Governments, and the strong support of our friends in America, the EU and around the world.  In more recent years it has been greatly strengthened by a transformation in relationships between North and South and between Nationalists and Unionists on the island.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Historical Enquiries Team to review all conflict-related deaths and to assist in bringing resolution to those families of victims affected by deaths attributable to the Troubles between 1968 and the advent of the British-Irish Agreement in 1998.  Two weeks ago, the family of Henry Cunningham met the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, to discuss his murder 35 years ago this August.  Henry Cunningham, who was 16 years old, was shot dead as he travelled home from work in County Antrim in August 1973.  Gunmen opened fire from a bridge on the M2 motorway at a van carrying a mixed group of workmen back to County Donegal and Henry, who was sitting in the front row, was shot dead.  The men had been travelling on the same route for three months and it is thought the van was targeted by the UVF because of its southern number plates and that the killers presumed the workmen were Catholic.  In fact, the van&rsquo;s occupants were a mixed group of Presbyterians and Catholics and the 16 year old victim, Henry Cunningham, was a Presbyterian.</P>

	<P>The Historical Enquiries Team, HET, set up by Sir Hugh Orde to look into conflict resolution for families, published a report in June 2009 that I have laid in the Oireachtas Library today for those who are interested in consolidating the peace process.  While the HET has not solved the crime, it was able to provide amazing information and answers to the family.  For example, the family was never told that the RUC believed the UVF was responsible for Henry Cunningham&rsquo;s murder.</P>

	<P>I propose a change to the Order of Business to discuss how, if 1,000 pharmacists withdraw from the community pharmacy scheme by the end of the month, patients <Col N="1342"/>will receive their medication next September.  Although this issue has been raised a number of times, no statement has been forthcoming from either the Minister or from the Leader of this House.  Consequently, there is a need for Members to debate this issue and I wish to propose a change to the Order of Business in this respect.</P>
        <P>I refer to a well-known Green Party Deputy who performs a popular breakdancing routine at public meetings in his constituency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent weeks, the House undoubtedly has dealt with a large quantity of legislation.  Questions have arisen in the media regarding a clear outline as to the blasphemy provisions in the Defamation Bill.  In many ways, the media are unclear until they receive clarification.  In addition, I refer to the possibility of a case being brought and as the courts do not judge in a vacuum, they need direction as to the intent of a Bill.  Consequently, I ask the Leader to restate that the Bill was passed with a view to the ultimate respect for all religious beliefs.  I refer to the belief in God, whatever one may perceive him to be, and that no one would be offended by any article, words or image that might offend people or attempt in any way to denigrate people&rsquo;s beliefs or to actually blaspheme.  In other words, it was a technical Bill and this would be of benefit to the media, which are unclear, and to the courts, were they to require clarification.</P>
        <P>Second, I refer to the European Court of Human Rights.  In respect of a court of human rights, there can be no other decision, as a human right, as to the preservation of the right to life.  In the next session, it might be useful were Members to debate, in the context of the provision of referral information in Ireland, an obligation to suggest an ultrasound whereby it will be quite clear to the person seeking an abortion that she is dealing with a living human being.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Twomey&rsquo;s proposal to amend the Order of Business regarding the pharmacy issue.  I also add my voice in support of Senators Mullen and O&rsquo;Reilly regarding the proposal to amend the Order of Business to discuss and debate REPS.  I called for such a debate yesterday and would continue to so do, were the Seanad sitting every day.  This is an extremely important matter for farmers and for rural Ireland and will have a massive negative impact both on the rural environment itself and on family farms and rural employment.  This has been a good scheme in respect of the protection of the rural environment.  Members should be discussing such issues of the day in this House and I ask the Leader to consider them seriously and to amend the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Later today, Members will be debating the Local Government (Charges) Bill.  They will consider amendments made in the D&aacute;il that had been debated and recommended in this House.  All Senators who contributed to that debate may take a bow because such amendments were badly needed and now are being framed in legislation.  Unfortunately however, some concerns <Col N="1343"/>were highlighted in this House with regard to the rental accommodation scheme, about which the legislation contains great inequalities and anomalies, in that rental accommodation scheme houses will be exempted from the proposed &euro;200 annual charge.  This is both unfair and an anomaly and is another reason legislation should not be rushed.</P>
        <P>For example, Galway City Council has 6,000 houses under the rental accommodation scheme under a five-year secure contract that is worth &euro;11,000 per annum to the landlords concerned, who are exempted from the charge.  Consequently, like many other local authorities, Galway City Council will be deprived of income of which it should be availing.  This is another anomaly that must be highlighted.  At a Galway City Council meeting last Monday night, members from all sides expressed concerns and the strong view that houses registered under the rental accommodation scheme should not be exempted and Fine Gael agrees with this point.  While it is a pity the legislation does not allow for it, this matter should be reviewed and Members should return to it at a later stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an issue I believe will be extremely important in the future.  Local authorities are not prepared and certainly are not well organised in respect of inward investment that comes into a county.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for a debate in this regard.  I note that IKEA, which is a fantastic company, is about to open in Ballymun with the creation of 500 jobs.  However, it took three years to organise that development with the local authorities in respect of putting in place a road system to suit the project.  I agree with the comments of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, regarding the Shannon Development Company, which plans ahead.  However, local authorities do not plan ahead for inward investment, which should be on top of the agenda.</P>
        <P>Sandyford Industrial Estate is an example of how development should take place.  However, inefficiencies also exist in that industrial estate, whereby southern access to the motorway still is not in place, which is due to local authority planning.  Having been a member of that local authority for many years, I know it does not plan ahead sufficiently.  I call on the Minister to come before the House and debate this issue, namely, how to get local authorities up to speed regarding likely developments.  For example, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s area, the Beacon Clinic would not have been developed without proper planning and appropriate zoning.  Therefore, I seek a debate in this regard because this pertains to jobs.  While Members talk about jobs here every morning, employment is the most important issue they will be obliged to consider for the next five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call from Senator Mullen and others for a full debate on the REP scheme before the House adjourns.  While I acknowledge there was a brief Adjournment debate on the matter last night, a substantial debate is needed on a matter of such fundamental importance to tens of thousands of farming families nationwide.  I will give the Leader a political health warning on the forthcoming Lisbon treaty referendum.  Members of Fine Gael will be the strongest advocates of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon treaty rerun.  In the previous referendum, all sorts of issues arose that caused people to vote on the wrong question rather than on the referendum.  I am gravely concerned that unless significant progress is made in resolving this dispute, the decision of the Government will result in tens of thousands of people from rural Ireland opposing the Lisbon treaty for the wrong reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Comments like that are not helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>From the perspective of farming, the environment and the forthcoming Lisbon treaty referendum it is important that we have a substantial debate to resolve this issue.  Hundreds of people are protesting outside Government Buildings but, more <Col N="1344"/>importantly, thousands of people are genuinely concerned that their only real source of family farm income has been removed at a stroke of the Minister&rsquo;s pen.  It is ironic that, as the Government was about to shut down the D&aacute;il for the summer recess, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food decided to shut down this vital scheme of funding for rural Ireland.  I ask the Leader, who comes from rural Ireland, understands rural communities and knows the importance of this scheme to people, to ask the Minister to reflect on this serious error.  We all make mistakes and we must all recognise the country is in financial crisis but some schemes repay their costs over.  REPS is such a scheme and, from an environmental and financial perspective, the decision must be reviewed immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice to the calls for an amendment to the Order of Business to address REPS, which is crucial to rural Ireland and the future of small farms across the State.</P>
        <P>I also add my voice to Senator Twomey&rsquo;s amendment concerning pharmacists.  I refer to the problem that those who want to receive medication in the next few weeks will face if this dispute is not resolved.  This is a rerun of the previous dispute and I have been very vocal on the approach the Minister is taking.  I have challenged her to look at the books of some of the pharmacists who will be put out of business if the Government continues in the direction it is going.  I was glad that the court found the actions of the Minister at that time to be illegal.</P>
        <P>The issues raised by Senator Mary White and others merit lengthy debate in this House.  Later this evening the House will be adjourned for two months but there is a need for serious debate on an bord snip nua, Irish unity, collusion, REPS, pharmacies, Eircom and the 200,000 jobs lost in the past year in Ireland.  For two months Senators will not be allowed to debate the issue of the day.  It is appalling.  The vast majority of people have no respect for this House, a point that was amplified by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he allowed a debate to take place knowing that no matter what was said, amendments would not be accepted.</P>

	<P>I add my voice to those on this side of the House who expressed anger and disappointment at the decision of the Government to axe REPS 4.  This is on top of the Government axing installation aid and the early retirement scheme.  As I have pointed out on debates on agriculture in this House, axing those schemes cost one family in my area &euro;20,000.  The family has been bereaved.  We recognise that cuts must be made in this economic climate and the axe must fall somewhere but the farming communities are being singled out and that is unacceptable.</P><Col N="1345"/>
        <P>The legislation passed last night was masked legislation, masking the problem that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have enough resources to fight organised crime.

A notice on a lottery machine stated that every time one purchases lottery tickets, one supports an arts project or a sports programme in one&rsquo;s community.  The sports capital programme for 2009 has been abandoned.  Every time someone buys a lottery ticket in this country, a portion of it goes to the State for the sports capital programme.  I do not know how much will accrue to the State this year but, seeing as the sports capital programme has been abandoned, what is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, doing with the money?  Is it being used to bail out and recapitalise the banks?</P>

I congratulate everyone who participated in the debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night.  That was one of the finest debates on the passage of a Bill in this House in the number of years that I have been in this House.  No guillotine was used on this Bill last night.  I offered the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Fitzgerald, a one hour break between Committee Stage and Report Stage.

        <P>Senator Prendergast raised the matter of finance to deal with the flu epidemic; it will be a top priority and one of the biggest challenges we face as a nation in the autumn.  Please God perhaps it will not be the case.

        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Sullivan, Walsh, Buttimer, Daly and Coghlan expressed their views on Shannon Development.  I can honestly state at first hand as the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that in every trade mission led by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, from 2002 to 2007, Shannon Development was a credit to Ireland plc.  It was magnificent and the job that it is doing and has been doing for decades has been something that we can look at and be proud that we established Shannon Development.  I know Shannon Development &mdash; in my heart I feel it &mdash; will not be in any shape or form interfered with by an bord snip nua because what it does is crucial, particularly during a down<Col N="1347"/>turn in the economy.  What it did for broadband is a shining example as Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan outlined to the House today.</P>
        <P>The contents of the report by an bord snip nua are for consideration.  However, as my predecessor, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, stated the last report wanted the train to stop in Athlone and not go to Galway.  Some of the proposals are practical and others are very impractical.  It is down to us as politicians and parliamentarians to decide what is in the best interests.  If there are good proposals we will examine them but if there are off the wall proposals just there for the optics they do not have a chance in hell of getting any further than the paper on which they are written in the report.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan called for a debate on the fishing industry.  I gave a commitment and I will respond.  This will certainly be debated in the first days after our recess.  I join with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan with regard to the two men, father and son, who are missing and I suppose presumed dead off the Beara Peninsula &mdash; that beautiful peninsula that everyone of us likes to drive around and see at holiday time.  The Senator warned that every local authority, Department and agency has a responsibility for safety regulations.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on the law on rape and I have no difficulty holding such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen, Bacik, Walsh, O&rsquo;Malley and Hanafin discussed the European Court of Human Rights and the three women who have taken their case there.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley made a plea that I would consult with the Taoiseach on her proposals.  I certainly will do so and I will pass on the strong views of Senators on that issue.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Buttimer raised the issue of old-age pension books being discontinued.  This is certainly not a good idea.  A person has a prerogative and a right not to have a post office or bank account.  No one should dictate that old-age pension books be taken from pensioners.  I hope the proposal does not go ahead and I will certainly express my strong views along with those of Senator Buttimer to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in this regard.  It is never the wrong time to do the right thing.  God knows this is all these people have at the end of their hard-working careers.  They should be left with their pension books and should not have them taken away by some bureaucrat who will misuse the information and all the other things that go with it when we have issues that are challenging us morning, noon and night.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Senator Callely called for a debate on all of the serious challenges that the Seanad will have to examine and the urgent need for change in the Seanad.  As I stated, Seanad reform will take place.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, will be in the House after the Order of Business with his Bill.  He will bring forward proposals for our consideration on Seanad reform during the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of the withdrawal of passports and the high regard and respect with which Irish passport holders have been held worldwide for decades.  I join with the Senator in the views he expressed on anything that interferes with that credibility.  Senator Quinn also raised the matter of the common travel area, which is of great importance, particularly with <Col N="1348"/>regard to Northern Ireland as so many people commute from the UK to Ireland.  The news from the House of Lords is to be welcomed and I join Senator Quinn in so doing.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly raised the matter of Eircom and the Black Valley, and &euro;29,000 is a serious amount of money to charge anyone for a telephone connection.  We must discuss this with the Minister to see how we can help the few areas in Ireland that still need telephone connections.  There are difficulties receiving signals in the beautiful Gap of Dunloe and the mountains in that area.  I will pass on the views of the Senator to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the matter of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill and tackling the challenges of time.  Senator McCarthy also mentioned this issue.  I wish the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Commissioner well with the new legislation; if it assists in dealing with the difficulties they experience then all of us in both Houses have done a great deed in the name of Ireland in protecting our people from the difficulties being experienced by the Garda at present.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Bradford raised the matter of the Lisbon treaty and the guarantees received by the Government on taxation, right to life, neutrality and all of the issues that the Senators outlined to the House.  We will all join together to ensure that this is brought to the attention of the Irish electorate and, if possible, to get a successful result on this occasion.</P>
        <P>Senators Mary White and Doherty raised the matter of the report which Senator White announced to the House this morning.  The report is in the Oireachtas Library for us all to consider and I congratulate her on the hard work she continues to do in many of these areas.  She outlined to the House the tragic death of Henry Cunningham.  It happened a long time ago but when it was recalled to us on the Order of Business quite a number of us remembered the terrible tragedy that took place.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, Doherty and Callely raised the question of how medication will be available from pharmacies.  I hope that is clarified in the update from the Minister.  If that is not the case then Senators can use my office to obtain the information required.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin outlined to the House the various Bills which the House has dealt with.  As we all know this was the busiest session for many years.  A total of 26 Bills were published during this session and most of them have passed through both Houses.  On that point, I congratulate the President, Taoiseach and Cabinet and everyone concerned.</P>
        <P>I also congratulate the veterans who took part in our national day of remembrance in Kilmainham on Sunday.  It was a wonderful occasion.  I was privileged and honoured to attend and represent the Seanad with the Cathaoirleach.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised the matter of rented accommodation.  The Minister will be in the House immediately after the Order of Business and if the Senator raises it with him perhaps he will receive a direct response.</P>
        <P>Senator Larry Butler, who brought the attention of the House to his long experience as a member of a local authority, raised the issue of inward investment for local authorities.  We all recall the great work county development officers did in our local authorities when the county development officer was the person responsible for inward investment in particular.  That is an area the Minister might have to revisit and reappoint the county development officers and the deputy county development officers because as Senator Butler said, inward investment is crucial.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy raised the issue of capital programme funding.  I will pass on his views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, our Clerk, Deirdre Lane, our Assistant Clerk, Jody Blake, and all the staff of the House a happy holiday time.  I thank the ushers, our Captain of the Guard, John Flaherty, our Superintendent, Paul Conway, Jimmy Walsh, our terrific supporter who writes up the issues as they happen here in the House, and, in particular, <Col N="1349"/>Michael Conway, who gives such good coverage of the proceedings of the House on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  I thank the leaders of the groups, the Whips, especially our own Government Whip, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, our Assistant Whip, Senator Camillus Glynn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Charges) Bill 2009 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Report and Final Stages. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendment made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendment to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, which may be discussed is the amendment made by the D&aacute;il.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to report to the Seanad an amendment agreed on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il giving effect to exemptions from the charge for certain persons vacating their home due to long-term incapacity due to illness, and for certain persons providing accommodation for relatives.</P>
        <P>Senators will recall we had an engaging and productive debate on the Bill in the Seanad two weeks ago.  In the course of the debate, the Minister accepted the point made by a number of Senators that the Bill should make it clear that no liability for the charge would apply in the circumstances the Minister has outlined.  I am pleased to provide more details to Senators of the provisions now incorporated in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 4(5) caters for a situation where a person who owns a principal private residence vacates the dwelling in question because he or she is long-term incapacitated as a result of physical or mental illness.  As the dwelling in question would no longer be used by the person concerned as a private principal residence, a liability to pay the charge could arise.  I accept <Col N="1352"/>there is an issue as to whether it would be reasonable in these circumstances for the person concerned to incur the liability, notwithstanding the modest level of the charge.</P>
        <P>The amendment provides a number of criteria that must be satisfied for the exemption to have effect.  In the first instance, the incapacity must be long-term and due to mental or physical illness.  Typically the incapacity would be brought about by infirmity due to old age or a form of senile dementia.  Other forms of illness could result in incapacity.  The essential point is that the person concerned is incapable of independent living into the future.  It must be the person&rsquo;s principal residence that has been vacated.  If the person does not own the residence he lives in, no charge would arise anyway.</P>
        <P>The person concerned must not own the property in which he or she will reside in the future.  In such a case the person would be the owner of at least two properties, in which case the exemption from a modest charge of &euro;200 would not seem to be required in respect of the property that has been vacated.</P>
        <P>Clearly, a person who is incapacitated due to long-term illness will require long-term care.  This is often but not always secured through a nursing home or care centre.  In such a case the Revenue Commissioners will permit that person&rsquo;s income to be offset against the cost of residing in the nursing home or care centre.  It is often the case that the property that was the person&rsquo;s principal private residence is let out to defray the costs of the long-term residential care.  The Minister was disinclined in bringing forward this amendment to require the person in care to pay the charge in these circumstances.</P>
        <P>Sometimes the person who is incapacitated goes to live with and is looked after by someone else, normally a relative.  In these circumstances, the Minister was also disinclined to provide that a charge should be paid on what used to be the incapacitated person&rsquo;s principal private residence.  The relative who has taken the incapacitated person under his care has probably relieved the State, at least partially, of the cost that would otherwise be associated with institutional care of one kind or another.  The Minister was not inclined to impose a charge in these circumstances, even if the dwelling concerned is rented out.</P>
        <P>Section 4(6) addresses the issue of what are referred to as granny flats.  In general the Local Government (Charges) Bill does not apply the &euro;200 to dwellings that are not separate.  A granny flat that constitutes an integral part of the residence in question will not be liable for any charge, assuming that the overall building of which it is a part is a principal private residence.  Nor will a granny flat be liable for a charge where it is owned by the person who resides there if it is his principal private residence.</P>
        <P>The question relates only to instances where the granny flat constitutes a separate dwelling and is owned by someone other than the resident, normally the person who owns the primary residential property of which the granny flat forms part or is associated with.  This is the situation the amendment is designed to cater for and a valid case has been made to make it clear properties of this kind are exempt from the charge.  Accommodation of this nature is usually provided by sons and daughters so they can look after their parents and in circumstances where the parents want to retain a measure of independent living for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>Although it is secondary to the consideration I mentioned, the point should also be made that the cost to the State is likely to be far less where people are cared for by their relatives as opposed to taking such people into long-term care.</P>
        <P>In drafting this amendment, the Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel have taken note of the legislation that applies in the case of the home carer tax credit and the amendment I am reporting to the House retains many of its features.  A number of conditions must be satisfied to avail of the exemption.  The property in question must be provided free of <Col N="1353"/>rent, be located less than 2 km from the principal residence of the owner and the respected parties in the properties concerned must be related to each other.</P>
        <P>There are sound reasons such conditions should apply.  This exemption is being provided to recognise the altruism relatives show one another.  This would be compromised if rent was charged.   Going further, if rent is charged, the owner can afford to pay the &euro;200 annual charge.  The criterion of its being on the same property or within 2 km is consistent with the fact that one party is meant to be caring for the other, something that cannot be done if they live long distances apart.  The 2 km provision follows precedent from Revenue&rsquo;s legislation dealing with the home carer tax credit.</P>
        <P>The definition of relatives is inclusive.  It will in no way act as a limitation on bona fide relatives or those of spouses or partners.  The provisions on legal guardianship and wards of court complete the amendment in respect of people who are not related as such but whose legal standing to each other amounts to the same thing.</P>
        <P>I commend Senators on their previous contributions to the Bill and commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and welcome this important amendment.  As the Minister said in her contribution, there was a robust debate in the Seanad during which many Members gave their views on the Bill, with a particular focus on this area, where we felt there was an inadequacy.  I welcome the role played by Fine Gael in identifying this because it was unfair to those elderly relatives of people who owned property while living in a granny flat or in a cottage nearby.  It also affected those in nursing homes who would have been liable for this charge on their family homes.  The Minister listened to the debate and while he did not accept our amendments he undertook to consult with the necessary parties to draft amendments to address the anomalies we identified.  We accept and support this amendment.  Having watched the D&aacute;il debate on the various stages and on the amendments I felt that the time necessary for proper analysis and debate was not afforded to the Bill.  Some Stages were guillotined in the D&aacute;il where I had hoped it would receive further analysis.</P>
        <P>I raised concerns here about issues such as data transfer and the Data Protection Act in respect of information required to operate this scheme.  Local authorities will depend on the transfer of data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the ESB.  The Minister of State should note that those concerns remain and will need to be revisited for clarification.</P>
        <P>There were calls for the exemption of registered holiday homes because this charge will increase the overheads of running these tourism projects, which are Irish, and that will have a negative impact on their viability because the owners will pass on the charges to their tenants.  The Minister did not address this issue although it was identified.</P>
        <P>There is much concern about the exemption of the property included in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  For example, Galway City Council has over 600 houses on the RAS.  Those houses have a secure five year contract, each worth approximately &euro;11,000 per annum.  The local authority pays over &euro;3 million in rent on this scheme yet there is no income under this legislation that can accrue from these houses.  There is a potential income of &euro;1.2 million.  This issue was raised at the meeting of Galway City Council last Monday where members were very concerned and held the strong view that the houses in the RAS should not be exempt.  The Minister of State should note that fact.  The scheme was created to increase income for local authorities and in general we all support that idea.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supported the general principle of the Bill from its outset because we support the giving of autonomy to local authorities in raising funds.  Galway City Council is only one <Col N="1354"/>example and it has 600 houses in the RAS, which offers a large potential income that should not be exempted.  That is an inequity in the Bill.  I pointed out on Second and other Stages that landlords in the RAS who are exempt from this charge might also let another, similar, house that is not in the RAS on which they must pay the charge.  That anomaly must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The amendment is welcome and will address the concerns we raised, especially in rural areas where elderly parents may remain in the family home while their children have built a new house on the farm.  At least the family home is exempt.  The same applies for those on the cottage acre where a son or daughter might have built a house and the elderly parent, or brother or sister, might live in the adjacent house although they do not own it.  I welcome this amendment as will those people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister and all those associated with inserting this amendment because it is absolute common sense.  It reflects the value of mature debate on such issues.  The Minister of State has outlined the thinking behind the amendment.  Although the Minister did not accept amendments in this House he indicated that he would review them.  He was true to his word.  The Minister of State said all there is to say and I will not parrot her.  I am pleased to accept and support this amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this Bill and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s stance on it, and his openness to suggestions from me and others.  I called for this Bill before the Government was willing to introduce a charge.  An Indecon report identified this many years ago but there was a refusal to introduce it.  I am not alone in saying this because Donegal County Council has been to the forefront in lobbying Government for such a Bill because it is rated third in terms of gains from this Bill.  It is important to see the money that accrues from these charges as complementary to, not a substitute for, the existing local government charges.</P>
        <P>I am glad, however, that the Minister introduced the Bill.  A great deal of time was lost between its announcement in the budget and now.  I am concerned about where in the Six Counties the advertising campaign will take place because many in the Border region have holiday homes and the charge comes into effect on 1 July.  It is a good Bill to a degree but it is full of holes.  It is rushed legislation although I do not understand why because it had been flagged.  This was evident when the Minister initiated the debate here with an amendment to exempt caravans.  This was followed by my amendments which are now before us.  There are other holes, and amendments not taken which significantly weaken the Bill.  Legislation will catch certain people whom the Government did not intend should pay.  That was definitely not the intention of the Opposition.</P>
        <P>It is always satisfying to see one&rsquo;s amendments accepted, in this case in respect of granny flats and people in long-term residential care.  When I put forward my amendments I told the Minister that they would need to be redrafted.  I put them forward to show that there were holes in the legislation and I am glad the Minister accepted them.  Senator Glynn said that they were &ldquo;absolute common sense&rdquo;.  I and Senator Coffey put down similar amendments and we argued vigorously that this needed to happen, but the Minister refused to accept them.  It went to a vote and the Government parties refused to accept the amendment.  The Minister gave no indication to me, Senator Coffey or the Seanad that he would reconsider it.  Luckily for us and thankfully maybe for the Cathaoirleach, we raised the matter again at the eleventh hour under a section that did not deal with the issue and sense prevailed.</P>
        <P>The two amendments inserted here are fine with me.  There is, however, a difficulty which the Minister will have to consider and I could cite many cases in which it would apply.  For example, if I was to build on to my house a self-contained granny flat for my mother and father <Col N="1355"/>and they were to move out of their family home, under this legislation I would be exempt from being liable for a charge of &euro;200 for such a granny flat.  My mother and father&rsquo;s house is fit for habitation and this charge applies to houses that are suitable for habitation.  Their house would be unoccupied because they would have moved in with me in order that I could care for them and that they would not have to go into a nursing home.  My parents would be liable to pay the &euro;200 charge in respect of their house, which would be unoccupied and would not be rented.  That is one of the flaws in this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure it would be the view of the Minister and the Government that the charge should not apply to the owner of such a house.  If one is an owner of a property but does not reside in it, one must pay the charge unless one qualifies under one of the exemptions.  Amendment No. 1, which provides for an exemption in the case of a person who has a physical infirmity, would not suffice for an exemption from the charge in the circumstances I outlined.  Not everybody who decides to move into a granny flat does so because he or she is infirm or suffers from a mental or other illness.  Sometimes people chose to do so to feel secure, to be close to their family and not to be isolated.  Where a person has moved into a granny flat to be beside his or her family and he or she does not want to be isolated, that person&rsquo;s house in the countryside would be unoccupied.  In the context of the example I gave, will the Minister of State clarify if my mother of father or anybody else&rsquo;s mother and father in such circumstances would have to pay this charge on their home?  For the record, I want to clarify that I do not have a granny flat attached to my house, I simply cited that as an example.</P>
        <P>A number of such issues need to be dealt with in the legislation.  Local authorities will pursue people for this charge in various circumstances.  I cited the example above and could cite countless others not related to granny flats where it would not have been the intention to apply this charge but where it nevertheless will be applied.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Coffey that the rental accommodation scheme should have been examined in the context of this legislation.  Another difficulty I have with the legislation is the definition of the types of houses to which the charge will apply in terms of the suitability of a house for habitation.  That is too broad a definition and allows local authorities to consider a derelict house in this context.  It raises questions as to what constitutes a house being suitable for habitation, it is one that has electricity connected or one that is lying empty.  I mentioned the family home that is unoccupied.  Would it have to be bulldozed for it to be exempt from this charge?  Amendments could have been proposed, dealt with and accepted that would have improved the substance of this Bill.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Because I agree with all the points made, particularly those made by Senator Coffey, I will not restate them as I do not see the point in doing so.  I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of amendment No. 1 which covers the particular concerns I had.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for their remarks.  They have made a significant and an important contribution to this Bill.  It is the better for such consideration and the local authorities will benefit from its enactment.  We look forward to a revitalised local government system with the introduction of this new local government charge.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised the issue of holiday homes and this matter will be kept under review.  The Minister wants to encourage the maximum uptake of the rental accommodation scheme and that is why the owners of such properties are exempt from the &euro;200 charge.  It is established Government policy to facilitate the migration of persons from the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to the rental accommodation scheme and the latter is a more satisfactory and cost <Col N="1356"/>effective way of meeting our social housing needs.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is demand-led and it is difficult to guarantee housing standards in that regard.  It can lead to undesirable concentrations of such dwellings in certain communities.  The rental accommodation scheme is a more cost effective scheme for both landlords and the State.  Because landlords do not have to incur the same level of vacancies between lettings, the State can guarantee a stable flow of tenants and in return landlords are prepared to give a discount to the State for this reason.  Even though there is a loss of revenue to the local authorities in this respect, because of the cost effectiveness of the rental accommodation scheme, it has been decided at the moment to give an exemption in respect of this charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I will convey that point to the Minister.  This matter will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty raised the issue of advertising this charge.  It will be advertised in the daily newspapers.  The Department will fund it and 31 July and not 1 July will be the operative date.  Local authorities will supplement such advertising with local advertising and both will be overseen by a project board on which the Department and the local authorities are represented.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where one&rsquo;s parents move to live in one&rsquo;s house, if the persons concerned are incapacitated, the charge will not apply to their principal private residence.  However, if the persons concerned are not incapacitated, the charge will apply to their principal private residence but they would have the option to rent it.</P>
        <P>I believe I have covered all the issues raised.  I will convey the Members&rsquo; comments to the Minister.  I thank them for their comments and wish them a well deserved break.</P>

	<P>I have a question, I do not want to make a speech or raise the incapacitation issue.  I wish to ask about the advertising of the charge, as it is important for the functioning of the Bill.  Will this charge be advertised on an all-Ireland basis, for example, in daily newspapers such as the <i>Irish News</i> and the <i>Belfast Newsletter </i>in the Six Counties where many people have properties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to make a final comment on this Bill which is about to be passed.  I thank the Minister and his officials for engaging with Members on this Bill.  Issues of concern were identified and we would not have raised them unless we had a genuine and sincere reason to do so.  I outlined the concerns we have.  We will monitor closely the implementation of this legislation at local authority level.  We highlighted our concerns during the debates on Second and other Stages regarding the financial capacity of local authorities to manage adequately the implementation of this legislation.  They will be depending on the Private Rental Tenancy Board and other agencies in this respect, which we do not believe are up to speed in this regard.  We outlined that in detail during the debate on earlier Stages.</P>
        <P>I thank the officials who drafted the legislation and wish it well as it becomes law.  It will create an important stream of income for local government.  That is essential and it is the basis for this Bill.  Local authorities throughout the country will welcome the fact that they will have a new income stream available to them.  I hope that this stream of revenue will not be a substitute for the central fund from which allocations are made to local authorities.  There have been cuts of up to 10% in that fund.  This steam of revenue should not plug that gap but should be an additional source of income for local authorities.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister and his officials to monitor implementation of the legislation.  Senator Doherty referred to this matter already.  He said it is estimated that Donegal County Council will rank third highest in terms of the accrual of revenue.  There will be a big deviation in the revenue accruing to local authorities ranging from &euro;1 million up to &euro;12 million.  Some local authorities will not derive a large amount of revenue on foot of this legislation.  I ask the Minister, his officials and the Department to monitor this and not to be of the view that every local authority is accruing a large amount of revenue on foot of this legislation as some local authorities will only derive a minuscule amount of revenue compared to others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who previously dealt with the Bill in the Seanad, and the officials who drafted the legislation for the approach they took in that regard and for the open-minded approach to suggestions from the Opposition.  In contrast, last night no matter what was said by the Opposition, we were told that no amendments would be accepted because the D&aacute;il was not sitting.  Thank God the Local Government (Charges) Bill was debated at a time when we could listen to common sense and that some of us with experience could help to make the Bill better.</P>
        <P>If we had more time we would be able to discuss the ins and outs of the legislation.  The Minister referred to the Bill as being a short one.  Perhaps it should not be that short because, for example, the parent who is moving into the granny flat should not have to pay the &euro;200 charge if he or she is not incapacitated.  We all know that will happen.  Thousands of people will not be affected but it should not happen as that is not the intention of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for the manner in which the Bill was handled.  Senator Coffey&rsquo;s point on monitoring the legislation is important as it provides significant potential to local government to raise additional funding.  The Government has suggested a figure of &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million but the figures from the CSO and the Library &amp; Research Service suggest &euro;97 million.  We all hope it will be at the upper end of the scale.  Local authorities might need some assistance.  For example, if we do not advertise in the Six Counties, that will have an immediate effect on my county of Donegal.  We need to focus on certain minor issues.  I accept there may be teething problems and a close analysis of the implementation of the legislation is required.  I look forward to receiving a report in September on how local authorities have managed to <Col N="1358"/>date in terms of funding accruing from the charges.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, for her attendance and how she has dealt with the Bill.  I wish it well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, thank the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, and her officials for the time allocated for debate on the Bill.  I had a good input into the debate and I followed it with great interest.  I support the calls for the chairs of the SPCs on housing and local policy to provide feedback to us on how the legislation is implemented, the take-up and the positive effect it will have as an income stream.  I thank everybody who was involved in it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, for bringing forward the Bill.  It is an extra string to the bow of the powers of local authority members.  I am on the record as having said previously that without money, local authority members do not have powers.  This is a revenue stream that did not exist heretofore.  I accept there will be teething problems; to think otherwise would be foolish.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Prendergast that housing SPCs have a pivotal role to play in the administration of the Bill.  It is now a matter for the locally elected members of town councils that are housing authorities, and borough, county borough and county councils to work out means for the improvement of our housing stock, especially for the elderly and the underprivileged.  This is the funding base with which to do that.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State and colleagues on all sides of the House for their contributions.  Everything that has been said in both Houses has, to a greater or lesser extent, depending on one&rsquo;s viewpoint, contributed to the passing of the Bill today.  I thank the Minister and her staff for that.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Bill 2009 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Report and Final Stages. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister of State will deal with the subject matter of a related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping.  Senators may speak only once on the grouping on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill was first introduced by me to the Seanad on 7 July 2009 and subsequently passed all Stages.  I indicated on more than one occasion that it might be the intention of the Minister for Finance <Col N="1359"/>to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to permit changes to be made to the parliamentary allowances system, such as may be agreed between the Minister and the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas, to be introduced by regulation.  Such an amendment was made and, therefore, the Bill has returned to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The amendment relates to a new section 3 of the Bill.  The purpose of the new section 3 is to facilitate consideration of a proposal made by the Oireachtas Commission for the introduction of a single composite allowance for Deputies and Senators, to be known as the parliamentary standard allowance.  That will replace separate allowances payable at present.  In the case of Senators, for instance, the Commission envisaged that the composite allowance would include all, or elements of, the existing expense allowances, including travelling facilities, overnight allowance, miscellaneous expense allowance, telephone allowance and mobile telephone allowance.</P>
        <P>This new section will enable the Minister for Finance to provide for the payment of the single composite allowance, instead of the existing separate expense allowances.  It will also enable the Minister to make regulations determining the rate of the allowance, the date from which it will be payable, the conditions of payment and the manner of payment.  In addition, it will allow the Minister to make regulations regarding the recording of attendance and deductions for non-attendance, such as is, for example, the practice with the European Parliament, where there is signing into plenary sessions.  As we know, committee attendance here is already recorded, which is particularly relevant when the Houses are not sitting.</P>
        <P>The new section is an enabling provision only.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals have the potential to provide a simpler and more streamlined system.  However, there is a need for further consideration and discussion of the proposed composite allowance before it is introduced in regulations.  Any such regulations that might be made later would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  I presume this will be a relatively short debate. Two Bills relating to pay and expenses of public representatives in these Houses and the European Parliament were passed in recent weeks.  Approximately one month ago we debated legislation on payments to MEPs.  The legislation that was passed by this House related to MEPs only, but the State pays a significant number of people in the European Commission and in other European institutions.  We pay judges, auditors, senior civil servants and a range of other people.  Those people were specifically excluded from the legislation passed one month ago, which focused purely on elected public representatives.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This type of legislation is concerned with ensuring good governance of taxpayers&rsquo; money and a sensible approach to how we deal with the crisis in our economy.  As such, it should not focus exclusively on politicians.  There is a nagging doubt that these measures are being introduced merely for optics, to prove that something is being done in regard to politicians&rsquo; pay, as opposed to examining the system in a broader way and making the necessary changes across the board.  That is why I was surprised that the Minister of State avoided the issue of the remuneration of all individuals working in the European Commission and otherwise when that legislation was introduced last month.</P>
        <P>The legislation before us today focuses specifically on aspects of the remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas.  However, there has been little specific focus on the remuneration of Ministers other than a reminder of voluntary reductions in ministerial pay.  Perhaps such changes will arise out of the report by an bord snip nua, but there is no evidence of that in this legislation.  There is nothing about the expenses associated with ministerial offices and the salary costs of civil servants who work for Ministers.  I understand some Ministers of State have as many as eight civil servants working for them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1360"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There must be very little work for those Ministers of State to do.  Is there sufficient work to require the deployment of eight civil servants to one Minister of State?  Perhaps these officials are managing clinics on behalf of their Ministers.  Will the use of ministerial and departmental credit cards be reviewed?  From what I can gather, there are no significant checks on the use of such credit cards for so-called miscellaneous expenses, purchasing rounds of drinks in Brussels and so on.  These are issues that should have been included in this debate.</P>
        <P>We will undoubtedly be accused in the media of taking a self-interested perspective in discussing this legislation.  Most public representatives define their role differently to how it is generally perceived.  Oireachtas Members are first and foremost viewed as legislators, as defined in the Constitution.  Our betters have been discussing these issues in the media, making the case that we should confine ourselves to legislation and policy.  Before the last election, I confined myself to a significant degree to the important legislation then being debated in regard to nursing homes, the Medical Council and pharmacies.  I also undertook a substantial amount of work on policy development at that time.  Regrettably, when I was canvassing for the election, nobody asked me about that legislation.  However, several people observed that I had been seldom seen about the place.  Among the most ferocious of these individuals were members of my own party.</P>
        <P>In short, an exclusive focus on legislation and policy puts one in danger of losing one&rsquo;s seat.  Most constituents perceive the role of a Deputy as beyond merely legislative.  In other words, to be effective public representatives, we cannot be confined to Leinster House.  No account has been taken of that reality in this debate.  The Minister of State compares Leinster House to the European Parliament where Members sign in for plenary session.  However, Deputies and Senators, who have an important role to play as public representatives in their constituencies, often work very differently to MEPs.</P>
        <P>There must be further debate on the proposal to introduce a swipe card system for Members.  I am not of the same mind as those Fianna F&aacute;il Members who apparently expressed their distaste to journalists at being treated like factory workers.  That attitude is contemptuous of workers who clock in and out every day.  My point is that our role is not specifically confined to Leinster House.  That must be acknowledged and taken on board before any such swipe card system is introduced.  Many Members who are within striking distance of their constituency will leave the House for certain periods during the day to attend meetings and so on.  Some may return to their home or constituency office for a short time before returning to participate in a late vote.  People put themselves out in this way all the time.  The notion of having to swipe in and out reflects a lack of understanding on the part of the Government in terms of how Members conduct their business.  The Minister of State must keep in mind how Deputies and Senators work in fulfilling their role as public representatives.</P>
        <P>If such a system is introduced, there will be a strong case for the abolition of the pairing system between Ministers and Opposition Members.  If the purpose of this measure is to ensure Members are confined within the walls of Leinster House, there is no justification for Ministers going here, there and everywhere on sitting days.  They should be obliged to organise their schedules in such a way that business requiring them to leave Leinster House must be conducted on non-sitting days.  Unless they are sick or on maternity leave, they should be obliged to be in Leinster House on the days the D&aacute;il and Seanad sit.  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s views in this regard.</P>
        <P>When I raised the issue of increments on Second Stage, the Minister of State responded that anybody could challenge anything and that the matter could be taken to court at any stage.  I <Col N="1361"/>suggested that a reduction of 25% in increment payments to every Deputy and Senator would provide the same saving to the State in the period leading up to the next election and would entirely negate the prospect of a legal challenge.  The Minister of State did not indicate whether the Government is considering a broader review of long-service increments, with a possible reduction for all members of the Civil Service and public service.</P>
        <P>I recently submitted a query to the Department of Finance regarding pension arrangements for county managers.  It was pointed out to me that having completed their seven years in office, the latter can retire on substantial pensions and with significant termination payments.  The answer that finally came back from the Department in response to my query was quite staggering.  I was told there is a special gratuity of six months&rsquo; salary and an immediate payment on leaving office of one and a half times the salary.  This means that county managers who retire immediately receive two years&rsquo; salary on retirement and if they have served for more than 20 years as a member of the local authority, which is usually the case, they will get ten years added to their pension, which, in effect, means they can retire early on a full pension.  That is quite generous.</P>
        <P>Again, there has been no indication in this House as to whether there will be any change to such payments.  Such change is more important than tinkering around with the arrangements whereby sitting Members can draw ministerial pensions.  As I said, I am concerned that this is more about the optics of being perceived to be doing something to ease the understandable public anger about what is happening in the wider economy, and that politicians are being singled out as a specific group for a hammering.  That will not make much difference in the long term when it comes to resolving the core problems of payments across the Civil Service and public service.  I would have hoped the Minister would have focused more on that aspect of the matter.</P>
        <P>To the best of my knowledge, there are no objections to the measures under discussion, apart from a significant minority who might object to the amendment tabled by the Minister of State.  I cannot speak for other parties but, overall, the majority approves of having a single monthly payment rather than separate allowances.  That may be the way forward on this issue.  I have not heard any major objections to the legislation.  The rest of the legislation points out that more could have been done.  More discussions should have been held on the broad range of what is actually happening.  The director of F&Aacute;S had to resign, as did the financial regulator, basically for making one hell of a mess of what was going on within their organisations.  However, the lump sum payments and pensions on which they retired would even make the former Taoiseach weep, although he has been the least affected by these cuts.  To instill confidence and regain the public&rsquo;s trust in what we do, we should have looked at every aspect across the civil and public service, and not just ourselves.  Politicians have no problem in taking the lead.  From the viewpoint of gaining public trust, it would probably be better to be seen to pay more than comparable grades.  For instance, we are linked to the standard principal officer&rsquo;s grade in the Civil Service, but there is no harm in us paying a little bit more.  However, if we are really going to make reforms and show that we can do things differently, we need to have a debate on what can be done across the Civil Service and the public service.  There was great concern about whether the financial regulator fulfilled his role properly, so we need to decide whether or not these sorts of pay-offs are justifiable.  If not, something needs to be done in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  In the words of David Hanley on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; many years ago, I must ask if the Minister of State is serious about signing in.  What have we come to?  While this legislation is necessary and we must take a principled stand, it is also important to ask the serious questions and be practical <Col N="1362"/>about this matter.  For example, are we now going to sign in to public meetings?  My constituency is over 120 miles long, from Cork airport almost to Kenmare, taking in the Beara peninsula, the Mizen peninsula, and the harbours at Kinsale, Clonakilty, Baltimore and Courtmacsherry.  There are three electoral areas.  As a successful constituency politician himself, the Minister of State will be aware of the importance of attending events and being seen where the crowds are.  The perception and optics of a public representative include being seen in different places to meet constituents and support events.  Will we have to sign in for attending festivals, regattas, tidy town competitions, public meetings and ribbon-opening ceremonies?  Will we have to provide proof of attending funerals to the Minister of State?  Will we sign in when we meet planners or when we visit a site?  Will we sign in when we attend a local authority meeting to listen to a report to councillors?  We are no longer councillors; that was the first sacrifice we made by virtue of the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen&rsquo;s, legislative vendetta against local authorities.  It was also inherently anti-rural Ireland because he abolished the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant.  He is now running off with the proceeds of the national lottery contribution to his Department because he has abandoned the sports capital programme for this year.</P>
        <P>We will now have to go to local authority meetings to pick up that information.  With all due respect, no matter how good one&rsquo;s replacement or surrogate is, one will still have to attend a certain number of local authority meetings, but will we have to sign in for those?  A constituent may call after 10 p.m. to raise a housing, planning or roads issue, or about an elderly relative who cannot get a bed in a community hospital, or the loss of a medical card, or about a couple who cannot get grant assistance for a child who is starting third level education, and third level fees are going to be reintroduced.  Will we have to log that phone call and bring it back to the House and say that is what we were doing at 10.30 p.m. on a Sunday?  Are we going mad?</P>
        <P>I just came from an Oireachtas committee that dealt with over-regulation of the shell fishing industry, but this Bill concerns the over-regulation of politicians.  Are we to be fingerprinted when we come into Leinster House so that we can draw expenses?  We must not forget the add-ons in the public service, as well as the vulgar filth that took place in F&Aacute;S, and the illegal practices in banks.  Did they have to sign in?  No they did not.  They left their jobs, took their large pensions and lump sums and sat down.  They never once had to knock on a door to offer accountability.  They had contempt for parliamentary democracy by refusing to come before an Oireachtas committee to explain their actions.  They do not have to sign in, but we must do so.  It has become ridiculous.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask about the meeting last Friday between the Minister for Finance and the backbench Fianna F&aacute;il TDs.  Who organised it?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>What was discussed?  What role does the Oireachtas Commission have concerning this?  The Minister for Finance took his PR battle against Members&rsquo; conditions, allowances or expenses to the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> at the start of this year.  After leaving a meeting with the Oireachtas Commission and making an agreement, he ran off to that newspaper to make a front-page statement.  He was the reforming Minister who was going to clean up Dodge City, but what role does the Oireachtas Commission have in this matter?  My understanding is that the commission was dealing with these issues.  There are representatives from each party in this House, and none, to deal with those issues.  What input did the Oireachtas Commission have concerning this legislation?  What was the background to the meeting last Friday?  Can we expect the Oireachtas Commission to be on the hit-list of an bord snip nua?  I am perplexed that when so many people are on the live register, the Government is obsessed with cutting expenditure and protecting banks.  It is doing so to the detriment of <Col N="1363"/>other sectors.  There is no absolute strategy or clearly managed vision for job protection or job creation.</P>
        <P>This reminds me of the legislation that was passed in the House last night.  It was debated restrictively because amendments could not be taken since the D&aacute;il is in recess.  That is why this Bill is before us, because it had to be amended in the D&aacute;il.  That is the proper procedure.  That is masking the problem, which is far greater than the content of these Bills.  The problem with criminal justice is that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have resources to deal effectively with the thugs, scumbags and psychopaths involved in gangland crime.  We produce legislation that circumvents a process&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not my intention to speak but events and what has been said indicate that I should add a word of caution.  The enabling amendments before us are technical in nature.  I understand how Opposition Members might express anxieties about what they might mean.  As regards what they will mean, however, we can give a view as to what is proper or not.  It is not correct to say that we are not prepared to make sacrifices.  We are the first people who must do so.  We must give a lead.  It is entirely appropriate that everybody together &mdash; which, as I understand it, is the Government&rsquo;s intention &mdash; would come back to the 2004 levels of standard of living.  We can then take it from there and start rebuilding a competitive economy.  If we do not give the lead, who will?  There are caveats within that, however.  It does not help the debate to use quotations from a &ldquo;d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean le&iacute;&rdquo; Fianna F&aacute;il TD who was quoted in the media.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>D&uacute;irt fear liom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not evidence of what somebody said, it is what is said in the media.  Neither is it particularly helpful to say the Government will do anything to help the banks.  The Government will do anything to help this economy and the way to do that is through the banks.  Whether we like it or not, the way to get funding and capital into the economy is through the banking system.  There is no other way.  I do have anxieties but I am certain that they will not materialise.  Sometimes, people who do not understand how we operate our business are looking at how we operate and are making suggestions.  It is important that when people look at how we do our business here, they should understand that there is an element of flexibility.  There is also a sword hanging over us and if we do not do our work properly we will be gone at the next election.  From the perspective of people worrying about clocking in and out, I do not think they need to worry because I do not see that materialising.  However, there must be some way of ensuring attendance.  Heretofore we had a system whereby one received an allowance for attending; under the new system of composite payment there would need to be a row-back if people were not genuinely here for committees when the Houses are not in session.  I cannot understand why we would have to clock in at any other time.  We have always had to attend to receive allowances when the Houses were not in session.</P>
        <P>There is one further aspect of which I am conscious.  People who still do not understand how we operate may look at our terms and conditions and allowances and think they are quite generous.  They are, if one is a paid employee with no expenses.  We are more similar to self-employed people.  We have telephone bills and other additional costs.  Members have referred <Col N="1364"/>to subscriptions they have given on an annual basis which represent a high percentage of their salaries.  It is important that those in the Department of Finance understand that the average term here is 11 years.  In what other job does one not know from day to day whether one will be in a job in the next term?</P>
        <P>We must be exceptionally careful to ensure people realise that the expenditure is necessary for what we do and, in some cases, it is less than we need.  I know for a fact that some people have telephone bills of &euro;600 and &euro;700 per month.  I do not doubt that we must lead by example.  However, it should never be allowed to happen that only those who are well off can afford to become involved in politics.  It must remain available to all sectors of the community.  If we cut too tightly into the allowances which allow for the fact that we are to some extent self-employed, we are putting at risk the ability of people to become involved in politics.  Notwithstanding that, I welcome the amendment and the changes that are about to take place.  However, those who are making decisions sometimes do not understand how we operate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hanafin asked how many other jobs are there in which the person doing the job does not know whether he or she will still have it in a year&rsquo;s time or a few years&rsquo; time.  The answer is that under the current economic circumstances this applies to nearly every job.  Most people working in the private sector are uncertain whether they will have their jobs, or their current incomes, in 12, 18 or 24 months&rsquo; time.  The point made by Senator Hanafin would have been correct a number of years ago, but the current circumstances and the profound uncertainty that is grasping our economy and society means that unfortunately, many people holding down jobs at the moment do not know whether they will have them in a year or in four years&rsquo; time.  Circumstances have changed such that the working conditions of most people in the private sector now resemble the contingencies and uncertainties of political life.</P>
        <P>The point was made by a colleague earlier that a Member of this House could lose his or her position in an election regardless of performance.  Again, unfortunately, those are the conditions under which most people in the private sector are operating.  People who are superb contributors &mdash; who are highly productive and are doing a wonderful job &mdash; may find themselves without jobs due to exchange rates or the problems in the banks.  That is the reality for people working in our economy at the moment.  It is of major importance that the institutions in which we operate are reformed so they are relevant to and reflect the working lives of the taxpayers who pay for them in the first place.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, due to the way Fianna F&aacute;il has operated in Government over the last 11 or 12 years, politicians have moved beyond being a laughing stock with regard to the economic issues we are discussing and become a lightning rod for public anger about where our country stands.  As I make a comment such as this, far more experienced people than me could stand up and say it has always been like this; politicians have always been blamed for everything.</P>
        <P>However, what is different now is the economic circumstances.  The chief executive of IDA Ireland said recently that he expects industrial wages in some sectors to fall by 15% in the coming years.  This will result in a fundamental change in working conditions, standard of living and disposable income for the overwhelming majority of people.  That is why our party is supporting the Bill.  If these institutions are not relevant in terms of this change, they will be irrelevant.  The reason this matters is that it is these institutions, ultimately, that have the job of leading the country out of the difficulty it is in.</P>
        <P>Some of the points I wished to make about this legislation have been touched on by my colleague Senator Twomey.  However, they are worth emphasising.  Senator Twomey mentioned ministerial salaries.  As I walk into Leinster House in the morning I look at the great figures <Col N="1365"/>from all political parties that founded this country and consider the conditions of austerity in which they did it.  If they were around now and saw that the average Cabinet Minister is paid at least &euro;200,000 per year to perform his or her job, they would wonder where we went wrong.  What happened to the spirit of service?  What has happened to the austerity that needs to be adopted by the holders of high office as our country goes through these changes?  As I have said before, the salaries of those holding high office &mdash; both elected and unelected &mdash; must be radically reduced so that they can regain the moral ground to lead our country through these changes.</P>
        <P>Other colleagues mentioned the contribution people make to legislation in the House.  Senator Twomey made a point which I know from my short time in the Oireachtas to be only too true.  One&rsquo;s performance in terms of legislation, while it is sometimes said to be important, is not often acknowledged as such.  However, it is within our grasp to change this.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should publish on a quarterly basis figures pertaining to the attendance, contributions and roles of Members.  One can find this information on the Internet.  There is a website that provides details of how many times I or Senator Twomey spoke in the House.  If a website can provide such information, why can the Houses of the Oireachtas not provide it in a way that is verified and accurate and shows the performance &mdash; and, at times, lack of performance &mdash; of Members, who are funded by the taxpayer?  Such changes, if implemented, would ensure these Houses are not on the back foot in leading the change that needs to happen.</P>
        <P>The issue of swipe cards was raised.  I used a swipe card for ten years of my life in the private sector.  I swiped it every morning to say I had arrived at my workplace.  Are we seriously suggesting that such a system is not appropriate for the place that is supposed to be leading the country?  The comment that we are not factory workers was a new low in terms of how out of touch we can be with the lives of the people we represent and serve.  People attend here every morning and say that we need to get more factory workers into the country, rebuild manufacturing and get people into high-tech services and jobs that create value.  These are the people who will come to their places of work and prove they are in attendance, and they will be paid in return.  Why is that not appropriate for this House?</P>
        <P>The point has been made that Members may be obliged to leave the Houses between votes to attend committee meetings, to deal with the other work relating to their office or, if they enjoy the luxury of being able to do so, to visit their families.  However, I do not believe it would be a great imposition to introduce a simple system that would indicate one was in attendance or that one entered the Houses of the Oireachtas at some point during a sitting day.  Such a system would illustrate that we are willing to proceed with the same type of reform we are asking members of the public to embrace.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the idea that members of the public do not understand that a sword hangs over all our heads in respect of our gaining re-election.  There are many people who understand what it is like to lose their jobs.  Through no fault of their own, the sword has fallen on these people and their lives are filled with dread, particularly in the context of what will happen to their families and what has happened to their bank balances.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the utter political responsibility of Fianna F&aacute;il in allowing matters to reach this stage.  It is unbelievable that legislation such as this is necessary to cosset people in respect of their concerns.  I support the Bill but we should go further.  In the context of the change that will unfold in our country in order for our democracy to survive, the legislation is but a starting point.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I listened attentively to the Second Stage speeches on this legislation.  There are differing opinions on all sides of the House on the Bill.  However, as the Minister of State and Senator Hanafin pointed out, this is enabling legislation which will allow the Minister for Finance to introduce various regimes in respect of allowances, expenses etc.  To my knowledge, a decision on the introduction of such regimes has not yet been made but I urge the Minister to make such a decision with haste.</P>
        <P>Anyone who has small children will be familiar with the television cartoon &ldquo;Dora the Explorer&rdquo;.  In that programme, the expression &ldquo;Swiper no swiping&rdquo; is used.  That expression is appropriate in respect of the legislation we are debating.  As Government Chief Whip, I am in a position to state that it would make my job much easier if colleagues were obliged to use swipe cards on entering and leaving the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is keeping them here that is the problem.  They cannot even find their way to the Chamber when they are present in the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe that Members of this House or the Lower House should be obliged to use swipe cards.  I agree with Senator Donohoe that technology has advanced to the stage where it is simple to check how often people attend the Houses.  On a daily basis &mdash; sometimes too often in this House &mdash; votes take place in particular matters and the record of those votes indicates whether Members are present.  That is the proper mechanism to use in the context of verifying people&rsquo;s attendance in the House.</P>
        <P>Rather than introduce a regime which would involve swipe cards or under which Members would be obliged to sign in and sign out, we should be obliged, like everyone else in the country, to make a sacrifice.  Regardless of how long we might retain them, it must be accepted that we are lucky to have jobs.  We should take an across-the-board salary cut of 10% or 15%.  We should cut out the type of nonsense mentioned by a number of speakers.  We must make the sacrifice to which I refer.</P>
        <P>Expenses are claimed in respect of money one pays out in the course of doing one&rsquo;s job in the Oireachtas and I accept that we must take a cut in respect of such expenses.  I also accept that it would be easy for Members to keep their expenses and do nothing, but they will not <Col N="1367"/>remain Members for long if they do so.  Let us be sensible in respect of this matter and stop putting forward proposals of a particular kind.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to put words in the mouth of the Minister for Finance.  I understand that he has not yet decided what action to take in respect of Members&rsquo; expenses.  However, I am in favour of dispensing with all the codology and introducing a cut of 10%, 15% or whatever in order that we might move to deal with other matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions on the new provision that has been inserted into the legislation, with which the House dealt last week.  The new section 3 is an enabling provision relating to the contingency where the Minister for Finance may decide to adopt a standard parliamentary allowance.  A decision has not been made on the matter but I can confirm that discussions and consultations will take place in respect of it.</P>
        <P>I was a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission when I served as a Senator and I am aware that its role in matters such as this is to provide advice to the Minister.  The proposal came from the commission and the Minister has put in place, by means of an amendment, the necessary legislation to implement it if that is his decision.  However, such a decision has not yet been made.  The proposal clearly requires more work, consideration and consultation before a decision is made.  It is highly unlikely that it will be made before the autumn.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey made the point that there are many other broader and relevant considerations in respect of this matter.  If it were the case that one could not take action until one had considered everything that might conceivably be connected with a matter, I suspect one would never get anything done.  Inevitably, one must deal in a piecemeal fashion with issues as they arise.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance pointed out in his budget speech that he asked the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector to study pay at higher levels throughout the sector, among both elected and unelected officeholders, and to compare it with that which obtains in comparable developed countries that are similar in size to Ireland.  The report of the review body is to be presented to the Minister by the end of September.  Recommendations which might be made in respect of these matters by an bord snip nua, as it is popularly termed, will also be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>Deputies are paid the same amount that applies at the maximum of the scale of principal officers in the Civil Service.  Senators are paid 70% of the salary which applies in respect of Deputies.  As for MEPs, that legislation was required specifically to deal with the implementation of an European Parliament decision on pay and conditions that only pertained to MEPs.  The legislation in question reflected the terms of the decision by the European Parliament and European Union&rsquo;s institutions on the MEP salary system and was required before the new Parliament met.</P>
        <P>I will deal with some other points that were made, all of which were interesting.  In some of my remarks, which will be clearly indicated, I will be speaking for myself rather than in any collective sense.  Senator Twomey referred to people working in offices.  I have the same three people working on constituency matters for me now as I did when I was a backbench Deputy.  The only difference is the number of hours done.  I could have had more but consciously decided not to.</P>

	<P>I am not in a position to say.  In such matters I simply tend to concentrate on what I consider to be right for myself, without looking at other people whose <Col N="1368"/>situations may differ from mine.  As for ministerial credit cards, I have such a credit card of which I make very little use.  I use it for train fares to official functions or if I am obliged to stay overnight in a hotel somewhere.  I am sure such information is available under freedom of information regulations and that the sums involved are small.</P>
        <P>While discussing the issue concerning signing in and signing out, the question was raised as to what is the role of Oireachtas Members.  Our role as legislators is important.  I remember putting &ldquo;active parliamentarian&rdquo; on the second line of one of my election posters, only to be ridiculed by some journalists from the newspaper of record, who queried how anyone would want an active parliamentarian.  It is necessary to have Members in these Houses who attach adequate importance to their parliamentary work.</P>

	<P>A well known and popular Deputy from the city of Dublin told me an anecdote recently about a woman who complained to him regarding his failure to attend a constituency meeting on a Wednesday night.  He responded that unfortunately, he was unable to get out as he was in the D&aacute;il, to which the reply came that his constituents had not elected him to be in the D&aacute;il.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It has a certain grain of truth regarding public attitudes.  However, and this also is true of my constituency colleague from my own party, I simply make it clear that I cannot attend constituency functions on Tuesday or Wednesday evenings as one is obliged to be present in Leinster House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State referring to his own constituency colleague?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes I am.  He had one of the best records for attendance at votes.  As I am an officeholder, I sometimes am obliged to be paired to facilitate attendance at meetings.  As for the point on arranging meetings, one cannot determine when an EU meeting or an OECD meeting will take place.  As it may well be when the D&aacute;il and Seanad are sitting, one must be realistic in that regard.</P>
        <P>I certainly have no problem in comparing myself or being compared to a factory worker.  A factory worker has a useful, valuable and dignified job and I do not regard myself, as an Oireachtas Member, to be in any way above or beyond someone who happens to be a factory worker.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the points that have been made in this debate.  However, my experience of both Houses leads me to suggest that if one leaves aside illness, which can prevent people from attending the Houses, and if one leaves aside pairs for important business, which do not always involve officeholders, all Members could think of a small minority of Members who, for one reason or another, do not attach great importance to attending these Houses.  I have a sneaking suspicion that were remuneration to be connected to attendance, one would cease to have a problem in that small minority of cases.</P>
        <P>Obviously, there are pros and cons to the system proposed by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The one glaring case that affects almost all Members and for which the allowance is far below the actual cost pertains to office rental.  As Senator Donohoe noted, Members <Col N="1369"/>must adapt, take reductions and accept a greater spirit of austerity.  However, I would not wish, for example, for Senators to revert to the conditions that obtained up to the early 1980s, whereby one might have six or eight Senators in a single room with just one secretary among them.  Justifiable improvements have been made in this regard.</P>
        <P>I hope I have dealt with the different points raised by Members.  Obviously, no decision has been made on either the question of the introduction of a standard allowance or on the specific issue mentioned by the Minister regarding a form or system of signing in.  Many places of employment do so and as I mentioned in my short speech at the European Parliament, this is a subject on which people in different parties have different views.  I do not hold it against either Senator Donohoe or Senator Twomey that they might have different views on the subject.  Different views exists within all parties in this regard and we still are working through these issues.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for its broad support for the changes in the new section 3.</P>

	<P>I wish to make the point to the Minister of State that Fine Gael supports this legislation and does not intend to obstruct its workings.  The Fine Gael Party fully understands the position and is aware of the probable need to make significant reductions to many aspects of Members&rsquo; pay and conditions.  The Fine Gael Party does not have a different view in this regard.  I sought acknowledgement that the role of a Deputy or Senator is broader than one might imagine and that were one to introduce systems involving swipe cards, one would be obliged to recognise the differences in respect of how that role works.  The respective roles of Dublin-based Members, those who are from within striking distance of the capital and those who are not all differ and this always should be taken into account.</P>

    <Title>Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2009: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of the Seanad are aware that significant provisions of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts were commenced two weeks ago on Wednesday, 1 July 2009.  These provide that no advertising or display of tobacco products will be permitted in any retail premises that sells tobacco products and also require retailers to ensure that their tobacco products are stored out of view, within a closed container or dispenser that can only be accessed by the retailer or by the retailer&rsquo;s staff.  To ensure that potential customers, who must be aged 18 years or older, may know what brands are on available, a retailer may use a pictorial list to inform them of <Col N="1370"/>the products stocked.  This pictorial list, which is optional and not mandatory, can only be produced when requested by a customer and must otherwise be kept out of sight.</P>
        <P>Registered tobacco retailers must display a sign at their premises informing the public that tobacco products may be sold at those premises to those over 18 years of age.  This sign is mandatory.  Retailers may display a sign drawing attention to the fact that identification confirming a person&rsquo;s age may be required as long as this sign does not specifically reference tobacco.  In this regard, a wide range of age restricted products can be found in retail outlets that sell tobacco.  Examples are alcohol, lottery tickets, petrol, some aerosols, disposable lighters, knives and some DVDs so there can be no legitimate objection to a sign drawing attention to the fact that age identification may be required, as long as tobacco is not specifically referenced or marketing images associated with tobacco brands are not employed.</P>
        <P>Self-service vending machines are now prohibited except in licensed premises and in registered clubs.  They must be token-activated and they must be located within the line of sight of a member of staff at all times.  This is intended to ensure that those under 18 years of age cannot buy cigarettes from an unsupervised self-service vending machine.  All retailers of tobacco products must register with the Office of Tobacco Control.</P>
        <P>These new measures will be enforced by environmental health officers of the HSE.  I pay tribute to the professionalism and dedication of environmental health officers, some of whom I met recently and who impressed me with their obvious commitment to the enforcement of this legislation.  Ireland is at the forefront of effective tobacco control measures internationally and these measures, announced just over one year ago, will ensure that we maintain our leadership position.  They will play an important part in tackling the public health threat that is posed by the consumption of tobacco.</P>
        <P>The year long lead-in period allowed my Department, together with the HSE and the Office of Tobacco Control, to work with those affected by the new measures.  The groups affected are primarily tobacco retailers, corner shops, the multiples, supermarkets, forecourt shops, bars, hotels or clubs.  Self-service vending machine operators, duty free outlets and specialist tobacco shops are also affected and a comprehensive guidance document was prepared and made available to assist all affected by the new measure in being aware of their responsibilities.  During this lead-in period a number of issues were raised with my Department.  These were examined and were submitted initially for ministerial decision and subsequently for Government decisions.  A policy decision was taken to adjust some of the measures originally proposed and consequently the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2009 is before the Seanad today.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes some minor changes to the overall package of measures introduced on 1 July and takes the opportunity to introduce other minor changes.  The Bill comprises eight sections.  Sections 1 and 8 are standard provisions.  Section 2 defines &ldquo;cigarettes&rdquo;.  Sections 3 and 5 are interlinked and provide for judicial discretion on the period of time a person who is convicted of an offence under the Public Health Tobacco Acts is suspended from the retail register.  The effect of such suspension is that the person cannot sell tobacco products for the period of the suspension.</P>
        <P>This proposal has attracted some critical comment and it would be helpful if I outlined the reasons for the proposed change.  Retailers, their representative groups and Oireachtas colleagues raised concerns about the period of time a person who is convicted of an offence under the Public Health Tobacco Acts would be suspended from the retail register.  The period of three months was considered disproportionate.  It was also considered unfair that the judge has no discretion around the period of time.  These concerns were taken on board and have been responded to.  The three month penalty remains an option and retailers on summary conviction <Col N="1371"/>will also be liable for a fine of up to &euro;3,000 and-or up to three months imprisonment.  As the vast majority of retailers can be expected to be compliant it is not envisaged that there will be a large number of prosecutions in the retail sector so I consider the current proposal a sensible compromise.</P>
        <P>This proposed change was announced on 27 March and a number of groups sought meetings on the proposed changes, including the Irish Cancer Society, which I met on 14 May last.  I met every group that sought a meeting with me.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides an exemption from the advertising ban for airport duty free retail outlets.  They will be permitted to have a pictorial list of tobacco products sold on permanent display.  However, airport duty free retail outlets will be required to conform to other significant changes in how they do business.  Self-service will be abolished and the tobacco products themselves will be required to be kept in a closed container so there will be very significant changes in the airport duty free sector.  It is my intention to review this exemption towards the end of 2013.  This section also provides an exemption from the advertising ban for specialist tobacconist shops.</P>
        <P>Section 6 empowers the Minister to make regulations to introduce combined text and photo warnings, also known as pictorial warnings or graphic warnings, on tobacco products.  The European Commission has proposed a library of these warnings but as their introduction is not mandatory, an enabling provision is required, hence section 6.  These high impact warnings have already been introduced in a number of EU member states and similar warnings have been introduced in non-EU countries such as Thailand, Canada and Brazil.  I intend that my officials will develop an action plan for the introduction of these warnings.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Section 7 broadens the definition of a specialist tobacco retailer to be either a retailer who carries on, in whole, the business of selling tobacco products and tobacco related products by retail or a person who carries on, in part, the business of selling tobacco products but other than cigarettes.  This amendment to the existing legislation will allow specialist tobacco retailers of which there are currently no more than five in business in the State, the choice of either selling only tobacco products and tobacco related products such as pipes, cigarette lighters, cigar cutters, humidors, ash trays and so on as provided in current legislation or, in addition to selling tobacco products, selling a full range of non-tobacco related products.  Typically these are wines, walking sticks, ties and high-end consumer goods but not cigarettes.</P>
      
        <P>Specialist tobacco shops are very much a niche sector and I do not consider that broadening the definition on the lines proposed will lead to a proliferation of such shops.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to the introduction of tobacco control measures that will support the aim of bringing about a tobacco-free society and we will work constructively with all stakeholders in the broad health family to achieve this goal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I note that we are taking all Stages of the Bill and this is not a method that we like to see used in the House.  I hope that when the House returns it will not be the way legislation is dealt with.</P>
        <P>Many anti-smoking groups see this legislation as a concession to vested interest groups and the smoking industry in general, and I am concerned about that.  Will the Minister of State respond to this point?  I note that she stated she met all the interest groups, including the Irish Cancer Society, but in the Government response and the Bill there is a dilution of what was originally intended.  In her speech the Minister of State commented that the Government&rsquo;s intention is to move towards a tobacco-free society but that is not what is happening through this Bill.  There is somewhat of a reversal of this in the Bill.  We support the broad thrust of the <Col N="1372"/>legislation outlining the penalties and for that reason we support it, but we have tabled a number of amendments which we feel would strengthen the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the impact that the lobbying groups have had on the Minister of State and the Department.  It is a very serious question because we all know the power of the international tobacco industry.  When men reduced the amount they were smoking because they were becoming more involved in sporting activities and the message was getting through to them, and they gave up smoking prior to young women, we saw immediately that the tobacco industry moved its budget to focus on women.  It began to advertise in women&rsquo;s magazines and very successfully targeted the advertisements at young women.  When the developed world got the message about cancer and tobacco where did the tobacco industry move its resources and money?  It moved them to developing countries and we see the problems those countries now have in this area.</P>
        <P>The impact of tobacco and smoking on our lives and on the health of our people is absolutely enormous.  This country has been extraordinarily concerned about the rates of breast cancer, but it is very clear that more women will die from lung cancer than breast cancer because of the generation of women who started to smoke in their teens.  Unfortunately, we are now seeing the results of that in increased rates of lung cancer.</P>
        <P>It is very disturbing to read the recent statistics on increased smoking among young women and men; the battle is far from over.  Of an estimated 1 million smokers in the country 1,600 die each year from lung cancer and 7,000 die from smoking-related illnesses.  The costs associated are absolutely enormous, as is the impact on the health service.  The Irish Cancer Society states that more than &euro;1 billion is spent by the health service on smoking-related illnesses.  We should do anything we can to strengthen the hand of the State and the Government to get the message across clearly to our young people that this is a dangerous habit and that it can cost one&rsquo;s life.</P>
        <P>We should not dilute what was recommended.  I am concerned about the dilution of the penalties and about the exemptions.  At total of 80% of smokers begin when they are under 18 and 53% begin when they are under 15.  That is on what the legislation should focus.  We are aware that the danger is beginning to smoke because it is so addictive.  We should do anything we can to protect children, to keep them from starting the habit.  That is why I am concerned about the legislation.</P>
        <P>It seems the Government listened more to the lobby groups representing the retailers than to ASH Ireland, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation.  I received very detailed information from each of those organisations, which are very concerned about the Bill.  They do not believe it is in the interests of public health as it is a dilution and is the wrong way to go.  These are very respected organisations and the Department normally listens very clearly to what they have to say.  I commend the Government on the work done on smoking and the ban, so this is very surprising.  Where has the influence come from and why has this happened in the Bill?</P>
        <P>A recent national health and lifestyle survey shows that the number of people who smoke rose by 2%, from 27% in 2002 to 29% in 2007.  This is a concern and we must ask why this is so and what Government policy can do to reduce these numbers.  The protection of children should be paramount.  Will the Minister of State consider improving the level of the enforcement of penalties for those who ignore the public health measures contained in the Bill?</P>
        <P>On behalf of the 10,000 families who lose loved ones to heart disease each year, Michael O&rsquo;Shea, the chief executive of the Irish Heart Foundation, expressed his serious disappointment with the amendments which water down the enforcement of tobacco health legislation.  He <Col N="1373"/>stated that, as the chief executive of a national charity supporting people with heart disease and stroke, he welcomed the legislation, as did everyone, as a positive step in the fight against tobacco.  However, like any legislation, its success depends on enforcement by authorities and compliance by relevant parties.</P>
        <P>The Irish Heart Foundation also expressed concern that the new signage erected in retail outlets throughout the country is contrary to section 43(4) of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act.  I am sure many of us have seen these advertisements at petrol stations and other outlets; the cover that was designed to move cigarettes from visible public display is being used as an advertising board, making cigarettes seem somewhat more tempting.  The Minister of State may need to examine this issue and we may need to consider more effective enforcement so the legislation is not undermined.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society has also alerted Members of the Oireachtas to the scary and alarming reality that up to 40% of retailers are willing to sell cigarettes to minors.  This is why the penalties should be strong and clear and why we should not reduce them.  Our legislation has to contain a strong message that those who sell cigarettes to minors will be punished where it hurts, in their pockets, and will be removed from the register to sell tobacco for a period of three months.  I do not know why that is being changed.  It is not comparable to alcohol.  We know precisely the effects of tobacco and the danger from smoking is very stark and is there for all to see.  ASH Ireland, a group comprising many public health experts and cardiologists, has expressed similar genuine concerns.  Will the Minister of State respond to these points and outline to whom she has responded and why?  What is the rationale?  It seems to be a dilution of the original recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions on duty free retail.  Will the Minister of State explain to the House why these have been included?  What is the imperative to amend duty free retail provisions?  I have some ideas on it.  The Bill provides exemptions for cigarettes for export to countries outside the EU.  What is this about and why is it the case?  Are we less vigilant about people travelling internationally?  Where we export to countries outside the EU are we less concerned about rigorous enforcement?</P>
        <P>The broader picture is that the Bill outlines an approach to penalties.  We all have the same goal, which is to improve public health, protect young people and ensure that those who break the law by selling cigarettes to children are dealt with.  The issue is how we protect children&rsquo;s health and the future health of the population.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am one of two Senators &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Malley was in the Lower House at the time &mdash; who was here when legislation on this area was first enacted in 2002, followed by the smoking ban legislation in 2004.  It struck me earlier that the legislation and <Col N="1374"/>policy on smoking has changed 100% since 2002 and credit should be given where credit is due.  I commend all the Ministers and Ministers of State, including this Minister, Deputy Brady, who were involved from 2002 to today on the great work they have done.  </P>
        <P>I have four children and, sadly, three of them are smokers.  I was delighted to hear the Minister of State refer to section 6, which deals with the pictorial warnings.  I looked at the graphic pictures this morning and some of them are terribly scary.  If I were a smoker I would give up smoking immediately and put the cigarettes in the bin.  I am going to blow up these pictures to make them more clear, bring them home and pin them up around my kitchen for the summer because they scare the daylights out of me and I hope they will have the same effect on my children who are in their 20s.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that this section of the Bill is finally being enacted.  I understand Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s reservations about letting retailers off the hook by not coming down hard on them if they are found to be selling cigarettes to children under the age of 18, and that is what they are if they are under 18, but we should compare like with like.  The problems addressed in the Intoxicating Liquor Act have harrowing consequences for young people who are drinking but the effects of smoking can be as severe on young people&rsquo;s health.  I am glad it is being brought into line with that legislation and that it is at the discretion of members of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>I realise cigarettes are now stored behind a shutter but we still have the pictures.  It is a good idea to remove those because young people may not be aware that they can buy cigarettes in a particular shop.  If they are under age they may not want to ask if cigarettes are sold whereas when the pictures were displayed they just went in and bought them.  Young teenagers have a great attitude and nothing is beyond them.  They have a sense of boldness and that everything will be at their disposal.  We would like to be able to put old heads on young shoulders but that is not the way it works.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald described how irate ASH and the Irish Cancer Society were but I did not get a sense that they were terribly irate.  I am aware their representatives frequently sat in the Gallery on the occasions when this legislation was going through the House, particularly the Irish Cancer Society representatives, and its representatives are in the Gallery again today, and they were always very welcoming of the measures the Minister of the day was implementing.  By and large, they are pleased and they would be the first to hold their hands up and say we have moved on this issue and that we are in a different position now than was the case all those years ago.</P>
        <P>I was surprised to learn that there are only five specialist tobacco shops in the country.  I am aware of one in Sligo where I live.  It is a musty old shop but it has great character and an old world atmosphere and one would hate to see those shops close down.  Perhaps we should consider the position in other countries, particularly France where there are specialist tobacco shops, which is the only place one can buy cigarettes.  Many years ago my late husband and I were walking the streets of Paris very late at night trying to find a shop that sold cigarettes and I prayed we would come across one because he was going out of his mind looking for a cigarette.  I cursed the fact that they could not be bought in supermarkets but we might consider something like that.</P>
        <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that her officials are examining section 6 in terms of the graphic warnings.  As harrowing as those graphic pictures are I would prefer to see them on a box of cigarettes rather than the printed warning.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister and I welcome the Bill, which is an important measure to protect young people.  As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, more than &euro;1 billion is spent every year on treating smoking related illness.  We must examine that into the future and try to cut back.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1375"/>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I disagree with Senator Fitzgerald when she says this legislation is watering down prohibition.  To my mind it strengthens prohibition.  She made the point that the law will not be as strong on retailers.  The measures remain in place but it is at the discretion of the judge.  That is not watering down prohibition.  Section 6 in particular is an anti-smoking measure and is the reason this Bill should be welcomed.</P>
        <P>It is a measure of how unfamiliar I am with cigarettes that I thought the photographs were already on packets of cigarettes sold here because when one sees somebody with a packet of cigarettes one captures those photographs, so to speak.  They are horrific and graphic but they are a reality.  It is vitally important that section 6 is enabled and that photographs of this nature are put on packets of cigarettes.</P>
        <P>Branding was the big thing in tobacco advertising, particularly in America with products like Marlboro or whatever.  I do not want to name certain brands but they had a cachet attached to them.  If this horrific photograph of the consequences of smoking was printed on a large part of a packet of cigarettes, with a tiny part showing the brand name, we will not see people sitting at a table with a packet of cigarettes beside them.  Senator Feeney has shown me some of the photographs and they are horrifying.  People would think twice about picking up a packet of something that will result in those terrible ailments.  The sooner this legislation is brought in, section 6 enacted and these photographs appear on packets of cigarettes, the better.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about a comment the Minister made about duty free operations.  Coming back to the issue of the branding, if duty free shops are now allowed to display photographs, the photograph of the ailment is vitally important.  If there are pictures of all the diseases one might contract, whether it is impotence, throat cancer or whatever, the sales of cigarettes will decrease enormously because nobody will want to buy a cancer, which is essentially what they will be doing.  We must package and market cigarettes as cancer causing instruments.  When we do that, and in a bold and brave way, we will see the number of smokers decline.  That is what the legislation should be about.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney referred to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  When I travel abroad, it gives me great comfort to hear people compliment Ireland on our pioneering legislation on smoking and plastic bags.  We should remain at the forefront of this issue.  I welcome the legislation and look forward to seeing hideous photographs on cigarette packets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the Bill and the steps which have been taken.  I recently watched an old film on television and I could not get over the fact that every character smoked.  I suddenly realised that one no longer sees that.  The behaviour of people in public clearly sets an example for young people.  I hope the current absence of public images of smoking will deter them.  </P>
        <P>In Germany recently, I was surprised to see a big poster advertising cigarettes.  I thought cigarette advertising had disappeared throughout Europe.  Apparently that is not the case.  Part of the difficulty of any regulation is that Irish people can see television broadcast from other countries, as we can see American magazines containing adverts for popular brands of cigarettes.  I am not sure how we can impose legislation in every area to deter people from smoking.</P>
        <P>The measures in the Bill will be effective because they will apply to shops.  The Irish Cancer Society has expressed to many Members its unhappiness with the reduction in penalties in the legislation.  I think the new penalties will work well.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is a rugby fan.  Until a few years ago, if a rugby player committed a foul the only thing the referee could do was to put him off the pitch for the rest of the game.  That usually finished the match because 14 players could not compete against 15.  With the introduction of the yellow card and <Col N="1376"/>red card rule, the referee was able to put a player off for ten minutes.  The match was not ruined but the penalty was a sufficient deterrent.  The new legislation has a similar benefit.  A judge might not be willing to remove a licence for a considerable period whereas he or she might be willing to remove it for the limited time specified in the Bill.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, we must make sure it is not acceptable to sell cigarettes to children.  Almost 30% of our population still smoke and close to 7,000 people die from tobacco related diseases annually.  The figures are horrific.  I do not understand why anyone smokes.  I can understand someone who started smoking 20 or 30 years ago finding it difficult to give it up.  I find it difficult to understand how anyone in his or her teens can take the first cigarette, knowing it is a drug.  I know we say this all the time.</P>
        <P>Ireland has become the first country in the EU to remove all tobacco advertising from retail outlets. The fact is that one in four people here still smokes and the aim of this Bill is to cut rates even further through the new measures.  I am a little concerned about small retailers who rely so much on tobacco.  With my own background in retail, Members will understand that.  I am much more concerned about the effect the tobacco industry has had on our children and that it continues to invest heavily in promoting a killing product.</P>
        <P>New research by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland makes it clear that the problem in some parts of Irish society is worse than 50 years ago.  In the 1960s, smoking was still comparatively rare among young Irish women.  The RCSI report shows that 56% of 18 to 29 year old females in the lowest social brackets are smokers, while the figure is 28% for the same age group among the most affluent.</P>
        <P>A study of the smoking habits and attitudes of 600 adolescents in Kildare and neighbouring counties found that adolescents have no difficulty in obtaining cigarettes from shops, despite laws which outlaw their sale to minors.  A significant minority say they get them from their friends, brothers and sisters and, most surprisingly, their parents.  Some 90% of the 126 pupils in four post-primary schools indicated little or no difficulty in obtaining cigarettes from their parents, siblings or friends, with the average age for the first cigarette at 12.7 years.  Dr. Brendan O&rsquo;Shea, who has served on the board of the Office of Tobacco Control, spoke to the <i>Leinster Leader</i> and suggested smoking was on the rise again in Ireland, after a dip brought on by the smoking ban.  It is very worrying to think that children are still having no difficulty obtaining cigarettes and I hope we will see a major decrease in smoking rates among children with this new legislation.  It is difficult to understand why young people start smoking when we have so much knowledge about its dangers.</P>
        <P>Another growing problem is black market sale of tobacco.  This is now, officially, one of the most profitable forms of organised crime in Ireland and is the third largest supplier of tobacco in Ireland.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill was before the House but without tackling gangs&rsquo; major source of income, the measures introduced will fall short.  Tobacco smuggling cost retailers &euro;453 million in 2007.  We need to do much more to address this major problem.  I use figures for retailers because they are unhappy with tobacco smuggling, but tobacco smuggling and the encouragement of gang crime is a far greater priority.</P>
        <P>Recent talks at the World Health Organisation on expanding an international anti-smoking treaty to clamp down on the illicit trade in tobacco cited evidence that &ldquo;half a dozen terrorist&rdquo; or militant groups rely on black market tobacco and smuggling for revenue.  I had not realised that.  They include a number of which we would be aware.  Some 11% of the global cigarette market is illicit, equivalent to some 657 billion cigarettes a year.  Those figures come from the International Union against Tobacco and Lung Disease.</P><Col N="1377"/>
        <P>The WHO negotiations are also considering measures to deal with Internet sales.  I am not sure what we can do about that.  What strategy is the Government considering to stem on-line sales of cigarettes?  I am not sure how big is that trade.  The World Health Organisation is also examining a possible halt to duty-free sales of cigarettes, which it says are often diverted into the illicit trade.  I am not sure how that happens.  I can understand why the Minister of State has excluded duty-free from the Bill as we are in competition in that market.  On the other hand, I would like to see a world wide ban or restriction on duty-free.  One of the measures being considered is a ban or restriction on duty-free sales, according to official reports of the WHO meeting.  It concluded that there would be no legal obstacles to such a ban, while a &ldquo;track and trace&rdquo; system on tobacco to prevent contraband was &ldquo;feasible&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the findings that so many duty-free sales of cigarettes end up in the illicit trade, I would like to know what the Government is considering in this respect.  Are heavier restrictions on duty-free cigarettes in the pipeline?  At the very least, I believe we need to find out what percentage of duty-free cigarettes end up on the black market and consider whether a track and trace system on illegal tobacco could be introduced here in Ireland.  I think there is a possibility of being able to do something in this area.</P>
        <P>Those of us in the supermarket and retail business know of a number of shops which stopped stocking cigarettes because they were so easily stolen.  The decisions had nothing to do with health.  Shopkeepers simply feared that tobacco is too easily stolen by customers or employees.</P>
        <P>The steps we are taking are in the right direction.  I hope they have gone far enough.  I accept the changes the Minister of State has made.  I approve of the yellow card and red card system.  I congratulate the Minister of State and encourage her to continue in the strife.  So many lives are at stake in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the opportunity to debate this point of sale amendment to the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 and 2004.  It is important that we are debating the proposed amendments.  </P>
        <P>We have seen a huge cultural change in our attitudes to smoking.  When I was younger and going to pubs and clubs, smoking was part and parcel of everyday life in Ireland.  It was commonplace in pubs and restaurants.  Smoking was often glamorised and popularised in advertising.  We have achieved a revolution in attitudes towards smoking because we have become aware that it is far from the glamorous activity portrayed in advertising, films and other media.  It causes many types of health problems and puts significant pressure on the health system at a time when resources are tightly stretched.  For this reason, the ban on smoking in the workplace was important.  As other Senators stated, in many ways we took the lead by introducing that legislation.  Other countries have since followed our lead or expressed their intention to follow.  We have achieved a major change in public areas where people congregate because smoking and exposing others to passive smoking have become anti-social and unacceptable.</P>
        <P>All of these achievements were important, as were the 2002 and 2004 public health Acts and the point of sale legislation that came into effect on 1 July, which banned the advertising or display of cigarettes in shops, pubs and hotels.  That legislation is an important public health measure, as its aim is to protect children from tobacco advertising.  Children are susceptible to the type of advertising for which tobacco companies are responsible.  The sale of cigarettes to minors is widespread and is an issue that we, as legislators, must take seriously.  We are all aware that smoking is an addictive pastime.  When people become addicted to smoking at a young age, it is often difficult to kick the habit.  As a society, we are obliged to try to prevent this type of unwitting involvement in smoking among young children in particular, otherwise they could be starting out on lifetimes of addiction to what we now know to be a dangerous substance that is bad for our health.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to ensure that the <Col N="1378"/>attractive methods used to convince people to begin smoking are removed from the reach of minors.</P>
        <P>In supporting the point of sale legislation, the Government recognised the power of advertising in many of the outlets regularly used by children, namely, local and garage shops and other retail outlets.  The penalties proposed by the legislation were important.  For this reason, the correspondence sent to all Members by the Irish Cancer Society was interesting, in that it expressed its concern that the amendments to be discussed today would dilute the penalties for those in breach of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts.  Others have referred to some of the statistics.  For example, the Irish Cancer Society has pointed out that 2008 saw 26 convictions for sales to minors.  The society does not believe that this statistic reflects the level of tobacco sales to minors.  It points out that the latest data from the Office of Tobacco Control indicates a significant number of retailers are still willing to sell cigarettes to minors.  The office&rsquo;s report supplies a figure of 40%.  Therefore, the figure of 26 convictions seems low.  The society also pointed out that the fines given in all prosecutions amounted to &euro;6,750 and that the average fine was &euro;250, although the guide fine under the legislation is &euro;3,000.  In three cases, the fine was just &euro;100.  In seven cases, approximately 27% of prosecutions, no fines were given at all.</P>
        <P>When we discuss the amendments, we must be aware of the level of disappointment with the way in which the current penalties are being implemented.  The concern is that these amendments will dilute further the ability to penalise and prosecute those involved in selling cigarettes to minors.  The key amendment, according to the society, is the greater judicial discretion in deciding for what period a person convicted of an offence under the Acts should be removed from the retail register.  The maximum period for which someone can be excluded from the register will be 90 days.  We must be practical and consider to what extent this penalty will serve as a disincentive to a retailer who has been selling tobacco to minors.  Ninety days is barely three months, which is a short time to be removed from the register.  I respectfully suggest that it is unlikely to have a major impact on the retailer.</P>
        <P>Representations were made to the Government about retailers&rsquo; concerns regarding such penalties, but being removed from the register and losing that licence would not mean that a retailer must close his or her shop.  Retailers would still be able to sell other goods and remain open for business.  We must try to find a balance between the protection of minors and the interests of retailers.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to some of the concerns raised by the Irish Cancer Society with Deputies and Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  What I am about to say is not shocking in and of itself, but only inasmuch as it relates to the context.  I am referring to the supposedly off-putting pictures on packets of cigarettes.  I recall working with Dr. Neasy while I was a student nurse.  He was a consultant from Galway who used to come to our hospital once a month to perform surgery on patients with lung cancer.  At the time and to my shame, it was routine for us to have a cigarette after assisting at or overseeing those operations.  We were not put off at all.  It was just something we did, as there was a disconnect between what was on the table or in the bucket in front of us and what we were doing.  The main point in terms of cigarettes and tobacco is prevention.  They are very addictive.  After battling for many years to give cigarettes up, I succeeded 18 years ago.  I have never felt the need to take them up again.</P>
        <P>I will qualify my point on the number of young smokers.  The notion, often proposed by the media, that cigarettes have a slimming effect by curbing the appetite is a serious issue.  I undertake a sexual health programme in many of the schools in the south east.  While we discuss many issues, many girls are concerned about the contraceptive pill and whether smoking will <Col N="1379"/>keep them thin.  The information that they get from Bebo and similar websites supports their viewpoint.</P>
        <P>Clonmel hospital saw a high incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  It was suggested that some of those problems had to do with the geography &mdash; being surrounded by hills and beautiful scenery &mdash; but there were many chest complications and smoking-related disorders.  This fact has been borne out by the submission of the Irish Heart Foundation.  I know Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Shea from my chairing of the Heartsafe programme.  The Heartsafe programme promotes activities and training in the use of AEDs and we were the first Heartsafe town in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is a disconnection between the education of young people on sexual and physical health and the activity a person undertakes that is damaging to himself.  I can deal with sexual behaviour that is safe but, although I do not want to moralise, I am always upset when I see someone smoking because there is such an addictive element to it.  I know because I have been through it myself.</P>
        <P>I have also seen people struggle when cigarette prices are increased in the budget, with a 10 cent increase making a real difference to them.  They are distraught because they must cut down on cigarettes so any legislation that might help to prevent people starting smoking is of benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  My attitude to this legislation is framed by my personal experience.  I have had asthma since I was a young boy.  At one stage it was quite bad.  With the use of medicine now it is, at worst, an inconvenience.  It has given me a real insight, however, into what it is like to struggle with unhealthy lungs.  I did not ask to be asthmatic, I had no say in that, so when I see people choosing to do something that will affect the health of their lungs, I feel we must do more to help them understand that choice is wrong.</P>
        <P>The change our society has undergone in its attitude has been brought home to me by a television programme, &ldquo;Mad Men&rdquo;.  It is set in an advertising agency on Madison Avenue during the 1960s and everyone smokes all of the time in the programme.  It is one of the features critics watching it have commented on.  Some people have gone so far as to suggest that it makes smoking cool again because we see these impossibly glamorous and successful people smoking incessantly.  That shows how important this legislation is.</P>
        <P>It hits the nail on the head when addressing the role retailers and retailer display can play in influencing behaviour.  It does this in two ways, one obvious and one less so.  The obvious way is that if something is readily available, the supply will be increased and more people will use it.  Retailers are also important in influencing attitudes, subtly but significantly affecting people&rsquo;s attitudes to what is acceptable or not.  If something is on display, it creates the impression for young people that it is fine to do it.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Nudging&rdquo; is an idea that has entered the political culture.  It was developed by Carl Sunstein, who now works in the White House as head of regulation.  His idea is that very small changes can be prompted in people&rsquo;s behaviour that will have hugely disproportionate effects on how they live their lives that then affect how an economy or society performs.  This legislation is an example of a nudge in that it removes material from public display.  That will then influence cultural ideas about what is acceptable or makes me feel sexy.  That is why I welcome the legislation, although I share Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s concerns about the weakening of the penalties.</P>
        <P>Retailers are important in influencing people&rsquo;s behaviour through supply and resultant acceptance.  I take exception, therefore, to the exclusion of duty free outlets from this legislation.  If young children when they are going through duty free shops see these items displayed, <Col N="1380"/>they will form the idea that smoking is still acceptable or somehow cool.  They can see people picking these up to go on holiday and will then associate cigarettes with leisure.  The next step in the legislation is to tackle nudges going in the wrong direction, away from where we want, by stating that if something is bad for a person if they are in Ireland, it is the same if they are going abroad.  Such clarity would improve the legislation.</P>
        <P>The overwhelming majority of retailers are law abiding but there will be potential for the supply of illegal tobacco to increase.  There will be people selling tobacco products on the black market.  It would be a retrograde step if retailers in town centres who are implementing this law find their businesses being hurt by those on the edges taking advantage.  If the Minister acted on that, it would speed up implementation of legislation.</P>
        <P>This is good legislation and we should be proud that we are leading the way in public policy on smoking and educating people on its consequences.  We cannot, however, afford to be complacent.  I would like the Minister to accept Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment because it would go some way to ensuring that we are relentless in dealing with this issue and its social consequences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was shocked when I was preparing my contribution to find out that 1 million people still smoke in Ireland and a very large proportion of them are young people.  Senator Prendergast made the point that in many cases this is bound up with people&rsquo;s idea of sexuality, that it is cool to smoke and if I do it, that girl or boy will really fancy me the next time he or she sees me.  There is no point being attractive while making oneself sick and this area merits more work.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.<b></b>I note in particular the concerns expressed about the proposed removal of the mandatory 90 day suspension from the retail register of a retailer who commits an offence.  This point was carefully considered when the legislation was being drafted and I am confident that the proposed change will better serve the long-term tobacco control agenda.</P>
        <P>A period of suspension from the retail register remains mandatory.  The only change is that judicial discretion will apply.  The three month suspension remains an option.  My officials will keep the operation of this aspect of the legislation under careful review.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s parallel with the effect of a ten minute suspension in a rugby game is apt because this principle influenced Government thinking.  A penalty that is imposed is more likely to be a deterrent than a more severe penalty that is not imposed.  The proposed change was influenced by concerns that the stricter penalty might not be imposed in practice.  It was also influenced by the prospect of a legal challenge on the basis that a three month removal from the register would be a disproportionate penalty but it remains an option for retailers on summary conviction.  They will also be liable for a fine of up to &euro;3,000 or up to three months imprisonment.  As most retailers can be expected to be compliant it is not envisaged that there will be many prosecutions in the retail sector.  The current proposal represents a sensible compromise but my officials will keep it under careful review.</P>
        <P>I dealt with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s point about the retail sign, &lsquo;no ID, no sale&rsquo; in my earlier remarks.  I understand that some retail outlets are displaying a sign indicating that ID may be required but this does not refer specifically to tobacco products because there is a wide range of restricted products to be found in retail outlets that also sell tobacco.  Retailers have said that it is helpful for their staff to have a clear sign to point to when dealing with a troublesome customer and that there is an obvious need to find a solution to this problem.  A sign that does not specifically refer to tobacco is an acceptable solution.</P><Col N="1381"/>
        <P>The airport duty free retail outlets must comply with all other aspects of the legislation, that all tobacco products must be stored out of sight in a closed container, can no longer be sold by means of self-service and the airport authority must register with the Office of Tobacco Control.  There will therefore be a significant change in the manner in which tobacco products are sold in airport duty free retail outlets from 1 July 2009.  Airport duty free outlets are a unique form of retail as the shops compete internationally rather than domestically.  Tobacco products may be purchased only by passengers leaving the European Union and unlike all other retail outlets they are not aimed at the domestic market.</P>
        <P>Duty free tobacco products are not sold alongside confectionery, therefore the subliminal association between confectionery and tobacco is not an issue.  Duty free allowances are restricted to people over the age of 18.  The sale of tobacco is passport-controlled, thereby restricting it to those over 18.  Passenger profiling indicates that only 3.7% of passengers are under 16.  Apart from leaving the pictorial list on permanent display there are no additional concessions to the duty free sector.</P>
        <P>When the combined text and photograph warnings are introduced the pictorial list permitted to be on permanent display in duty free outlets will incorporate these warnings.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point about duty free relates more to the diversion of duty free than to the legitimate sales in a duty free environment.  This is not a concern in the Irish duty free outlets.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for all matters concerned with the illicit trade in cigarettes.  They continue to implement a wide-ranging programme of measures to combat this threat, including continuing seizures of illegal products and prosecution of offenders; monitoring of Internet sites and instigating test purchases to identify importation routes; monitoring of sales patterns to identify and investigate irregularities and to target enforcement activity contributing to action at EU level to improve the controls on excisable products in the community; monitoring of sea cargo on the basis of risk analysis seizures; and ongoing monitoring of international courier and air freight services including Internet traffic as well as air passenger arrivals has also resulted in significant seizures.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to address some legitimate points raised with my Department over the past year.  It does not represent any weakening of the Government&rsquo;s position in regard to tobacco control.  With the introduction of the 1 July package, when tobacco control measures are compared internationally Ireland is at the forefront.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1: </P><Col N="1382"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, line 29, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not less than 14 days, except for offences relating to the sale of tobacco products to minors whereby removal from the register will be for a mandatory period of not less than 3 months&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I thank the Minister of State for her response.  It is interesting that the figure for duty free sales to minors is so low.</P>
        <P>In 2008 there were 26 convictions for sales to minors under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act.  The total amount of fines given in all prosecutions was &euro;6,750, the average fine handed down was &euro;250 and the guide fine under the legislation was &euro;300.  In three cases the fine was &euro;100 and in seven cases, almost 27% of prosecutions, there were no fines.  The fines are not an effective deterrent.  Convictions are difficult to secure and there seems to be a problem of enforcement.  I do not know whether that is due to a shortage of people or because it is difficult to get a prosecution.  A deterrent is therefore very important.  The Oireachtas should send out a clear message about these public health issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney is not correct to say that the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and ASH are happy with this legislation.  They believe it is a watering down.  A mistake was made in the negotiations with the former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Wallace, that led to this Bill when the lobby interests took priority over the public health interests.  That is disappointing because this is a major public health issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I have already acknowledged the positive aspects of this legislation and the work of the Ministers in this area, for example, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.  The smoking ban was exceptional public health legislation which had an enormous impact.  The figures show, however, that the challenge continues.  This amendment addresses the challenge by saying that to deal with the challenges from a public health point of view we need strong deterrents to stop young people starting to smoke.  This concerns protecting minors and we say there should be a minimum mandatory element.  That is why the amendment proposes a period of no fewer than 14 days because selling cigarettes to minors has such lifelong implications and is so serious that there can be no compromise.  Amendment No. 1 states &ldquo;not less than 14 days, except for offences relating to the sale of tobacco products to minors whereby removal from the register will be for a mandatory period of not less than 3 months&rdquo;.  When the Minister of State commented on this, she spoke about a proportionate response and suggested that, constitutionally or legally, my proposal might be considered a disproportionate response.  When one considers the health implications of selling cigarettes, what is a proportionate response or an appropriate deterrent?  As for removing a retailer who is guilty of such an offence from the retail register for a three month period, the shop can continue to sell other products, it is not as if the business is being closed.  Such a retailer will be removed from the retail register to sell this product.</P>
        <P>If the effect of this measure is that some young people get cigarettes more easily, end up with a lifelong addiction, lung cancer, cardiovascular problems or a range of other health problems, what constitutes a proportionate response?  A proportionate response would be for the Government to take this issue seriously, to have a strict response to it and to recognise that tobacco is different from other licensed products.  There is no safe consumption of tobacco.  We must bear to mind that the rate of lung cancer is increasing and I have gone into detail about that.  This is an extraordinarily serious public health issue.  As Senator Prendergast and others have said, the addiction issues around young people beginning to smoke early in their lives will have an enormous impact on their health.  Therefore, we must get this legislation right.</P><Col N="1383"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Our view is that if the Minister of State accepted this amendment, it would strengthen the legislation and give a clearer message to retailers and to the 60% of retailers who are compliant in this regard.  I understand there is not a problem in regard to the behaviour of 60% of retailers and the Minister of State may indicate the percentage is higher than that but that is the figure I have.  The 60% of retailers who abide by the law will not view it as fair if the sanctions against those who breach the law are not strong.  That is another reason to be clear in this respect.  This proposal is not draconian, of that there is no question, but it is stronger than what is currently proposed.  What I propose assumes that a person&rsquo;s removal from the register would be automatic and would not have to be referred for judicial decision.  It is a stronger approach.</P>
        <P>Clearly, there were different agendas in regard to this legislation.  There is a public health agenda, which should be the primary one.  That was the agenda when the legislation to ban smoking was introduced.  The Government stood up to vested interest groups.  What is proposed in this legislation constitutes a giving in to certain groupings.  I do not know whether it was the retailers, the tobacco industry or from where the influences came, but public health was not placed centre stage when these amendments were being considered.  I am surprised by that because I know the Government is committed to public health issues.  Aspects of this legislation are strange.  It smacks of lobby group influence, which does not put public health centre stage.  For that reason, I propose amendment No. 1 to section 3.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment for the reasons outlined by Senator Fitzgerald.  She made a valid point on the need to ensure that public health is put centre stage in this respect.  I cannot restate often enough the importance of preventing people from smoking in the first place.  When I decided to start to smoke, I did so because of peer pressure.  I and my colleagues were training together and it was considered cool to have a cigarette and a cup of coffee.  That is a wrong reason to smoke but at the time that was what we were exposed to.  It was considered cool to smoke.  I now realise the huge public health cost of smoking on our health services.  Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Shea, the Irish Cancer Society and ASH have made very relevant contributions to this legislation.  These amendments are excellent and their inclusion would strengthen the legislation for the reasons clearly outlined by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>

	<P>We are dealing with amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 to 11, inclusive.  On the issue of the monitoring and enforcement of the legislation, the Office of Tobacco Control is responsible for the co-ordination and implementation of the national tobacco control inspection programme in order to ensure there is compliance with this important public health legislation.  Environmental health office, EHOs, in the Health Service Executive are authorised officers under the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts.  Protocols or administrative guidelines have been developed by the OTC in co-operation with the HSE.  The guidelines set out best practice to be followed by EHOs and facilitate a consistent approach to enforcement of the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008 active enforcement of the smoke-free workplace legislation by the EHOs was critical in maintaining the high levels of compliance and 97% of premises inspected were found to be compliant.  The data from the national inspection programme are published annually by the OTC.  The data include the number of inspections, the rates of compliance and the number of prosecutions for specific breaches of the legislation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the penalties under the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts, I have already pointed out that a period of suspension from the retail register is mandatory and it will remain mandatory.  The only change is that we are providing for judicial discretion in this respect.  It can apply <Col N="1384"/>up to a three month period of suspension.  I said that my officials will keep the operation of this aspect of the legislation under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed the advertising issue earlier to which the Minister of State responded.  From some of the examples I have seen, there is a difference between a standard sign stating the need for the production of ID and a marketing campaign which, effectively, is what is happening, which creates a ready-made standard, namely, no ID no sale, on the shelves where cigarettes are sold.  I assume that is a matter the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials will investigate to examine whether it is a legitimate sign.  That is important because in terms of the advertising that is taking place, we are seeing clever marketing campaigns to get around the provisions of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I have explained what is allowed.  There cannot be any reference to tobacco in any advertisements relating to the ID section.  The other advertisement that is allowed is the one that has been outlined in the guidelines.  I hope the Senator has seen the one that is officially allowed, stating that tobacco products are sold to people over 18 years of age only.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State familiar with the marketing campaigns that are ongoing which say, no ID, no sale.  They are clearly subliminally about tobacco advertising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Senator&rsquo;s concern in that regard?  I am not aware of the advertisements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State would give an undertaking that the officials might examine the matter.  It does not appear to be within the spirit of the legislation.  In terms of the ongoing monitoring of the legislation, this is one area that will need to be monitored and a decision will need to be made as to whether it comes within the legislation or undermines it.  It may be considered necessary to introduce further legislation to deal with the matter.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">4.&mdash;Any approved signage regarding age restrictions on the sale of tobacco products, or any other matter, must be approved by the Department of Health and Children and must not carry the colour scheme of tobacco brands on the market.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We discussed advertising issues earlier but this amendment deals with the issue of subliminal marketing that is going on and which, I believe, goes against the spirit of what the Minister would want.  We have effectively discussed the matter already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 43 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 and 2004 provides that a person registered with the Office of Tobacco Control under section 37 must display a prescribed sign at the premises where tobacco products are sold.  The sign, which informs the public that tobacco products are on sale to persons aged 18 years and over, is prescribed in the Public Health (Tobacco Retail Sign) Regulations 2009.  No other sign, notice or display is permitted at the premises indicating that tobacco products are for sale, and attention cannot be drawn to the sign by means of light, sound or any other means.</P>
        <P>I understand that some retail outlets are displaying a sign indicating that ID may be required.  This sign does not specifically refer to tobacco products being available to purchase.  There is a wide range of age-restricted products to be found in retail outlets that also sell tobacco, so there can be no legitimate objection to a sign drawing attention to the fact that age-ID may be required, as long as tobacco is not specifically referenced.</P>
        <P>Also, retailers have made the point that it is helpful for their staff to have a sign to point to when dealing with a troublesome customer.  There is an obvious need to find a solution to this problem.  A sign not specifically referenced to tobacco is an acceptable solution.  A sign using the recognised colours of cigarettes, such as gold, blue or purple, is not acceptable.  The proposed amendment is therefore not required and I regret I am unable to accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P><Col N="1387"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The display of a sign or artifact which advertises cigarettes, where the brand displayed is one which is no longer available for sale in the form displayed or advertised on the sign or artifact, is not prohibited.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a minor point concerning premises with antique signs that are there for historic rather than marketing reasons.  The issue may well be covered already but I thought I would put it in as an amendment and ask the Minister of State to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 33A of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, as inserted by section 5 of the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Act 2004, defines &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; as including, with regard to a tobacco product:</P>
        <P LI="1">every form of recommendation of the product to the public and, in particular&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) (i) a statement of the name of a manufacturer or importer of a tobacco product, or the name of any brand of tobacco product, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) a statement of any trade description or designation, or a display or other publication of a trademark, emblem, marketing image or logo, by reference to which the product is marketed or sold,</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is1p8- ?><?oasys _ix ?>in circumstances where such statement, display or publication may reasonably be regarded as a recommendation of the product to the public.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If a brand no longer exists then there is no product to recommend to the public and the display of, for example, an obsolete brand could not be seen as a recommendation of that product to the public.  Signs and memorabilia connected with brands that are no longer on the market may therefore continue to be displayed.  The issue here is whether a brand is still on the market, and it is immaterial whether a mirror or other item is genuine or a reproduction.  This amendment is unnecessary and I regret I am unable to accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Before she reached the last sentence I was beginning to think it would be an awful shame if old signs such as the ones under discussion were covered by the Bill.  Ireland markets itself partly in terms of the old Irish pub.  Many of these have been recreated and one sees signs for Sweet Afton, Woodbines and other brands of cigarette which I remember from childhood.  I was hoping the Minister would reply in the manner she did.  It is nice to see such old signs still displayed and if the products are not available for sale today they do not pose a threat.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not have the opportunity to express my opposition, and that of my party, to section 3 of the Bill, but these two sections are linked and we oppose them for the same reasons.  I will outline for the Minister of State why I pushed the vote on the deletion of section 3.  I speak as somebody who has been smoking for a long time.  I am not that old, but I have been smoking for a long period of my life.  However, I am off cigarettes for the last seven weeks, so I am doing all right.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1388"/>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we acknowledge the major damage caused by smoking in our society.  We need to take into account the need for constant vigilance and concerted efforts to combat smoking in the most effective way possible.  It is extremely disappointing to see the Government introducing provisions that water down the penalties for breaches in the law with regard to the advertising, sale and display of tobacco products in shops.  We need to ask ourselves what signal this sends out.  The latest survey from the Office of Tobacco Control shows that 40% of retailers and 63% of licensed premises are willing to sell cigarettes to minors.  While there has been some improvement in these figures since 2007, it is still a high rate and shows that breaches of the law are widespread.  Such breaches ensure that children can have ready access to cigarettes and begin an addiction that will be lifelong in many cases, health-impairing in most and fatal, unfortunately, in many.</P>
        <P>In the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, among the penalties set out is removal of the retailer from the register and consequent prohibition from sale of tobacco products for three months for a summary offence and a year upon indictment.  This new Bill proposes, in sections 3 and 5, to dilute these penalties.  The mandatory tobacco sale prohibition period for offenders is to be changed from three months or one year to a maximum of three months or one year, with lesser periods possible at the discretion of the Judiciary.  This is just not acceptable.</P>
        <P>When the Bill was published, the impression was given that this change only affected those provisions relating to the display of sale of tobacco products.  The Government rightly went ahead with the ministerial order that came into effect on 1 July but apparently as a softener to retailers signalled that it would reduce the penalties for breach of the law.  As I said, the impression was that this was only for display-related offences, but my reading of the Bill indicates that it covers all breaches of the principal Act of 2002.  Either way, Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to sections 3 and 5 of the Bill, which send out entirely the wrong signal and represent a slackening of the effort to combat smoking and prevent the grave damage it does to our society.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with the Bill in general, apart from these sections; other sections relate to duty free and specialist tobacco shops.  However, the signal these sections have sent out is unhealthy.  The Minister for Health and Children talks about the damage done by tobacco and we all know about this.  In this context, I do not understand why a Government would reduce the penalties for sale to minors.  It does not make sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Sections 3 and 5 are interlinked and provide for judicial discretion on the period of time that a person convicted of an offence under the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts is suspended from the register.  The issues involved here were discussed fully when section 3 was considered and I regret I am unable to accept the argument that section 5 should be reconsidered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The issue I have tabled, and the last issue to be discussed in the Seanad before the summer recess, is important to communities throughout the island of Ireland.  It affects about 300 HSE employees but it will affect hundreds of thousands of medical card holders across the State.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the office in Ballybofey, County Donegal, where ten employees of the HSE provide a remarkable service to medical card holders.  These individuals process applications for medical cards and deal with appeals submitted by members of the public in an efficient and caring manner.  They possess a knowledge and understanding of the way of life in Donegal, the geography of the county and the difficulties people experience.  Those to whom I refer operate under an extreme amount of pressure and I acknowledge that there is a backlog in respect of the service being provided.  At present, 78,000 people in Donegal possess medical cards and a further 5,700 utilise the GP visit card.  This means that some 84,000 people, over half the population of Donegal, have access to either card.  As a result, a major burden has been placed on the staff who work at the office in Ballybofey.</P>
        <P>I am concerned with regard to the immediate threat on the part of the Government and the HSE to remove the service and centralise it to what is primarily a call centre in Dublin.  On foot of this action, the knowledge, understanding and compassion which those who work at the Ballybofey office possess will be lost.  The HSE has already centralised the service relating to the medical card for those over 70 years of age and it must be acknowledged that this has not worked.  The lack of staff in this regard means that there is not an ability to deal with the issues that have arisen in respect of those over 70 years of age, not to mention tackling matters relating to those between the ages of zero and 69.  Some 350 calls go unanswered each week at the hub in Dublin because the staff there do not have the capability to cope with them.  Such calls are made by those over 70 or people who are applying for medical cards.  What will be the position when the 84,000 people in Donegal who possess cards of one type or another and their counterparts in other counties will be obliged to avail of the services at this call centre?</P>
        <P>The centralisation of this service runs completely contrary to the Government&rsquo;s commitment in respect of decentralisation in the early part of this decade.  The idea that the Government would remove services from a county such as Donegal at a time like this does not make sense.  I have challenged the Government in respect of numerous issues.  I had a discussion with someone recently as to whether there should be fewer Ministers and Ministers of State and he stated that we should get rid of them all because all we need is a &ldquo;Minister for Cop On&rdquo;.  An element of cop on is missing from some of the decisions being made by the Government at present and, in the current climate, it certainly does not make sense to remove services from Donegal.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State outline the plan with regard to the centralisation of services?  Will she confirm that such a centralisation is not going to take place?  I am sure she is aware that IMPACT, the union which represents the ten workers in Donegal to whom I refer and the other 300 who are employed in various other offices throughout the State, is in the process of <Col N="1390"/>balloting its members on industrial action.  The results of that ballot will be known at the end of the month and I have no doubt that IMPACT is ready to defend not only those it represents but also the services these people provide to medical card holders in Donegal and other counties.</P>
        <P>It is important that this centralisation of services should not proceed as planned.  It is also important that sense should prevail, that the ten jobs in Ballybofey should be protected, that the service should continue to be provided in Donegal and that the 84,000 people there who hold one type of card or another should continue to be able to access it and that the compassion and knowledge to which I referred earlier should be retained in the county.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate that what is proposed is a fantasy of the Minister for Health and Children and that it will not proceed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and general practitioner, GP, visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE, and is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his or her dependants.  Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the 32 local health areas.  However, under the HSE&rsquo;s service plan for 2009, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will be centralised and will transfer to the executive&rsquo;s primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Dublin.  This change is being implemented on a phased basis and commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.</P>
        <P>The decision by the HSE to centralise the processing of applications has been made in the context of the requirement to realise the savings in this very challenging economic environment.  The change will provide an enhanced standardised service to the client population.  It will also deliver services for the public within sustainable levels of expenditure and with the aim of achieving efficiencies by the greater usage of shared services.  In view of the fact that medical card applications will all be processed centrally, this will result in a more consistent and transparent approach being applied.  There will be no adverse impact on patient care or the quality of service provided.  In addition, there will be no adverse affect on the assessment of people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but who have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately, with a card issuing within 24 hours.  People whose income exceeds the income guidelines but who have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will continue to have their applications considered by the PCRS.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised the Department of Health and Children that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices.  These offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  In conjunction with the national helpline, they will also deal with inquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements and the completion of application forms.  However, the process will involve a reassignment of existing human resources within the HSE.</P>
        <P>This is a good example of the type of innovation signalled in the transforming public services programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.</P><Col N="1391"/>
        <P>I wish to highlight that the number of persons with medical cards has increased by over 240,000 since the start of 2005.  Almost 1.4 million people are now covered by the card.  In addition, over 90,000 people have GP visit cards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless of my level of disappointment with it, I thank the Minister of State for the information provided.  Everyone is aware that the HSE is both a monster out of control and a bureaucratic nightmare.  The Government is intent on creating a second monster.  Processing the applications of 1.4 million people at one call centre in Dublin does not make sense.</P>
        <P>I recently spoke to Cora Harvey, a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor who lives in Ballybofey, who indicated to me that the people in the office there understand the needs of those throughout Donegal who possess medical cards.  I do not understand how staff in an office in Dublin who will be obliged to deal with over 1.4 million people will be positioned to operate in the same way.  For those who live in rural areas, the office in Dublin might as well be located in Timbuktu or China.  It does not make sense to centralise the service to Dublin and I am of the view that the office here will not be efficient.</P>
        <P>The call centre or hub in Dublin currently deals with medical card holders who are over 70 years of age and misses an average of 350 calls per week.</P>

    <Title>Killarney Jarveys. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State will be aware, the stand-off between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Killarney jarveys is happening in the middle of our tourism season.  Sadly, this year&rsquo;s is a very poor season with information released by the CSO showing that tourism figures are down 20%.  In Killarney and the remainder of County Kerry, tourism figures for the year to date show a decrease of 37% to 40%.</P>
        <P>The Minister will appreciate that the jaunting car is a unique mode of transport.  The jarveys have been operating in Killarney since the visit of Queen Victoria in 1861, if not before.  For all of the intervening period, they have taken tourists on journeys through Killarney National Park in their jaunting cars.</P>
      
        <P>Both sides, including the Government side, must see sense.  They must enter into meaningful discussions because although the national parks and wildlife service, NPWS, and the jarveys entered into discussions, the impression is that they merely sat around a table and talked for the sake of it, without either side aiming to get anywhere.  Moreover, the local authority, which is the licensing authority has not been involved.  It must ensure the jarveys have insurance, their cars are roadworthy and so on.</P>
        <P>My plea is that access be restored immediately and that talks be resumed, which might also involve the local authority.  The traps are rather high and given the uniqueness of this mode of transport, they may not be best suited to these devices without some modification.  I read today <Col N="1392"/>that the Department had provided many of these devices free of charge.  It might consider grant aiding modifications to the cars.  That is a point for legal discussion.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also refer to these people&rsquo;s legal rights.  As the Minister of State is aware, an eminent solicitor, Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Donoghue, represents the jarveys and I am sure he is not misleading his clients and that they have legal rights.  It would be a pity were this matter to remain deadlocked, thereby requiring resolution in the courts.  However, that is where it appears to be going at present.  I make this point regardless of the merits of the environmental arguments the Minister undoubtedly possesses.  It is sheer lunacy to allow them to override other considerations at present and is what has led to this lock-out.  If the Minister is acting on serious health and safety grounds, such grounds must be advanced because I do not know how such requirements enter the legal mix in regard to this matter.</P>
        <P>Consultation and dialogue is the only way out of this impasse.  In common with any other strike, it will not be resolved by allowing a stand-off to continue and someone must break this deadlock.  I note the mayor of Killarney has offered some sound advice and perhaps he might be available to mediate.  I am sure everyone involved in public life seeks a resolution to this matter.  However, my plea is on behalf of all the tourism interests that are suffering badly this season in particular.  In the middle of the Killarney July racing festival, people have been faced with this situation since 6 a.m. yesterday.  Moreover, I understand from a telephone call made half an hour or so ago that the stand-off continues and no one is making a move.  I am pleading for an immediate move, for access to be restored and for talks to be resumed immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  I thank the Senator for this opportunity to update the House on this important issue.  Within Killarney National Park, up to 45 jarveys, operating 66 jaunting cars, ply their trade under licence from the national parks and wildlife service across a network of approximately 15 km of internal roads within the park.  An unfortunate consequence of so many horses frequenting the park is that the roadways are consistently fouled with horse dung.  The presence of this untreated dung in the park has long been a concern from the point of view of aesthetic, environmental, tourism and health and safety grounds.  Consequently, while the jarveys can add to the visitor experience, the soiling of roads in the park simply is no longer acceptable.</P>
        <P>The national parks and wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government first set out to address the problem of soiled footpaths in the park to make it clean and safe for visitors approximately four years ago in the context of the management plan for Killarney park from 2005 to 2009.  That plan included a commitment to research and demonstrate the best methods for the disposal of horse dung and to implement a methodology in consultation with the jarveys.  Since October 2007, the NPWS has embarked on a serious and extended effort to engage with the jarveys.  This involved multiple meetings during which the NPWS presented the options, supported both by a UK-based equine expert on the issue and one of Ireland&rsquo;s leading equine veterinary consultants.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that the clear preference, on the basis of extensive research, expert advice and investigation, is that the dung catcher device offers the best solution to this problem.  This option was further supported in various field trials conducted towards the end of 2008.  At the end, therefore, of a long period of consultation with the jarveys and following the successful field trials, the dung catcher option was committed to.</P>
        <P>In early 2009, the jarveys were invited to a briefing at which it was explained that the dung catcher was being introduced on 8 June 2009.  As such, jarveys were given three months to familiarise their horses with the new devices.  A further two demonstrations were held in April <Col N="1393"/>and early June.  Regrettably, the jarveys have consistently signalled their opposition to the new devices.  However, they have never trialled the device on their own jaunting cars to illustrate where they perceive the problem to lie.  This makes it difficult to pinpoint what are their actual reservations and consequently makes it impossible for the NPWS to address them.</P>
        <P>The NPWS has been patient in enforcing the implementation of the new requirements.  The jarveys have been reminded in writing since 8 June that they are operating illegally in Killarney National Park as they do not hold a valid licence; a condition of the new licence being that the jaunting cars are fitted with a dung catcher.  In the meantime, the State continues to pay for the cleaning of paths and roads in the park.  The situation of unlicensed jarveys could not be allowed to continue indefinitely and so, reluctantly, the NPWS took appropriate enforcement action yesterday by preventing access to the jarveys to the park.</P>
        <P>I trust the House will appreciate the efforts to date by the NPWS to move forward on an agreed basis.  I acknowledge the support and understanding the Department has received from the trustees of Muckross House and the business, tourism and wider community in Killarney.  The action today by the jarveys in blocking the entrance ways to the park to all visitors is not acceptable.  The NPWS will be happy to welcome back the jarveys to the park on the basis of the new arrangements for dung catchers which, as Members are aware, are in widespread use throughout European cities.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I thank the Minister of State for the outline of the position, which is an outline of recent history and an apologia from the national parks and wildlife service.  This is what it believes and it may well be correct.  However, the Minister of State said that this practice now is illegal on foot of the order made by the Minister, which gave the jarveys three months to comply.  However, that effectively is a unilateral decision and I wish to be apprised of the legal basis behind it.  Of course, if the matter goes to the High Court or a similar destination, the Minister of State will be precluded from providing such information.  My point is that unless common sense prevails, this matter will be resolved by the man in the wig.  However, this lock-out is serving no purpose.</P>
        <P>I consider this material to be more objectionable when found on the streets of our town and the connecting roadways than in the park.  In the latter, there are NPWS staff and others to remove it and transplant it to the rose bushes or wherever it will do good.  Moreover, people can avoid it as it is clearly visible in the middle of the paths and one can walk on the grass.  For that reason, I believe the licensing authority also must be involved.  I do not know what legal right the NPWS has to make a unilateral decision in this regard.  Moreover, if the matter becomes tied up legally, it might be difficult to find out.  I completely accept in good faith the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks.  However, the matter is crying out for resolution and this stand-off is damaging our tourism further.  We all are in the business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Many tourists wish to visit Killarney National Park and they choose this unique mode of transport to so do.  We cannot afford to have this lock-out and stand-off.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State conveyed this point in the strongest terms to her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and welcome the opportunity to discuss this important matter.  I wish to share time with Senator Cummins.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask for confirmation that an application has been made by the Government to access the EU globalisation fund.  The EU has established the globalisation fund, worth over &euro;500 million per year until 2013, to pay for retraining and reskilling where there are large-scale redundancies.  The scheme was first available to companies with a workforce in excess of 1,000 but that number has since been reduced to 500.  The 600 redundancies at Waterford Crystal, therefore, qualify for EU help.</P>
        <P>The Government sought this help for the 1,900 workers in Limerick who were made redundant by Dell in January.  The formal application for cash was made in mid-June.  On 3 July the Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladim&iacute;r Spidla, visited Limerick.  It seems the EU and the Government are fast-tracking this application.  There is a good chance that &euro;20 million will be available to former Dell workers to acquire new skills.  I am glad to know some measure of hope is being offered to the people of Limerick.  My interest is in the people of Waterford and the south east.  Will the Minister of State clarify if the Government has applied for assistance for Waterford from the EU globalisation fund?</P>
        <P>There is a shocking contrast between the Government&rsquo;s concern for Limerick and its total failure to help Waterford and the employees of Waterford Crystal.  Waterford cannot wait.  It has been hit more than most because of high dependency on the manufacturing sector.  This is seen in widespread redundancies across many employers and manufacturers in Waterford, such as Waterford Crystal, Bausch &amp; Lomb, ABB Transformers, Honeywell and many others.  I hope the Minister of State will confirm the Government is working in the best interests of the workers of Waterford and that it has applied for the assistance of the EU globalisation fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Coffey on this matter.  We want fair play for Waterford and the south east but that is not what we have had in recent years.  Senator Coffey referred to the haemorrhage of jobs in recent months, with 600 jobs lost at Waterford Crystal, 200 at Bausch &amp; Lomb and 178 at ABB Transformers.  We wish the people of Limerick well.  They need this finance but we want fair play, particularly for Waterford Crystal workers.  They have suffered enough, with their pensions almost totally eroded.  People paid into a pension for 40 years and came out with a pittance and hardly any lump sum.  It is a disgrace.  Those who put so much money into the economy over the past 40 or 50 years should be treated with the utmost respect.  When will we get the money?  I take it the application for funding is in and we should be getting the money fairly soon.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s response on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Senators for raising this important issue.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s concern to ensure that all possible measures be put in place to assist the workers who have lost their jobs at Waterford Crystal to upskill and eventually get alternative employment.  With that aim in mind, F&Aacute;S has put in place a special team to assist those workers with individual skills assessment, occupational advice and guidance, training and job search assistance.  F&Aacute;S has worked and continues to work in close collaboration with other statutory agencies and educational institutions in the south-east region, such as Waterford Institute of Technology, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the regional educational guidance service for adults, Waterford citizens information centre, Waterford VEC, Enterprise Ireland and the local employment services.</P>
        <P>A two-day information event was held on 11 and 12 March at which these statutory agencies and educational institutions provided information to Waterford Crystal employees, mainly on <Col N="1395"/>educational and training programmes that are available locally.  To date 520 former Waterford Crystal workers have been given one-to-one guidance interviews, 336 workers have completed training courses in various skills that they identified, 26 are currently being trained and a further 80 have yet to commence training.  Other training courses run by F&Aacute;S and from which these workers have benefited include heavy goods vehicle driving, basic computer skills, warehouse, fork truck driving and an introduction to life sciences.</P>
        <P>These interventions are being provided from existing budgets.  Any funds received in future through the European globalisation fund will serve to defray some of the costs already incurred.  However, the process of approving such applications at European level involves consultations with the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council.  That can take some time to complete and, therefore, supports that redundant workers require now will continue to be provided, irrespective of the fate of applications for transfers from the European globalisation fund.  In this context, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has requested her Department, in conjunction with F&Aacute;S and other State agencies, to prepare an application for assistance based on interventions for former Waterford Crystal workers.  This process is being finalised and, on the assumption that this results in an application that satisfies the strict eligibility criteria, it will be submitted to the European Commission for initial consideration.</P>
        <P>Last December the European Commission proposed, as part of the European economic recovery plan, the revision of the current European globalisation fund regulation to make it more accessible, effective and responsive.  This was partly as a result of the limited take-up by member states of European globalisation fund assistance during its first two years of operation.  The new application conditions will make the fund more accessible, particularly to smaller countries such as Ireland and include halving the applicable redundancies threshold to 500, doubling the implementation period to 24 months, increasing EU co-financing from 50% to 65% and broadening the eligibility criteria for applications made between 1 May 2009 and 31 December 2011.  The revised regulation was formally adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council on 11 June last.  The changes to the European globalisation fund regulation apply retrospectively to all applications submitted by member states since 1 May 2009.  The revisions will also facilitate Ireland and ensure, in the event of any application being successful, that higher level of co-financing than heretofore will be provided from the European globalisation fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the information but I am disappointed by it.  The criteria have made it easier for Irish companies to access the European globalisation fund but I am disappointed with the lack of urgency with regard to job losses at Waterford Crystal.  My understanding is that Limerick is treated as a high priority, with a visit from the European Commissioner, whereas in the case of Waterford, there is no urgency.  The initial application has not been considered, it is only being put together at a delayed stage when job losses have happened.  Workers are in urgent need of retraining and reskilling.  It is not good enough.  When will the Government stop sitting on its hands and engage with the people of Waterford and the European Commission and apply for the fund?  The criteria are clearly set out.  When will the Minister of State confirm that the application has been submitted?  There is a lot of vague&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>When will the application be completed?  When can the people of Waterford expect fair play, focus, attention and representation from the Government?  To date, we have not seen that.</P><Col N="1396"/>
        <P>The same applies in respect of the application of the Waterford Institute of Technology for university status.  The Government treats the application with contempt, fobbing it off on a year-by-year basis.  Waterford and the south east is suffering as a result.  When will the application be finalised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>An application must satisfy the strict eligibility criteria and there is no question that this does so.  Like Senator Coffey, I am surprised that an application has not yet been made.  I would have thought that at this stage we would have had word back that we would be receiving money from the globalisation fund.  However, we now learn that an application has not been submitted and we will not receive word back unless one is submitted.  Unfortunately, it is typical of the way in which the people of Waterford are treated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
