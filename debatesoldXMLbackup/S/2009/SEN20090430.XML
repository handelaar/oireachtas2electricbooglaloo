	<P>I have notice from Senator Dominic Hannigan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to consider reducing the audit requirements for smaller charitable institutions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to review the timeframe in place relating to leaving certificate results which can mean that students do not get an opportunity to appeal their results in time to obtain a college place of their choice.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re European asylum support office, referral to committee, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business without debate; and No. 2, statements on gangland crime, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, to conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with spokespersons having 15 minutes&rsquo; speaking time, all other Senators ten minutes, on which Senators may share time, and on which the Minister will be called ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to correct the record of the House.  Reference was made in the House either yesterday morning or possibly on Tuesday to the availability of BreastCheck in the north west and west.  A statement from the Irish Cancer Society makes it clear there is no BreastCheck service at present in counties Donegal, Leitrim or Clare.  It is not available and there are no plans for it in the future because of the current recruitment embargo within the BreastCheck screening programme.  This should be put on the record of the House because although Senator Feeney clearly shot down Senators Coffey and Buttimer in this regard when Senator Buttimer raised this issue, it is not the case.  I refer to what is going on with the HSE, which is now taking on celebrity advisers to generate PR.  The Government should put a stop to this nonsense.  A Bentley driving solicitor giving advice to the Government on how to run <Col N="186"/>the health service cannot go further than recommending a glass of Chablis for patients before they go to bed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a total joke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are more than enough experts in the HSE to advise it.  If they did their jobs we would not have to listen to this rubbish on the airwaves.  I ask the Leader to write to Professor Drumm and tell him to get a grip of himself and his communications director.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an insult to the people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to patriotism and shopping north of the Border.  I ask the Leader to write to all State agencies.  I hear that a major number of State agencies and State bodies are giving contracts to businesses outside Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>So are political parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important issue and we must debate it.  This business is going outside the island of Ireland.  Often Irish businesses can do this work.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that Senator Callely likes to make light of the issue that Irish people are losing their jobs at a rate of 13,000 per month.  Businesses in Ireland can do jobs for local authorities and State bodies and the contracts are being given to companies in Europe that are entitled to apply for them.  They are getting these contracts even though Irish businesses can do the job, but are not getting the contracts because they are out by one or two points on assessments of contracts.  We must give positive discrimination to Irish businesses on these issues.  British and German Governments are telling their local authorities to do likewise.  Senator Callely should not make fun of a serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making fun of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader should be raised through the Chair, not across the floor to other Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callely is part of the Government under which unemployment doubled in the past 12 months.  That is the sense of isolation here.  Unemployment has doubled in the past 12 months and it is not a laughing matter.  Laboratory technicians who are highly trained and skilled in carrying out smear tests are being laid off in the health service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Why would they not be?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because the contract was given to a company in the USA by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Quest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the same Government that told us to be patriotic.  This is where contracts are going and it must be examined.  We are rapidly losing confidence in the Government, the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  The talk of national unity and working together is nonsensical because clearly Government Members have not a clue what is going on and are refusing to sort out major problems in this country.  I would like these issues discussed at length.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey should go into discussion with Senator Regan to have explained to him the rules on tendering and procurement in Ireland and the EU.  Local authorities cannot hand out work willy-nilly without going through procedures.  If Senator Twomey is correct, we need to have a debate on it.  I am not sure that is the point he is making.</P>
        <P>The House should acknowledge the launch of the election campaign of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to be the first directly elected mayor of Dublin and should wish him well.  I note that he welcomes this.  Can we look forward to early legislation on the issue of directly elected mayors?  Is there an indication from the Government that there will be an agreed candidate?  We understand it is a dress rehearsal for the next step, running for the park.  We are aware that Senator Mary White is considering this and on these benches we have hopes for Senator Norris, who may look in that direction.  We could discuss where this will finish up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a transfer pact?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the cost of unemployment, raised by Senator Twomey.  We hear the narrow perspective of people talking about the cost of the dole and redundancy, without any attempt to meet it with a positive, reflective and creative response.  The costs of unemployment versus employment must be examined.  In certain places, such as Germany, a company with long-term viability but with current difficulties that is forced to lay off workers gets support from the State on the basis of a grant per worker retained.  That is cheaper than the cost of the dole or redundancy.  It keeps people in employment and is a stimulus for the economy.  It is something I have not heard discussed by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a response and to examine creative methods to deal with unemployment other than the dole or redundancy.  We can look for companies that will work their way out of difficulties and get support for retaining those workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Every Member is concerned about unemployment and the increase in the number of people without work but for Members to blame it on EU legislation is not acceptable.  Members cannot speak out of both sides of their mouths.  We are either in the EU or we are not, and if we are in it, we must abide by the legislation we have signed up to.  The statement we have heard will serve the opponents of the Lisbon treaty.  If we are to get through the recession we must get the help of Europe and must be involved at the heart of Europe.  In regard to the statements such as the one made, the Senator needs to think again.  We have gained significantly from the EU legislation that is in place.  Our companies are winning jobs and contracts throughout Europe.  To ask for a recall of that does nobody good.</P><Col N="188"/>
        <P>I refer to the Freedom of Information Act.  It is time to consider reforming that Act.  The original Act was very successful but, because of changes made to it, we have seen a reduction of 50% in the number of requests made in the past five years.  At a time when we are introducing organisations such as NAMA, which will be the recipient of significant amounts of money, it is vital that organisations such as that are at the heart of the Freedom of Information Act and that the remit is broadened to include NAMA.  I seek a debate on reform of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>I refer to the further doubt and confusion raised about mortgage relief.  We know that times are hard and sacrifice must be made.  This is not about whether people are entitled to relief but removing it from those who qualify by law for relief.  Families do not know whether their incomes will decrease, they do not know how much their budgets will be reduced by and they are trying to plan paying household bills, paying for food and taking a short summer break.  Now they do not know if they will lose &euro;100 or &euro;150 per month.</P>
        <P>We are told that an assessment will be done quickly and that the Government is setting up a website to enable people to enter their details.  With the Government&rsquo;s history on technology projects, that could take an age.  In the meantime, a quarter of a million families could be without this relief even though they qualify for it.  We understand that this relief will be removed from many but while the assessment is being carried out, rather than suspend the relief we should give it to them and then claw it back at a later stage if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on rural planning, particularly the role of An Taisce.  Over the past 20 years I have always been clear that I have no problem with An Taisce, which has an important function in protecting heritage and buildings.  When it was set up in the 1980s it was never intended that An Taisce would have a role in objecting to rural once-off housing.  I was contacted by a couple who received planning permission after three years negotiating with the local authority.  Yesterday was the last day for objections and, lo and behold, An Taisce lobbed in an objection.  That is grossly unfair.  Having been with a local authority for nearly 20 years in the area I represent, my experience has been that planners were very sensitive to rural landscapes and scenic routes, etc.  There should be a debate in this area and I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to debate the focus of An Taisce&rsquo;s efforts.</P>
        <P>I have never attended a meeting in west Cork where An Taisce had a transparent and open annual general meeting.  The body seems to lack transparency and it galls me to see somebody from Donegal or Mayo objecting to an issue in west Cork or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Senator not join An Taisce?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be no interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a valid point but never in my experience in west Cork has there been an advertisement or an open invitation to join An Taisce or to raise a view.  The body lacks transparency.  It has a role but not in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator could fill out an application form.  I will send it to him today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;one-off rural housing.  With all due respect to An Taisce, the experience of Senator Norris would differ totally from my experiences, which would be similar to the majority of public representatives across the political divide in County Cork.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="189"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey raised a very important matter, which I support.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, has been responsible for much waste and it has gone on a joke of a trip with this celebrity forum, or whatever it is called.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disgusting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is flippancy gone mad at a most serious and difficult time for our country.  I will leave the matter at that but I look forward to the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s reply.</P>
        <P>The issue of having a directly elected mayor of Dublin has been raised by my eminent colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I wish all prospective candidates well.  There is a serious national issue so will the Deputy Leader indicate if this is a pilot scheme for Dublin?  We are a small country but Dublin would not be the best example for the entire country.  Surely we cannot proceed on the basis of a lack of uniformity.  I would like to hear the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s thoughts on this as he is a man with insight, given his close contact with the Department and his general knowledge in any event.</P>
        <P>We had a most important debate yesterday concerning the proposed national asset management agency, NAMA.  I do not want to go back on that but there are two serious and important questions.  Timing is important with this issue and delay is our enemy.  When will the agency begin operations on an interim basis and when will we have legislation for it?  Is there anything definitive in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, in calling for a debate on planning.  Many times over the past seven years I have called for such a debate, especially regarding the right to object.  While there is no doubt that the contribution of An Taisce has been very valuable over recent years as a prescribed organisation, one would certainly query the timing with which it tends to lodge objections to particular developments.</P>
        <P>There certainly have been cases when people have tried to join An Taisce and they may have been seen as the wrong types of members.  Wicklow springs to mind as a place where people were not being taken in because it was felt they would have views more consistent with rural development than An Taisce with regard to trying to object and block rural development.  As somebody who is from regional Ireland, I would like to see our areas develop as something other than just the exclusive reserve of weekend commuters who wish to go to the west in search of Peig Sayers looking out over a half door.  More goes on in such areas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on the issue of unauthorised moneylending.  We are experiencing economic difficulties and there is a potential for people to default on mortgages.  There is a need for the House to have a discussion on innovative ways to cater for those who are under pressure at a particular time.  It is also giving rise to illegal moneylending which can lead to a serious amount of criminality.  We need to focus on such issues in a non-partisan debate to come up with innovative ways for the Cabinet to address issues relating to illegal moneylending and how we might best help those most under pressure to meet mortgage payments at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to provide for a debate on freedom of speech, particularly in light of the apparent proposals to introduce into law the offence of blasphemous <Col N="190"/>libel.  Unfortunately, I was in hospital and was not able to be in the House yesterday but I would have raised it had I been here.  It is very important that we consider the issue.</P>
        <P>Certain forces abroad are trying to get this done.  The Vatican, in conjunction with the forces of Islamic fundamentalism, has been using international fora to try to establish an offence of defamation of religion, and this was rightly resisted by our international representatives.  To find that the Government is acting in a contradictory way is very disturbing.</P>
        <P>I was close to a case of blasphemous libel some years ago, which was very damaging, when <i>Gay News</i> was banned on foot of the publication of a poem by the late Professor James Kirkup.  That had serious repercussions here as an entire edition was seized and other editions were subsequently seized.  It was a serious infringement.</P>
        <P>The matter of blasphemous libel and blasphemy was raised and dismissed by the Law Reform Commission in 1991.  The Supreme Court decision in 1999 held the same way.  I understand exactly how offensive these matters can be.  That is why some weeks ago I raised the matter of a blasphemous performance in a Wexford nightclub where they re-enacted the Crucifixion.  I felt that to be contemptible and I said so.  The matter was taken up by the radio and other sources.  As a result, not perhaps of my intervention but the popular moral disapproval, this was cancelled.  That is the way to do it.  God, if he or she exists, requires no defence from Irish law.</P>
        <P>We would be far better off introducing civil partnership legislation and if we are looking for legislation to introduce we should achieve something we promised rather than kowtow.  Where did this come from?  I am a little disturbed to discover that sources close to one of the most reactionary religious-political groups here are circulating newsletters containing selectively edited highlights from these kinds of debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I deplore that and any Member of the House who co-operates with it as that is not freedom of speech either.  That is the reason we need a debate on freedom of speech.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to Senator Twomey who seemed to be on thin ice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am looking for questions to the Deputy Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>On one side there appears to be an anti-Lisbon treaty and anti-Europe argument and on the other there appears to be a policy favouring protectionism.  I am not sure where the Senator is coming from.</P>
        <P>One issue raised by the Senator was unemployment which is a cause for concern.  The only message I can give to the House is that the growing problem of unemployment cannot be resolved by taking sides.  Too often we spend more time fighting about methods and assigning blame than taking action.  Usually there is anger without action and we become bitter rather than better.  There are a couple of messages for Senator Twomey in that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should provide issues for the Deputy Leader rather than people on the other side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I rose to mention the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which I have noted in this House on a couple of occasions, along with the good work it does. <Col N="191"/> Its caseload has increased greatly and there is a significant percentage increase in the demands on its services.  I concur with Senator MacSharry about the black market of unauthorised moneylending.  Will the Deputy Leader try to assess for me and other Members the level of increase in additional supports made available to MABS to meet the particular demands of this time?  It is very important as the body does tremendous work.  It is appropriate for this House to ensure the correct supports and funding are in place for it.</P>
        <P>In light of yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the national asset management agency, NAMA, will the Deputy Leader seek clarification on the toxic debts in banks?  How will they be assessed?  The concern in light of yesterday&rsquo;s debate was that the banks would be very anxious to dispose of their toxic debts so we need to know what mechanism will be used.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

	<P>What I said was meant as a compliment.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to highlight the new OECD report on labour policy in Ireland.  I am of the view that this report is worthy of debate, particularly in the context that it outlines the small gap that exists between social welfare payments and declining wage levels.  I am not necessarily stating that social welfare payments should be reduced, but it is obvious that workers are bearing a great deal of pain.  Consideration must be given to this matter.  Regardless of whether people are on social welfare or working, the Government must remember that they have commitments and debts to pay.  At present, we are paying the State&rsquo;s debts and, as a result, people are being placed under a great deal of pressure.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of merit in the suggestion that the Government should offer an allowance or a stipend to companies where jobs are at risk.  We should pay such a stipend instead of allowing people to go on the dole at a cost to the State, taking into account social welfare payments and the loss of tax revenue, of &euro;20,000 <i>per capita</i> per year.  I surveyed companies in Galway with regard to this matter and I was informed that a stipend of even &euro;5,000 per worker would allow them to retain employees and ride out the hump of the recession.  There is need for a serious debate on labour policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In Killarney last week I chaired a conference on rural planning which dealt specifically with the issue of one-off housing.  We will be making a grave error if we do not realise the palpable anger that exists in respect of this matter.  Those who live in rural communities are of the view that they are being treated in an inferior manner.  Five cases were highlighted at the conference and these indicated the contradictions that apply in the planning code.  I am of the view that the Government&rsquo;s guidelines in respect of this matter are not being implemented as intended.  In one instance, the reason given for the refusal of planning permission was that it would have been possible to see the house from the sea.  When five councillors visited the site, they could not see the sea from their vantage point.  Who would be out at sea looking at the house in any event?</P>

	<P>The example I have highlighted provides Members with an idea of the bizarre situation that obtains in respect of the planning code.  An Taisce, in preparing to take its place in history, stated in recent months that the work done by its members during the <Col N="192"/>past 60 years is that of giants.  I presume it is suggesting that the remainder of the people will be seen as other than giants.  This matter has become completely outrageous.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, addressed the conference to which I refer and put forward a new concept &mdash; I believe it is very good &mdash; namely, that there is a need for a body to monitor all these issues, including those relating to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  People who live 50 miles away from sites in respect of which applications are being made are submitting objections and are placing information regarding the private circumstances of the applicants in the public domain.  That is a grave matter and one worthy of serious consideration.</P>
        <P>I welcome the concept put forward by the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I hope this matter will not be left on the long finger and that we will not be obliged to raise it on the Order of Business as the occasion arises.  This is one of the gravest injustices visited upon people in this State for a long period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Hannigan, I am seeking a debate on the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s report which was issued in recent days.  This matter is particularly relevant.  We debated NAMA last evening and I do not believe anyone stated that the latter will not be subject to the freedom of information legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That point was made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  The Information Commissioner referred to certain organisations that are not subject to the freedom of information legislation.  These are the same organisations that are under public scrutiny at present.  That is why it is so important for the House to debate the report.</P>
        <P>I do not know if any Member of the House has ever tried to procure information from the Financial Regulator.  Doing so is similar to approaching the Masonic Order and asking what is the key to its handshake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Financial Regulator is outside the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Financial Regulator will not supply information.  I do not know if any Member has sought information from the National Treasury Management Agency.  I inquired this morning as to what its chief executive is paid and I was told it does not supply that information to anyone.  That is extraordinary.  Even the banks tell people what their chief executives are paid.  This organisation is funded from the public purse and it is at the centre of public focus at present.  It has responsibility for managing up to &euro;16 billion or &euro;17 billion of public money that is now being used to rescue the banks.  However, under the Freedom of Information Act we cannot find out anything about its activities.</P>
        <P>Why is it not possible to obtain information regarding Anglo Irish Bank?  I am not seeking commercially sensitive information.  In any event, people are sensible about such information.  Why can we not discover how these organisations are run?  What prompts them to make decisions?  I would love to know what Dr. Michael Somers thinks of the Government&rsquo;s decision to give to the banks all the money for which the NTMA was previously responsible.  I would <Col N="193"/>be interested in discovering whether Dr. Somers is of the view that that is a good or a bad investment.</P>
        <P>At present, many of those important Government-run or Government-owned organisations which have access to massive amounts of money are being run as if they were part of the secret service.  It would be useful if time could be made available to debate the extremely useful report to which I refer.  That report should not be allowed to just gather dust.  There are vital questions to be answered.  Freedom of information is a particularly useful mechanism.  However, the process relating to it was obstructed and made overly expensive by the previous Administration.  The Government should take steps to facilitate a restoration of the freedom of information process to its previous incarnation because the organisations about which we require answers are those that are being protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I again call for a debate on the economy at the earliest opportunity.  I am cognisant of the fact that calls have been made this morning for positive discrimination to be exercised in respect of contracts within the State.  This would run against EU rules and could not be allowed.  However, there may be a system whereby we could examine the weighting given to companies of which local authorities have knowledge &mdash; that is, those within their own areas &mdash; while still remaining within EU guidelines.</P>
        <P>The Government is not allowed to instigate a &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  However, there must be something the House can do to highlight this issue and ensure that, where possible, people exercise positive discrimination towards and purchase Irish goods and products.  This would assist in retaining jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need for a debate on a particular aspect of the economy, namely, unemployment and competitiveness.  The private sector is taking radical steps to adjust to the new economic circumstances by making dramatic changes to the organisation of companies and to employees&rsquo; pay and conditions.  On a daily basis, unions are accepting changes to circumstances within particular companies.  This is having an effect and there has been one extremely positive signal in that the figures for February show that exports have increased.  We are fortunate that we have industries such as those relating to pharmaceuticals, information technology and services.  There is no doubt that we are heavily dependent on the exports that emanate from these industries.</P>
        <P>Adjustments are being made in the private sector and competitiveness is being restored.  Let us contrast this with what is happening in the public sector, particularly in respect of matters for which the Government has responsibility, such as meeting the various costs in respect of electricity charges, commercial waste charges, water charges and commercial rates.  These costs can be controlled by the Government but we do not see any reductions.  Nor do we see progress in the restructuring of the public sector in which costs can be cut and efficiencies improved.  This is what makes the resumed partnership talks irrelevant.  In current circumstances the private sector is trying to restore competitiveness.  If we are to find jobs for the 300,000 unemployed, it can only be done by increased competitiveness in the economy.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come into the House to tell us what the Government is doing to restore competitiveness in the economy.  Tough medicine has been taken in the private sector but there has been no movement by the Government on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I am interested in the revival of vibrant rural communities.  There was an interesting conference on the subject in Kilkenny that, unfortunately, I could not attend owing to the death of Senator Tony Kett.  It is an issue we must discuss because we must strike a balance in society.  There has been too much movement to cities and towns; we are leaving rural Ireland in a dark alley.  When will the amendment to <Col N="194"/>planning legislation be brought before the House?  It presents a golden opportunity to discuss our planning laws and the issue of one-off housing at length.  We need a new forum, in which all stakeholders &mdash; An Taisce, planners, councillors and county and city managers &mdash; can examine how we might shape the future and change society.  We have a golden opportunity to discuss the issue, as the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs pointed out at the conference.  Will the legislation be brought before the House before the summer recess?  Now more than ever we must discuss the future of society.  Who watches the planners?  From where do they get their guidelines and how are they implementing them?  How knowledgeable are they about local development plans?  I would like to put these questions when the Bill is introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am calling for a debate as soon as possible on local government in advance of the local government elections.  Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Ormonde mentioned planning; we should debate the matter in both rural and urban areas.  We should examine An Taisce which is demonising Ireland with its carry on.  Let us also look at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  How can it go against the report of its inspector?  How can it overturn the decision of an inspector who carries out a study and makes a recommendation?</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the role of directly elected mayors.  Will this role be the same as that of the city or county manager?  If so, do we need a county manager?  Will there be a power struggle?  We need a debate on real local government.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Twomey in asking the Deputy Leader to change the record of the House.  Last Tuesday or Wednesday &mdash; I cannot remember which day &mdash; we were told by Senator Feeney that BreastCheck was available in the north west.  A press statement issued by BreastCheck on 28 April stated the national cancer screening service had confirmed that its plans to commence first-run screening in counties Clare, Donegal and Leitrim later this year were temporarily on hold.  BreastCheck is not available in the entire north west.</P>
        <P>We should also have a debate on the proposed transfer of breast cancer services at South Infirmary Hospital to Cork University Hospital.  I hope the Deputy Leader will join me in asking the Minister not to proceed with the transfer.  It has not inspired confidence in the women of Cork.  As the HSE launches a celebrity communications strategy, it is an insult to hear Mr. Connors on the radio defending the decision to canvass the views of celebrities on the health service.</P>

	<P>I made this point yesterday and reiterate today that the people to talk to are the staff.  The people the HSE should answer to are the members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  As public representatives, we act as advocates on behalf of the people but we cannot get answers.  That is not good enough.  Does the Deputy Leader condone what the Health Service Executive is doing?  Does he agree with its strategy?  It is a failed strategy and it is time Professor Drumm came here to answer questions from us on behalf of the patients who are suffering.  It is about time the HSE was put on a horse and ridden out of town.  It has destroyed the health service.  Government Senators might laugh at me but the people have suffered under the HSE and the Government parties condone it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>In these difficult times it is heartening to see a small ray of sunshine coming through the dark clouds.  In the last couple of weeks a small electrical contractor did a job for me.  In the course of conversation he intimated that he had work for two qualified electricians.  The same gentleman rang me this morning to inform me he now required four electricians.  It is small but it is a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Healy Eames.  We must look at the situation differently.  Our people are our greatest resource.  While I strongly support the concept of assisting people who have no income with social welfare benefits, there are talented individuals who have recently become unemployed and they could be used to upgrade houses for the elderly and provide homes for the homeless.</P>
        <P>I have a sore point when it comes to planning.  I am aware of a young man who was refused planning permission for a development on his own land.  He was granted planning permission by Westmeath County Council but a photograph was taken from an aeroplane and used as a reason to overturn it.  If that is how planning matters should be scrutinised, I am a Dutchman.  I will not refer to the matter Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned, where a house could be seen from the sea.  Those who talk in this way are all at sea.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come into the House for a debate on the funding of local authorities?  As a number of outdoor staff from local authorities will be laid off after the local elections, we should debate the funding of local authorities, particularly the cut backs in road grants, the laying off of staff and the reform of structures in general.  The local authorities must be reformed.  The Minister has flagged his intention to reform them but he is as long in office now as the rainbow Government was in the 1990s and nothing has happened.  It is all pie in the sky.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should be invited to the House as a matter of urgency, particularly in light of the cutbacks in local authorities and the strain they will be under over coming months to find the resources to keep a minimum number of staff employed.</P>

	<P>With regard to Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point about celebrities and the HSE, will the Deputy Leader inquire about that list of celebrities and how many of them have health insurance for private health care and how many do not?

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s call for proper management of social housing and the anti-social behaviour that takes place in local authority housing estates.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council found it necessary to introduce a scheme whereby people on its housing list had to undergo a course before getting a house.  It is a management course on how a house is run, the equipment in the house and how to use it, where the water is turned on and off and so forth.  It might sound simple but a house is a big resource to give to somebody.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire the average house costs &euro;250,000 so when a house is rented to somebody from the housing list, it is a big investment in that person.  Every local authority should do the same.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should examine this scheme with a view to extending it throughout the country.</P>
        <P>There are very decent people living in social and affordable housing who cannot live their lives in peace because of anti-social behaviour.  That is not good enough.  It is important we do something about it now because this problem is leading to the gang warfare we see in Limerick, Dublin and other cities.  The Minister must put some type of plan together on how people can live together more peacefully.  It is important to bear in mind that a person&rsquo;s home is his or her castle and they should be able to live their lives in peace.  The local authorities can play a major role in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Norris, for a debate on freedom of speech.  I am glad he raised the issue of the blasphemous libel offence being suggested by the Minister.  I raised the matter yesterday.  It is very dangerous to talk about creating an offence of causing outrage to somebody on grounds of religion.</P>

	<P>There have been all sorts of difficulties in other countries where that has been done.  It is very different from the careful legislation we have in place on incitement to hatred on racial grounds, although there have also been difficulties in prosecuting those offences.  We must be careful about rushing willy-nilly to create offences in this way.</P>
        <P>I did not get a satisfactory answer yesterday to my query to the Leader of the House about the arrangements for inter-country adoptions with Vietnam and Russia, both of which, I am told, have broken down recently.  This has caused great concern and trauma to prospective adoptive parents in this country.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children informed us on Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill that these agreements would be renewed or finalised but it appears this has not happened.  I asked yesterday if the Adoption Bill would be before the House again soon so we can put these questions to the Minister.  These arrangements are almost a side or parallel procedure to the Adoption Bill, and answers are urgently required about the agreements with these two countries, from which come the majority of children currently being adopted into Ireland.  If the Deputy Leader cannot give me an answer, will he arrange for the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the House to <Col N="197"/>answer questions about those arrangements, irrespective of when the Adoption Bill is before the House again?</P>
        <P>Finally, what progress has been made with the civil partnership Bill?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey and Senator Buttimer asked about statements made in this House and their accuracy.  I am not in a position to answer their requests but there are mechanisms in the House which they can follow if they wish to pursue the matter.  Both Senators went on to discuss the communications strategy of the HSE.  Senator Coghlan and Senator Daly also raised this matter.  Undoubtedly, there is a degree of incredulity about what is being proposed in this regard.  I received correspondence today for Oireachtas Members from the Cork and Kerry area which indicated that Professor Drumm of the HSE will speak to those Members on 13 May.  I presume similar meetings are being held for Oireachtas Members from other parts of the country.  The fact that I received the same letter twice from the HSE indicates the degree of over-administration that might be occurring in that organisation.</P>

	<P>Senator Twomey, Senator Hannigan and Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about procurement issues.  Senator Hannigan and Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the difficulties that exist with EU legislation.  We are obviously constrained by that.  However, the Government is committed, both in the programme for Government and in the framework document on a smart economy, to pursuing the concept of green procurement.  The essence of green procurement is that materials are sourced as close as possible to where they are created.  There is an opportunity to refine our procurement policies to ensure there is maximum employment impact in the national economy.  That issue is being pursued as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked about legislation regarding a mayor of Dublin.  There will be an announcement on this in a few weeks and legislation will be brought forward in the very near future.  The same question was asked by Senator Coghlan and Senator Buttimer.  On the question of who would be a candidate for that election, the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, will definitely have a candidate in the field.</P>

However, I am open to contesting any future elections that might happen in the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, which will follow under subsequent legislation.  The question of the balance between the elected mayor and existing city managers will be dealt with in that legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others spoke about the cost of unemployment, while Senator Healy Eames referred to the seminar being held today by the ESRI on the cost of welfare in relation to other labour costs.  Senator Regan talked about unemployment and competitiveness, as did Senator Callely.  We must have a debate on this issue.  We had a start to such a debate yesterday with the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  Next year&rsquo;s Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will be vital in addressing these issues, as they go to the heart of what our policy is and what resources there are to pursue that policy into the future.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan raised the Freedom of Information Act and pointed out that in the last five years the number of requests has decreased.  However, the report of the Information Commissioner pointed out that the number of requests has risen in the past year for the first time in several years.  That is encouraging.  That is partly because the number of organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>If I am given the opportunity to speak Senator Norris will understand that I am not necessarily disagreeing with the Senator.  As Senator Ross pointed out, there is a need for a debate in the House on the report, the nature of freedom of information and whether the legislation can be extended.  The number of bodies covered by it has been extended and there is a belief among Members of the House that it should be increased even more.  Examples were given on the Order of Business today of the bodies that should be included.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position applying to mortgage relief was raised in today&rsquo;s news.  Having heard spokespersons from the Revenue Commissioners, it appears every effort is being made to allay any fears that may exist.  My understanding is that the Revenue Commissioners will be contacting the financial institutions and if information on whether the mortgage is longer than seven years is not available, then and only then will contact be made by letter directly with the mortgage holders.  The advice is - the Revenue Commissioners are being matter of fact about this - for people to wait for such a communication and not react unnecessarily to some of the news stories in the press today.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, MacSharry, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Ormonde raised the question of rural planning.  Senator Ormonde referred to the possible amendment of the planning Acts.  Those Acts are to be substantially recast and the publication of such a Bill will take place in the coming months.  It will be a major debate on the nature of planning, levels of accountability and democratic control within such a system.  Many Members will have an opportunity to address concerns raised today during such a debate.</P>
        <P>There are concerns about organisations needing to be more open and democratic but there is also a role for voluntary organisations to continue to play without State resources, and there is a need for a watchdog on both sides.  I hope that when the debate takes place in this House, it will be conducted on such terms.</P>
        <P>Senators Coghlan and Callely asked about the contents of the national asset management agency, NAMA, legislation in terms of the assessment of the risk, when the body will be established in shadow form and when the legislation will come to the House.  My knowledge is that the legislation will be published within the next month, with debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas, giving Members an opportunity to examine those issues.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry spoke about the need for a debate on unauthorised moneylending.  That debate could be pertinent given the general constraints in lending by our financial institutions.  Consideration will be given to having such a debate in the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Bacik spoke about the proposal to include a crime of blasphemous libel in new legislation.  My understanding is that this was considered as an inclusion from a Cabinet decision in 2005.  I am also informed, being a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution, that the issue was examined recently.  It was proposed to leave the reference to blasphemy in the Constitution but to suggest that it is impossible to legislate for it.</P>

	<P>I would be happy to talk to Members outside the Chamber after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely spoke about the area of unauthorised moneylending and the need to provide resources for the money advice and budgeting service, MABS.  We have had recent legislation to improve the effectiveness and administration of MABS.  That request should be brought to the relevant Minister as being representative of views in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin also raised the question of procurement but asked for more particular debates on the economy, as did Senator Regan on the question of unemployment and competitiveness.  Those issues might deserve a debate in the wider context with the ESRI seminar today and the recent publication of that agency&rsquo;s report.  That could form the basis of a particular economic debate we could have in coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer asked about a debate on local government, as did Senator Burke, and on the question of local government funding.  The Commission on Taxation has been given a particular remit on local government funding.  It will report earlier than expected.  I am not sure whether that report will be produced before the end of this session but while there would be value in discussing the role of local government before the local government elections, I suggest the debate on local government funding needs to be informed by the recommendations that will come from the Commission on Taxation in a number of months.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer also asked me to respond to the application of breast cancer facilities in the Cork area.  He may be surprised to hear that I agree with him in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn spoke about the appearance of small green shoots in terms of new opportunities in local communities and employment prospects.  The dim light, in terms of the ever-increasing unemployment figures, is that the rate of increase in the figures announced yesterday was significantly less than in the previous month.  We can only hope that is a sign of things changing.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn also raised the question of planning issues but also, more importantly, the need to have a particular debate on tenant training prior to social housing being allocated.  In that he was joined by Senator Butler.  I believe a debate can be organised to discuss such matters.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik asked about the current position on international adoption agreements with Russia and Vietnam.  I am aware that 1 May is seen as a deadline but I am also aware that the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, is active in reaching a conclusion to this matter.  There is ongoing activity and it is hoped that positive news can be reported to the House on that.</P>
        <P>Regarding the civil partnership Bill, my understanding is that it will be published before the end of June.</P>

    <Title>Gangland Crime: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for the opportunity to address it on this important matter.  At the outset, I would like to extend my condolences to the family and friends of Roy Collins, a respected member of his community who was so brutally gunned down, and to the family and friends of other victims killed in similar circumstances.  An extensive Garda investigation into the killing of Mr. Collins is under way and has made good progress so far, with one person already charged.  A person has also been charged with the murder of Shane Geoghegan.  Senators will appreciate that I am, therefore, greatly constrained in what I can say about the specific incidents.</P>
        <P>Let me first assure the House that tackling organised and gangland crime remains and will continue to remain a primary concern for the Minister, the Government and the Garda Commissioner.  One of the priorities the Minister has set for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the targeting of serious crime, in particular organised, gun and drug-related crime.  The Garda policing plan for 2009 contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in serious criminality of this type.</P>
        <P>The Minister is very clear that we cannot allow organised criminal gangs to attempt to undermine the functioning of the criminal justice system.  Such behaviour demands a response from the State and such a response will be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>I make the point that Garda strength has increased very significantly in recent years, with the number of attested members going from 11,895 at the end of 2002 to 14,371 in the most recent figures, an increase of 21%.  The strength of the force is scheduled to reach approximately 14,900 by the end of this year.  There has also been a significant increase in civilian support staff, with the total number of whole-time equivalent civilian personnel going from 1,688 at the end of 2007 to 2,133 in the most recent figures, an increase of 26%.  So, while the moratorium recently announced by the Minister for Finance will have a temporary effect on recruitment into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its record strength means that it is in the best possible position to absorb the impact and continue to deliver a top-class policing service.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Limerick Garda division, I understand that at the latest date for which figures are readily available, its personnel strength was 634.  This is an increase of 211 or almost 50% since the end of 1997.</P><Col N="201"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The budget for overtime in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2009 has been reduced from a record provision in 2008, but is still a substantial &euro;80 million.  This includes an increase in the allocation for Operation Anvil from &euro;20 million to &euro;21 million.</P>
        <P>Very significant efforts and resources are being directed on an ongoing basis into tackling organised crime and gangland culture, and the State will continue its relentless approach to bringing those involved in such activities to justice.  Persons involved in organised criminal activities, including persons suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, importation, sale and supply, as well as the illegal importation of firearms, are being targeted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a number of fronts, involving uniform and plain-clothes personnel overtly and covertly disrupting known criminals in the course of their criminal activities.  Such criminals, their operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted through intelligence-led operations, particularly under Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>Under Operation Anvil, which commenced in May 2005 in the Dublin metropolitan region and was extended countrywide in 2006, almost 2,500 firearms have been recovered throughout the country up to 22 March last.  There have also been over 7,500 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, serious assault, robbery and burglary and over 72,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.  At a time when the public finances are under pressure, the Minister is determined that top priority will continue to be given to front-line policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil has, therefore, increased from &euro;20 million in 2008 to &euro;21 million in 2009 to enable it to continue with targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.</P>
        <P>One very effective tool available to the State since the mid-1990s has been the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The bureau has been extremely successful over the years in seizing the proceeds of criminal activity in a very effective and visible manner.  It represents a new form of policing designed to disrupt and disable the capacity of targeted individuals from participating in further criminal activity.  As a result, a criminal investigation can continue while a financial investigation, a tax examination and a social welfare examination can also proceed.</P>
        <P>The public can see for themselves the effectiveness of the bureau&rsquo;s co-ordinated multi-agency approach in dealing with the assets derived from crime.  This model of a co-located bureau focusing solely on the proceeds of crime was one of the first of its type in Europe and the powers given to it are far-reaching.  A recent and important development at the bureau has been the rapid expansion in the number of trained asset profilers who are now working all over the country.  There are over 100 trained asset profilers working in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and these have now become an invaluable resource for the bureau in doing the early groundwork on possible targets and in keeping the bureau informed of developments at local level.  While the profilers are based outside the bureau, their work is being embedded into the bureau and this means that criminals in every corner of Ireland are within reach of the bureau.</P>
        <P>The State is already expending very significant efforts and resources in tackling organised crime and gangland culture and it will be relentless in its approach in bringing those involved in such activities to justice.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises intelligence-led operations in the fight against crime and, in this context, the information and assistance made available to the Garda by the public remains invaluable in ensuring that those who engage in criminal activities can be brought before the courts to answer for their actions.</P>
        <P>A significant element of the fight against organised crime and criminal gangs on an ongoing basis involves the use of specialist units.  Units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drug Unit, the Organised Crime Unit, and the Criminal Assets Bureau, as well as the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau, each bring with them expertise and skills in specific areas of policing.  The Organised Crime Unit, which has been established on a permanent basis, has the specific remit of targeting those <Col N="202"/>suspected of involvement in organised crime, including the trafficking, importation, sale and supply of drugs.</P>
        <P>The actions of all of specialist Garda units are co-ordinated by the assistant commissioner with responsibility for national support services in order to ensure that a comprehensive approach is taken to tackling issues throughout the State.  The work of these units is at all times guided and supplemented by the security and intelligence section which assists with the provision of intelligence briefings and timely information required for Garda operations.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertakes several multi-agency actions designed to target the activities of criminal organisations involved in the sale and supply of illicit drugs.  It conducts targeted operations against individuals and organisations operating in the State which have known links to international criminals, including Irish nationals based abroad.  It co-operates on an ongoing basis with the Customs and Excise Service of the Revenue Commissioners in the proactive investigation of persons suspected of being involved in international drug-trafficking.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Garda works closely with Customs and Excise and the Naval Service under the umbrella of the joint drugs task force.  It exchanges strategic and operational intelligence with other law enforcement agencies, including Interpol and Europol, in accordance with legislation and operational protocols.  It assists international law enforcement agencies which are conducting investigations with suspected involvement by Irish nationals, through the mutual assistance agreement in criminal matters.  Our involvement in the establishment and operation of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre, based in Lisbon, Portugal, is a good example of this international co-operation in practice.</P>
        <P>The Garda national drug unit is responsible for targeting networks involved in the sale and distribution of illegal drugs.  A dedicated section in the unit has been established to liaise with the Criminal Assets Bureau to target in particular those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.</P>
        <P>At local level divisional and district drug units have been established with the specific remit of targeting individuals engaged in the sale and distribution of drugs to local communities.  These units are supported by local Garda resources as well as the national unit.  This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.  In addition to these specific initiatives, all members of the Garda have responsibility to enforce the criminal law, including relevant drug trafficking legislation.  The situation is being closely monitored and kept under constant review by senior Garda management in conjunction with regional assistant commissioners and heads of units.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies across Europe and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence, which has led to several successful joint operations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has several liaison officers on secondment to other jurisdictions and to other international bodies such as Interpol and Europol.  Through these officers, information is passed between law enforcement agencies to ensure national borders are not, and cannot, be used by criminals as a means of frustrating law enforcement agencies.</P>
        <P>It is the duty of every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce legislation, including drug-related legislation.  All Garda resources, therefore, can be utilised in specific operations to target drug criminality.  Through such a strategy which includes ongoing specific initiatives and intelligence-led operations, the Garda continues to seize substantial quantities of illegal drugs and identify those involved in the importation, distribution, sale and supply of illegal drugs.  As a result, drug seizures of a total value of over &euro;168 million were made in 2007 and just under &euro;200 million in 2008.</P><Col N="203"/>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that, in addition to this considerable volume of drugs seized in past two years and again this year to date, there has been a significant impact on drug trafficking by the arrest and prosecution of several major players involved and the activities of crime gangs have been disrupted, resulting in several crime groupings being dismantled.  However, there is no room for complacency and our drug law enforcement efforts will continue to be vigorously pursued.</P>
        <P>Robust legislation is already in place to fight gangland crime.  We have made substantial changes to our criminal laws in recent years, many of which are targeted at the fight against gangland crime.  The Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 introduced wide-ranging reforms to strengthen the capacity of the Garda to tackle serious crime.  One of the most far-reaching has been the introduction of seven-day detention for offences connected with organised crime, such as murder or kidnapping involving the use of a firearm.</P>
        <P>The intimidation of witnesses is an offence pursuant to section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, which specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.  We are examining increasing this penalty.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated a witness security programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic witness intimidation.  Legislation was not required to establish this programme but its operation is supported by section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, which makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the programme.  The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rigorously enforces the provisions in the law relating to witness intimidation and protection.  In circumstances where the senior investigation officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his or her family, an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him or her included in the programme.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge who has discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused or suspect.</P>
        <P>Our bail laws have been strengthened to allow the prosecution to mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  For example, applicants for bail can be required to provide a statement of their means so the prosecution can highlight any divergence between their lifestyles and their stated means as evidence of their involvement in gangland activity.  The circumstances in which inferences may be drawn at trial from a suspect&rsquo;s silence in response to Garda questioning have also been expanded.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue to press forward with this work in strengthening the criminal law.</P>
        <P>Since his appointment, the Minister has expressed concern at the number of handguns which have been licensed here in recent years.  Some time ago, the Minister directed the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law.  Following this, he has brought forward proposals for strengthening the law.  These include no new licenses being issued for handguns, subject to limited exceptions in Olympic sports.  Existing licenses will not be renewed unless applicants fully meet the requirements of a radically tightened licensing procedure where the safety of the community will be paramount.  While a de <Col N="204"/>facto ban on new handgun licences is already in place, the Minister&rsquo;s proposals will also be given legislative form in the criminal justice miscellaneous provisions Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposals for the criminal procedure Bill are also well advanced.  While the Bill will be primarily aimed at giving effect to the legislative aspects of the justice for victims initiative, which the Minister announced last June, some elements of it will be of considerable benefit in our fight against serious crime.  In particular, the Minister is considering a proposal that will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to seek a re-trial where an acquittal is tainted due, for example, to intimidation of witnesses or jurors.  There will also be a provision on expert evidence to ensure the prosecution is given adequate opportunity to examine and challenge evidence being introduced by the defence.  In other words, there will be a levelling of the pitch.  The Minister expects to be in a position to seek Cabinet approval for the publication of the Bill presently.</P>
        <P>Work is also ongoing in the creation of a DNA database for criminal investigation purposes.  Such a database will greatly enhance the intelligence available to the Garda in the investigation of crime.  The Minister expects to be in a position to publish legislation in this area by the summer.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>While significant legislative changes have been made in recent years and significant operational resources and initiatives put in place, we must constantly monitor the resources, both legislative and operational, at the disposal of the State to fight this type of criminality.  Those engaged in such activities are constantly changing their mode of operation.  It is incumbent on us to anticipate and respond appropriately and effectively.  The Minister is consequently working on a range of measures to combat gangland crime.  The Minister published the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 on 17 April and it began its passage through the Oireachtas yesterday.  It is a mark of the importance of the measure that the debate in the Oireachtas commenced so soon after the Bill&rsquo;s publication.  Senators will discuss the Bill in due course, but I would like to say a few words about it.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s primary purpose is simple.  It is to facilitate the use in evidence in criminal proceedings of material gained by secret surveillance while ensuring that the encroachment on certain rights relating to personal privacy and privacy of property, particularly a dwelling, which this entails is both limited and proportionate.  The Bill provides for the first time a basis in law for secret surveillance by the organs of the State concerned, principally the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its role as the primary law enforcement and security agency of the State.  The Defence Forces are included because of their parallel responsibilities in protecting the security of the State and the Revenue Commissioners are also included as they have a front-line role in guarding against the illegal importation of drugs and firearms.  It is easy to see how the interests of these agencies may coincide, for instance in the case of joint operations by the Garda and Revenue to target money laundering and tax evasion, which is a key element in the fight against organised crime.</P>
        <P>The Bill sets out the rules that will apply to the admissibility of that evidence.  It is generally accepted there are some circumstances in which the State in a democratic society may in the common interest exercise special powers denied to ordinary citizens.  The right to privacy is a case in point as it may be interfered with in certain circumstances and subject to safeguards.  Another rights-related issue is that which deals with the right to a fair trial and the associated evidential issues such as admissibility and disclosure of evidence.  In dealing with these matters, the Bill takes into account the principles of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Bill seeks to strike the correct balance between the competing interests of privacy and due process on the one hand and the protection of persons and the prevention of crime on the other.  Until now the Garda has been reluctant to use this evidence in court, mainly for legal and operational reasons, but that policy has changed.  In the Garda Commis<Col N="205"/>sioner&rsquo;s opinion, the changing nature of crime and particularly the growth of organised and ruthless gangs requires the security response to be stepped up.  In addition, as I mentioned, the threats to society and to the integrity and effectiveness of the criminal justice system itself that these gangs pose, particularly the attacks on ordinary people going about their daily lives, require a corresponding robust legal response.</P>
        <P>The use of sophisticated surveillance devices is now an essential tool in the fight against serious crime in many jurisdictions throughout the world.  It provides tactical and strategic information for the agencies concerned in their respective fields of operation and for effective cross-agency co-operation as required.  It delivers real-time intelligence on the plans and actions of criminals, subversives, terrorists and other sources, which allows the agencies to disrupt their plans and frustrate their actions.  It can identify the perpetrators and facilitate their arrest and it can reveal the existence of new sources from which a broader understanding of the threat from criminals and others can be assessed and preventive strategies developed accordingly.  The use of secret surveillance after a crime has been committed can lead to the arrest of the perpetrators and assist with the direct recovery of any proceeds and the unravelling of any related money laundering operations.  Crucially, surveillance can prevent loss of life.  It is of inestimable value in dealing with ransom cases and crimes of revenge and retribution within the criminal community.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a significant advance in the process of bringing those involved in serious criminal activity to justice and it demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the fight against crime and the safety of citizens.  It adds to the measures already introduced by the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 in dealing with the prosecution of gangland crime.  It provides an appropriate and, more important, a proportionate balance between the competing demands of protecting people&rsquo;s rights to privacy and ensuring we live in a society safe from the threats of crime and terrorism.  The Bill respects our obligations under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights while ensuring that effective mechanisms are in place to support the Garda and other agencies in carrying out their work.</P>
        <P>Given the continuing serious problems with tackling organised crime gangs and their increasing attempts to undermine the criminal justice system through extreme acts of violence and intimidation against witnesses and ordinary citizens, the Minister is working in consultation with the Attorney General on the introduction of further measures to tackle such gangs.  As I said, the information and assistance the public make available to the Garda remains invaluable in ensuring those who engage in criminal activities can be brought before the courts to answer for their actions.  Anything that would reduce that assistance is a matter of concern.  The gangs are also aware of that, so they have on occasion engaged in intimidation of witnesses and jurors.  In light of this ongoing intimidation, the Minister is considering making the powers to combat subversive organisations applicable also to criminal gangs.  This would mean that certain crimes involving criminal gangs would be scheduled offences for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act so they will be tried in the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP directs otherwise.</P>
        <P>The Minister is also considering introducing several new organised crime offences with maximum prison sentences of 15 years to life.  Under consideration are the creation of new offences of membership of a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation and making those offences scheduled offences as regards the Special Criminal Court; simplifying the procedures for extension of time for questioning of suspects; and increasing the penalties for intimidation of a witness or juror.  Senators will appreciate that complex legal and constitutional issues are involved in these proposals.  The Minister is therefore in close consultation with the Attorney General and will of course take his advice into account before finalising the proposals.</P><Col N="206"/>
        <P>There is no doubt that the scourge of gangland crime is a real concern for the Government, the Minister and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I have outlined, significant efforts are made daily to tackle this problem.  The Minister asked me this morning to assure the House that he will continue to make the fight against crime a priority.  The substantial changes we have made to our criminal laws in recent years, together with the proposed changes I have outlined, will complement the excellent work that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carries out daily.  I assure the House that the State will continue to be relentless in its approach to bringing those involved in such activities to justice and will adjust that approach as necessary in the light of the evolving challenges.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their forbearance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are assured that everything is in order, that the legislative framework is in place and the resources are available to combat criminal activity and, in particular, organised crime gangs.  However, the House has had that assurance many times.  There are no results on the ground to substantiate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s ongoing claim.  If we look back to 1997, elections were won on the principle of zero tolerance.  It is a bit like the role of economic management in the most recent election.  However, if we examine the period since then, there have been 140 gangland murders but only 14 convictions.  In 2008 there were 106 incidents in Dublin alone involving grenades, pipe bombs and other improvised devices.  That represents a 340% increase in just one year.  There have been 171 gun murders in the State in the past 11 years but only 22 convictions.  The record of detection and particularly prosecution of gangland crime has been appalling.  The criminal gangs clearly have the technology, the equipment and the organisation.  The State has not given the Garda and the forces of law and order the resources to combat this scourge, nor have they been given a legislative framework within which they can operate effectively to combat, detect and prosecute these heinous crimes.  The facts speak for themselves.  The Government has failed to destroy criminal gangs or secure prosecutions.  There is no strategy.  If there is a strategy, after every new murder of this type or other tragedy the usual announcement is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a meeting with the Garda Commissioner.  That seems to be the standard response.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to combat the activities of criminal gangs not only outside prisons, but also when they are inside prison.  While some corrective action has been taken to address the prevalence of mobile phones, all the evidence suggests that these hardened criminals can continue to run their businesses from behind prison walls.  It is true to say that there was an attitude to gangland crime that did not make it a priority for the Government.  The attitude was that as long as they were killing each other, who the hell cared.  The problem about that as we have seen in many cases in the recent past is that innocent people get caught up in the crossfire and then we have some reaction to the situation.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions we initiated legislation in this House and in the D&aacute;il &mdash; Fine Gael has initiated legislation such as the Criminal Justice (Violent Crime Prevention) Bill 2008.  I introduced a Bill here in the Seanad entitled the Criminal Law (Admissibility of Evidence) Bill 2008 &mdash; and they were all shot down by the Government.  Everything was in place.  The Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 were adequate and provided the necessary basis for hitting back at criminal activity and organised crime, and yet some of the provisions of those Acts have not been activated or implemented, including electronic tagging.  Recently even the Taoiseach questioned whether the provisions regarding gang membership would be constitutional.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, mentioned the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 that was recently initiated by the Minister.  Fine Gael has called for such a Bill for some <Col N="207"/>time.  We welcome its introduction.  It is of fundamental importance to the detection of crime, particularly in cases where witnesses are being intimidated.  To have direct evidence of this nature, which could be admitted in court in the prosecution of gangland crime, is of fundamental importance.  However, if the resources are not provided for the three main law enforcement agencies involved, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Customs and Excise, and Revenue, the Bill will not produce the results.  It is good that Revenue has been added as an organisation that can utilise the provisions of the Bill.  At present under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 only the Garda and the Defence Forces can do so.  That is a welcome development.  The fact that the law enforcement authorities have not been able to use evidence in court in the prosecution of crime has been a major hindrance in prosecutions.  This is a welcome development albeit coming with undue delay.</P>
        <P>There is an aspect of the Bill that demonstrates the lack of co-operation on legislation in these Houses.  Anything suggested by the Opposition is automatically shot down.  I refer back to the Bill I introduced, the Criminal Law (Admissibility of Evidence) Bill, which provided for the admissibility of evidence in circumstances where it may have been illegally obtained.  The Bill provided considerations that could be taken into account by a court in admitting evidence, including: whether the obtaining of the evidence was a result of a mere mistake, accident or oversight; whether the breach was serious or merely technical in nature; the seriousness of the crime which the accused is alleged to have committed; whether there were extraordinary excusing circumstances; and the effect on the administration of justice.  The considerations for admitting evidence in the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill included whether the error or omission concerned was serious or merely technical in nature; the nature of any right infringed by the obtaining of the information or document concerned; whether there were circumstances of urgency etc.  The idea in the Bill we proposed in this House and indeed some of the language has been adopted.  I am happy that aspects of the Bill that I initiated here have been plagiarised by the Minister.  However, if we are to work together on these types of problems there should be a sharing of ideas.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I welcome the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.  It is important that the resources are put in place to ensure that its provisions are effectively implemented.  The national surveillance unit that is to operate the tapping and bugging operations will need to be resourced.  The resources for the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions need to be provided.  If the Bill is to be successful there will be more work for that office.  To have a cutback in this area does not reflect that the combating of gangland crime and criminal activity of this nature is a priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State touched on the legislation to provide for a DNA database.  Such legislation, which is fundamental to improving the conviction rate for the most serious of crimes, was supposed to have been available before the end of 2008.  I now notice that there is a new deadline of the summer.  In his speech the Minister of State said that the Minister is working on this legislation and thinking about it.  When there is a commitment to legislation of this nature, which is of such fundamental importance and which we are implementing in co-operation with other European Union member states, the Minister should just get on with it.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the Criminal Justice (Violent Crime Prevention) Bill 2008 presented by my colleague, Deputy Charles Flanagan, in the D&aacute;il, which contained our suggestions for improving the legislative framework for combating organised crime.  Again it was rejected by the Government.  However, the Minister might have regard to some of the proposals in that Bill.  If he wished to implement them, we would welcome that and would support any initiatives in that regard.</P><Col N="208"/>
        <P>Regarding Garda resources, the technology of criminals is very sophisticated.  However, the Garda&rsquo;s communication technology is such that, given its radio system, more eavesdropping is done on the Garda than on criminals.  Rolling out the Garda&rsquo;s digital radio system is important.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify the position.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned how the number of garda&iacute; has increased in recent years.  Recognising our problem with criminal activity, to suggest that garda numbers would stand still would be a step backwards in terms of the resources available for the detection and prosecution of crime.  There must be adequate garda numbers if they are to carry out their current duties as well as the increased surveillance duties and so on mandated by this legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to special operations and units.  Operation Anvil has a budgetary allocation this year of &euro;21 million.  While the operation has gone nationwide, a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme highlighted the fact that it has run down in certain areas that are the focus of criminal gangs and criminal activity.  Given its allocation, there is no higher capacity within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement it and to combat the most serious forms of gangland crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will discuss drugs, to which the Minister of State referred.  In recent years, the amount of drugs that have entered the country by the south-west coast is extraordinary.  In 1996, cocaine valued at &pound;120 million was found on a boat in Cork Harbour.  In 1998, cocaine valued at &pound;61 million was found during a search in Kinsale.  In July 2007, cocaine valued at &euro;440 million was found in Dunlough Bay in west County Cork after a boat capsized.  A short while ago, a yacht was traced to a position 200 miles off the south-west coast as part of a joint EU task force.  It was carrying cocaine valued at an estimated &euro;500 million.</P>
        <P>We cannot tackle this problem on our own.  The recommendations at European level for a police border force were shot down by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The only way to succeed in significantly curtailing the flow of drugs into the country and through it to the rest of Europe is through co-operating with other European law enforcement agencies.  This requires a co-ordinated and integrated response.  It would be in Ireland&rsquo;s interest to taking the initiative in promoting an integrated approach to combating the flow of drugs into the EU.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s location and its use as an entry point, we have a national interest in securing EU support.  Customs and Excise and the Garda have done fantastic work in detecting the landings to which I have referred, but I imagine that these only constitute a sample of the volume of drugs entering the country.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s surveillance Bill and the fact that other measures, such as those outlined by the Minister of State, are being contemplated.  This side of the House will give its full support to measures that will strengthen the legislative base, thereby enabling the Garda, Customs and Excise and Revenue to deal with the different forms of gangland crime, an issue that has become more complex, sophisticated and dangerous.  I thank the Minister of State for attending.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has clearly pointed out the growth in the number of organised and ruthless crimes and the need to step up our security in response.  We have recent and unfortunate experience of the threat posed by gangs to society and to the integrity and effectiveness of the criminal judicial system.</P>
        <P>Unlike Senator Regan, I believe that much has been done in recent years.  The number of garda&iacute; has increased from 11,000 during my earliest debates in the Seanad to in excess of 14,000.  The Garda reserve force has also been introduced, although that process may be moving more slowly than we would have liked.  When a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced it, it received much support in the Houses because it would release garda&iacute; from mundane duties to tackle serious crime.</P>
        <P>Organised criminal gangs around the world have become sophisticated.  As a consequence, there has been an increase in the co-operation between various jurisdictions&rsquo; police authorities.  This is essential if we are to combat the crimes committed by those who have no inhibitions about crossing frontiers.</P>
        <P>Drugs comprise a significant factor in the growth of crime worldwide.  Various states have taken strong initiatives, but none has overcome the difficulties.  I share the opinion that, to some extent, we are merely trying to match or contain crime.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State alluded to Operation Anvil, which has enjoyed significant success.  However, while the figure of &euro;200 million in seizures certainly is high, it probably only constitutes a fraction of the value of the annual market for drugs, which in Ireland is an industry that is worth well in excess of &euro;1 billion per year.  This of course will entice people into crime and the drugs trafficking trade.  As a consequence, the incentive for such people to participate in that business and to be absolutely ruthless in controlling their market areas must be matched with an equally committed and absolutely unwavering fight by the State against those involved in this trade.  This is not easy because so doing has led to much introduction of and change in legislation.  The Minister of State has outlined a number of initiatives that will come before the House in the next few months.</P>
        <P>Whenever Members have such debates, some raise issues with regard to civil liberties infringements and so on.  This point must be kept in mind because balance must be achieved in this regard.  However, the judicial pendulum must tend to lean more towards the protection of society than towards the rights of such serious criminals in particular, who have no respect for the rights of anyone else.  Some of the aforementioned initiatives have taken place against the backdrop of serious and high profile crimes and murders in this State.  The obvious example is the introduction of the Criminal Assets Bureau on foot of the horrendous murder of Veronica Guerin.  While I can be highly critical of some issues pertaining to the media, I extol the fact that they are very much part of our democratic process and therefore must be so perceived and protected.  Moreover, individual citizens also have such a right to be protected by the State.  The Criminal Assets Bureau has been extremely successful and interestingly, representatives from other jurisdictions have come to investigate the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau in Ireland and have introduced similar provision within their own jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>In the aftermath of the Omagh bombing in 1998, provisions were made to tackle subversive crime in Ireland that were regarded as draconian at the time.  That was in response to people&rsquo;s great abhorrence of the killing of so many innocent people in that bombing.  Measures pertaining to the right to silence certainly were introduced and allowing judges to make an infer<Col N="210"/>ence and enabling superintendents to give evidence to which the courts were obliged to give regard were positive steps.  Members have begun to recognise that the threat posed to society and the State from those who are involved in serious criminal activity and criminal gangs is at least comparable.</P>
        <P>One measure that has been introduced in the intervening period and to which the Minister of State referred is the witness security programme, whereby families and witnesses are relocated, identities are changed and financial aid is forthcoming.  It appears that for whatever reason, this measure is not used as widely as Members had anticipated at the time.  It does not appear to have been as effective a tool as was thought initially.  In previous debates, it has been suggested that this is because people do not wish to be relocated or to go abroad and be completely separated from relatives, friends and the like.  Moreover, those involved do not welcome the lifestyle change and this may be an inhibiting factor.  However, whatever measures are taken must ensure the protection of witnesses and any intimidation of witnesses at whatever level must be tackled with the most vigorous efforts and with all the resources of the State.  A sad instance in this regard was the recent murder of Roy Collins in Limerick.  However, it followed other murders, such as that of Shane Geoghegan and of Brian Fitzgerald a number of years ago.  The latter case probably did not receive the same profile as the murder of Veronica Guerin.  He was a man who performed security duty, in the course of which he prohibited some gangs from selling drugs in the premises for which he had security responsibility, and they cold-bloodedly murdered him.</P>
        <P>Apprehensions have arisen with regard to some of the murders that have taken place and I share Senator Regan&rsquo;s concern that only a small number of those who have committed such murders or assassinations have been brought before the courts.  However, I also recognise that it is extremely difficult to so do.  Such gangs are highly professional operations with significant financial resources at their disposal and are completely ruthless in the manner in which they apply such resources.  In this regard, I welcome the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 to which the Minister of State referred.  Any initiative that has been taken regarding subversive crime also should be applied in this respect and the Government now appears to be going down that route.  The record will show that I advocated so doing in the past.  It is only right that such evidence as may be acquired through secret surveillance methods can be used.  I am aware of reservations on the part of the Garda.  While Members will have the opportunity to debate this Bill, it contains certain precautions, such as the requirement for authorisation by a District Court judge and the fact that such authorisation must be renewed after three months. Moreover, it will be subject to a judicial review, to be carried out by a High Court judge, and I understand the report will be laid before these Houses.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Regan, I would greatly welcome the introduction of the Bill to establish a DNA database that is in preparation because use of DNA has proved to be useful in the detection of crime.  A number of issues arise in this regard.  Obviously one must have in place the legislative framework but one also must have in place resources that are equipped and honed to meet the challenges of such sophisticated groups and operations, bring them before the courts and be able to prosecute them effectively through the courts.  Anything that Members can do by way of legislation would be done willingly by practically everyone in the Houses.</P>
        <P>One subject that has not yet been mentioned and that I have raised previously concerns the infiltration of gangs by the Garda.  I do not know the extent to which this happens and I understand the need for secrecy and absolute confidentiality in this regard.  However, from following some of the cases through the courts, my perception is that such infiltration is not used as widely here as it might be.  My second reason for making this point is that I have seen no attempt in Ireland to move in the direction of the Canadian model.  The Canadians legislated <Col N="211"/>to grant immunity from prosecution to undercover police operations, except in cases in which those involved may have been involved in murder or sexual offences.  I wish to expound on the Canadian model a little further.  I met the group responsible for public safety and emergency in Canada a number of years ago and the Canadians amended the criminal code in 1997 to acknowledge crimes committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organisation.  In January 2002, organised crime legislation made participation in a criminal organisation an offence and expanded this provision to anyone who knowingly becomes involved in activities that further an organisation&rsquo;s criminal objectives.  They also simplified the definition of criminal organisation and reduced the number of people required to constitute a criminal organisation from five to three.  These were effective measures taken by the Canadian State.  Some of the success that country has had should be examined.  Apart from responding to high profile crimes it is important to keep ourselves <i>au fait</i> with what is happening in other jurisdictions where effective initiatives are being taken, which we could replicate.  I wish the Minister well in his efforts.  I look forward to the two items of legislation, which will be a significant addition to the armoury of combatting crime in this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am a welcoming person and I welcome the changing of the guard, noting that there is a different Minister of State in the Chamber.  I welcome the support of my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, with whom I will share time.</P>
        <P>This is a serious situation, particularly with regard to violent organised crime involving firearms.  I am now boasting of my age, almost 65 years.  When I was younger there was no such thing as organised crime in this country.  Gun crime was virtually unknown and comparatively small crimes were headline news.  We went to the cinema to see the mob in Chicago but it did not appear to exist in our community.  There was less violence.</P>
        <P>I am not sure how it happened.  Partly, it is our culture.  There may not have been a mob but there was a culture of violence.  It was embedded in the songs sung, glorifying violence, murder and explosion.  That was part of our background.  The IRA softened people up to the idea of violence through its campaigns, particularly in recent years.  I listened to a reporter in Limerick on RTE, who interviewed a man who was limping because he had been shot.  The precise method by which he was shot, through the back of the knee, was used by both sides in the north of Ireland.  There is political currency there.  I remember warning that if we did not manage the transition from violent events to a more democratic situation, we ran the risk of creating a mob situation, which we now have.  There is a direct relationship.</P>
        <P>The recent cases in Limerick are extraordinarily worrying.  The catalyst for this appalling violence appears so trivial.  The refusal to admit a young girl to a pub because she was under age and not in a position to produce evidence of her age was treated by the criminal fraternity as a capital offence for which someone was sentenced to death.  That is absurd and a previous case was similarly trivial but people were hired to murder on the basis of this tiny provocation that escalated like a 16th century Italian vendetta.</P>
        <P>The ages of some of the murderers and gun toters are 14, 15 or younger.  Where does this come from and in what manner have these people been desensitised?  The conditions of poverty and squalor in which these people live and the areas where this takes place are limited and easily definable.  This is part of the reason.  I never thought I would say the following because I remember speaking on the Video Recordings Bill where I was so much in favour of freedom of speech.  People are acclimatised to horrendous violence by violent video games.  This must be examined again.</P>
        <P>There are absurd effects of this.  I do not want to be bloodthirsty but I recall the phrase in the Bible that those who live by the sword die by the sword.  The case of the man who blew his head off while showing an accomplice how to murder somebody is absurd to the point of <Col N="212"/>laughability.  My mother&rsquo;s favourite joke was a cartoon of a man who lost his index finger who was explaining to his workmate how it happened and the other four fingers were flying up in the air.  It happened because the man was so stupid.  One regrets every death but if anyone asks for it, it is someone from a gang.  It shows they are not quite as clever as they thought they were.  We must use these circumstances quite callously to illustrate the lack of intelligence.  These people are admired and have promoted themselves.  Consider the insensitive way a young female member of one of these gangs discussed on the Internet her favourite gun, among other fashion accessories.  That is a deliberate provocation of society.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the CAB and Senator Walsh approvingly referred to how other countries have admired it.  I hope they knew it was Tony Gregory who suggested it and I who supported him in this House.  The Government was not the slightest bit interested at that stage so there is no point in the Government taking credit for it now.  Let the credit reside where it belongs, with the late Deputy Tony Gregory, who pointed out there was no co-ordination between the inland revenue, the social services and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and who consistently made the plea for co-ordination.</P>
        <P>There is a relationship between drugs and guns.  Frequently, guns come in as part of the drugs shipment for a variety of reasons.  We are vulnerable to drugs because of our island geography.  It is extremely difficult to police this area, even with European assistance.  We were very foolish to allow ourselves, in an unsophisticated way, to be set up for this.  One of the ways we did this was by ignoring heroin, despite what people like Tony Gregory were saying.  We concentrated on cannabis, a recreational drug, which was a stupid diversion from the real target.  They should have considered legalising cannabis.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, in his speech, mentioned Mr. Collins.  I saw his father on television and I salute him and his family.  It was immensely moving to see his grief and hear that, even though he knew that the same might happen again and he might lose a son, he would still do it because these people must be stopped.  We need not look for support from the people; while we have magnificent, courageous, decent people like that in Limerick, we have the support of the people and must build on it.  I honour and salute that extraordinary man.</P>
        <P>The figures in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech are a complete waste of time and are utter garbage.  I remember being in the House when Michael McDowell produced the same figures.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Members analysed the figures and argued that the only reason an increase could be shown was because the figures took this or that starting point.  They are not impressing anyone with that.  We need to know not whether there was a percentage increase between 1997 and today but whether there are enough garda&iacute; concentrated in the areas where they are necessary.  There is a clearly demonstrable correlation between the numbers of garda&iacute; and a drop in crime.  The Minister of State should not try to fob us off with massaged figures that impress nobody.</P>
        <P>I was interested in what the Minister of State said about trained asset profilers.  I would have liked some more information on this as it was not explained, meaning it was just a phrase.  I assume it means that people are professionally trained to detect, for example, if there is a sudden efflorescence of luxury in a working class estate, a Lamborghini is parked outside a door or people appear outside the front door looking extraordinarily tanned after a period of poor weather conditions and so on.  I presume such people find anomalies and are able to profile and track people who could not afford items such as houses, boats or holidays on the social welfare they claim, for example.  Can we have more information about what is involved?</P>
        <P>There is the question of witness protection, which is very important.  Can a programme be achieved and are there resources to do it?  There should also be protection for garda&iacute; and I ask the Minister to introduce special penalties for those who attack the emergency services.</P><Col N="213"/>
        <P>Is there a proper register for handguns and is it updated regularly?  May a person with a criminal record ever have a handgun?  They should not be allowed to have one.  With regard to the use of surveillance evidence, how would this be gained?  How would long-distance voice recording be proven, for example, and is there a form of voice profiling?  Mobile phone tracing has been useful in the past.</P>
        <P>There is a clear need with regard to definition, for example, of members of a criminal organisation.  Previously, there had been great difficulties in defining &ldquo;gang&rdquo; and the process came unstuck with that before.  Will the Minister of State reassure the House that we have an appropriate definition of criminal organisation?  How is that defined and how can people be deterred or prosecuted for that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I echo the words of Senator Norris in expressing sincere sympathy for the families of Roy Collins and, before that, Shane Geoghegan.  Those two people in particular have in recent months come to symbolise the real problem that so many communities, not just in Limerick but around Ireland, particularly in inner-city areas, face with so-called gangland crime.</P>
        <P>With regard to the language, the term &ldquo;gangland crime&rdquo; is an unfortunate term and, like the term &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo;, it does not get across the serious, very sordid and damaging nature of this crime to communities.  It is a somewhat sensationalising word to use which has echoes of the streets of Chicago in the 1920s and so on.  It is perhaps better to speak of organised crime rather than gangland crime.  That is not strictly accurate either because the term comes from the US and a criminal context where there are very organised so-called street gangs.  In Ireland we see a different sort of structure within the organised crime world, with some examples based on family allegiance and others based on commercial ties, drug running etc.</P>
        <P>We must be conscious in any debate like this that the majority of crime is not of an organised nature; most crime is committed in a much less organised way.  As the Garda has indicated on many occasions, a great deal of crime, particularly inner-city crime against property, is committed by people addicted to heroin.  There are very different methods to tackle that sort of crime.  I am glad to say that for some time the official policy has been to encourage more people who are addicted to heroin on to methadone maintenance programmes and there has also been a pilot drug court, which has been a good initiative showing great potential.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to rolling out the drug court further as this is an obvious way of trying to remove from the system a large core of people who will become persistent offenders?</P>
        <P>Research has been done to show that the drops in property crime throughout the 1990s could be linked to an increased Government commitment to putting funding into methadone maintenance programmes and we must be conscious of different methods used to tackle forms of crime other than the so-called gangland or organised crime.</P>
        <P>There is a particular problem for the Garda in prosecuting gangland crime with regard to gathering information, evidence and having witnesses willing and able to come forward.  We should all pay tribute to the very brave individuals who have come forward over the years and enabled prosecutions to be taken against persons engaged in organised crime.  As gangland crime is organised, there is potential to organise intimidation of witnesses and jurors, although we have not seen that in Ireland.  We have seen serious and worrying cases of witness intimidation and that is where our legislative response must keep its focus.</P>
        <P>I welcome two initiatives in particular, including that which allows statements of witnesses to be used in court as evidence even where the witness has been intimidated or is no longer able to come into court to give evidence in person.  Subject to safeguards, particularly where <Col N="214"/>the evidence is videotaped, it is a welcome change to the rule of evidence.  I also welcome the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 which is on Second Stage in the other House, given that all of us, particularly those of us working in the courts, know that the Garda already operates surveillance measures and uses covert methods to gain information.  Anybody who has been in criminal courts will be aware of the formula garda&iacute; use where, on the basis of confidential information available to them, they went to a certain house and arrested a certain suspect.  We know such information is obtained through covert surveillance and garda&iacute; may not want to reveal how information was obtained in all cases.  It would be useful and important that where judicial authorisation is obtained, such information may now become admissible evidence in courts.  I stress the need for safeguards and to ensure that the constitutional rights of privacy and inviolability of the dwelling are protected.  We have seen a large body of case law built up over the years on search warrants and the courts have held a line against undue encroachments on those rights, which is important.</P>
        <P>We cannot lose sight of other means which have been adopted to try to tackle organised crime where it has been a specific feature of specific communities.  It is important to welcome the regeneration project in Limerick, which I hope will bear fruit.  That is a more long-term prospect.  I also welcome changes in community policing and ask the Minister to guarantee that it will be one of our priorities.  A Minister of State gave a speech earlier in which he spoke about increased Garda numbers but I saw nothing in the contribution about an increased commitment to community policing.  To build trust in communities, community policing is the best way forward.</P>
        <P>Some measures have already been introduced through the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 and there are some proposals for the future apart from the electronic surveillance Bill.  In the raft of legislation introduced in 2006 and 2007 we have seen sweeping new measures such as mandatory minimum sentences for firearms offences, on top of those which have been passed for drugs offences, new definitions around organised crime and new offences in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 where persons commit offences for the benefit of or in association with a criminal organisation.</P>
        <P>Everyone acknowledges that the definition of criminal organisation is problematic.  It is different to the organisation which is at issue in the Special Criminal Court where we have scheduled offences under the Offences Against the State Act.  By their nature, these organisations are much less clearly defined so I urge caution on that.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposed DNA database, which is long overdue.  The Minister will be aware of the Marper decision in the European Court of Human Rights which requires that DNA databases operate within particular parameters and that they cannot be too widely drawn or they will breach civil liberties.  I generally welcome proposals to deal with the matter but warn against the widening of nets.  With any measures introduced to deal with organised crime, the danger is that they will spill over to the ordinary and opportunistic crime and thereby encroach unduly on civil liberty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Bacik stated, the context and even the language of this debate is very important.  The term &ldquo;gangland crime&rdquo; lends itself to what some might see as a glamorised or romanticised vision of desperadoes taking on an establishment.  The reality is that these elements in society, outside their use of arms, have intimidation as their chief weapon in enforcing their will on reluctant individuals and communities when they threaten to hurt, maim or even kill.  The fact they have done so means that society is faced with a problem with which it must deal.</P><Col N="215"/>
      
        <P>The Minister of State referred directly to events that occurred in Limerick city.  This is the most unfortunate aspect of the type of crimes we are discussing.  The overwhelming majority of people in Limerick have nothing to do with the crimes that are being perpetrated there, the number of individuals involved in committing these crimes is pitifully small and the communities where they occur are geographically tiny.  However, the activities of criminals in Limerick have cast a pall over the city and, as a result, it requires access to all the relevant resources of the State to overcome its problems.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to areas in which resources are being provided, highlighted proposed improvements to legislation and outlined further proposals to put in place appropriate legislative measures.  I acknowledge Senator Regan&rsquo;s comments in that regard.  Those in Opposition have played a constructive role in identifying how these problems should be defined and how we should frame our responses to them in legislative form.  There will be much agreement among us in the context of how the problems to which I refer should be tackled.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Some of the crimes that have taken place include recent atrocities such as the deaths of Roy Collins and Shane Geoghegan.  I welcome the fact that a process is in train in respect of the latter and we can only hope that this process will reach a successful conclusion.  Neither the existence of legislation nor the provision of resources provide all the answers.  In the context of the overall response to this issue, what is lacking is confidence among the people living in the communities to which I refer that the problems they are experiencing are being dealt with, that the intimidation they are forced to endure will become a thing of the past and that the substantial resources that have been allocated can be targeted in such a way that they will have the best possible effect.  This is not a matter for political dispute, it is one which we must discuss and respond to in the way the people to whom I refer desire.</P>
        <P>Many of the measures that are already in place go some way towards meeting the gaps in provision that previously existed.  We are in a difficult legal and constitutional area in the context that we are dealing with individuals who have no regard for common rights and decencies.  However, the State has a responsibility to ensure the rights of all its citizens are protected.  We must ask how a balance can be struck between dealing with the individuals to whom I refer and protecting the rights of others.  How can the State intervene to ensure the former can no longer engage in their invidious activities?  Whether the balance to which I refer can be achieved depends on future circumstances.</P>
        <P>There is a common belief that certain people who were suspected of the commission of crimes, who were charged and brought before the courts and who are still intimately involved in many of the negative activities that constitute gangland crime were able to avoid taking responsibility for their actions as a result of their use of intimidation.  We have witnessed the collapse of particular court cases and we are aware that, in certain instances, justice was not served.  This does not help in inspiring public confidence or ensuring a long-term solution to these difficulties might be identified.</P>
        <P>When the relevant legislation comes to the House, we will have a better opportunity to deal with these various matters.  I look forward to many Members having the opportunity to debate that legislation in detail.  We must ask difficult questions of ourselves with regard to how we can strike a balance between maintaining the rights of all in our society and protecting those whose rights have been compromised by the type of nefarious activities in which criminals engage.  If, as legislators, we are successful in that regard, we will be doing our job well.  However, it will not be easy and a great deal of reflection and hard talking will have to be done by Members before we reach that stage.</P><Col N="216"/>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  This debate provides Members with an opportunity to indicate what they believe needs to be done and to outline the improvements that must be made.  In light of the way it is proceeding, I am confident that, within this Chamber at least, there is a common purpose with regard to how we should proceed and what we need to do to be successful in combating gangland crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  As the economic health of the country deteriorates, it is easy to forget there are many issues of real importance which have not gone away.  Gangland crime and the gun culture are but two of those issues.  It is great, therefore, that we are debating this matter today because some of the issues to which I refer require legislative attention.  Senator Norris referred to growing up in the 1930s and 1940s when there was no gangland culture in this country.  At the time, that culture only existed in places such as Chicago.  Now, however, gangland crime is to be found in all our cities and in many of our towns.</P>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009, which could serve as a useful weapon for the Garda in its fight against gangland crime and criminals in general.  Placing Garda surveillance rights on a lawful basis and allowing surveillance to be used as evidence in courts of law will remind the gangs and criminals who plague our society that we will not be intimidated by the increasingly brutal way in which they mete out what they consider to be gang justice.  It is vital to send a message that regardless of who is in government, anyone who inflicts pain on law-abiding, decent people will be pursued and punished to the full extent of the law.</P>
        <P>Measures such as those contained in the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 will be of assistance but, more importantly, they will send a signal that where specific legislative measures or provisions are inadequate, the State will adapt and introduce tough legislation that will confer on the Garda the powers and resources necessary to address the reality of the situation with which we are faced.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about some of the suggestions relating to the Bill.  I refer, for example, to expanding the Special Criminal Court in an effort to counter witness intimidation.  As the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, recently pointed out, an expansion of these powers is unnecessary and would make very little difference in tackling the problem of witness intimidation.  I fully support the ICCL&rsquo;s assertion that while intelligence-led policing is welcome, human rights should be an integral element to our policymaking process.</P>
        <P>I have stated previously that I favour a two-pronged approach in dealing with the broader issue of gangland and gun related crime.  Such an approach must at once be tough but must also be soft in respect of certain issues, such as investing in individuals and communities that are at risk from gangs and organised crime.  It is my view that in terms of concrete powers, considerable ground will have been gained by the end of the year.  The reform of handgun licences, coupled with the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009, can assist in rebalancing the burden of fear from the innocent law-abiding member of society, back to the gangs, the criminals and the murderers.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to speculate about or lend unqualified support to legislation relating to gang membership without seeing specific proposals.  The drafting of such legislation requires time and at present we would merely be debating the issue in a vacuum.  The Labour Party will not support dangerous and highly polarising initiatives that equate young people hanging around on street corners with hardened, dangerous criminals.  Any legislation to deal with gang membership must be approached carefully and in a manner that does not criminalise some of the more transient and naive characteristics of youth.</P><Col N="217"/>
        <P>When I spoke on gun crime recently, I emphasised the need to invest in the elite Garda units that have expertise in dealing with gun and gang-related crime.  On Sunday, I read reports that commended the innovative work practices that are evolving at the crime and security section in the Phoenix Park.  By all accounts, detectives and specialised garda&iacute; are trained to a level that meets international standards and these developments are welcome.  I was disappointed, however, to read this morning that plans to build a new Garda centre for training in firearms have been abandoned as part of cost-saving measures.</P>
        <P>I was also disappointed that the Minister of State gave no commitment to put the witness protection programme on a statutory footing.  Many Members of this House and of my party have been calling for this for some time.  It has been supported by experts and would be a useful tool for garda&iacute; so the programme should be reconsidered.</P>
        <P>These harder measures will help but it is crucial that we follow up with soft power.  Investment in communities and intervention in the lives of young people at risk of joining gangs or engaging in criminality are essential if we are serious about eradicating gangland crime into the future.</P>
        <P>We also need to look at how we treat our prisoners.  Currently our prisons are overcrowded and the situation is so bad that according to the Prison Officers Association, prisoners are now sleeping on mattresses in the reception area in Mountjoy Prison.  Conditions such as these will not help rehabilitation and I worry that recidivism rates will rise.</P>
        <P>Hard power must be used to neuter the abilities, means and resources of the current generation of gangs and criminals.  Soft power &mdash; intervention, education, training, rehabilitation and the provision of hope &mdash; will provide the necessary follow through to dissuade future generations from choosing a life of criminality.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned previously, it is crucial that we deploy resources, including early intervention strategies, towards high crime regions and areas with lower socio-economic demographics.  While it is essential that we tackle and punish the perpetrators of crime, it is also our duty to show a generation of potential criminals that there is a better way of life.</P>
        <P>There are some interesting examples of this approach in Britain at the moment.  Last month, a charity based in Derby was given a &pound;70,000 grant to help young people at risk of joining gangs by improving their access to jobs and training.  Interestingly, the money came from the private sector &mdash; Lloyds TSB issued the three-year grant that will cover workshops, support classes and after-school development courses.  Not everything has to come from the State, but the State can certainly provide leadership and incentive.  Given how much money the taxpayer has now poured into our banks, it would be appropriate to see these kinds of schemes included in the small print of the recapitalisation deals.</P>
        <P>We cannot tackle these problems in isolation and brute force alone simply will not work.  A two-pronged strategy that builds trust, fosters hope and opportunity and provides a route away from crime, while also pursuing and punishing those who do choose that life, is the most effective way to save and intervene in these troubled communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about gangland crime.  As previous speakers have mentioned, I do not think gangland crime is an appropriate term, it is organised crime.</P>
        <P>It is never a good idea to single out one event that led to changes where we decided people deserve better protection from these thugs but I agree with Senator Norris that the reaction of Roy Collins&rsquo;s father on the death of his son was extraordinary.  His courage and dignity were remarkable and we must protect such people.  In spite of the loss of his son in such brutal circumstances he still insisted he had done the right thing and would not make any changes.  It <Col N="218"/>is incumbent on the authorities and the State to protect individuals who show courage like that.  Their immense bravery should be supported.</P>
        <P>Society will fall apart completely if we allow these thugs to parade around Limerick city and other areas.  In news reports after that incident it was clear that the good people of Limerick have had enough so we must introduce changes and I welcome those the Minister is bringing forward, particularly in terms of surveillance measures to counter these people.  They are a threat to society and the State and have the potential to cause communities to rot.</P>
        <P>Thankfully most Members and officials of the Houses are not subject to the level of intimidation that some people must bear on a daily basis.  In my constituency in D&uacute;n Laoghaire we frequently dealt with constituents&rsquo; complaints of anti-social behaviour from lively kids or cars but there was never anything like what some communities are subjected to in terms of violence, drugs and guns.  The power of these people to intimidate their communities through their swagger is most destructive.  Garda&iacute; are even reluctant to get involved sometimes so I welcome the new measures that will allow the State authorities to operate effectively against these criminals.</P>
        <P>We must get real.  I am a proud liberal but while basic human rights must be offered to every citizen, if that means we must have draconian measures in place, so be it.  We have a good history in the use of laws and legislation when the State was under threat from paramilitary subversives.  We have used and employed such legislation to good effect.  When the Oireachtas and the Government concentrate, good legislation that protects the people is enacted.  We have a good record in the area and we must employ all necessary tools to curtail the prevalence of gangland crime.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to peace in Northern Ireland and the idea that these thugs would be idle and would want to control areas through drugs and violence.  It was noted that they would probably come down to the South to ply their trade.  That is what they did.  The Garda is aware that many paramilitaries got themselves involved in territorial battles, particularly in Dublin, whereby they own crime areas or control the supply of drugs to areas.  That has had a detrimental effect.  As Senator Norris pointed out, that might be why the level of organised crime really took off in the South.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister is applying himself to introducing draconian measures to ensure that good, ordinary citizens are protected.  The intimidation of witnesses is a particular problem and the Minister is introducing measures to safeguard the conduct of trials.  If jurors are going to be intimidated and interfered with, we must dispense with the need for them.  That worked successfully previously.  We must be firm about this because these criminals must be tackled head-on if we are to be successful against them.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan did not give garda&iacute; much credit for the level of success they have achieved.  That is somewhat unfair.  I recall hearing a senior member of the Garda discussing the level of drug seizures.  He said that gang members would pay a price as a consequence of these successes and, indeed, many of these gang members were murdered.  That is why the incidence of murder has increased so much.  The internecine strife between these gangs is such that if one is responsible or perceived to be responsible for having tipped off the Garda or having led the Garda to intercepting the delivery of a drug shipment, the price to be paid is one&rsquo;s life.  It is a vicious community and must be shown up for what it is.</P>
        <P>It is a worry that with increased unemployment, youngsters might be persuaded, due to the large amounts of money involved, to become involved in gang culture.  One of the major weapons we have against that culture is very harsh laws.  They must be applied rigorously to try to stop this conduct.  However, many preventive measures can also be introduced in communities <Col N="219"/>that are ravaged by drugs to help move people away from the gang culture.  I look forward to discussing that in more detail when the legislation proposed by the Minister is before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I agree with most of what Senator O&rsquo;Malley said.  These thugs will have to be tackled head-on and the full rigours of the law must be put in place to tackle them.  The gangland criminals are not just a threat to communities but also to the State and the institutions of the State.  They must be treated accordingly.</P>
        <P>I attended part of the Garda Representative Association conference in Killarney this week.  I was heartened to hear the Garda Commissioner state that the Garda is to launch a new series of initiatives to tackle the murdering thugs in Limerick.  That is to be welcomed.  The Commissioner also stated that garda&iacute; in Limerick are also being intimidated.  One wonders what the country is coming to when garda&iacute; are being intimidated.  The Commissioner said they would not be deterred from doing their duty and that although these thugs are prepared to take on the State, the State will prevail eventually.  In the meantime, however, communities are being torn asunder by these criminals, thugs and murderers.</P>
        <P>As has been mentioned by a number of speakers, the threats to Stephen Collins less than two weeks after his son, Roy, had been shot dead are absolutely despicable.  People throughout the country would compliment the man but they wonder what we can do.  We should be doing more to protect such people and communities.  That is the situation in Limerick.  On the radio recently I heard about the ongoing situation in Dolphin House.  The community was meeting to discuss anti-social behaviour and the serious damage that has been done to many cars in the area.  In the course of the meeting there was a bomb scare, and a pipe bomb had to be defused.  This type of incident is happening mainly in Limerick and Dublin but it is happening on a lesser scale in other counties.  People are being threatened and intimidated.</P>
        <P>Drugs are behind the situation in Dolphin House.  It is understood there are four or five major criminals there and they have 15 to 20 runners.  They intimidate people.  Garda&iacute; are present but when they go away the community is left with the problem.  We must have regard for those people and make the punishment fit the crimes.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley said that gangland crime should really be classified as organised crime.  In its programme for Government the Government committed to taking two actions to tackle organised crime.  The first is to introduce divestitures, which would require defendants to divest themselves of interests in tainted enterprises, impose restrictions on the future activities and investments of an individual, and order the dissolution or re-organisation of any enterprise.  The second is a commitment to introduce trusteeships which would allow the courts to empower trustees to run organisations where they are infiltrated or controlled by criminal elements.  There has been no progress whatsoever on both points.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael welcomes the publication of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.  We urge that it be implemented immediately.  We have been calling for such a Bill for some time and we will certainly support its provisions, which we hope will make inroads into tackling gangland criminals.  The conviction rate of just 12% in the 171 shootings that have taken place in the last 11 years emphasises the need for an urgent overhaul of the law.  Covert surveillance legislation is essential in the fight against organised crime.  The garda&iacute; currently monitor criminals under targeted operations such as Operation Anvil but they cannot rely on the material they gather in a criminal trial.  The Minister of State will agree that is an unsustainable position.  We welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to address the problem but we hope it is acted upon as a matter of urgency.</P><Col N="220"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The Garda Reserve was mentioned.  Currently, there are 322 reserve garda&iacute; in place.  That is slow progress, given that the initial target in March 2006 was that we would have the full strength of 4,000, with 900 in place by September 2006.  Those targets have not been met and at this stage the Minister should forget about the Garda Reserve.  It is not playing any part in the prevention of crime and helping garda&iacute;.  We need more garda&iacute; rather than people in the Garda Reserve.</P>
        <P>The witness protection programme was mentioned by a number of speakers.  I do not know how effective the programme is but the Garda Commissioner conceded it was difficult to ask people to give evidence and relocate abroad.  The former Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, said many people are simply too scared to give evidence against members of armed drug gangs and in recent weeks the Director of Public Prosecutions, James Hamilton, expressed his doubts about the programme, saying it was of limited use in tackling gangland crime because the demands on people entering it were fairly drastic.  That comes back to the point Senator O&rsquo;Malley made that if juries have to be taken out of the equation and we have to have special criminal courts without juries, let us do it.  Whatever is necessary must be done to tackle crime of this nature.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has been calling for legislation to be expedited for the introduction of a DNA database for some time.  The heads of the criminal justice (forensic sampling and evidence) Bill 2007 have been published but I understand the legislation has not been drafted yet.  That Bill provides for a central database of DNA samples.  DNA collection would be mandatory for suspects and people convicted of a crime and would be voluntary in the case of mass screenings.  I am aware the Irish Human Rights Commission of Ireland has raised some concerns about the DNA database and called for further safeguards to be introduced when the Bill is published but those fears can be acted upon.  When will that legislation come before the House because it is another tool in tackling organised crime and should be put in place as a matter of urgency?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The myriad loopholes at ports and small private airports must be addressed also.  Currently, they are subject only to random, if not rare, customs visits and searches.</P>
        <P>I could speak for much longer on this issue but we must act on behalf of the people in communities. They are depending on us to put the legislation in place but when the legislation is in place we want it acted upon to protect ordinary decent people in communities throughout the country.</P>

	<P>Yes.  Are there two minutes remaining?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I cannot say much in two and a half minutes; I understood there was more time remaining.</P>
        <P>One gets the impression at times that the Government is saying, &ldquo;What can we do about this problem&rdquo; but there is a great deal that can be done.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Nora Owen, brought in the legislation establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau.  When M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn was Minister for Justice O&rsquo;Connell Street was a no-<Col N="221"/>go area and she sorted that out.  To this day O&rsquo;Connell Street is a very safe place compared to what it was in the past.</P>
        <P>There are measures that can be taken but it is a shame that at this time the Garda budget is being cut by &euro;85 million.  In the two years since this Government took office, violent burglaries have increased by 48% and knife crime has increased by 38% yet the Garda budget has been cut by &euro;85 million.  That does not add up.  The Government said it would bring the force up to its full strength of 16,000.  It is not near that number and as Senator Cummins said, the civilianisation programme is rolling out very slowly.</P>
        <P>There is much that can be done also in terms of the film industry.  Violent films are being shown throughout the world, including in our country.  Young people in particular are viewing those films which depict violent crime involving hand guns, machine guns, other types of guns and drugs and there is no doubt that they act out those films.  Something must be done in terms of censorship of those type of films.  Very few of the films I watch do not portray some form of crime.  One would wonder why films without very violent crime cannot be made.  No form of crime is acceptable in my view.</P>
        <P>As Senator Cummins and Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, whatever has to be done must be done to tackle this problem because we cannot let the position in Limerick get out of hand and be repeated throughout the country.  That is happening because the people involved are moving out of Limerick to other towns and cities and repeating what is happening in Limerick.  The slogan, &ldquo;whatever has to be done must be done&rdquo; is a good one to come out of this debate and the Minister of State should take it back to the senior Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a very useful debate.  I was fortunate to hear the second half of the debate which was opened on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.</P>
        <P>A number of interesting issues were raised which I would like to summarise.  As Minister for children the last point made by Senator Burke is something I would be cognisant of but violent video games in particular are difficult to police.  One person&rsquo;s taste is different to that of another.  One could describe the old cowboy and Indian films as a graphic depiction of violence.  Should we censor those?  Should we censor the John Wayne movies which depicted bar room brawls?  Are they a graphic depiction of violence?  Do we censor Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood films, or Tom and Jerry?  I do not mean to be facetious about it but there is a difficulty in that regard.</P>
        <P>I accept that we are clear about the graphic depiction of sex, which would be described as illegal content in regard to the Internet and so on, but there is a much more equivocal approach to the graphic depiction of violence.  An argument could probably be made for us to consider more seriously the limits and borders we set for our children in particular because as other Senators have said, it desensitises children.  There is no doubt about that, and it is all caught up in violent settings that are the very settings we are discussing, namely, gangland crime.  It is something we must try to tackle.</P>
        <P>I am Minister of State with responsibility for children.  The children of the families involved in gangland crime are seldom mentioned but, clearly, those who are brought up in this setting are at risk, inevitably will engage in a life of crime and, at the very least, they will have the lowest regard for the State and its authority and will be completely desensitised to violence.  I refer to whether the child care services should take a more proactive approach to the children of those involved in drug and violent crime and intimidation and whether the issue should be <Col N="222"/>more honestly addressed by the HSE, which has responsibility for the care of our children.  We are quick to take children from a family if they are at risk, neglected or being abused and the proper criteria are established.  Children brought up in violent settings in Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere are being exposed to risk and the criteria leading to the HSE considering care orders in their respect have been met <i>prima facie </i>.  These parents love their children very much but it is arguable whether they are fit to bring up children in those scenarios.  I visited Limerick recently and garda&iacute; and social and community workers pointed out that children under the age of 12 who are not subject to the criminal code are used by families for the purposes of intimidation, knowing that the Garda cannot reach them.  These are serious issues.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the categorisation of young children who hang around as being engaged in anti-social behaviour.  Young people like to hang around in groups but that does not necessarily mean this should be categorised as criminal activity.  They engage in high jinks and horseplay that can sometimes be described by over-sensitive adults as drifting into the arena of criminality.  Young people are critical of the way they are always depicted by adults.  They are always depicted in a negative light whether that is because they are drinking too much or engaged in anti-social behaviour.  It is in their nature to want to hang around together.  They to not engage in activities that are criminal and sometimes we can be over-sensitive to those issues.  We must pay particular cognisance to that.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan claimed gangs in prisons are not being tackled.  The Irish Prison Service devotes significant resources to tackling gang members in prisons.  It is an offence to have a mobile phone while in prison and convictions have been secured.  The number of searches has been stepped up in our prisons using X-ray facilities and dog units.  I reject the Senator&rsquo;s characterisation of the Irish Prison Service as being inert on this issue.  It is important that our prisons are used for rehabilitation as well as punishment, as Senator Hannigan said, and that people have an opportunity to change their ways.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan and Walsh mentioned the Bill to establish a DNA database while Senator Bacik pointed out that progress has been made.  The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in a case will be significant in the context of how we progress the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris inquired about CAB&rsquo;s asset profilers and referred to fellows with sun tans who in poor climatic conditions may present as an anomaly in the context of their declared income and their perceived wealth.  His description is accurate.  CAB officials try to identify such anomalies and prepare cases accordingly.  He also referred to the debate about who set up CAB and whose idea it was.  He mentioned the late Tony Gregory, while Senator Burke referred to Nora Owen and Senator Walsh referred to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s role.  Everybody had a role, including the Labour Party through Deputy Quinn, who had a significant role working with Nora Owen at the time, the Garda, community workers and Tony Gregory.  They all identified that co-ordination between the Garda and the Revenue was missing.  That issue was addressed and it was redounded to the credit of the State.  Officials from other jurisdictions have visited to observe that model.  Many people had a significant input.</P>
        <P>It is an offence to attack a member of the emergency services, including garda&iacute; and fire brigade personnel.  Senator Norris raised this.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to using statements in court that witnesses recant.  This provision was introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in the context of the Keane trial following significant intimidation of witnesses.  Statements given in the police station were resiled from by the witnesses and the trial of one young man collapsed.  I vividly recall him showing the fingers to photographers on his way out of court.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="223"/>Reform, Michael McDowell, introduced the measure, which was a significant development in our criminal law because it meant the statement could be accepted into evidence, although it cannot be cross examined in the normal way.  It is presented as evidence subject to a number of warnings contained in the Act.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner launched a new model of community policing in January, which is being rolled out nationally.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley that we must respond to the evolving challenges, including, if necessary, draconian legislation.  The Constitution protects many fundamental freedoms and rights, as she said, including the right to one&rsquo;s bodily integrity.  That was not afforded to young Mr. Collins or Shane Geoghegan and we have a duty to protect people from intimidation and violence.  That may require tougher legislation, about which there seems to be a consensus in this House.  We cannot make excuses to do nothing in this area.  The Garda is devoting the resources necessary in Limerick.  I visited there recently and community workers and community garda&iacute; say the Garda is doing fantastic work there.  The regeneration model will, hopefully, benefit Limerick in the long term.</P>
        <P>Legislation is in preparation and it is not correct to state we are doing nothing. Yesterday the Minister introduced the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill in the D&aacute;il.  This will step up the security response to the changing nature of crime by providing a basis in law for secret surveillance and facilitating the use in evidence in criminal proceedings of material so gained.  He is also working in consultation the Attorney General on the introduction of further measures along the lines of those in place to deal with paramilitary groups to tackle organised crime gangs and, in particular, their attempts to undermine the criminal justice system through extreme acts of violence and intimidation.  This includes issues such as membership of crime gangs, a difficult and abstract concept to prosecute.  These measures are in addition to work under way on further tightening the legislative provisions relating to guns, knives and similar weapons.  A <i>de facto</i> handgun ban is in force.  Work is also ongoing on the creation of a DNA database and the Minister expects to seek Government approval to publish a Bill shortly to give effect to his justice for victims initiative as well as to introduce further elements of considerable benefit in the fight against crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reference is made from time to time about the comparatively low level of convictions in gangland type killings, to which Senator Cummins referred.  The Garda has made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings but members of the force face considerable difficulties in obtaining evidence in shootings that are the result of gangland activities.  It must be accepted that associates of a victim of a gangland killing who have information of value to the Garda often do not co-operate, even where they have been the victims of violence.  A number of changes to the laws of evidence have been made to address this.  It has also to be accepted there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it difficult for the Garda to investigate such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation.  The witness protection scheme is in place to assist such witnesses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has expressed his concern at the number of handguns licensed in recent years.  The majority of licensed firearms holders act responsibility and pursue their interests legitimately.  It is regrettable the more handguns that are held by the population, the greater is the risk these guns will find their way to people not licensed to hold them.  Following a series of judicial decisions, there has been a significant increase in the number of handguns licensed.  As there was no public policy decision to bring about this, the <Col N="224"/>Minister has brought forward proposals which include no new licences being issued for handguns, subject to limited exceptions in the case of Olympic sports.</P>

	<P>Companies limited by guarantee are regularly formed by local associations, charities, resource centres and residents&rsquo; associations because it offers them a separate legal entity and identity and avoids the need to issue shares to individuals involved.  Under the Companies Act, companies limited by guarantee are considered public companies, and as such, must have an annual statutory audit irrespective of the amount of annual income and expenditure incurred.  The costs of such an audit can be as high as &euro;1,700, plus VAT, and can often be the largest item of expenditure to many of these organisations.</P>
        <P>In contrast, if the local development association were a private limited company, it would have to issue shares to its members but would be exempt from a statutory audit if its annual turnover was less than &euro;7.3 million, its asset base less than &euro;3.65 million and it had fewer than 50 staff members.  Many small charities fit right into these criteria.</P>
        <P>The need for an annual statutory audit is becoming increasingly prohibitive for many small charities and development associations.  Will the Minister consider a change in the Companies Act whereby companies limited by guarantee with an annual income of less than &euro;100,000 would be exempt from an annual statutory audit?  Such an exemption would benefit a local small charity, residents&rsquo; association or local development association by freeing up valuable income for them to pursue their main objectives.  Auditors would be relieved of what is a boring and meaningless task of completing pages of audit reports to satisfy regulators that a proper and full statutory audit has taken place for a company with very a small annual income.  Will the Minister consider the introduction of such an exemption?</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
        <P>The regulation and auditing of charities is the responsibility of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Section 50 of the Charities Act 2009 stipulates the accounts of a charitable organisation should be audited within nine months of the end of the appropriate financial year where the gross income of such an organisation exceeds an amount proscribed by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Minister cannot proscribe an amount greater than &euro;500,000 under the legislation.</P>
        <P>However, the Charities Act 2009 has not yet been commenced as it will happen when the charities regulatory authority is established.  In addition, for those charities that are companies, the provisions of company law and the auditing requirements of such law also apply.  Responsibility for company law rests with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The <Col N="225"/>company law review group is reviewing the area of exemption from the provisions of company law for companies limited by guarantee.</P>
        <P>Charitable organisations can also, of course, apply for charitable tax exemption from the Revenue Commissioners.  This is a valuable status for a charity to have because, once granted, the charity can then benefit from the various tax exemptions for charities included in the tax code.  These cover income tax and corporation tax in the case of an incorporated charitable body and also extend to capital gains tax, stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax and several other taxes.</P>
        <P>A charity may also apply for authorisation as an eligible charity under the provisions of section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 after it has been granted exemption from tax by the Revenue Commissioners for a period of not less than two years.  This allows the charity to benefit from the scheme of tax relief for donations to charities and other approved bodies.  The relief can be beneficial to charities and such bodies, as it can increase a donation by a top rate taxpayer by over 69%.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; role in this regard is to consider applications from bodies of persons or trusts claiming exemption from these taxes on the basis they have been established for charitable purposes only and to operate controls and monitoring procedures to ensure exemptions, once granted, are not abused.  In determining the appropriate level of controls, Revenue must get the balance right between the opportunities for malfeasance and misuse of moneys donated by the public or grants paid by other Government agencies and the important contribution that voluntary organisations make to society.  It is, therefore, necessary to ensure the monitoring procedures and controls are commensurate with the risks involved.</P>
        <P>Revenue adopts a two-pronged approach to compliance, consisting of the vetting of applications from bodies of persons or trusts claiming exemption from certain taxes to ensure they are entitled to the exemption, and operating controls and monitoring procedures.  The first element is the vetting of applications from bodies seeking charitable tax exemption.  This is considered the key element in ensuring compliance with charity tax exemption conditions.  The second element is the controls and monitoring that bodies that have been granted charitable exemption are subject to after the exemptions have been granted.</P>
        <P>Once an exemption has been granted, each body is required to provide a copy of its first year&rsquo;s financial accounts, as well as details of activities actually carried out.  This information is normally requested within two years of the grant of exemption.  Bodies with an income in excess of &euro;100,000 are required to submit audited accounts.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners carry out several long-term reviews based on risk rating.  As part of the long-term review process, bodies with an income in excess of &euro;100,000 are required to submit audited accounts on request.</P>
        <P>Given the thresholds used by the Revenue Commissioners, the auditing of charitable bodies for tax exemption purposes cannot be considered onerous for smaller charities.  It is considered that the practice is both balanced and reasonable.</P>
        <P>As regards the wider issues of regulation and general audit, these are issues primarily for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the matter of leaving certificate result appeals, the delay in giving them out to colleges and third level institutions, the impact this has on college <Col N="226"/>places and the implications for individual students. It can mean that they do not get to take up the course they want in the year they do their leaving certificate.  A constituent of mine, Charlotte Joyce, has been in correspondence with the Minister&rsquo;s Department and I would be grateful if she could get a comprehensive reply from the Department on the points that she researched and forwarded to it.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister for Education and Science needs to review the timeframe for leaving certificate results, which can mean that students do not get an opportunity to appeal their results in time to obtain a college place of their choice.  I hope the Minister will take an interest in the issue.  With some goodwill and perhaps some changes to procedures, the Department could deal with the issue and remove the stress involved for individuals and families.</P>
        <P>The appeals process for the leaving certificate examination is riddled with delays, which can result in students being excluded from taking up their preferred college place in that year through no fault of their own.  The system seems unfair.  If students appeal their result and a marking error is found when the script is rechecked, they will be awarded the additional points, but at that stage it will be too late for them to take up their college place and they must wait an entire academic year, with all the implications of that for the individual.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will outline to the Minister the timeline for the results and highlight the difficulties posed to students.  Leaving certificate results will be issued on 13 August.  If students are not happy with their results and they or their teachers believe they should have done better, they can lodge an appeal, but the result of the appeal will not be issued until 8 October.  That is too late for them to be included in the universities as their numbers are capped for the academic year.  Even though students have achieved the required marks, they will be advised to wait until the following year.  That seems unfair on a student who has worked tirelessly to obtain the place and has achieved the required marks.  I ask the Government to examine the issue and find a way in which to deal with it so that students can take up their place in the same year they do their exam.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I hope the Department and the Minister will engage with teachers, school management bodies, the State Examinations Commission and the Higher Education Authority and that collectively they will generate innovative ideas to overcome this inequity in our education system, which could be remedied fairly easily.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I am pleased that Senator Fitzgerald has given me an opportunity to clarify the position on the matter she raised.</P>
        <P>The leaving certificate is a terminal and externally examined examination.  Individual subjects are examined under a number of modes of assessment including oral, practical test and coursework, and aural and written examinations.  Some tests, such as oral and practical examinations, are conducted during sixth year, and written examinations take place during a 13-day period in early June each year.  Following the conclusion of the written examinations, candidates&rsquo; scripts are returned to the State Examinations Commission in Athlone for allocation to examiners.  The SEC then arranges preparation of the marking scheme and comprehensive briefing and training of the team of examiners.  Enough time is required for the examiners to conduct the marking to a high standard and for the SEC to put in place quality assurance processes.  Leaving certificate results are finalised by the SEC and issued to candidates seven and a half weeks after the conclusion of the written examinations.  The results then feed into the third <Col N="227"/>level college entry process, which is conducted by the Central Applications Office and college admissions departments in mid-August.</P>
        <P>The results of the leaving certificate examinations, which issue in August each year, are only provisional and this is clearly stated in all correspondence issued by the SEC.  The reason is that any result may be subject to further check and alteration, usually through the appeals system.  This system is in place precisely because the SEC accepts that errors in correcting papers can occur.  Last year, for example, over 380,000 grades were issued by more than 3,000 examiners in the leaving certificate.  The SEC&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that the process of marking papers is as free from error as practicable and that a transparent, easily accessible and effective appeals process is available to all students who feel aggrieved at the result they achieved.  Last year, leaving certificate results were issued on Wednesday, 13 August, and the CAO issued its first round of offers the following Monday, 18 August.</P>
        <P>As an aid to leaving certificate candidates who consider appealing a result, the SEC makes all written scripts available for viewing along with the marking schemes that were used by the examiners who marked their work.  Candidates can then make an informed judgment about whether to appeal a result.  The closing date to apply to schools to view scripts was Tuesday, 19 August.</P>
        <P>To facilitate this viewing process the SEC transports all higher level leaving certificate and ordinary level mathematics scripts and copies of the marking schemes to schools, a major logistical exercise which involves full track-and-trace capacity.  The viewing of scripts took place on Friday and Saturday, 29 and 30 August 2008, and the closing date for the submission of appeals was the following Tuesday, 3 September.  Scripts that are the subject of appeal are returned from schools to the SEC to be made available to examiners at briefing conferences on the following two Saturdays.  In 2008, the first of those took place on the Saturday immediately following the appeals closing date &mdash; that is, Saturday, 7 September.  I understand that there were 11,500 subject grade appeals in the leaving certificate, many for subjects with a number of components.</P>
        <P>The SEC leaving certificate appeals process is undertaken by experienced examiners who, as serving teachers, are tasked with undertaking this work outside school time.  The appeals process involves significant levels of quality assurance by the SEC including the monitoring &mdash; that is, a further remarking &mdash; of 20% of the work of appeal examiners.  All scripts that might lead to a change of grade are remarked in this quality assurance process.  The appeal results were issued on 8 October 2008.</P>
        <P>While the difficulties of students in the position that the Senator described are appreciated, the SEC has assured the Minister that the appeals process is delivered to the tightest possible timescale and deadlines.  From time to time, concerns arise about the impact of this schedule on students who wish to take up offers of third level college places following the leaving certificate appeals process.  In this regard, third level institutions respond as flexibly and positively as they can in relation to accommodating leaving certificate appeal results and make arrangements to admit students to courses on the basis of upgraded leaving certificates.  In a small number of courses, such as medicine, difficulties or constraints can arise from existing class sizes and expanding numbers can have implications for laboratory and clinical capacity.  When it is not practicable to take students into a course at that point, the students in question are offered a deferred place for the following year.</P>
        <P>The Minister appreciates that there can be concerns about this situation, but it is not possible to guarantee a completely error-free examinations system.  The SEC&rsquo;s objective is to minimise <Col N="228"/>the potential for error and ensure that errors that do occur are quickly identified and remedied.  The SEC has assured the Minister that it constantly reviews its procedures to ensure that, as far as practicable, problems such as this are minimised.  However, it is clear that to attempt to expedite a process whereby appeals could take place in a shorter timeframe would impact on the quality of the system and would therefore not be in candidates&rsquo; best interests.  The timeframes involved are required to ensure the high quality and transparency of the leaving certificate examinations process, which are internationally recognised hallmarks of the system in Ireland.  I thank the Senator again for raising this important matter.</P>
