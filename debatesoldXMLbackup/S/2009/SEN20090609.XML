        <P>I wish to inform the House that Senator Alan Kelly has been elected a Member of the European Parliament and accordingly, pursuant to section 11 of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 (as amended by the Act of 2004), he ceased on his election to be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the House I join with the Cathaoirleach in congratulating Alan Kelly on his election to the European Parliament.  It is a great honour and a great distinction.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin again and summarise by saying it is important that everybody was so involved in the democratic process.  Their campaigns were strong and vibrant.</P>
        <P>Turning to the outcome of the elections, the verdict of the people has been given and it is resounding.  Fianna F&aacute;il has suffered its worst ever electoral defeat and the Green Party has been decimated.  Fine Gael is now the largest party in local government, with the highest share of the vote and the highest number of seats.  There is no doubt the people expressed their anger at the Government through the vote.</P>
        <P>Many Government Ministers have since said that people voted as they did because the Government took tough decisions.  It was not because the Government took tough decisions but because they took wrong decisions.  People feel betrayed that so much money has been wasted while they are feeling the pain on the front-line.  They are angry at the waste, rising unemployment and the price individual families are paying, day in and day out, for the poor management of the economy by the Government.</P>
        <P>It is clear the people have withdrawn the mandate from the Government through the electoral process and that they want a general election.  I want to move an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the outcome of the elections and the need for a general election.  It is appropriate that we should discuss these matters in the House today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the two previous speakers in their congratulations, and not just to Alan Kelly on his fine victory.  I met his most enthusiastic supporter, the local Fine Gael Deputy, Noel Coonan, who was delighted with his success &mdash; I thought that was understandable.  In the case of Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Alex White, Donohoe and Phelan, and particularly Senator Bacik, however, it is important we recognise those who put themselves forward for election.  They should be congratulated and supported in every way possible.</P>
        <P>I agree that it would be appropriate to have a debate on the current political situation, although perhaps for reasons different from those of Senator Fitzgerald.  I caution the two large parties to calm down and remember this is a great game played slowly.  They should not rush into anything.</P>
        <P>The Irish people, unlike almost every other group in Europe, took the opportunity to have a go at the Government without moving to the far right.  I would like to <Col N="865"/>discuss that.  If anything, there was a move towards Independents, left wing and centre candidates.  That is an important issue and should be recognised at a time when an anti-political vote was cast across Europe.  We should look at how Ireland has dealt with this issue differently.</P>
        <P>Now that the Leader has lost another quota of what the public would call local authority members and what we would call single transferable votes for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, perhaps he might be more enthused about Seanad reform, which might offer some proofing against the loss of councillors.  This should be put at the top of the political agenda.  The Government side is down two quotas since the last local elections and should examine change, even for its own preservation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ag an deireadh seachtaine, foilseofar an t-eagr&aacute;n deireanach den nuacht&aacute;n <i>Foinse</i>.  I have never been a fan of <i>Foinse</i>, it has never given me good press ach caithfidh nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge a bheith ar f&aacute;il do phobal Gaeilge agus do phobal Gaeltachta na t&iacute;re seo.  N&iacute;l airgead ag teacht chuig an nuacht&aacute;n &oacute; fh&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht, advertising revenue, agus n&iacute;l doth&aacute;in airgid ag teacht &oacute;n Rialtas.  T&aacute; nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge chomh t&aacute;bhachtach leis na me&aacute;in Ghaeilge raidi&oacute; agus teilif&iacute;se.  Caithfidh nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge a bheith ar f&aacute;il do na teaghlaigh, na scoileanna, na mic l&eacute;inn agus do dhaoine eile.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag moladh anseo, c&eacute; nach raibh riamh m&oacute;r&aacute;n b&aacute; agam le <i>Foinse</i>, go gcuirfidh an Rialtas na hacmhainn&iacute; riachtanacha ar f&aacute;il ionas go mbeidh nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il do phobal Gaeilge na t&iacute;re seo.  It is scandalous and outrageous.  I am sick and tired of the words of support we get for the Irish language time and again.  It is absolutely criminal that there will not be an Irish language newspaper available in this country after this weekend.  Can the Government not deal with that?  Can it learn nothing?  It is another slap in the face for Gaeltacht people sa t&iacute;r seo.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on that matter and for the support of the House in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for clarifying the position of former Senator Alan Kelly in regard to his election to the European Parliament last night.  I spoke to him on the telephone ten minutes before I came into the Chamber and had the opportunity to congratulate him.  We were speculating about the precise legal position but the Cathaoirleach clarified it very helpfully.  Unfortunately for us, but fortunately for the European Parliament, Alan Kelly ceased to be a Member of this House on his election to the European Parliament.  I extend warmest congratulations on behalf of my colleagues on the Labour Party benches and I acknowledge the congratulations of others to Alan Kelly, a young member of the European Parliament, a terrific politician and a fantastic standard-bearer for our party.  I wish him every success in the European Parliament.  I am sure he will be a great success there.</P>
        <P>I thank colleagues for their commiserations and congratulations.  I will take both in equal measure because I am sure the intention is the same irrespective of whether they were expressions of commiseration or congratulation.  Along with colleagues, I congratulate my other colleagues in this House who went forward for election in the recent elections.  I say to Senator Norris and to others that it shows no disrespect to this House that Members of it should seek election to the other one.  I wish to make that point clear.  While I have been critical of the way in which we manage the business of this House and have raised the need for reform, I hold this House in very high esteem and respect, as I am sure do the other Members who sought election to the other House.</P>

	<P>Senator Alex White without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is certainly not intended as an explanation and it is a pity that it should be taken up in that way.  It is meant absolutely genuinely.</P>
        <P>There has been a political shift in the past few days and I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that there should be a debate about this.  Manifestly, there has been a change politically throughout the country and I am happy to say there has been a marked shift to my party and to the left in this city and in urban areas throughout the country, about which we should have a debate.  It throws down a challenge to all political parties, including my own, that we should present genuine political alternatives to the people and that we should not think they will be satisfied with personality politics or with swapping personnel in Government for other personnel.</P>
        <P>I accept this is a challenge for all parties.  We should move on to present genuine alternatives and debate them in a House such as this in the future.  A debate in this House, as suggested by Senator Fitzgerald, would present an opportunity for that to be done and I second her amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole maidir le <i>Foinse</i>.  T&aacute; an ceart aige agus glaoim ar an Rialtas rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh faoi sin chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir.</P>
        <P>What I have to say should be recorded because it is uttered after every election.  The electoral register is a disaster.  I am sure every Member of this House would say exactly the same.  As members of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Senator Coffey, I and perhaps others from this House compiled a report having visited the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland.  Can this report be brought before the House as soon as possible in the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because something must be done?</P>
        <P>Many people who voted all their lives were disenfranchised.  There must be a better way to compile the register because what is being done currently is not working.  I met an old lady well into her 80s who voted all her life in tears because her name was deleted from the electoral register.  I am sure this was the result of a clerical error of some description.  However, a way must be found for persons in that situation to vote, as they are entitled to do.  I would welcome an early debate, with the Minister present, to discuss the report of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the status of the electoral register.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader provide the House with any information he has on the response of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the No. 35, non-Government motion 8 on the Order Paper, regarding the exemption of the churches from equality legislation?  I seek seconders for an amendment to the Order of Business whereby No. 8 would be taken immediately after the conclusion of the Order of Business.  There has been no response on this issue in two weeks.  This suggests either that the Leader is held in contempt by the civil servants in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or that the Leader holds this House in contempt.  The churches have been placed above the law in a manner citizens neither understand nor welcome.  I have referred in this House to an important case where protection was removed from a student in a school in Dublin and vulnerable people were exposed to risk as a result of the deficiencies in this legislation.</P>
        <P>This poses questions about the commitment of some sections of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to equality.  We have seen the attack on the Equality Authority of Ireland.  Some weeks ago we had Senator Walsh seeking to remove protection from Travellers.  We have had people talking both in this Chamber and on the radio<Col N="867"/> about secret societies.  It must be a requirement that membership of any secret society that may have an extra-parliamentary influence be included on the register of Members&rsquo; interests.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the outcome in the McKevitt case whereby the wicked and callous individuals concerned have been called to account and shown up for what they are.  The Shell oil company has also been called to account, having been fined $15 million in respect of its involvement in the murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others.  This places in context references in this House to terrorist involvement in the Shell to Sea campaign and raises serious questions about the newspapers that applauded the element of bias in Paul Williams&rsquo;s film.  The <i>Independent</i> said it was a great idea, that they were very glad.  It is astonishing that bias should be found.  Perhaps we will be treated to Senator Harris&rsquo;s views on the criminal activities of Shell oil.  He was very lyrical in smearing the people involved in the Shell to Sea campaign.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I congratulate Deputy Kenny, leader of Fine Gael, and Deputy Gilmore, leader of the Labour Party, for their stunning success in last week&rsquo;s elections.  Deputy Kenny receives a very bad press and receives little recognition for the trojan work he has done for his party.  I congratulate Alex White and Senators Bacik, John Paul Phelan and my old friend, Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, all of whom copper-fastened their positions for the future.  That was all good news.</P>
        <P>There has been much rubbish spoken about seismic shifts in Irish politics.  Such a shift would be a very negative development.  One of the clich&eacute;s of my youth, when I was a student socialist, was the notion that Irish politics should be divided between left and right.  If it were, we would have something like the type of politics represented by the two British National Party MEPs.  The reason Irish democracy is the most stable in Europe, surviving fascism and armed struggles by the IRA, is that we have two centre parties which offer a change of tone and temper and which can move to the left or right according to changes in the political context.  We do not need a left-right divide.</P>
        <P>It has been a good electoral result.  However, to those who predict that Fianna F&aacute;il will disappear from the landscape, I say that would be a tragedy, just as it would be a tragedy if the same were to happen to Fine <Col N="868"/>Gael.  I am less pushed about the Labour Party.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very pleased that Alan Kelly did so well in the European elections, but I was not very pleased with some of the transfers he received.  There is a great deal of tic-tacking taking place between Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in which deserves close scrutiny on the part of the people.</P>

	<P>Irish democracy, from Daniel O&rsquo;Connell to Isaac Butt to Parnell to John Redmond and on to the War of Independence and the Civil War, when only a small aberration occurred, has always had a great parliamentary, constitutional tradition of the centre.  I hope that when the waters stirred up by Friday&rsquo;s elections have subsided and by the time the next election comes around, people will recognise that the public sector and the banks must still be reformed and that work remains to be done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also congratulate all those Members of this House who contested the various elections.  I particularly congratulate Alan Kelly, who is now a Member of the European Parliament.  It is a tribute to these people&rsquo;s political standing that they can join political parties, remain with them and get elected.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on fisheries, particularly in the context of the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  There have been a number of appalling developments with the implementation of the sea fisheries legislation that was enacted by both Houses some years ago.  There has been a particularly scary development whereby the Chief State Solicitor no longer deals with violations of the relevant Act and the DPP is obliged to take on such cases.  I have referred to the criminalisation of fishermen on previous occasions.  In that context, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate, sooner rather than later, so that we can investigate the claims being made by those involved in the industry and ensure this House defends fishermen.  Fisheries is one of the areas by means of which we can reboot the rural economy.  We must consider relaxing the very restrictive and draconian laws in this area so that people in the industry are allowed to survive.</P>
        <P>I also request a debate on the HSE and its controversial Teamwork report, which was published this morning, relating to the future of Bantry, Tralee and Mallow general hospitals.  This is a very important and controversial document and it should be the subject of a debate in this House.</P>

        <P>I join other speakers in complimenting and congratulating the Members of this House who put their names forward for election.  It is particularly important that we recognise anyone who is prepared to put his or her name on a ballot paper.  I monitored the efforts of the various candidates from this House and there is no doubt that they put in exceptionally good performances and they can feel extremely pleased with their achievements.  I congratulate former Senator Alan Kelly on his magnificent achievement.  I have no doubt that he will be an outstanding representative in Europe and I wish him well.</P>
        <P>I also congratulate all those who succeeded in gaining election as councillors.  However, let us spare a thought for those councillors who lost their seats.  Many of these people were fine, spirited and generous public representatives who lost their seats as a result of a quirk of fate.  I hope those individuals will continue to give service into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank colleagues for their good wishes on my efforts and those of the other Senators who stood in the various elections which took place on Friday last.  I support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Fitzgerald.  The reason for this is not to debate the consequences of the elections but to examine the events that have caused the changes in the political landscape.  I refer to two issues that have not been mentioned on the Order of Business.  The credit rating of our country has been downgraded, which means that, despite the assurances of the Government, it will cost more than originally thought to borrow money to fund the rescue of our banking system.  Those who downgraded Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating have indicated they will do so again.</P>
        <P>On Friday the number of people on the live register exceeded 400,000.  We are inexorably creeping towards an unemployment figure of 500,000 and we are in the middle of an economic war.  The consequences of that were seen in the elections last week.  The success or the loss felt by those who participated in those elections is irrelevant in comparison with the loss by people of income and jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is need for a debate on what is happening because there is concern about the lack of leadership and the lack of confidence of the people in the Government.  This requires a debate because the Government has to a fair degree neutered the Houses of the Oireachtas in the past 20 years.  That has made the people feel they do not have a say in matters.  If members of Government parties feel they got a drumming they did not expect in the elections, it is because people feel they do not have the opportunity to have their say in what happens in politics because of the way both Houses of the Oireachtas have been shut down and power handed almost exclusively to the Executive, Ministers whom the people feel are incompetent.  There is a strong need for an early debate to give confidence back to the Irish people that their views can be heard and respected in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is not happening at the moment.  Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers have an attitude of whistling past the graveyard as if this is not really happening to them.  They must wake up to what is happening.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Harris, many of whose observations in this House fall on barren ground.  Those observations should be taken on board because they are very interesting.</P>
        <P>Another issue will arise in the next couple of months that we must debate seriously in this House, the Lisbon treaty.  At this time the people do not have enough confidence in the Government for us to give sole authority to it for running that campaign.  That must be taken on board by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is a serious need for the political parties which support the Lisbon treaty to have joint ownership of that campaign.</P>
        <P>During the last campaign, the Taoiseach insulted the Opposition parties which supported him when he said they were not doing enough, and that had a detrimental impact.  The position is so serious now that we must have a debate on the Opposition parties leading the Lisbon treaty campaign in order to gain the confidence of the people.</P>

	<P>I would like to be associated with the note of congratulations to all those who allowed their name go forward for election but were not successful on this occasion.  I single out former Senator Alan Kelly, as his election is a great credit to him.  He put significant work into his campaign and at 33 years of age, he is the youngest person from this island being sent to represent us in the European Parliament.  I congratulate him, his Labour colleagues, the Labour Party leader and the Fine Gael Party leader on a great election.  It was certainly Labour and Fine Gael&rsquo;s weekend.</P>
        <P>I commiserate with all the councillors from all parties around the country who lost their seats.  It is not an easy thing to put one&rsquo;s name forward and some of these people were long-serving and hard-working councillors, and for them to not be elected is a huge personal loss.  There is much upset on this side of the House because of the bad results in the various elections, particularly with regard to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>
        <P>We have a mandate from the Irish people to continue governing this State well.  It is easy to oppose, particularly at this time, but our Government has an immensely difficult task in getting this country back on track.  Every day unpopular decisions must be taken and the Government is in no way shirking its responsibilities.  I commend it for its patriotism, hard work and the ability to put the nation&rsquo;s need before short-term party advantage.  I would welcome a debate with the various <Col N="871"/>political parties setting out their stalls on where we will go in future in these difficult economic times.</P>
        <P>As with Senator Twomey, I would welcome a debate on the Lisbon treaty and now is the time to start it.  I am glad we are seeing the end of the Libertas group today.</P>

It is important that a debate take place in this House on the outcome of the elections.  It is very clear that a signal was given by the people to this Government that although it has the authority to continue to govern up to 2012, the moral authority was withdrawn last Friday through the people&rsquo;s actions at the ballot boxes.  Such a discussion must take place in this House, as it will in the Lower House later, when a motion of no confidence will be put forward in the Government.  It is unfortunate we cannot have a similar motion as I would definitely support it in the Chamber.  There is a need for such a debate, which would take into account the direction this country needs to take in upcoming years.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that difficult decisions will need to be made, particularly in December&rsquo;s budget.  Senator Fitzgerald mentioned something which I have commented on many times, namely, the issue is not the difficult decisions but that the Government is making wrong decisions.  Difficult decisions must be taken to quell the anger out there.  As I have said before, hopefully Fianna F&aacute;il will listen now that the people have spoken.  Fianna F&aacute;il needs to have the authority of the people.  It is clear it does not have the moral support or mandate to continue making the decisions it has made.  Whatever Government needs to make these decisions, it must have the support of the people.</P>

        <P>Senator Doherty is wrong when he claims the moral authority was taken from the Government last Friday.  Those I have spoken with have let me know we have made mistakes.  I will put my hand up and admit the Government and this side of the House have made serious mistakes.  I have raised some of those issues with my parliamentary party.</P>

        <P>I support Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s call for a debate on the HSE.  Like him and Senator Donovan, I have a particular interest in the issue of hospital services in geographically isolated regions, such as Bantry Hospital.  I look forward to a debate on this, along with other HSE issues I have raised.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s office and <Col N="873"/>that of the Ceann Comhairle, following my request concerning the hosting of an OSCE parliamentary assembly conference in Dublin.  As I said earlier about teams, I pay tribute to and congratulate the teams in their offices and, in particular, the teams in the interparliamentary section, the Office of Public Works and many other sections.  The conference was held two weeks ago with over 150 delegates from around the world attending.

He managed to secure a moratorium on foreclosures for 12 months.  However, those couples who ran into difficulty at the end of 2008 now are at real risk of losing their homes.  People are sick and tired of the Minister&rsquo;s actions in bailing out Anglo Irish Bank while he does not act to save people&rsquo;s homes.  Moreover, fixed-rate mortgages have crippling breakage costs that no one can tackle and it is expected that 300,000 more people will be on the dole by the end of 2010.  When will the Minister for Finance act for the people and give something back to them instead of simply bailing out banks?</P>

	<P>Stati<Col N="874"/>ng that 40,000 people will lose their homes constitutes further scaremongering and is disgraceful.

	<P>I also congratulate Alan Kelly on what was a magnificent achievement.  I know, from hearing him in this House, that he has the talent, ability and commitment to make an excellent contribution in the European Parliament and I wish him well.  I was sorry that other colleagues did not succeed in their endeavours but I do not doubt they will enjoy success at a future date.  I also note that in common with many others, I felt disappointment when Kathy Sinnott did not make it back to the European Parliament.  She has been a distinctive and compassionate voice and I am sure her future participation as a representative politician is not far away.</P>

It is vital for the intellectual future of this country that discussion of current affairs in the Irish language is carried out in both the broadcast and print media and a weekly newspaper is an essential part thereof.</P>
        <P>I hope the Leader will consider supporting the Private Members&rsquo; motion I intend to table tomorrow on human trafficking.  It is clear that despite the human trafficking legislation enacted last year, there still are problems in the manner in which victims of human trafficking are being treated with particular regard to their exploitation in the sex industry.  While there is a range of issues, it appears as though victims of trafficking are being treated as an immigration problem.  A number of measures must be taken, from mandating a focus from the organised crime side within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  I hope the Government will take this issue seriously, starting with support for this motion tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I compliment those Senators who ran in the recent by-elections and European Parliament elections on their magnificent performances.  I congratulate the former Senator, Alan Kelly, on his election to the European Parliament.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole said he has detected a shift in the mood of the electorate.  Perhaps the election of Joe Higgins as an MEP for the Dublin constituency and the election of my neighbour, Se&aacute;n Kelly, as an MEP for the South constituency means there has been a move towards our part of the country &mdash; the kingdom.  I support Senator Glynn who made a serious point about the register of electors.  When I toured the polling stations in my part of the kingdom the other day, I saw people from Bangladesh, Bangalore and all points in between but noticed that a number of our own people were absent from the electoral register.  Although we call them local elections, all of the non-nationals are on the register and more power to them.  One could hardly spell some of their names, but they were there.  I suggest that nearly 100% of them came out to vote in the town of Killarney.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must all put our heads together, as Senator Twomey said, to deal with the Lisbon treaty.  It would be wise of the Government to acknowledge the shifting mood of the electorate in this regard.  Perhaps the Leader will use his good office to prevail on the Taoiseach to consult the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party immediately.  We need to treat this matter seriously.  While I admire Mr. Ganley for the courage he showed in putting his name forward, I am glad the electorate has seen the back of his party.  I appeal to the Leader to use his good office to secure co-operation and goodwill in respect of this serious issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think people on the Government benches can claim it is business as usual after last week&rsquo;s elections.  Just as Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s has downgraded this country&rsquo;s sovereign debt rating, the electorate has downgraded the Government&rsquo;s rating.  It is indisputable that the people have issued a vote of no confidence in the competence and ability of the Government to manage the economy and deal with many of the other concerns that exist at present.  The Government has no mandate and no legitimacy.  It does not have the power to get us out of the problems we are in today.</P>
        <P>In his fine analysis of what happened in the recent elections, Senator Harris suggested that it was not a seismic shift.  If it was not a seismic shift, it was certainly a fundamental one.  The reality is that just as Fine Gael has never had a secure core vote, Fianna F&aacute;il no longer has a substantial and secure core vote.  That is what is different now.  This country can now have real politics, in which the people decide whether the Government is competent to do the business of government.  Many voters who saw Fianna F&aacute;il as their own party have realised that it is not able to deliver the goods or serve their interests and the general interests of the population.  That is the fundamental change.  It is the end of tribal politics.  It is a fundamental change for the better.  The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, transformed this country with his constitutional crusade.  He transformed the Constitution in a way that ultimately led to the birth of modern Ireland.  It is to his credit and the credit of Enda Kenny that Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s stranglehold &mdash; its dead hand &mdash; on the Irish body politic has been ended.  Politics will be healthier for it.</P>

I congratulate all the other Senators who took part in last week&rsquo;s elections.  They performed admirably and should be proud of their performances.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to arrange a debate on three key aspects of the recent local elections.  Senators have already spoken about those who were disenfranchised as a result of problems with the register of electors.  On the day of the election, serious issues arose in Meath when political parties failed to take down posters near polling stations and continued to canvass in the vi<Col N="876"/>cinity of polling stations.  The Minister should re-examine the guidelines issued to county managers to ensure all parties are aware of their requirements on the day of polling.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the counting of votes.  I speak today after spending three days attending the count for Meath County Council.  Recounts were called, one of which I called, and I am very pleased with the result.  For the first time since the 1960s we won four seats .

	<P>I second Senator Norris&rsquo;s timely amendment to the Order of Business.  Let us have a debate on the whole ambit of Government policy.  Our credit rating has been downgraded, despite the Minister hawking himself around Europe.  Citizens are facing further prospects of unemployment.  Some 400,000 people are unemployed.  Senator Healy Eames is correct that an increasing number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>May we have a debate on the report issued today by the HSE on the reconfiguration of hospital services in Cork and Kerry?  The report is worthy of debate because it downgrades many of the hospitals in Cork and Kerry, on which we need to have a proper debate.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Alan Kelly on his fine achievement on being elected to the European Parliament in the constituency of Ireland South.  With regard to elections, there is a massive problem with impersonation.  Our register is in rag order and there needs to be a complete overhaul of the election process, otherwise we will be guilty of electoral fraud, which, as a nation, we cannot afford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s call for a debate on the possibility of health services reconfiguration in the Cork and Kerry region.  The HSE&rsquo;s report in this regard is causing great concern in the town of Mallow and the wider north Cork area due to the possible impact on Mallow General Hospital.</P>
        <P>I support the call for a broader debate on the political circumstances in which we find ourselves.  We must all acknowledge that only 55% of the people voted last Friday, the vast majority of whom expressed very strong dissatisfaction with current Government policies.  We will leave the debate on that for another time, however.  We are also obliged to reflect on the fact that approximately 45% of the people cast a vote of no confidence in all of us by deciding not to vote.  We must learn a lesson from that and respond.</P>
        <P>There is a great economic crisis and the people&rsquo;s future is at grave risk.  Some 400,000 people face unemployment.  The country&rsquo;s finances are in absolutely shocking order and we all face a huge political challenge to respond.  This House is the forum in which to have substantive debate on the political and economic choices facing the country.  In the D&aacute;il, Members will go through the motions in the coming days in a party political way, but in this House we should avail of the opportunity on every possible occasion to have serious and substantial political debate on the choices we face.  If the people gave us any message last week, it was that they want political leadership.  Those who did not vote obviously see no political leadership in this House or the other House.  We have to respond to defend our country, our economy and democracy.  Let this Chamber be the fulcrum of economic and political debate on the choices and challenges facing us.  We will all be able to wear our political colours but we urgently need that debate.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all my colleagues who fought the good fight, particularly former Senator Kelly who is now a Member of the European Parliament.  Will the Leader consider doing what we did during the last Seanad when all the Irish Members of the European Parliament came before us to report on their work and to respond to our queries and concerns?  I hope that in the next few months we will begin that process of re-engagement with Members of the European Parliament.  It would be an opportunity for Alan Kelly and others to take on board our views and concerns and we will hear what is going on in Europe.</P>

    <Title>Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009: Report and Final Stages. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that they may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of the amendment, who may reply to discussion on the amendm<Col N="885"/>ent.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 8 are related and will be taken together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, line 30, after &ldquo;1999&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, TO AMEND SECTION 45 OF THE COMPANIES (AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING) ACT 2003 CONCERNING DIRECTORS&rsquo; COMPLIANCE STATEMENTS&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State and his advisors but I see no sign that he will accept this amendment.</P>
        <P>The Government has had a bad run and I am putting forward two simple amendments, even if the second amendment runs to four pages.  A couple of months ago we had the row with the banks.  I am proposing what was originally in the Finance Bill 2003 that was changed because of opposition from auditors from the big four accountancy bodies and from IBEC.</P>
        <P>These amendments will require company directors to disclose any information that is material to the accounts and will require auditors to confirm it has been done.  I doubt there are five people in Ireland who would not agree with that after all we have gone through with the banks.  It irritates me because this debate will get no publicity in the newspapers but when any of us are in the pub at the weekend, we will be asked what we are doing about the bankers.</P>
        <P>If this had been in place when a certain bank got into huge difficulties three months ago, a board member who had previously been chief executive who had loans of &euro;100 million would have had to declare it.  We found ourselves in a situation where the senior Minister and others had to say they did not know if what had happened was in breach of any law.  I am correcting that situation with these amendments.  In doing so, I am going through company legislation as it was previously.</P>
        <P>Where did I find this amendment?  This is the amendment the Director of Corporate Enforcement submitted to the Company Law Review Group.  I am proposing what the Director of Corporate Enforcement wanted.  He is the watchdog for the people and in every amendment the Minister rejected on Committee Stage, one of the reasons given was the view of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I have turned that around; this is the view of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In 2002 following the establishment of the audit review group, which I chaired on behalf of the Government, the senior Minister in the Department was Deputy Harney.  The then Minister agreed with the viewpoint I am putting forward today but came under pressure, as did the Government, and there was a change.  The Minister had appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts with me and if we revisit what she said at the time, when Jim Mitchell was Chairman and Deputies Rabbitte and Durkan were also members, the point was that never again would she have to listen to the view expressed when the off-shore accounts were revealed, when directors claimed they did not know what was happening.  It was like the concentration camps in Germany, they did not know.  We will require people to do something.</P>
        <P>When the audit review group looked over this, one of the issues it reported on was the directors&rsquo; compliance statement, where effectively a company director could say that to the best of his knowledge and as far as was practical, the company was compliant with the law of the land.  That suddenly became a huge problem for all the wrong reasons.  A Senator at the time, who was also a director of a large multinational company, asked how could he know what was going on in a back office of his South African operation.  The answer is that a director could<Col N="886"/> not know but he should be able to say what he put in place to ensure compliance and present the reports his executives provided throughout the last year.  That is not much to ask.  In 2002 I believed naively there was nothing above and beyond what would be required of a company director if there was no legislation.</P>
        <P>I asked the following question at the time and I ask it again today.  When we, as a democracy, give the privilege of limited liability, what do we expect back?  To understand that, we must look at from where it came.  It came from a time when conducting financial transactions was based on the honour system.  If somebody deliberately conducted business fraudulently, it was a capital offence.  That was the case in Genoa, Barcelona and all the centres of trade and commerce in the Middle Ages.</P>
        <P>To get away from that savage era when people were hanged outside their financial offices and at a time when usury was a mortal sin in the Christian churches, we developed limited liability.  Limited liability is a gift we give people but it has stopped being that.  People now believe they can set up a company with limited liability and that they cannot be held responsible for anything beyond the means of the company etc.  Why do we allow someone to set up a company, take money from people and trade in a democracy?  We do so on the basis of trust.</P>
        <P>What is required is that the directors of a company put in place the structure to ensure they comply with the laws of the land.  The first argument against that was that people would have to check out health and safety, bullying, environmental issues and so on.  In 2002-03, people were not sure.  There is not one person on either side of this House who would have an ounce of sympathy for a company dumping dangerous chemicals in a place it should not, as happened in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  We would hold people responsible for that.  We would not jail the directors but we would ask if the directors knew or, if they did not know, why they did not know and who knew.</P>
        <P>I will not go into that issue because I am talking about revenue, tax and company law today.  I am touching on the other issues into which one could go.  There is a view that company directors believe they are not responsible for anything.  I do not know for what they are responsible if they are not responsible for telling me they are compliant with the law of the land and that they have put a structure in place.</P>
        <P>Two months ago there were discussions about auditors in the Members&rsquo; bar, in the Houses and in pubs.  What were auditors doing?  As I said to the Minister on Committee Stage, the business of auditing is not the business of being a bloodhound but of being a watchdog.  The auditor watches for things.  One cannot stop fraud.  If people want to act fraudulently, they will find a way.  That is not what this is about.  This is about allowing honest people to ensure their company conducts its affairs honestly and compliantly and that there is a level playing pitch for everybody.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage, Senator Callely commented on heavy regulation and it irritated me.  In retrospect, I probably over-reacted in the point I made but we have had enough light touch regulation.  I have always been in the middle in this argument.  I do not like heavy regulation nor do I like light touch regulation.  The regulation should meet the needs and no more.  It should be fit for purpose and no more.  It should be easily and properly met.  For instance, the level of regulation on Members of the Houses in terms of the list of things we must fill out each January is too much but we are stuck with it and we get on with it.</P>
        <P>I want company directors and the Minister of State to remember the outrage about offshore accounts.  In the late 1980s, people tightened their belts only to find there were millions of pounds in offshore accounts even though they were told there was no money in <Col N="887"/>the country.  They should also remember the outrage a couple of months ago.  All I ask is that directors put in place a structure which will do the business as far as they know, that they take reports so many times in the past year, that they review the structure in the past year and that they ask auditors to ensure that is done.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill but one of the flaws in it is that it comes under the American influence of being rules based.  This legislation deals with loans to directors.  As I said on Second Stage, I come from the county of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell and we are very good at giving a different name to the same thing, which is what company law does all the time.  There are various ways to give money to people other than by way of loans.  I believe people will get around this.  People must act honourably.</P>
        <P>The system in this country, the UK and most of Europe is principles based.  Put in simple terms, people must act honestly, must make decisions on that basis and must be compliant.  There are 24,000 rules in the American system and they tick the box if they have followed every one of them.  None of the rules refers to what happens when an elephant walks into the front office because that is not expected.  That is what happened in the case of Enron.  The legislation brought in after the Enron disaster in the US was the Surbanes-Oxley Act under which the chief finance officer and, I believe, the chief executive officer can be committed to jail for not doing the things about which I am talking but it is done on the basis of rules.</P>
        <P>I ask that the company director looks at what he or she has done in the past year and states that he or she is confident that something fit for purpose has been put in place which will do the business, that he or she has checked and reviewed it, he or she has got reports and he or she is signing off on it on that basis.  The company&rsquo;s external auditor also signs off on it.  If that was put in place, with all the other issues dealt with in the 2003 and 1990 Acts, including internal auditors, audit committees and the role of independent directors, one would have in place something that works.</P>
        <P>Two or three months ago, the auditor of a bank appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs.  That is what led to the row in 2000 about the offshore accounts.  The internal auditor of AIB was not listened to, was sacked and lost his reputation.  I thought I would never again see a situation where an internal auditor of a large bank would come before a committee to say he was not listened to.  That reflects a weakness in the legislation for which I take responsibility.  We looked at the legislation at the time and thought we had closed the loopholes but clearly we did not do that.</P>
        <P>The issues I have put before the House have arisen from our previous experience with offshore accounts, including the importance of limited liability and light touch regulation.  I say to Senator Callely, in particular &mdash; perhaps this is a better articulated response than that which I made to his Second Stage speech &mdash; that I am not asking people to fill out a load of forms.  I ask that people say they have been to ten directors&rsquo; meetings in the past year, that they have put something in place, that they believe it works and that they are signing off on it.  That is neither light touch nor heavy touch regulation.</P>
        <P>One of the arguments made against such a system is that it would require the engagement of an entire sheaf of consultants.  That is what the &ldquo;big five&rdquo; companies have claimed, and that it will thus cost billions of euro to implement.  If it takes an external person to come in to tell the director how well he or she is performing, then he or she is not performing well.  I am a director of a company.  I spent an hour and a half this morning dealing with a report to me and the chairman of the company, taking us through some of the issues we have just discussed.  We were satisfied with what we heard.  This does not mean we could not have been misled by somebody, but that is not the issue.  The point is that we followed a process to ensure we were compliant, we are satisfied with the outcome and are signing<Col N="888"/> off on it.  This is not about a process of form-filling.  It is not about engaging consultants to tell me I am compliant with the law of the land.  The structures which we as directors have put in place should be structures which will deliver compliance so long as everybody concerned acts honourably.  We have checked that and gone through it.</P>
        <P>What I am proposing is what emerged from the audit review group, of which I was chairman, which was established by the Committee of Public Accounts following the controversy regarding offshore accounts.  What I am proposing was put forward in the report to the Committee of Public Accounts in 2002, and it is what emerged in the 2003 legislation in its original form before being softened.  Bank directors were able to play ducks and drakes with the legislation last year.  My amendment encompasses the proposal put forward by the Director of Corporate Enforcement to the company law review group.  The latter was in a previous life the boss of the secretariat when I chaired the Committee of Public Accounts.  He has been through the system on all sides.  He worked at an earlier stage in the same role as the adviser seated directly behind the Minister of State and held various other positions within the Department.  He is on the board of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, as am I.  My proposal mirrors exactly his proposal to the company law review group, because I would not attempt to second guess the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>I conclude by offering some advice to the Minister of State, without wishing to be smart.  If I were being grilled in front of a committee, court or elsewhere in the future about what was done to tackle these issues, I would like to be able to say that I followed the advice of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in order to safeguard the interest of the public.  I ask the Minister of State to accept my proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s contribution.  He asked why the Minister of State does not simply proceed to implement the advice of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Just because a person in authority, whether the Director of Corporate Enforcement or otherwise, says we should do something, that alone is not sufficient reason for doing so.</P>
        <P>In the course of his contribution, Senator O&rsquo;Toole eloquently put forward a support base for his proposal.  He spoke about the aftermath of events at Enron in 2002 and urged that we be proactive.  I support his view in this regard.  If this proposal has been on the table since 2002, what consideration has it received since then and why has no amendment been made to incorporate it into legislation?  I read a newspaper editorial in recent days which made the case that Ministers should make decisions rather than seek reports.  I understand the company law review group is due to report but I am not sure whether that means it will be in three months or 18 months.  I do not know how long the issue has been under consideration and when it is likely to report.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct that when the entire financial debacle surrounding Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent emerged, there was a general view among the public that some of those involved in what was seen as shady and unethical behaviour should have been taken out in handcuffs.  I will not go into that in detail today.  I understand there is a quite senior Minister who is somewhat saddened that she made a comment on one occasion about a former senior Irish officeholder being put behind bars.  As a consequence of her statements, that person probably avoided what may or may not have been his deserved fate.  We must be cautious when we talk of people who have allegedly done wrong.  There must be due process.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about earlier, draconian times when people who did wrong were hung outside their doors.<Col N="889"/>  He went on to speak about limited liability and the benefit of this to company directors.  If I understood the Senator correctly, he seemed to suggest that limited liability affords company directors <i>carte blanche</i> in respect of financial burdens, compliance or the law of the land.  That is not my understanding of limited liability.  Many directors have found that while it may have offered some level of protection in the past, it has, more recently, been of little use.  I am sure Senator O&rsquo;Toole is aware that limited liability might in the past have given company directors a certain comfort regarding bank loans, for example.  Now, however, they are usually requested by financial institutions to provide personal guarantees in this regard.  I make this point because Senator O&rsquo;Toole seemed to indicate there was a certain blessing for company directors in regard to their responsibilities.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify this in his response.</P>
        <P>In general, the argument made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole merits consideration, particularly in light of the position in which we find ourselves following recent experiences in financial circles.  The Minister of State is as aware as any of us that there is great annoyance among the general public at what is perceived to be wrongdoing by senior players in financial institutions.  Congratulations are due to the Minister for Finance in bringing pressure to bear in influencing the former chief executive officer of one particular building society to surrender a bonus payment in the region of &euro;1 million.  However, that development was achieved as a result of leverage as opposed to the use of a legislative mechanism.</P>
        <P>While canvassing during the recent election campaign, I obtained from members of the public an impression that they were annoyed with the former chief executive of a particular financial institution, which has been nationalised.  It was clear that they were also annoyed with the pension payments made to the former chief executives of building societies or whatever.  However, they are equally annoyed that huge amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money is being used to bail out the banks.  People are aware that this money does not relate to one individual.  They are also aware that it is not a question of responsibilities, compliance etc. and that it is a much broader issue.  If we were to discuss the issue of compliance, members of the public would probably sign up to the proposal Senator O&rsquo;Toole has put forward.</P>
        <P>In my capacity as an elected local public representative, for a number of years I was a member of a board and that board received a breviate from the financial controller which contained the information he felt it was appropriate to provide.  Other information was also relayed to board members by various other professionals &mdash; those operating in the areas of technical support, health and safety or whatever.  The board members received those reports and, in the hope that they were factual and correct, adopted them accordingly.  Very little of the information in those reports was challenged and perhaps there were not many board members who were qualified to make such challenges.  People might have been qualified to challenge information relating to particular aspects but they may not have been in a position to challenge the reports to which I refer in their entirety.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I wholeheartedly support a great deal of what he said during his contribution and I look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister of State may have to say in reply.  However, we must consider how we might deal with some of the issues that will arise as a result of legislation that will have to be introduced to deal with other matters.  This is an extremely complex subject.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I may have expressed different opinions on Committee Stage but I am inclined to sign up to what he is proposing now, particularly if this can be achieved.  It will be interesting to hear what the Minister of State has to say with regard to the deliberations of the company law review group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Senators on the comments they made in respect of this matter.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole<Col N="890"/> tabled amendments on this matter on Committee Stage.  As promised at that point, the T&aacute;naiste reflected on the inclusion of a provision in the Bill to require that directors&rsquo; compliance statements be provided.  Section 45 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 provided for the insertion of sections 205C and 205F into the Companies Act 1990.  This would have imposed such a requirement on certain companies, namely, all public limited companies and large private companies with a turnover of greater than &euro;15.2 million and a balance sheet of greater than &euro;7.5 million.  Following the enactment, this provision was not commenced pending the preparation of guidance as to how the requirements could be complied with.  During the development of this guidance, which was led by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, differing views emerged with regard to the obligations to be imposed and the procedures that would be required to comply with the provisions.  This gave rise to concerns in respect of the potential cost of compliance.</P>
        <P>This matter was discussed, including in the context of the proposals put forward by the Director of Corporate Enforcement, by the company law review group and differing views were expressed.  Eventually, it was the majority view of the company law review group that was accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State indicating that the provision to which he refers was never initiated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not as if it was never discussed.  It was discussed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it ever initiated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator inquiring if it has been commenced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it has not been commenced.  The company law review group was requested to examine the matter.  Its report of July 2005, which included a detailed cost benefit analysis and a screening regulatory impact assessment, resulted in the majority of the review group recommending a requirement for the provision of mitigated directors&rsquo; compliance statements.  One of the dissenting voices in respect of this recommendation was that of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who questioned some of the assumptions put forward by the majority of the group and who proposed an alternative provision.  The latter retained more of the elements of provision relating to directors&rsquo; compliance statements originally put forward in the 2003 Act than contained in the recommendation advocated by the majority of the company law review group.</P>
        <P>The matter was then considered by the Government, which decided in late 2005, on the recommendation of the then Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to accept the proposal put forward by the majority of the company law review group.  The Government also decided that the provision should be included in the company law consolidation and reform Bill.  As Senators are aware, a massive project is being undertaken in the Department at present in respect of that Bill.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste indicated on Committee Stage that this was the approach she had decided to pursue.  From Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s perspective, unfortunately that is still the course we intend to follow.  I urge him to accept our bona fides when I inform him that we are conscious of the points he is making.  However, the company law review group has discussed this matter and a decision on how to proceed has been made by the Government.  In consultation with the OCDE, it has been acknowledge<Col N="891"/>d that the Government, in conjunction with the Oireachtas, will be obliged to decide on the introduction of legislation.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department have been in contact with the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who accepts that it is a matter for the Government to decide when it should legislate and that it should do so at a time of its choosing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a major statement on the part of the director.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Has something changed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>We took the Senator&rsquo;s views on board and they were discussed and brought to the attention of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who accepts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Who accepts the Government&rsquo;s right to legislate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a matter for Government to legislate.  The director also confirmed that his proposals to seek amendment of certain provisions in Parts 2 and 3 of the Companies Act 1990, which form the main part of the Bill before the House, arose directly from a number of specific weaknesses in the current legislation.  The latter were brought sharply into focus by current investigations and, in the view of the director, they require urgent attention in order not to hamper the ODCE&rsquo;s further investigative capacities.  In light of this, it is intended to proceed as originally decided.  As a result, we will be dealing with the matter in the context of the company law consolidation and reform Bill.</P>
        <P>There is another issue of which we must be conscious.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to limited liability.  Such liability is a privilege which is afforded not only to directors but also to shareholders.  Most directors are also shareholders.  I was not present for the Committee Stage debate but appropriate regulation is required.  If there is to be an increase in regulation to ensure that everything is acceptable, it must not be heavy regulation but rather appropriate regulation.  Regardless of the importance of this House, I am of the view that Members may speak freely with regard to Enron because there is a good chance that said company would not be able to use what they might say to avoid prosecutions elsewhere.  However, we must be sensitive in our comments on credit institutions in this State.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, these matters were discussed by society in general.  However, we must be extremely careful when discussing specifics.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept this amendment but Senator O&rsquo;Toole appreciates we intend to bring forward mitigated proposals in the context of reform of company legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the response.  I accept the Minister of State spoke to a number of people and gave it some thought.  The Minister of State and Senator Callely referred to limited liability and I want to clarify why it is a gift and a privilege.  It is not just because of the limited nature of the liability.  It exists to encourage entrepreneurship.  If I am running a company I may decide to advance and develop the company by taking a risk that might go wrong and cost a lot of money.  By ensuring I can still do this without losing my house and everything behind me, limited liability ensures entrepreneurs and companies can develop without being put personally at risk beyond the limited liability of the company.  It is crucial and I would be the first to defend it.</P>
        <P>We had to deal with this in the 1990 Act.  In the late 1980s, the equivalent of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; produced a number of programmes on companies closing and setting up with a similar name or the same address where they were clearly the same entity.  We introduced the concept of reckless trading to ensure limited liability was protected.  This is an example for Senator Callely.  We have dealt with this on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely asked a question, which is why I interrupted the Minister of State, for which I apologise.  Very wisely and logically, Senator C<Col N="892"/>allely asked why we did not amend this measure if it had been in place since 2002 and was not working.  The answer is that it was recommended in 2002, introduced into the Bill in 2003, passed by the Houses at the end of 2003 but has never been commenced.  That is disgraceful.  The reason is that certain members of the groups referred to by the Minister of State used their influence quietly to block the measure.  What I suggest is what was proposed by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, recommended by the audit review group and accepted by the Committee of Public Accounts of these Houses.  That is the validation of my amendment.</P>
        <P>Why should we listen to the Director of Corporate Enforcement?  The only person mentioned in the Long Title of this Bill is the Director of Corporate Enforcement because the Bill gives him additional powers.  The director would not thank me if the record showed his response as being that he agreed the Government was entitled to legislate.  I would be doing him a disservice.  I refer to what he said when asked a question by the Company Law Review Group, which I understand is still his view.  He stated: &ldquo;as the body responsible for encouraging compliance with company law including the preparation of books of account which give a &lsquo;true and fair&rsquo; view of a company&rsquo;s state of affairs, the ODCE finds unacceptable a proposal which omits reporting on obligations &lsquo;that may materially affect the company&rsquo;s financial statements&rsquo;&rdquo;.  That is what he says; nothing could be clearer.</P>
        <P>If Senator Callely receives representations on this, part of the argument will be based on the cost.  Senator Callely&rsquo;s example was good.  A person who is a director of a company approves the books when they come in.  Prior to that, the finance sub-committee of the board, two of which I chair, or the audit committee will have ensured the structures are in place to ensure the books are right.  We still cannot stop fraud, however.  There must be trust and confidence and one way to build that is by taking decisions.</P>
        <P>The big companies will say they will need teams of consultants to comply.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement has responded to that point by stating: &ldquo;the proposal that a company may rely, at the directors&rsquo; discretion, on internal or external advisers to help secure compliance is unnecessary&rdquo;.  That would be heavy regulation and there is an attempt to present it as that.  Company directors make their judgments as they see fit.</P>
        <P>The Director of Corporate Enforcement states: &ldquo;the provision for auditor review of the directors compliance statement has been entirely deleted&rdquo;.  This does not refer to the legislation we are debating but to a Bill proposed for the spring.  The reason is that the ODCE states:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he proposal that a company has in place &lsquo;appropriate arrangements or structures&rsquo; to secure compliance is unclear. It appears possible that an appropriate &lsquo;structure&rsquo; can be independent of any arrangements or procedures for securing compliance and that it could be a designated compliance officer[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is why he is opposed to it, as well as the fact that: &ldquo;the proposed definition of &lsquo;material compliance&rsquo; no longer requires that the &lsquo;arrangements or structures&rsquo; in place must be reasonably effective&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The answer to the question posed is that a person can say they have put in place something they believe is effective and they can give various reasons for that belief.  In effect, this is about acting honestly.  That person may be wrong but it does not commit them to jail or to handcuffs, in the words of the Minister of State, if they have acted honestly and honourably.  I do not want to be misrepresented as trying to bury, hang or jail company directors.  I want them to act honourably, openly and easily, and to say they have done their job, examined the results and are satisfied they are compliant.  They might be wrong but only if we find out they knew<Col N="893"/> something that was material, such as a director receiving &euro;110 million, would they be in trouble.</P>
        <P>I refer to the consolidated Bill, with 1,250 sections.  No doubt it is growing by the day and will get bigger and bigger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is shrinking.  We are consolidating legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The last time we tried to do that was in 1990.  I was a Member of this House on the occasion and it took so long that we had to come back in the middle of the summer to pass sections 7 and 8 dealing with the beef business.  The adviser to the Minister of State, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, states: &ldquo;the inclusion of the CLRG proposal as part of the planned consolidation of the Companies Acts would be likely to give rise to substantial delay given the size of the new Bill&rdquo;.  He wants it done now.  We have done all that.</P>
        <P>My amendment raises the threshold so that some small and medium-sized enterprises are not required to do this.  It is only for larger companies.  This makes it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>We had great discussions on the job done and not done by the Financial Regulator.  There was much misinformation about the regulator who became the scapegoat and whipping boy.  In a radio interview, the Green Party spokesperson on finance gave the example that the regulator did not act to block 110% mortgages.  I challenged him on this afterwards.  He and I, as well as any of us who cared to read the legislation, know the reason for this was very simple.  We never gave the regulator the power to do that.  We absolutely and determinedly prevented the regulator from interfering with any financial product on sale.  It could speak about it and give advice and guidance but it could not block such products.</P>
        <P>There were people on both sides of both Houses, from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour and Independent backgrounds, talking about the regulator not doing its job.  When the business came through the House five or ten years ago, we did not follow it through.  Representatives from the regulator&rsquo;s office came before the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs and we had all the hard men from the D&aacute;il and Seanad flexing their muscles and having a go at these public servants one way or another for what they did or did not do right.  I sent this to the committee two weeks ago and told it that this was what was wanted to force the directors to say they were compliant, or take action to be compliant.  It would also ensure that auditors of companies make sure a true and fair reflection is made.</P>
        <P>I am asking that directors of banks and other places say at the end of a year that during the course of the year they put in place the proper structures adequate to ensure they were compliant with revenue and tax laws, that the company traded properly and clearly, and that anything which is important is reflected in the accounts.  That did not happen with Anglo Irish Bank.  This is a way in which such action can be blocked.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has not objected to the points I have made but he has said he will not accept the amendment.  Perhaps it will be like St. Augustine&rsquo;s prayer, and he will say &ldquo;not yet&rdquo;.  He may accept it in the spring or some time close to that.  If the amendment is good it should be implemented now.  There were three groups with a problem, including the company law review group and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>I have put a proposal to the Minister of State and Government, on the same side as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which is there for the people to ensure bankers and others act honourably and carefully or go to jail if they do not, and I am having trouble convincing people.  Are we on the same planet at all?  I cannot understand why the Minister of State will not accept a very simple proposal.</P>
        <P>I will go back to where I began.  Limited liability in a company, company directorship and the business of trading is something that must be done honourably and fairly.  We must not fetter entrepreneurship and we shoul<Col N="894"/>d not put significant burdens on honourable people.  I do not know one honourable, decent company director who would feel threatened by putting his or her hand up at the end of the year and saying the company acted in compliance with the laws of the land, paid its taxes and would sign off on that basis.  This is written into the pertinent section of the 2003 Act.  One cannot blame an auditor for failing to come to a conclusion on information that was not made available but we can blame the people who did not make the material available in the first place.</P>
        <P>What comes from the company law review group, although it may not be the intention, means that a company could get Joe O&rsquo;Toole to be a compliance officer in the same way that a company has an FOI, bullying or safety officer.  The matter could then be dumped with such a person.  We cannot do that as we live in a democracy and we want to ensure company directors act honourably, observe the law, pay their taxes and do what ordinary people are asking.</P>
        <P>There will be no report on this discussion.  We could have a media that looked closely at what was going on in the world but the Government is lucky there are not financial correspondents to look at what I am saying.  I could not imagine one interested commentator anywhere disagreeing with what I propose.  I regret the Minister of State will not accept my proposal, although I will not detain the House longer.  I have rehearsed, replayed, restated and re-enacted my points, which are on the record.  I propose that the amendment be accepted.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to reflect on Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal to amend section 5 by inserting new subsections 2(F) and 2(G) into section 20 of the Companies Act 1990.  The essence of the proposal was to introduce timelines within which terminations and separations should be made once the proposed new extended powers of seizure had been employed. Contributors from all sides of the House supported such an approach during the Committee Stage debate.  These timeframes also are the essence of the amendment I propose today and, in common with the amendment proposed by Fine Gael, the Government amendments provide for the following time limits.  There will be three months to decide on the materiality of seized information and to separate material information from immaterial information.  In addition, there will be seven days to return records which are found to be immaterial to the party from whom they were taken.  Each of these time limits could be extended or reduced by the court.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Members will note the amendment also contains some additional features designed to ensure further the extended power of seizure operates effectively.  Specifically, the proposed new subsection 2(I) provides for a specific right to adjust the prescribed timeframes by means of a ministerial regulation.  It also will be noted that the directions that may be given by the court are spelled out in greater detail in the proposed new subsection 2(G).  I believe this will be helpful to any court in the consideration of such applications as it might be asked to consider.  Moreover, Members will note this subsection provides that before giving directions, the court shall have particular regard to any submissions made on behalf of the Director of Corporate Enforcement with regard to the progress of his investigations.  A court direction order for return of records to the person from whom they were seized under this subsection also may include a condition allowing the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to retake and retain possession of those records during a specific subsequent period.  In other words, maximum flexibility is provided to the court in respect of the directions it can give.</P>
        <P>Members also will note that the proposed new subsection 2(H) includes the ability for the court to hear matters other than in public.  This could be especially important when the content of confidential company information is being discussed.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes a new subsection 2(J), which will retain the ability of the Minister to make regulations to address any supplementary, consequential or incidental matters as may arise in the operation of these new provisions.  I commend these amendments to the House.</P>
        <P>The Government gave a commitment on Committee Stage that it would take on board the views that were being expressed by Fine Gael.  While these amendments have gone further, they also incorporate everything that was requested by Fine Gael.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the House and thank him and his colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, for the spirit of co-operation that has endured throughout the debate on this legislation.  Fine Gael welcomes the amendment that seeks to attach greater urgency to the process whereby documents are separated and decisions are taken as to what documentation is incriminating and what is not.  It also welcomes the inclusion of the three-month limit because the party was concerned the phrase, &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;, somehow left it open-ended.  People&rsquo;s past experiences of dealing with public bodies suggested that efficiency and urgency in dealing with certain issues was not always a hallmark of such bodies.  Fine Gael is pleased with this three-month limit as well as the seven-day limit that will be imposed upon the director&rsquo;s office in returning material that is deemed not to be incriminating.</P>
        <P>I also suggest that Fine Gael&rsquo;s concern in respect of the Data Protection Acts has been addressed somewhat by these amendments in that they allow, in some cases, hearings to take place away from public scrutiny.  Fine Gael had expressed concerns that sensitive personal information held in company records might inadvertently find its way into the public domain.  Again, the amendment proposed by the Government in this regard goes a long way towards addressing this and I again thank the Minister of State.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(vii) the rights of any person who is the subject of the information under the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The issue of concern to the Fine Gael Party is that sensitive data held within company records could inadvertently find its way into the public domain.  On Committee Stage, the T&aacute;naiste undertook to have this matter examined and to bring it back to the House.  I await with interest the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>During the Committee Stage debate, the T&aacute;naiste informed Senator Cannon that she would consider further his comments on the data protection rights attached to information seized by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, under the extended power of seizure mechanism provided for in section 5.  In further examination of this matter, the views of the ODCE and the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s office were elicited to ensure no inadvertent consequences arose from this Bill.  I am informed the Data Protection Acts recognise that data, which would otherwise enjoy protection under those Acts, can be obtained by authorities whe<Col N="897"/>re this is necessary for enforcing compliance with statutory codes.  This would include record-seizing powers available to the ODCE when investigating breaches of the Companies Acts.</P>
        <P>Obviously the amendments discussed previously bring clarity to the issue raised earlier by the Senator.  I acknowledge the extended power of seizure being given to the ODCE in this Bill is wide-ranging and could have the effect of allowing it to seize documents that later may prove to contain personal information that is irrelevant to its investigations.  I assume that a fear such information somehow might be disclosed is the basis for Senator Cannon&rsquo;s concerns.  In general, the previously discussed amendments, in the context of the Data Protection Acts, address the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.</P>

While it is primarily technical legislation, it is very important.  I am new to the position of having responsibility for trade and commerce but the Government likes to be co-operative.  When ideas come from the Opposition or Government sides in Seanad debates, they genuinely are taken back into the Department and officials are asked to consider Senators&rsquo; views or concerns.

Together with him, I congratulate the team from his Department who accompanied him, my colleagues who participated and the Seanad support staff. Senator O&rsquo;Toole <Col N="899"/>made a very interesting point about compliance in the context of this legislation.  Perhaps the Department will consider keeping those of us who have been involved in today&rsquo;s debate informed about how this issue, which has prompted many things to happen in recent times, is being addressed.  One would question why the argument made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole cannot be accommodated at this time.  We all recognise that there are usually very good reasons for that.  The comment made by the Director of Corporate Enforcement needs to be considered.  I am sure there are balancing arguments on the other side.  We should not be getting into this type of debate at this stage because we have already had it.  I would like to be kept informed of what is being done in the compliance area.  I am sure Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Cannon will agree with me when I say that the Department should take note of that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>A few weeks ago, we started to try to strike a good balance between conferring on the Director of Corporate Enforcement the sort of powers he needs to do his job correctly and ensuring that those who get involved in entrepreneurial effort in this country &mdash; people who become company directors, for example &mdash; do not encounter disincentives.  I think that balance has been almost achieved at this stage.  It was my first time to be involved in the shepherding of a Bill through the Seanad and I enjoyed the process immensely.  I found it interesting and enlightening.  I congratulate the Government on showing such major co-operation.  I look forward to seeing further activity of this nature in the future.</P>

    <Title>Aviation (Preclearance) Bill 2009: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this Bill is to give legal effect to a landmark intergovernmental agreement reached last November between Ireland and the United States of America on air transport preclearance.  Air transport preclearance means passengers of US-bound flights from Ireland can be fully cleared for entry to the United States in respect of all necessary US controls and checks, including US immigration, customs, agriculture and security checks, prior to departure.  This will allow aircraft to land at an extended range of US airports and will facilitate easy onward connectivity to all points within the United States.  This is a significant development for Irish aviation.  As well as improving the passen<Col N="900"/>ger experience for those travelling to the US, preclearance should over time contribute significantly to growth in travel to the US and to the growth of new business for Irish airports as airlines take advantage of unique opportunities arising from access to a wider range of airports in the US.  Preclearance for commercial aircraft is due to commence at Shannon on 29 July next and for private aircraft there in September.  Preclearance is due to be introduced at Dublin Airport when terminal 2 opens next year.</P>
        <P>It is understood the US authorities have no plans to introduce similar facilities elsewhere in Europe.  This provides Irish airports with a unique marketing opportunity in attracting airlines and creating new business in the key transatlantic aviation market.  Under this legislation, and no other, US preclearance officers in Ireland will be empowered to carry out their duties in dealing with requests for entry into the United States.  In other words, the only powers to be exercised by preclearance officers at Dublin and Shannon airports will derive from this legislation only and will only be exercisable within clearly defined preclearance areas.  Other powers assigned to preclearance officers in the United States are derived from US law but of course these are not exercisable in Ireland in the performance of preclearance duties.</P>
        <P>The preclearance agreement with the US, on which this legislation is based, has been drafted in close co-operation with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure it is consistent with the Irish Constitution.  Accordingly, the laws of Ireland, and of no other country, will apply at all times in the preclearance facility and the various preclearance areas and the only powers that can be exercised by a preclearance officer are those created by Oireachtas na h&Eacute;ireann under this legislation.</P>
        <P>The transatlantic aviation market is of enormous strategic, economic and cultural importance to Ireland but it has to be recognised that the ongoing global recession and high aviation fuel costs are having a seriously negative impact on the industry.  Consumer demand for air travel has fallen sharply and transatlantic traffic is being hit particularly hard this year.  The challenge will be to ensure that Irish aviation is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it comes.  It is in this context that the full potential of preclearance can be realised and that includes the promotion of Irish airports as hubs for in-transit preclearance.  Already there have been a number of outside expressions of interest in preclearance.  In particular, British Airways has announced that it is considering a business class only service from London City Airport to the US with a stopover at Shannon, precisely for the purpose of taking advantage of the preclearance services there.  Preclearance is also being introduced at Shannon for private US bound aircraft from September next.  In line with the interest shown by commercial aviation, we can expect an increase in private and business aircraft routing through Shannon to take advantage of preclearance.  All additional aircraft routing through Shannon will have a positive commercial impact on the airport and the surrounding region.</P>
        <P>Preclearance is the process whereby all inspection and clearance requirements under US laws for travellers arriving into the US are carried out at the departing airport.  Such passengers arriving at US airports are then processed without further official contact.  On arrival at the US airport they will have a status similar to that of passengers arriving from another US airport.  For passengers the benefits are that they are processed through all US entry procedures before they travel, knowing that when they arrive at their destination they will have an uninterrupted passage through the US airport.  In addition, passengers will be able to travel onward to other US destinations, while remaining airside thereby obviating the need for further security and baggage checks.  The airport authority will be able to market its airport as a hub for US bound flights having these preclearance advantages.  This service is not on offer to any other European county.</P>
        <P>Under this legislation preclearance officers of the US customs and border protection service will be authorised to carry out certain func<Col N="901"/>tions at designated preclearance areas of Irish airports in respect of passengers and aircraft bound for the US that would otherwise be carried out on arrival in the US.  The functions of preclearance officers in Ireland shall include the inspection of individuals and their goods and aircraft, the searching of individuals, with the assistance of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in certain circumstances, and the holding of individuals, where the circumstances warrant it, pending the arrival of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who would then take charge.  Where, during the course of an inspection, a preclearance officer discovers an item the possession of which constitutes an offence under Irish law the officer would seek the assistance of an Irish law enforcement officer.</P>
        <P>If a situation arises where goods need to be seized, they shall be seized by an Irish law enforcement officer.  The Bill makes provision for a right of appeal in situations where goods have been seized.  The necessary preclearance facilities will be provided by the airport authority and the costs recovered from the participating airlines through a passenger charge.  When negotiating the agreement, both sides saw the merit in not including in the agreement the details of operational procedures for the practical implementation of preclearance on the ground.  It was decided these would be negotiated separately between the parties and agreed before implementing preclearance.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides for the interpretation of the Act.  Section 2 enables the Minister to make regulations designating preclearance areas at the airports.  In such areas US preclearance officers would be able to undertake necessary procedures to grant preclearance to passengers seeking entry to the US and necessary security safeguards would be implemented.  The airport authority, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Revenue Commissioners would be consulted before the making of such regulations.</P>
        <P>Section 3 outlines the duties and responsibilities of travellers in the preclearance area such as an obligation to provide an accurate written declaration of all goods and complying with the lawful requirements of an Irish law enforcement officer or a preclearance officer.  Failure to adhere to such obligations constitutes an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides the traveller with a right to withdraw from the preclearance area at any time subject to certain exceptions relating to threatening or obstructive behaviour by the traveller or where a person is suspected of committing an offence under Irish law.  Section 5 outlines the functions of preclearance officers when processing applications for preclearance, including powers to search a traveller and his goods with his consent and to search a person and his goods in the preclearance area without warrant when suspected of posing an immediate threat.  Preclearance officers may also detain a person or private aircraft where an offence is suspected and forthwith deliver that person or private aircraft into the custody of an Irish law enforcement officer to be dealt with in accordance with Irish law.</P>
        <P>Subject to subsection 5(4), preclearance officers may also detain goods, which are not accurately declared by a traveller and forthwith deliver them to an Irish law enforcement officer for the purposes of sections 8 to 10 of the Bill, which deal with a special procedure for seizure and detention of goods to be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Under section 5(5) preclearance officers, as a condition for the grant of preclearance, may require the traveller to pay a sum of money that would be payable by that traveller on postclearance in respect of any particular goods or to surrender the goods.</P>
        <P>Section 6 sets out the functions of Irish law enforcement officers in the preclearance area where a person is suspected of making a false declaration of goods or is in possession of goods that are controlled or prohibited in the State or if the person is suspected of otherwise posing a threat to persons in the preclear<Col N="902"/>ance area.  An Irish law enforcement officer may search the person without warrant and detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out the search subject to certain provisions.  An Irish law enforcement officer may examine, seize or detain anything found in the course of the search that might be required as evidence in a prosecution.  Section 6(6) provides that the powers granted under section 6 shall not prejudice other powers exercised by Irish law enforcement officers to search, seize or detain any goods.</P>
        <P>Section 7 restricts entry into the preclearance area to preclearance officers, travellers and other authorised personnel.  It also sets out the powers of preclearance officers and Irish law enforcement officers in the interest of security and the proper functioning of the preclearance area.  It also empowers those officers to request a person to leave the preclearance area in certain circumstances.  A person who contravenes these provisions shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
        <P>Sections 8 to 10, inclusive, provide for the seizure of goods not declared or falsely declared, procedures for making a claim to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of goods seized and procedures to be followed by the Revenue Commissioners in the event of the seizure of goods and the processing of claims by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides that the responsibility for costs incurred in respect of travellers refused preclearance are to be borne by the air carrier.  The air carrier may recoup the costs from the traveller.  Section 12 clarifies the status of in-transit preclearance travellers under the Aliens Act 1935 and the Immigration Act 2004.</P>
        <P>Section 13 provides for the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States who are assigned to carry out preclearance functions in the State under this Act.  In line with article IV(4) of the agreement, section 13(6) enables any person to sue the Minister, who would be precluded from suing the US authorities because of the immunity granted under this section.</P>
        <P>Section 14 empowers an airport authority to charge fees to air carriers availing of preclearance.  Section 15 is a standard provision relating to the power of the Minister to incur expenses in the administration of the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 16 gives the Minister the power to make general regulations as necessary to give effect to the Act and agreement and make regulations to ensure the integrity, security and proper functioning of preclearance areas.  Sections 17 and 18 provide for the offences and penalties to be applied under the Act.</P>
        <P>Sections 19 to 21, inclusive, provide for the repeal of the Air Navigation and Transport (Preinspection) Act 1986, a minor amendment to the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and for the short title and commencement of the Act.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not have significant financial or staffing implications for the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The potential for job creation and long-term economic benefits for Ireland contained in this Bill are obvious.  preclearance will present the industry with an opportunity to grow business in such a key international gateway for the country.  While the immediate challenge will be to weather the current recession, I firmly believe that all international airlines, including Aer Lingus, will fully embrace this unique opportunity to grow their business over the long term.  This is an important development for our State airports, particularly Shannon Airport where preclearance will be introduced a full year ahead of Dublin.  I urge the airport authorities to fully utilise this unique marketing advantage.</P>
        <P>Good international air access is a key factor in mitigating the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s peripheral location, in particular that of the west of Ireland.  This is even more important now in times of recession.  Growth in air transport links has played a significant part in our economic success since the mid-1990s.  I firmly believe that this initiative will help ensure that air transport pl<Col N="903"/>ays an even greater role in our economic recovery in the future.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this legislation.  As the Minister said, it is a legislative change that is very much to be welcomed.  I agree with his concluding remarks that during times of great economic difficulty, such as those in which we find ourselves, there is no single silver bullet remedy that will release us from them.  Achieving that will require the implementation of a suite of measures, each of which, individually, might not deliver a great deal but when implemented together would deliver the effect we seek.  I have no doubt our tourism industry will consider this to be a meaningful measure that will help to boost the competitive advantage of our country in terms of attracting tourists and passengers. </P>
        <P>I will focus on five questions concerning the legislation and two questions on its operation, particularly within the relevant airports.  I emphasise I pose these questions in the context that this legislation is a welcome initiative that will make a difference in attracting tourists and passengers to this country.</P>
        <P>My questions relate to the role of preclearance officers and to sections 13 to 15, inclusive.  My first question is a simple one, namely, will preclearance officers be allowed to carry weapons in preclearance areas?  This is not stated as a fact and is not identified in the legislation.  Through this discussion we are beginning to understand how the legislation will operate.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether any of the personnel in question will carry weapons on Irish soil or in the preclearance area.</P>
        <P>My second question relates to section 13(1) which specifies that the preclearance officer shall be a national of the United State and assigned and posted to the State.  Is it necessary that the people who will perform the role of  preclearance officers must be American nationals?  People who work in these airports are local people who would be aware of the importance of the preclearance area to the airport and to the broader region.  I want clarification as to whether it is specified in this section that people who will perform this role need to be nationals of the United States.  That appears to be the case from this section, but I would like the Minister to clarify that.</P>
        <P>Section 13(5) provides that all documents that would be used within the preclearance area would be regarded as archives kept at a consulate within the meaning of the Consular Conventions Act 1954.  Does that mean that any of the decisions made in this area or paperwork in this respect would be exempt from freedom of information requests.  I note section 20 includes a reference to previous legislation in terms of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  Would any decisions that would be made on the operation of the preclearance area be covered by the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
        <P>My fourth question relates to section 13(1), which indicates that a preclearance officer shall not be amendable to the jurisdiction of the judicial or administrative authorities of the State in respect of acts performed by him or her in the exercise of his or her functions.  That appears to indicate that this officer will have a degree of diplomatic immunity.  Will that be the case?  Is that the norm when such officers are appointed here or in equivalent countries?  It appears to be a relatively sweeping indemnity to give to an officer who will be performing this job in our country.</P>
        <P>My final question relates to sections 14 and 15.  Section 14 provides that an airport authority may charge a fee to air carriers and aircraft commanders availing of preclearance.  Section 15 provides that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  If expenses are incurred by the taxpayer for the operation of these areas, for example, the provision of additiona<Col N="904"/>l garda&iacute; or other personnel, should there not be a mechanism to ensure the State can be reimbursed?  It may be that such a mechanism is in existence or is provided for elsewhere in the Act, but I would appreciate clarification from the Minister in this regard.</P>
      
        <P>Those were my main questions about the legislation.  I also have two questions about the operation of the system, particularly by the airport authorities.  As I said, it is clear the legislation will confer a smart competitive advantage on the airport authorities.  I would like to ensure, through the Minister&rsquo;s offices and through the Department, that it makes good use of this.  I have only been doing work of this kind over the last two years, but I get the sense that although great work is done to confer opportunities on bodies in the expectation they will make the most of them, we end up looking back and wondering what happened to them.  There should be some mechanism in place to ensure the Department is happy with the way in which the system is implemented.  Given that our Government had to go to the trouble of negotiating an agreement with the USA, we need to make sure we are getting the most out of it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I note that the Dublin Airport Authority has indicated, with regard to Shannon Airport, that the current charge per passenger for miscellaneous services is &euro;1.51 and that the fee for using the preclearance facility is to rise to &euro;10.50 per passenger.  The authority estimates the cost of providing this facility within Shannon will be around &euro;20 million.  I emphasise that a competitive advantage is being conferred on these bodies through the legislation.  The last thing they should do is to nullify this by charging passengers unreasonable amounts for using the service.  Whatever costs are incurred by the system, the first thing the authorities should do is to find out how they can cover that charge themselves to ensure the bare minimum is passed on to passengers making use of the services.  As I said, it is obvious that the way out of our difficulties, particularly in industries such as tourism and aviation, will be through a collection of strong although perhaps small measures.  It would be a pity if a measure such as this, which is clearly of great benefit, were nullified due to unreasonable charging of passengers.</P>
        <P>The Bill is clearly to be welcomed.  It contains many measures that will make a difference to the airports in the regions in question.  I ask the Minister to respond to my points in his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Donohoe, I welcome this Bill.  It was a positive move by the Government, in its negotiations with the American authorities last year, to ensure we got a competitive advantage.  Competitive advantage is important for airlines because it is not always the price that can make something competitive; it can be the service or fringe benefits provided by an airline.</P>
        <P>With regard to the legislation, there are one or two things about which we should be careful.  The fixing of costs should be left to the Minister rather than to the airport authorities, because the airports that have this advantage could decide to use it as a means of taking more cash from travellers, which could cancel out the benefits that will be created.  Thus, the cost should be controlled by the Department in conjunction with the airport authorities.</P>
        <P>The system will give us an advantage which should be marketed.  The Minister stated in his speech that a number of airlines have considered Irish airports as possible hubs for preclearance.  The biggest beneficiary of this could be Aer Lingus, which flies into Dublin from its European destinations.  If its schedules were designed to encourage people to take their onward journeys with Aer Lingus rather than from other European airports which do not have this facility, it could be a major boost for Aer Lingus.  I have no doubt its competitor and shareholder Ryanair will consider ensuring that its flights are timed in such a way as to join up with clearance for US flights from Du<Col N="905"/>blin.  This should be considered by both airlines as a means of improving their competitive edge and the service provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>Those who have travelled to American airports know that one could end up queueing for an inordinate length of time for immigration clearance and so on.  It is not unknown for people to be queueing for two or two and a half hours.  After this, one could end up meeting an individual who would put one through the wringer, go through one&rsquo;s cases and so on.  This is something about which people have always complained.</P>
        <P>Under the system, the personnel who carry out the inspections will have immunity.  This is something that must be tightly controlled, and I hope the legislation will be sufficient to do that.  There is one thing I do not see in the Bill, namely, an appeal mechanism for those who are refused landing rights in the US.  This is something we should consider.  In the future, if people decide to travel to Dublin on their way to the US and then discover they cannot go any farther, who will be responsible for repatriating them?  Who will have to carry the cost?  Will it be the airlines or the individuals concerned?  I do not see anything in the Bill to deal with this possibility, but it is one that should be covered because people may try to use the system as a back-door mechanism to enter the country to seek asylum.  It is only a minor issue but it should be considered.</P>
        <P>The move to preclearance will provide a facility for people to complete various checks before they leave Ireland rather than standing in long queues.  They will have the same privileges when they land as a US citizen.  This is important.  It also means that if they are taking an interconnecting flight in the US they will not have to go through customs between flights.  People who use the facilities here will, on arrival in the US, be able to move freely through terminals and get onward connections without having to go through inordinate delays.</P>
        <P>The fact that the staff of the preclearance system will be American and will have the equivalent of American Embassy status within the clearance area is something we should keep an eye on.  I also have some fear about the length of time data provided by people will be retained.  It will be retained indefinitely for those who use the facility.  Anyone who feels threatened may decide to use other ways to enter the USA but that would be wrong.  The fact that this will be the equivalent of an embassy means this is the only way it could be agreed, it could not be done any other way.  The American authorities have stringent regulations for travel documentation and entry.  They introduced the biometric passport and made it mandatory for entry into the country.</P>
        <P>The preclearance facility is to be welcomed.  It will be in place in both Dublin and Shannon.  Shannon may not have the facility for a further year but a year is not that long in aviation terms.  Airlines often prepare schedules two years in advance.  The major advantage will be for our national carrier and those other carriers from America that use Dublin Airport.  They will be able to offer preclearance facilities in Dublin and Shannon, allowing travellers faster access to the US, which will encourage people to travel through Ireland on the way to America.</P>
        <P>While we are putting this in place, I hope we would also ask the United States to do something with regards to those who have entered the US over the years and are living there undocumented.  We might be able to persuade the American authorities to look at an amnesty for such people in the United States.  It is not an area within the remit of the Department of Transport but there is a need to look at some way to get the Irish undocumented immigrants addressed.  We know in recent times that no one enters the US without a visa but there was a recent incident where an undocumented Irishman died for the want of medical treatment.  We should put further pressure on the US authorities to clear up this issue.  I spoke to someone recently whose brother has been undocumented in the US for ten years.  If there was a family bereavement or wedding, he could not come home.  The<Col N="906"/> Minister should ask his Government colleagues to do something.  From now on, however, everyone will be properly documented before going to America.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The Bill is obviously welcome as it is required to give legal effect to the preclearance agreement signed by the Minister and the US Secretary of Homeland Security in Washington in November last year.  I welcome the indication from the Minister that it is only this legislation that will apply in terms of preclearance and the roles of preclearance officers and Irish law enforcement officers are clearly laid out.  There is consistent reference as we go through the sections in the Bill to Irish law enforcement officers.</P>
        <P>I welcome the agreement and recognise the Minister&rsquo;s success in progressing it; credit is due in that regard.  The primary aim is to facilitate the new preclearance facilities at Shannon Airport, due to open in July, and in Dublin Airport in November 2010.  They will be of great benefit to passengers and industry alike.  I particularly welcome the fact the first place outside the Americas to offer a full preclearance service to US-bound passengers will be located in Shannon Airport.  This is the only such facility proposed for Europe and it offers many opportunities for Ireland to exploit.</P>
        <P>Having visited the States many times, with documentation processed both in the US and Ireland on different occasions, I am aware of the difference preclearance makes for passengers.  Any US-bound flight leaving Shannon from July and Dublin from November 2010 will offer all immigration, customs and agricultural clearance before take off and, therefore, passengers will enjoy uninterrupted transit.  The benefits in time and money saved will be appreciable.  The new agreement will also afford a greater choice of airport destinations in the US for aircraft originating in or transiting through Ireland.  Passengers will also welcome the change that will allow them to check their baggage through from Dublin and Shannon to their final destinations in the US, even if it involves flights with different airlines.</P>
        <P>Preclearance has the potential to boost business.  The Shannon Airport Authority hopes to attract up to 70 business jets a day to the airport when the US preclearance facility opens as a result of this agreement.  It has been reported that management at the airport is in talks with a large number of airlines, including Middle Eastern carriers, to attract as much stopover business as possible when the service begins.  The potential is that some aircraft that currently overfly Shannon might stop and benefit from the preclearance.</P>
        <P>Shannon is already a popular technical stop due to its being a 24/7 airport with some of the most competitive fuel pricing in Europe.  If this agreement generates additional interest and traffic, when transatlantic operators see advantages in the time and money saved with the ability to bypass the normal airports of entry within the US and proceed directly to their destinations, it can only be good for Ireland.  This opportunity must be exploited.  Mr. Brendan O&rsquo;Grady of Universal Aviation in Ireland, a ground support firm for corporate planes that has bases in more than 50 countries, has stated this could encourage multinationals to locate their head offices in this region as chief executives and directors could fly in, do their business, have fast-tracked preclearance, and fly back to their local airports.</P>
        <P>Ireland needs every boost it can get economically.  I welcome the agreement and this legislation.  Between now and Committee Stage on Thursday, we will look closely at the detail of the Bill to check for shortcomings and to suggest possible improvements.  Senator Ellis mentioned people who are refused access, an interesting question that should be teased out, particularly when it comes to ensuring there is no cost to the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and their interest in this topic.  I will try to address the number of matters raised and I look forward <Col N="907"/>to working with Senators on Committee Stage.  This Bill represents a landmark in the development of Irish aviation and I thank Members for recognising that.  I am confident the Government&rsquo;s policy on preclearance will help Ireland on the road to economic recovery when the current recession passes.</P>
        <P>The fee being set for preclearance at Shannon will increase from &euro;1.50 to &euro;10.50.  This is an airport authority doing its own business and for that reason it would be a matter for it to decide what the costs should be and to recoup those costs.  That is provided for in the memorandum and agreement.  I do not believe it would be a good idea from anyone&rsquo;s point of view that there should be ministerial interference in that aspect of an airport&rsquo;s business anymore than in any other aspect of its day-to-day business.</P>
        <P>It is very important the airport does not price itself out of the market.  Obviously, it will have an eye to being as competitive as possible.  Currently, air travel is almost a luxury except in respect of low cost fares.  I suppose it involves discretionary spending.  If too many costs are imposed, it could become very cost sensitive.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators spoke about the importance of the facility being available and of marketing it.  I have emphasised that repeatedly to the airport authorities, especially in Shannon, which are very alive to the opportunities and conscious of the need to market it proactively.  We have offered assistance.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and I have indicated in our various roles that if the airport authorities need us to promote this we will do so as we promote Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland companies or Ireland as a destination for work.  Senators are correct that it is very important we do not take it for granted that because this facility is in place and this is the only country outside the Americas which has this facility, it will automatically mean new business.  If one does not go out and market it, one will not get that business.</P>
        <P>I refer to immunity, the status of that immunity and why American personnel or citizens of the United States of America will provide this service.  This is a United States of America service to travellers who originate in Ireland and are travelling to a destinations in the United States of America.  Whatever regulation the US has in regard to preclearance officers and immigration, we must recognise that.  We cannot second guess it or choose its personnel.  As I said, there is a strong role for Irish personnel, including the Garda, in the preclearance area.</P>
        <P>Increasing business and generating employment as a result of this facility is more to do with what I spoke about earlier, namely, marketing the facility, increasing the throughput of passengers at airports and attracting businesses from eastern Europe to transit through Shannon, which I believe we can do.  That is where the jobs will be created.</P>
        <P>Jobs can also be created if private jets land.  Good marketing might mean we give people the opportunity to stay overnight or for a few nights in the area before travelling to the United States.  Good marketing may capture a market there.  That is very important.</P>
        <P>I refer to the personnel working in this facility and diplomatic immunity.  The officers operating there will have the equivalent of diplomatic immunity.  Senator Ellis asked whether the preclearance area will be equivalent to the American embassy.  The preclearance area will remain part of Ireland while, technically speaking, the American embassy is American soil.  It is important to emphasise that.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the question of expenses and costs being met.  We do not anticipate there will be huge costs involved and anticipate they will be able to be met from within existing resources.</P>
        <P>I refer to the retention of documents.  Documents are American consular documents and are the property of the United States of America.  We have no control over those documents.  They will remain w<Col N="908"/>ith the United States of America.</P>
        <P>I can categorically state that preclearance officers will not be allowed to carry weapons.  As I said, where there is a necessity to detain people, they have the power to do so until the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arrives.  They do not have a general power.  Preclearance officers do not have to be US nationals but the likelihood is that they will be because they will be employed by the United States Government.  However, they could be Irish nationals.  Many of the people working in immigration inspections regard themselves as Irish because they have been here so long and enjoy it here.  If I have missed one or two of the points Senators raised, I am sure we can tease them out on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
        <P>Preclearance will bring many benefits to Ireland over the coming years.  It will bring financial and economic benefits and will enhance the strong business and cultural relationship which exists between Ireland and the United States of America.  It could be very important as another string to our bow in attracting American multinationals to this country.  It is very important we use this opportunity to develop air links between the two countries and to maintain the close relationship we have.</P>
        <P>This facility will bring obvious benefits to passengers and will make it much easier for them at the end of their journey.  It will generate new transit business at Irish airports.  We will continue to follow up on a number of active inquiries we have had about that.  I am confident there is great scope for enhancing business, helping airports and generating new business opportunities not only in the airports but in their catchment areas.</P>
