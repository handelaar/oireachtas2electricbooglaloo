	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on plans to improve waiting times for drug rehabilitation, intervention and detoxification facilities in the Cork region.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an update on the number of inspections carried out by local authorities of privately rented accommodation, the amount of revenue raised by fines issued and the success he has had in implementing new standards in the privately rented sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to set out the proposed new environmental protection scheme following his decision to discontinue REPS 4.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to review the decision to end REPS for new applicants.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to resolve the stand off between his Department and Killarney jarveys on the ongoing horse dung issue which needs consultation and dialogue involving all of the parties and the licensing authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that processing of medical card applications continues to be provided in Ballybofey, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh of the following matter:</P><Col N="1186"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that District Court facilities and hearings are maintained in New Ross through the continuance of temporary facilities, which have proved very satisfactory, pending the provision of a new court house.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Buttimer, Donohoe, Phelan, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Coghlan and Doherty as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Buttimer, Donohoe, Phelan and &Oacute; Domhnaill.  They will be taken at the conclusion of business.  As the matters raised by Senators Phelan and &Oacute; Domhnaill are similar I suggest they share time.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Walsh as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter, which is one for the Courts Service.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, earlier signature motion on the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Bill 2009; No. 2, Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill &ndash; all Stages; No. 3, statements on Northern Ireland; and No. 4, Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; report from D&aacute;il.  It is proposed that No. 1 shall be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, shall be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and Senators may share time; Second Stage shall conclude not later than 3.45 p.m., with the Minister called for concluding comments not later than 3.35 p.m.; No. 3 shall be taken at the adjournment of No. 2 but not earlier than 4 p.m. and shall conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not exceeding five minutes and Senators may share time; No. 4 shall be taken at the conclusion of No. 3; with Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 2, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I condemn the riots in Northern Ireland that we saw on television screens last night.  It is so disappointing to see this sporadic and unwanted violence.  The people who behave like this have no mandate.  We stand four square behind the Government and the police forces, North and South, in tackling this violence and ensuring the hard-won peace continues to reign and communities continue to benefit from the peace that was so hard won over many years.  We will have the opportunity to discuss this with the Taoiseach when we have a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the absolute frustration on this side of the House at the manner in which legislation is being dealt with by a Government that is arrogant and contemptuous of parliamentary democracy in these Houses in respect of how this important legislation is dealt with.  If the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill is found to be unconstitutional, it will not protect one family or citizen who has suffered at the hands of these gangs.  We support the legislation but we sought proper discussion.  It will be rushed through this House in the same manner as the D&aacute;il.  Serious statements about our courts are made in this legislation.  Fine Gael tabled serious amendments in the D&aacute;il.  Once again it is being rushed through.  The D&aacute;il is in recess and therefore the Minister will be very reluctant to accept any amendments from the House.  This is no way to handle the business of the Houses, particularly with legislation which has such implications and is so far-reaching.  In recent weeks, we have had excellent debates in the House on legislation.  Amendments have been taken on board and subsequently passed in the D&aacute;il.  We will not have that opportunity today.  I will vote against the Order of Business on the basis that this is no way to run the business of the House.</P><Col N="1187"/>
        <P>We called for debates on job creation; we wanted to discuss the pharmacy issue and we wanted the Minister of State with responsibility for children to update the House on adoption legislation.  None of this will happen.  There is unfinished business in all of these areas and we should have continued to work on them instead of putting the business together in the way that has been done.  Yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Government had plenty of time to consider the legislation.  The Government may have had plenty of time but reaching for discussion amendment No. 6 of 43 amendments did not provide the D&aacute;il with much opportunity to tease out the legislation, consider its implications and improve it.  That was denied to the D&aacute;il and it will probably be denied to the Seanad today given the rushed nature of the legislation.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of leaks from an bord snip nua and I note there was one with regard to the Ombudsman for Children.  These leaks are selective.  The Ombudsman for Children is appointed by the President and the Oireachtas.  In light of the Ryan report it would seem extraordinary if the work of the Ombudsman for Children was to be one of the areas highlighted for cuts.  Will the Leader take up this issue with the Government?</P>

	<P>We are on the Order of Business and the Senator should put questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Normally, this should be the Seanad&rsquo;s opportunity to show the value of a second Chamber where we could interrogate legislation properly.  However, as Senator Frances Fitzgerald stated, we will not have that opportunity because of the rushed nature of what is happening in these days.  To see the phrase &ldquo;all Stages&rdquo; posted underneath legislation as important as the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill with all that it entails is ludicrous, as others have stated.</P>
        <P>I watched Miriam O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s television programme at the weekend and I am sure like others did I felt tremendous sympathy, powerlessness and anger listening to members of the Collins family describe what they have been through.  There are sincere people with very legitimate opinions on both sides of the argument on what needs to be done in the criminal justice system to deal with the wave of criminality facing us.  People rightly identify that there is a long-established and carefully crafted balance in our criminal justice system which should not be tampered with and that it would not be in the interests of the innocent in future to introduce draconian approaches that interfere with the normal checks and balances in criminal prosecutions.  On the other hand, one listens to people who have suffered enormously and we all know that desperate times call for extraordinary measures.  However, they should be good measures.</P>
        <P>Whatever way this issue is resolved, it should not be resolved in a hurry.  This is the exact type of clash of opinion between sincerely held, well-established and justified views on different sides of an argument that calls for extended debate.  It is one thing to push through technical legislation at the end of term but it is another to push through legislation on an issue as important as this, when the issue needs to be interrogated fully and we need to go from having a gut reaction to having a more considered view that one would hope would accommodate the aspirations of all sides and protect the delicate balance in our criminal justice system.  For this <Col N="1188"/>reason alone, this is very bad legislation.  That is not the way we should be doing business and it will bring the Houses of the Oireachtas into disrepute.</P>
        <P>I was talking to a former Seanad&oacute;ir at the weekend who said that one of the frustrating aspects of being a Member of the Seanad, and I am sure it applies equally to Members of the D&aacute;il, was the inversion of the way business should be done.  Instead of the Executive proposing legislation which the Oireachtas must consider, we are a barely consulted body of people.  It would be more likely to take heed of us if we were powerful figures in the media or wealthy lobby groups.  That is not the way it should be.  We should have a fully functioning, inquisitive Legislature that gets an opportunity to ask the hard questions, asks the hard questions and is not just heard but heeded when it is correct.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Leaving aside the question of the merits of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill, I want to ask the Leader two questions.  First, what would be the effect of any changes this Chamber might propose and have adopted in that Bill?  Am I not right in saying they would have no effect whatsoever because the D&aacute;il is in recess?  There is not the slightest intention on the part of the Government to return this Bill to the D&aacute;il when we have done with it in this Chamber.  I ask the Leader to agree with me that the sad reality is that anything we do today, unfortunately and regrettably, despite all the talk about the relevance of the Seanad, will be entirely irrelevant.  It is entirely regrettable that the people who are taking an interest in what will go on in this Chamber today might as well be told and are being told by the Government and by the Leader, who is colluding with them, not to bother paying attention to what happens here today because it will not have any impact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>How am I wrong in the assumption that I and others make that irrespective of what happens in this Chamber today, this matter will not be returning to the D&aacute;il?  The D&aacute;il being in recess clearly points to that fact.</P>
        <P>Second, it is a strange experience being on one&rsquo;s feet here day in, day out asking the Leader questions because he hardly ever answers them but I will ask them again anyway because that is what I am here to do.  Why does the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform only appear to be able to bring forward legislation in the months of June and July in any given calendar year?  What is the problem in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it cannot bring forward legislation and pace itself throughout the year to allow some opportunity in the Houses and across the public to debate these extremely important items of legislation?  I am leaving aside the issue of the merits of this legislation but clearly anything that has to do with the liberty of the individual requires at least some minimum level of scrutiny in any Parliament.  Why can we not have that and why can the public not have access to that throughout a period longer than a few weeks?  This legislation was published on 30 June and it is proposed that it will be disposed of in this Chamber today.  That is wrong, and the Leader is colluding with the Government in rendering this Chamber irrelevant to the Irish people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s position on this Bill is rather unique in that it calls for action but when the Government takes action, it criticises it and votes against it.  One <Col N="1189"/>of its Members in the other House abstained because he could not stomach the hypocrisy on this particular issue and the way the party treated it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;if an amendment is made to this Bill, it is argued in this House and agreed by the Minister, speaking as one who served in that position, the Minister will have to bring it back to the other House either in the autumn or another time.  That is a fact.</P>

	<P>Fat chance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senators can bring forward a reasonable, well-argued amendment to this Bill the Minister will have no choice but to bring it back to the other House.  That is a fact.  We should be clear about that.  That is no excuse for going on holidays, by the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A comment about someone going on holidays is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to come before this House in the September session to discuss the serious position regarding the number of taxi plates issued throughout the country.  There are 27,429 taxis operating currently and this morning at Heuston Station, 45 taxis were lined up.  Three passengers came off the train.  In Dublin city, there are 14,000 taxis while there were 2,722 before regulation.  In London, there are approximately 21,000 taxis and in New York approximately 12,000.  That puts things in context.</P>
        <P>Taxi drivers are having a tough time at present.  The business is far too competitive.  Taxis must line up, with not enough space to park.  Outside Heuston Station there is not enough space for taxis to park.  It must be soul destroying to sit in a taxi all day waiting for a fare and be completely undermined by the regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Who is the Minister?  Who is in government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Minister for Transport come to the House to speak on this matter.  The taxi regulator must have some say in this matter.  He should recommend a change in the rules in this regard.  There must be a balanced approach to the number of taxis.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1190"/>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government not have responsibility for taxis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 1,200 taxis in Galway, 2,500 in Cork and 1,100 in Limerick.  This is too many.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue in a calm manner after the summer recess and before the Christmas period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned, as every Member of the House should be, about the report of the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Joe Meade.  He says financial institutions have &ldquo;preyed on the elderly&rdquo;.  Elderly people have been focused upon by financial institutions with regard to investment in bonds, windfalls from the sale of property and retirement lump sums.  This report is a further blow to the reputation of our banking institutions.  Some 63% of complaints made to the Financial Services Ombudsman have been upheld.  That is an indictment of our financial system and needs the full attention of the Government.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Government and the Minister for Finance and ask them to ensure that this type of preying on people in vulnerable situations does not continue.  It does not do us, our economy or our reputation any good.</P>
        <P>There is huge concern throughout rural Ireland at the discontinuation of the rural environmental protection scheme, REPS.  The scheme is worth approximately &euro;6,000 per farmer and contributes to the real viability of farms.  Other countries are protecting the scheme and ensuring that the environment is protected and has the support of the State whereas we are discontinuing it.  Meanwhile, we are talking about the need to get support for the Lisbon treaty.  This will have a huge negative effect, not only on farmers but on agricultural stores, farmers&rsquo; suppliers, contractors and agri-advisers.  It will have a huge effect on rural employment in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The local rural economy will be devastated.  I will propose an amendment to the Order of Business to call on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House to debate this very important matter for rural Ireland.  I ask the Leader to facilitate this amendment to the Order of Business and support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with some of the points raised by Opposition Senators regarding the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill.  Perhaps we do need more time to debate Committee Stage of the Bill.  The fault lies with the Lower House.  The process of legislating is not paced properly.  Too much comes to this Chamber too quickly at the end of the session.  Reform of the Seanad should take that matter into consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is caused by Government mismanagement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>A huge amount of legislation came to the Seanad in the last week.  I would like to tease it out more thoroughly.  I agree with the merits of the legislation and I am prepared to go along with it on that basis.  However, there are points which should be raised with regard to it.</P>
        <P>A recent study looked at nine year old children, who are the offspring of the boom years.  The study examined their lifestyles, health, welfare and achievements at school.  Young children, whose parents may now be out of work, will be affected by the recession.  There is a call for a debate on changes in society.  We should talk about the smart economy, which will be based on information, energy and environment, and a new emphasis in education.  The future of the country needs a vision of humanity.  Not only should we protect those who are doing well, but we should protect the vulnerable.  A change is coming in those respects.  I would like these challenges to be discussed in the Chamber in the autumn, as it would be a golden oppor<Col N="1191"/>tunity.  Life is changing significantly and that change affects youths, teachers, professionals and all aspects of society.  It requires a full debate in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second Senator Coffey&rsquo;s proposal for a debate on REPS.  Germany and France take different approaches to their agriculture sectors, but each supports REPS-type schemes to protect its rural environment.  Ireland abolishing the scheme would be a backwards step, not only from an agricultural point of view, but from the point of view of environmental protection.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader remove the guillotine he wishes to apply to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill?  Senators are not so out of touch with reality that they do not understand the level of violence and intimidation to be found in many communities.  However, recent years have shown us how absolute power corrupts so easily.  We must strive for a balance at all times when discussing legislation, that is, we should not give absolute power to people who we consider to be the guardians of the State.  All too often, they have readily abused their powers.  At the same time, we must stamp out the violence and intimidation in communities that feel unprotected.  If necessary, let us have that debate.  It would not do us any harm.  In fact, it may strengthen the legislation and the public&rsquo;s perception of what we do instead of appearing as a laughing stock.  In some respects, the latter is of the Leader&rsquo;s making.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I call upon the Leader to convey the consensus that most Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; believe that an bord snip nua&rsquo;s report should be published.  While he wants us to confine our points to this House, there is a certain sense of relief around Leinster House.  It is like having noisy neighbours move out.  There is a relief in the Chamber that we can breathe a bit and address ourselves to the issues that matter.</P>
        <P>I will reserve my remarks on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill, but I wish to make a point about an bord snip nua.  It has been precluded from examining the most important aspect of its work, namely, the question of public sector pay.  As a formerly active trade unionist, I do not understand how the trade union movement and the political class can contemplate axing 20,000 jobs instead of cutting public service pay and saving those jobs.  I do not know why people should not think the unthinkable and why public servants should not work longer days and provide the same quality of public services for less money, given the revolutionary situation in which we are living.</P>
        <P>I do not know how the political class, including Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, can pontificate about the public sector or the economy when it has given such a contemptible example.  The political class should have been at point position in giving up its pay and perks.  Minor cosmetic changes have been made.  Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; and Deputies, including former Ministers, have held on like grim death to their perks and privileges, setting a bad example for the people.  I do not know why, from the point of view of survival and self-interest, Deputies and Senators do not see that the people are logging this information day in, day out and that there will be a terrible day of reckoning.  Since I am a one-term Senator, I do not care.  Out of self-interest, Deputies and Senators should have set a good example and taken cuts until the pips squeaked, so to speak.</P>

	<P>I do not understand why he is trying this again today.  This is important legislation.  We all agree with it in principle, given the problems associated with law enforcement, but the procedure being applied is unacceptable and brings the whole House into disrepute.</P>
        <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> today, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole has a very good article entitled &ldquo;Politicians prove they have no self-respect&rdquo;.  He should be more discerning in making that kind of statement because at least Fianna F&aacute;il is barefaced about the fact that it is rushing through legislation and that, in setting out the procedure, it does not care what amendments are tabled.  The Green Party is acquiescing in this and acquiesced in supporting the legislation on the medieval offence of blasphemy.  Last week, Mr. Jason O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s blog stated that Senator de B&uacute;rca put on record during her European election campaign that she and the Green Party are against the legislation on blasphemy.  Senator Dan Boyle spoke in this House against the law of blasphemy, yet voted with the Government.  The Green Party could have prevented the law on blasphemy being ensconced in the Defamation Bill.  If it had done so, we would all have supported it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me take up the point made by Senator Francis Fitzgerald on the recent violence in Northern Ireland, which was absolutely shocking.  The violence comes as a great disappointment to all those who have invested so much hope in our newly found peace and who believed we had entered an era in which people could sit down and settle their differences as equals.  In this regard, one can only hope the bringing back into play of the petrol bomb and rocks will not have an ongoing effect on another generation of young Irish people.</P>
        <P>It is not so long since we saw several immigrants driven out of Northern Ireland by violence.  There is an underlying problem that must be addressed.  We should not regard the violence as a once-off occurrence because it is evident that it is orchestrated and intended to cause disruption and undermine what has been achieved in Northern Ireland.  One can only imagine the pictures of the violence of recent days that have been broadcast on satellite television throughout the world.</P>
        <P>We are currently trying to grapple with a recession and stimulate tourism, yet everything we achieve will be undermined by the violence.  All I can see emerging from the violence is more hatred &mdash; I can sense it already.  I hope we give the leaders, particularly the community leaders, every possible support because there is always a danger the violence will escalate.  When one sees ten year olds, in particular, involved in this type of violence, it indicates there is manipulation behind the scenes.  I hope that when the Taoiseach is in the House today, he will have the opportunity to address the problem.  We need leadership from the highest level.</P>

	<P>We are in the middle of what is probably the worst economic crisis we have witnessed in our lives and, in the middle of the tourism season, in respect of which everybody is focused on saving and protecting jobs, on the second day of the week-long Killarney races festival, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, <Col N="1193"/>Deputy Gormley, has decided to lock people out of Killarney National Park.  This step on his part, regardless of its environmental merits, is sheer lunacy.  It is a question of so-called equine sanitary devices, dung catchers or, in the simplest terms, horse nappies.</P>

As I stated previously, we cannot have one law for the park and another for the streets of the town and all its connecting roadways.  Consultation and dialogue are required that must also involve the licensing authority, the local authority.  I call on the Minister to reverse immediately this lunatic policy, resolve this matter and get involved.  The mayor of Killarney has offered to mediate. </P>

	<P>In the past few months I have been in contact about this with a number of contractors around the country who construct GAA pitches and I have been working with the Fine Gael Deputy who trains the Mayo football team, and the consultants in the GAA appear to have a bias towards a particular contract.

We have not had any of those debates during the past two weeks of this session.  </P>

I have raised this matter previously and a journalist has contacted me about it.</P>
        <P>These young people drive cars in some cases with the silencer removed.  Ramps do not pose a problem for them as they have removed the ramps.

	<P>When the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced the Criminal Justice Bill 2006 in this House he spent several weeks dealing with it and was here for the taking of all Stages.  We spent weeks dealing with Committee and Report Stages of that Bill.  The Minister accepted several amendments to the Bill from this side of the House.  That is in marked contrast to what is proposed regarding the criminal justice legislation that we will deal with later.  All Stages of that legislation are to be rammed through.  That is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>Such treatment of legislation happens on a regular basis in this House and that is down to the way the Leader orders the business of this House.  He is not doing his business properly and he is not treating this House with the respect that it deserves.  The least that can be done is that Second and Committee Stages would be taken today and Report Stage would be taken tomorrow.  There would be some sense to that approach.  I ask the Leader to consider that proposal when replying to the Order of Business and to co-operate in some way with the Members who wish to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  Some 12 speakers are offering to speak on Second Stage of this Bill but given what the Leader proposes, only two or three at the most will be able to contribute.  Does the Leader think that represents democracy?</P>

	<P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Transport yesterday that more than 200 km of dual carriageway has now been upgraded to motorway standard.  I raised this matter in the House previously.  This upgrade will bring the speed limit on such roads up to 120 km/h.  It is only right that the huge investment we are making in our road network will benefit the economy.  Time is money in that respect.  I welcome this upgrade.</P><Col N="1197"/>
        <P>I request that the Leader arranges a debate on a review of all speed limits with the Minister in attendance early in the autumn.  They are set artificially low throughout the country.  Even the AA has ridiculed the fact that they are set artificially low.  This will give rise to serious public disquiet when the rolling out of the private camera system becomes operational.</P>
        <P>It is good that we will have a debate on Northern Ireland today.  What happened last night is regrettable.  We need to recognise in these Houses that if we were to contact people in Northern Ireland, particularly in Nationalist and republican areas, we would find that there is considerable concern that the reciprocity that they expected from Unionism has not been forthcoming.  Since the Good Friday Agreement there has been very little recognition of the North-South element of the Agreement.  That needs to happen if we are to ensure that the peace process, which everybody wants to continue, is fully bedded down.</P>
        <P>I was touched by Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s concern about people on this side of the House.  I seek an early debate on swine flu, which is becoming quite serious in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  A number of people who have died from it had no other illness, which confirms the concerns of the World Health Organisation in classifying swine flu as a pandemic.  I seek a debate on it some time in September when the Minister can fully set out the plans and procedures that are in place with the HSE in order to contain what will be a serious health situation for the population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s comment about swine flu.  My concern is that September is a long time away to have a mere debate on the matter at a time when 133 people have died in Ireland &mdash; God forgive me, they are not dead, but have contracted swine flu.  Yesterday a child in the United Kingdom who had only a sore throat died from swine flu.  Urgent action is required on swine flu, which is a pandemic.</P>
        <P>The reason I rise is to support all my colleagues who have referred to the manner in which legislation is being rushed through this House today.  The Minister indicated in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that knee-jerk reaction has no place in responding to legislative proposals.  I agree with him.  The tone of his newspaper article was measured.  While we all support the need for legislation, this House should be the forum where we have the opportunity to debate and discuss serious legislation such as the Bill.</P>
        <P>Last week lawyers wrote to <i>The Irish Times</i> and expressed their astonishment that we were jettisoning ancient rights.  I have similar concerns.  I listen to people who are better informed than me.  The Garda has today expressed serious concerns about the legislation.  It is not too late.  We do have powers in the Seanad.  We can extend the time for debate and allow for serious contributions from both sides of the House.  I am aware that the concerns of colleagues on the other side of the House are as deep and serious as those of Members on this side.</P>
        <P>The Well Woman Centres&rsquo; serious survey on cervical cancer revealed the sad situation that the underprivileged and poor are not availing of free cervical smear tests.  No more than Senator Walsh seeking a debate on swine flu, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the cervical cancer vaccine.  That is what the Well Woman Centres said yesterday, that the cervical cancer vaccine must be administered to 12 year olds because we have such a high rate of cervical cancer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for his response on Friday to my request for a debate on child protection and the second interim report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  I seek clarification on my request for a second debate on the 420 plus children who remain missing from the care of the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I have tabled the matter on the Adjournment on a number of occasions.  The latest response from the Minister indicates that there are still 420 children missing from the care of <Col N="1198"/>the HSE.  One of the missing children was Melissa Mahon, whose body was found last year.  She had been missing for 18 months.  As Members of the Oireachtas we have a particular responsibility to ensure that every step is taken to find those children.  All of them bar three are non-national.  Three children are Irish and the remainder are non-national, unaccompanied minors.  In other words, from the moment they entered the country, they were in the care of the State.  There was nobody to speak up for them.  Nobody will contact the Garda to ask what steps have been taken to find them.  It is up to us to ensure everything is done to account for each of these children.  That would be a fitting legacy to the Ryan report and the other reports on child abuse.  It is of utmost importance that we send a message that Ireland is not a soft target for child trafficking.  Disturbing accounts are emerging that some of these children have been exploited for the purposes of child labour and the sex trade.  We must have a debate on this important issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>When we do not pay attention to particular issues, there is a danger that they simply fall off the agenda.  Two issues caught my attention in the past week.  First, it emerged that Galway County Council is spending &euro;3,000 per week on supplies of bottled water to areas where the water supply continues to be considered unsafe for human consumption.  This is the type of issue to which we should give more attention.  We do not appreciate our clean water supply until something goes wrong with it.  Second, a report has indicated that one quarter of ice samples, mainly in public houses, that were tested by the Food Safety Authority were found to be contaminated with bacteria.  These ice cubes are produced from a machine but have clearly deteriorated in some way.  These two issues serve as a reminder of how we may take certain matters for granted.  It is important to be aware of the problems that exist and the need to address them.</P>

	<P>In the event that the report from an bord snip nua is published, will the Leader arrange for a debate on its contents when we return in September to debate the NAMA legislation?  There may be merits and demerits in publishing the report, which I understand proposes a suite of options for achieving reductions in public expenditure of &euro;5 billion.  As we are all aware, there are people who say we must all be prepared to make sacrifices and to endure cutbacks and job losses, but that is only true if the pain is imposed at somebody else&rsquo;s expense.  Such persons will use the suite of options as a stick to undermine the necessary work of the Government.  That is why this debate is essential.</P>
        <P>I am aware of Opposition requests for more time for the debate on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 and of the strong legal objections that have come from the Law Library.  In the mid-west, where I am from, there is a dark evil in the form of gangland violence.  The people involved have made enormous sums of money from the drugs trade, with anecdotal evidence of wheelie bins full of cash.  There is often a difficulty in getting rid of the money because of the huge sums involved.  People&rsquo;s lives are at risk from this activity, with the price of a life set at &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000, amounts which those intent on committing these crimes have readily to hand.  They are despised by the community.  Short of internment, we must do something to impede the activities of those people, who are managing to get around legislation by using eight year olds to burn down premises and hiring contract killers.  We must act now to address this problem.</P>

	<P>I support my colleagues in their absolute and unanimous condemnation of the Government&rsquo;s handling of the debate on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009.  This major legislation will make a number of seminal changes in respect of such issues as the inferences that may be drawn from a failure to co-operate in court, Garda testimony and bail.  Its implications are enormous.  While I acknowledge the need for this legislation, it is of such <Col N="1199"/>monumental and ground-breaking proportions in terms of our entire system of jurisprudence that it is criminally wrong for it to be dealt with in this fashion.  The Government must stand indicted for trying to rush it through.  The fact that the D&aacute;il has risen means no amendments can be made in this House and that the Minister has no intention of accepting amendments.  It is clear therefore that this will not be a legislative process, but rather a pantomime or a pageant.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is wrong to deal with such important legislation in this manner.  The Bill proposes to suspend important human liberties, although in a considered fashion because of extraordinary events in extraordinary times.  However, the suspension of central civil liberties, which were fought for and achieved over years of evolution towards justice and democracy, cannot be undertaken lightly.  The legislation needs days of thought and consideration to tease out and modify the proposals.  It is a criminal indictment of our legislative assembly, including this House, that the Government is attempting to deal with this Bill in such a cavalier fashion.  We are talking about individual people and we must be very careful before we diminish their liberties and change the entire operation of our courts.  Tragically the need is there, but it requires consideration and not in a few hours of debate without amendments.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join in the condemnation by Senators Fitzgerald and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; of the riots that took place in Northern Ireland last night in front of our eyes on our television screens.  It is to be regretted and it is certainly not being done in the name of the majority of people in Northern Ireland and everyone in the South.  Those involved in the rioting should desist in the interests of future generations.  The present generation has given them an opportunity that the preceding generation did not have for the previous 30 or 35 years.  I look forward to the Taoiseach attending this House later to discuss and hear the views of party leaders and spokespersons on Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Mullen, Alex White, Leyden, Ormonde, Twomey, Regan, Coghlan, Cummins, Walsh, McFadden and O&rsquo;Reilly expressed their views on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill.  It is one of the most important Bills to have come before us for consideration.  I confirm that there is no time limit whatsoever on Committee and Remaining Stages.  There will be all the time in the world for colleagues to make their views known during the debate, with the Minister present.  He will be in the House all day and into the early hours of tomorrow morning for all sections of the Bill.</P>

        <P>Senator Leyden correctly pointed out the dilemma facing taxi drivers.  One&rsquo;s heart would go out to these poor unfortunate taxi drivers.  Every day we come into this House, we see queues of taxis whose drivers are trying to make a living.  One wonders what time of the day they will get a fare.

	<P>Senator Coffey referred to the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Meade, who upheld 63% of complaints.  I will see if time can be left aside to discuss this issue on our return.  Senators Coffey and Twomey also referred to the rural environment protection scheme, REPS 4 as we know it.  We will have to get an up-to-date position on that issue and I will revert to the House on the Order of Business tomorrow morning.  It is certainly exercising the minds of everyone in the agriculture sector.  We want to play our part as representatives in assisting the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in any way we possibly can.  </P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate, in view of the recession, on the situation facing those who were born in the boom years.  I will arrange to have time left aside to discuss this matter after the recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris correctly pointed out the need for everyone to play their part, including Members of the Oireachtas.  He has given a good example and Senators have accepted a 25% reduction in our travelling allowances, as well as a 10% levy, which is substantial.  It represents about &euro;20,000 to most Senators living outside the Dublin area, which is a large amount of money because a Senator&rsquo;s salary is a humble one in a sense.  When one takes into consideration the cost of running a car and everything to do with being a Senator at present, the allowances only cover what is really necessary.  I fully support the Senator&rsquo;s view that if everyone in the public service is playing their part, we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should do so also, and we are playing our part.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in respect of issues concerning his native town of Killarney that he has been highlighting and outlining to the House.  He asked the Cathaoirlech to have this issue discussed on the Adjournment.  I listen to his views with great interest every time he brings them to the attention of the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly referred to the GAA and it is a matter of pride and joy for our country to see the achievements of the Gaelic Athletic Association.  This year marks the 125th anniversary of the greatest amateur athletic organisation, possibly in Europe.  Every weekend we celebrate those achievements.  Those of us who have had the benefit of being life-long members of the association know the value of the GAA to Ireland and what it did for us, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; outlined to the House last year, concerning the reunification of our country and where it is today.</P><Col N="1201"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Senator Buttimer raised certain issues.  I am endeavouring to provide an update on the bilateral adoption agreement with Vietnam and hopefully I will be able to do so on the Order of Business tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Glynn sought an urgent debate on road safety, particularly concerning young drivers with souped-up cars.  There are many such distractions for young people today.

	<P>It shows how times have changed in Ireland, and thank God they have.  I see a reverend representative in the Visitors Gallery.  We will certainly allow time to debate this matter with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s call for a discussion on speed limits.  We welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement yesterday that 300 km of roads are to be assigned as motorways. </P>
        <P>Senators Walsh and McFadden called for an update on the position relating to the swine flu.  I will endeavour to have an updated position on this tomorrow morning from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  It is a serious challenge.  Many people were shocked when they saw on television last night a report that a doctor had died within days of contracting swine flu.  It just goes to show how serious this challenge is and how difficult it is to combat this type of influenza pandemic.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with Senator McFadden&rsquo;s sentiments concerning the Well Woman clinic.  Everyone should be able to avail of the vaccine to which she referred.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan called for a debate on child protection.  She outlined once again her concerns about the 420 missing children who were in the care of the HSE.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s strong concerns to the Minister this week.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the &euro;3,000 per week it costs to supply bottled water in Galway.  He also mentioned that 25% of ice cubes are made from contaminated water.  It is a matter of serious concern and I have noted his comments in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to present this Bill to the House.  There has been much debate and commentary, inside and outside these Houses, concerning the content of the Bill and the process of its enactment.  Regrettably, much of it has been misleading and, for that reason, I wish to clarify again the background to and purpose of this Bill and to confirm my conviction that there should be no delay in its enactment.</P>
        <P>In recent years there has been a significant increase in the activities of organised crime gangs, which has been accompanied by a ruthless determination to impede investigation and prosecution.  As I told the Lower House, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that there is no doubt that investigations into the criminal activities of such gangs are hampered by the unwillingness of people to come forward.  Such unwillingness is a result of a fear that has grown following recent murders, including the tragic case of Roy Collins.  These killings emphasise the complete disregard of those gangs for the rule of law and a determination to intimidate entire communities.  Beyond the absolute tragedy of this or any murder, it confirms in the minds of the public the threat posed by these gangs and creates the climate of fear that is so conducive to the maintenance of control by criminal gangs within their communities.  This was described as a wall of silence by one High Court judge and neither the Government nor the Oireachtas should stand by and let the criminal justice system be so undermined.</P>
        <P>The threat to witnesses already is clearly accepted.  Instances of intimidation of witnesses have been evidenced by withdrawn statements, refusals to testify or failure to recall events.  Legislation was changed a few years ago to take this into account and despite what people have stated both inside and outside the Lower House, that has worked very well.  Does anyone really suppose that groups that would kill in retaliation for a witness giving evidence would for some reason draw the line at the intimidation of jurors?  I have no doubt that jurors will continue to do their duty conscientiously in a wide range of cases.  However, the Garda Commissioner has made it clear that the threat is now such that in dealing with gangland crime, the effective administration of justice would be best served by the use of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>During the debates in the D&aacute;il, a number of Members of that House who are familiar with the communities within which these gangs operate stated their belief that jury intimidation occurs.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, set out the situation during the 2003 trial of Kieran Keane in Limerick and noted that, despite issuing more than 700 jury summonses, a panel of 12 could not be established.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, also confirmed that his city of Limerick has changed radically in the past ten years and spoke of how dozens of people come to his constituency office each year with fear in their eyes following a call to serve on a jury in Limerick.  Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell of Fine Gael also stated that intimidation was rife in that community.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and <Col N="1204"/>the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, also related the disturbing tale of being photographed and filmed by criminal gangs on the day they joined thousands of citizens on a march in that city following the brutal murder of Roy Collins.  Deputy Finian McGrath spoke of the situation in Dublin and confirmed the concern of his constituents should they be asked to sit on a jury dealing with gangland crime.  Other Deputies on both sides of the D&aacute;il spoke strongly in favour of the Bill.  This support was further reflected by the large majority which passed this Bill last Friday.  However, I emphasise again that the Government introduced this Bill on foot of strong advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the effect there is a level of fear and intimidation in those areas in which the aforementioned criminal gangs operate.</P>
        <P>It may be argued that the fear expounded by the Deputies and others is based on the perception of persons within the community rather than actual instances of jury intimidation.  Unlike the recanting of witness statements, which are often a clear indication of intimidation, an unwillingness by jurors to come forward with complaints of intimidation makes proving such interference with the justice system extremely difficult.  However, I remind Senators of the comments of Mr. Michael Murray, the State solicitor in Limerick, when speaking on &ldquo;The Week In Politics&rdquo; on 5 July, that in the recent past he had asked the Garda to investigate a case in which a juror was clearly frightened.  Furthermore, in his view, the atmosphere had been poisoned to such a degree that people were reluctant to serve on juries.  He went on to state that the verdict handed down in that particular trial differed from that which was expected and that he believed this was because of intimidation of that juror and a number of other jurors on that jury.  Last Sunday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> reported former High Court judge Feargus Flood as stating he had presided over gangland trials in which he believed juries had returned the wrong verdict.  The stark fact is that members of such gangs have displayed a callous disregard for human life and a brazen contempt for their communities.  They have come to believe that they can take on the criminal justice system and act as a law unto themselves.  It is beyond question that criminal gangs will try to take whatever action is open to them to thwart the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>The Government decision to provide for a limited number of specific offences pertaining to organised crime to be prosecuted in the Special Criminal Court was not taken lightly.  It was based on the strong advice of the Garda Commissioner and took account of information provided by him and others involved in the criminal justice system, which detailed instances of threats and intimidation.  Furthermore, I am introducing offences here today that are inextricably linked to organised crime.  A person will not be before the court on a murder, firearms or drugs charge but on a charge of directing the activities of a criminal organisation or of participating or contributing to a criminal organisation.  The impact of that fact alone on the likelihood of successfully intimidating a prospective juror cannot be ignored.</P>
        <P>Alternatives to scheduling these offences were considered.  However, options such as sequestering jurors, using jurors outside the community from which the defendant comes, shielding jurors from sight of the open court or providing round the clock protection for jurors are not viable and will not guarantee freedom from intimidation.  The Government questioned the Garda in this regard and it mostly is because the Twenty-six Counties is a very small community.  The tentacles of these criminal gangs extend beyond the geographic parts from which they originate into many other regions, as can be demonstrated by some high profile murders that have been carried out on contract by these criminals.  These gangs have sophisticated networks capable of identifying those they perceive as thwarting their activities, and their ability to carry out surveillance is evidenced by the increase in recent years in tiger kidnappings.  In the view of the Government and the Garda Commissioner, the Special Criminal Court and its <Col N="1205"/>non-jury format is the single most effective means of successfully prosecuting such gangs and one should not wait for a further escalation in intimidation.</P>
        <P>The enactment of this legislation is crucial.  Those who state it can be delayed until the autumn ignore the point that at present under Irish law there is no offence of directing organised crime.  Until the Bill is enacted, the steps to investigate, charge and ultimately prosecute those who are directing others in the commission of organised crime offences cannot be taken.  I have heard some comments in recent weeks that the passage of the legislation should be delayed until September.  The reasoning is that, because the courts will not be sitting until then, these charges will not be prosecutable in those courts.  However, criminal law is not retrospective and were the Government to wait until September, no one could be charged in the meantime with any of the proposed new offences.</P>

	<P>Consequently, it is ludicrous to suggest delaying the Bill&rsquo;s passage until September because the courts are not sitting at present.  Were passage of the Bill to be delayed until September and were something to happen in the next week or so, we would not be able to charge people with directing or participating in a gangland crime.  The retrospectivity of legislation is very important in respect of the criminal law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not oblige the House to pass the Bill today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We also need to amend the provisions in regard to the offence of participation to effect the successful investigation of and prosecution for this offence.  We cannot afford to delay such matters as this legislation is needed now.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House also introduces amendments to detention and search powers that will, among other matters, address problems that have arisen during the hearing of applications to extend the time for questioning.  The Bill is in five Parts with 26 sections and I will highlight some of the main provisions.  Part 2 concerns organised crime.  In the main, this Part amends the organised crime provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  New measures are introduced and existing provisions are amended.  I wish to highlight the following sections.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends the existing definitions of &ldquo;criminal organisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;structured group&rdquo;.  The existence of a criminal organisation is a crucial element in proving the offences provided for under this Bill.  This section introduces a simpler formulation of the required definitions.  Section 5 introduces into Irish law an offence of directing a criminal organisation which criminalises the directing or controlling of activities of a criminal organisation including the supervision of such activities or the giving of orders.  This is to try to target gang lords rather than those who pull the trigger.  This provision will strengthen our ability to pursue those persons who direct and control the activities of their criminal gangs although not directly or personally involved in those activities.  The seriousness of the offence is recognised by the equally serious penalty of up to life imprisonment.  The introduction of this offence, in addition to providing a necessary tool to combat the threat of organised crime, is also a requirement of our obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime.</P>
        <P>The section provides significant detail on what &ldquo;directs&rdquo; means and sets out the evidence to which a court may have regard in determining whether the offence has been committed.  This was the subject of much deliberation by the Supreme Court in a recent case involving members of the Real IRA.  In drafting these provisions, it was considered appropriate for the purpose of consistency to replicate these provisions in section 6 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, which contains the offence of directing an unlawful organisation.  The amendment to the 1998 Act is contained in section 25 of the Bill.</P><Col N="1206"/>
        <P>Section 6 amends the participation in organised crime offence under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which will, where proven, carry a penalty of up to 15 years.  Additional evidential requirements have been introduced that will assist prosecution.  Facilitating the commission of a serious offence by a criminal organisation will not require proof that an actual offence was committed or that the accused had knowledge of a particular offence.</P>
        <P>Section 7 is an important provision.  The offences already outlined cannot be proven unless the existence of a criminal organisation is first established.  This is the reason for the inclusion of this section.  In particular, it allows for the hearing of evidence of a member or former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with appropriate experience and knowledge as to the existence of a criminal organisation.  During the debates to date, this provision has given rise to confusion.  The evidence of a garda under this section will not in any way go to establishing the guilt or otherwise of a defendant.  However, it will assist in meeting the first hurdle of a successful prosecution, establishing that the criminal organisation exists.  The absence of reference to Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rank in this provision is deliberate and was decided after much consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is crucial, in my view and the view of the Garda Commissioner, that the officer with the best knowledge and experience of the existence of a criminal organisation in a particular area should be the officer providing the evidence to the court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another significant provision is contained in section 8, which extends the remit of the Special Criminal Court to organised crime offences.  It is not a step taken lightly.  The Garda Commissioner has expressed strong concerns regarding jury intimidation.  Increasingly, prospective jurors are seeking reprieves from participation in trials involving criminal organisations.  Persons familiar with the communities and those working in the court system have convinced me that the threat is real.  We have, however, ensured that safeguards are included in the legislation.  For instance, the declaration that the ordinary courts are inadequate for the pursuit of these types of offences is without prejudice to the power of the DPP to direct that a person not be sent forward for trial by the Special Criminal Court on a particular charge.</P>
        <P>We have also included a clause whereby this section will cease to operate 12 months following the passing of the Act unless continued by a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Each House will have an opportunity at that time to examine the operation of this section.</P>
        <P>Under existing law, the DPP already has the option to send a member of a criminal gang forward for trial to the Special Criminal Court.  We are proposing that a limited number of organised crime offences should be tried before the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP is satisfied that, in a particular case, the ordinary courts are adequate.  This approach ensures clarity and certainty in the law.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides for inferences to be drawn from a failure of a defendant, prior to being charged, to answer any question material to the investigation of the offence.  This replicates similar provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2007, including a number of safeguards such as the electronic recording of questioning and that a reasonable opportunity must be given to consult a lawyer.  An inference drawn under this section cannot solely or mainly be relied on to convict.</P>
        <P>Section 14 introduces post-release restriction on certain activities orders.  These orders can be applied at sentencing and will take effect on the person&rsquo;s release from prison.  The order can apply restrictions on the person&rsquo;s movements, actions or activities, impose conditions on the person&rsquo;s participation in any activity and apply restrictions relating to the person&rsquo;s associations.  This section was amended in the D&aacute;il on foot of a Fine Gael proposal requiring a scheme to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas setting out the categories of restrictions and conditions that may be imposed, to give the judge directions.</P><Col N="1207"/>
        <P>Section 16 increases the penalty for witness or jury intimidation from ten years to 15 years.  Part 3 of the Bill contains three sections that amend section 7 of the Offences against the State Act 1939, sections 7 and 8 of the Criminal Law Act 1997 and section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  These amendments arise out of an obligation to legislate for particular provisions of the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime.  Parties to that convention are required to establish jurisdiction over obstruction of justice offences in certain circumstances where the offence occurs outside the State.  These circumstances are where the offence occurs on board an Irish ship or aircraft or was committed by an Irish citizen or by a person ordinarily resident in Ireland.  Section 7 of the 1939 Act contains the offence of obstruction of Government, including the Judiciary, and is amended in section 18 of the Bill.  The provisions of Irish law being amended in these sections contain offences relating to the obstruction of justice.</P>
        <P>That leads to Part 4 of the Bill, which amends provisions on Garda powers of detention and re-arrest.  My amendments are primarily concerned with the conduct of the court hearings when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to have the period of detention extended.  My objectives are to limit the possibilities for the disclosure of sensitive information, to reduce the risk of diverting garda&iacute; unnecessarily from pursuing the ongoing investigations and to ensure court time is not taken up unnecessarily in dealing with constitutional questions that fall outside the jurisdiction of the courts concerned.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has powers under a number of statutes to detain persons arrested in connection with serious offences.  The permitted duration of detention varies.  Similarly, certain powers are directed at particular offences.  The most frequently used power is in section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  It applies to all offences having a penalty of five years or more and provides for detention up to a maximum of 24 hours.  Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 apply to a more limited range of offences but only to ones that justify the possibility of detention for up to seven days.  Section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 permits detention up to 72 hours.</P>
        <P>Detention is for fixed periods and at the initial stages it is authorised and, if necessary, extended by a senior garda.  However, detention in excess of 48 hours is, as a rule, only permitted on the authorisation of a District Court and occasionally a Circuit Court.  Experience in recent times has made it clear that hearings of applications to extend the detention period are being used to elicit as much information as possible from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the current state of the investigation and its direction.  This can seriously undermine an investigation.</P>
        <P>Part 4 responds to this new trend in a number of ways.  It provides that the court may direct that the applications be heard <i>in camera</i> or that certain persons or the public may be excluded.  If the court agrees that some particular information is very sensitive and that its disclosure would harm the investigation, it may in those exceptional circumstances hear the evidence from a garda without anybody else being present.  Having heard the information, the court may then decide that the information can be given in open court.  The Bill also clarifies that the publication of details relating to an extension of time application, other than that it has taken place and the decision, is prohibited.</P>
        <P>In the interests of efficiency, the Bill also provides that the garda making the application for an extension of time, who must be of at least the rank of superintendent, can give oral evidence on matters not within his or her knowledge but within the knowledge of another member.  This provision is subject to the court being able to require the attendance of that other garda to give oral evidence if it is required in the interests of justice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The same risk of prejudice to ongoing investigations can also arise in the case of applications to court for a warrant to re-arrest a suspect for a particular offence or for a search warrant. <Col N="1208"/> These applications are not on notice to the suspect.  Nevertheless, hearings in open court could result in the disclosure of sensitive information.  The Bill addresses this risk by providing that re-arrest applications are to be made <i>in camera</i>.  Section 26, which is in Part 5, makes a similar clarification in respect of search warrant applications.</P>
        <P>It is worth recalling that the court has a limited function in these matters.  It must be satisfied that the extension of time is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence and that the investigation is being conducted expeditiously and diligently.  My amendments will cause the court and the parties to re-focus on those points rather than engage in some other expedition to query the lawfulness of the arrest and detention, which is not a matter for that court.  The hearing is not intended to be a focus for issues relating to the lawfulness of arrest and detention.  Under the Constitution, that is a matter for the High Court primarily, as confirmed by the Supreme Court as long ago as 1990.  My amendments clarify that issues relating to the validity of the arrest and detention are not proper to a hearing of an application for an extension of a detention period.  This clarification will ensure that the garda&iacute; concerned with the arrest and detention of a suspect are not required to be at the courthouse ready to give evidence in case the lawfulness of the arrest and detention is raised by the defence.  Instead, they can get on with the investigation.</P>
        <P>The amendments will greatly improve the operation of the detention powers by eliminating in so far as is possible the risk of sensitive information being disclosed to the suspect or his or her associates and in terms of the best use of Garda personnel.  This will put an end to the perception in some quarters that a trip to the courthouse is an opportunity to waste time.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to other amendments in this Part which are specific to individual detention powers.  The House will recall that the detention powers in sections 2 and 4 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 were subject to renewal by way of resolutions passed in each House of the Oireachtas.  The most recent resolution passed was for a two-year period and expires on 31 December 2010.  It is clear that these powers are a necessary part of the armoury in the fight against drug crime.  Therefore, I propose to end the requirement for renewal.  I indicated my intention to make the provisions permanent when the provisions were last renewed.  This is achieved by section 22.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 23 extends the scope of section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 to the organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as amended by the Bill.  As I outlined, section 50 permits detention up to a maximum of seven days for very serious offences involving the use of a firearm or explosives.  The Garda, in its advice to me, made it clear that such increased detention powers are necessary given the nature of the Part 7 offences and the difficulties arising from the lengths to which the people involved will go to thwart the Garda investigation of these offences.</P>
        <P>In addition, the nature of these offences is such that the process of gathering the information that garda&iacute; need to put to suspects in custody can be slow.  Often, it must be done against a background of intimidation and internecine feuding.  I emphasise that there is no question of all persons suspected of such offences being held for seven days.  Experience of the operation of section 50 to date and the Drug Trafficking Act over the past 13 years is that the longer periods of detention are used very sparingly.  I acknowledge that this is a significant package.  However, I remind Senators that there is nothing in the Bill which does not already exist in Irish law.</P>
        <P>We are facing an extraordinary threat requiring a determined response.  I repeat that the step is not being taken lightly but it is one that we are convinced must be taken.  This must be put in the context of what happened in recent months.  After the awful murder of Shane <Col N="1209"/>Geoghegan I and the Government were put under considerable pressure inside and outside the Oireachtas to introduce legislation.  At that time we stated that we had enough legislation or more than was required and that the Garda had all the resources.  I do not want to have a hierarchy of murders but the murder of Roy Collins was a watershed and a tipping point, as Deputy Rabbitte described the murder of Shane Geoghegan.  People were willing to wait four years to take it out on a family &mdash; not on a person who gave evidence as I saw in one article in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  A leading human rights lawyer wrote that Roy Collins was killed because he was a witness in a trial.  He was not a witness in a trial; he was the son of a man who was a witness in a trial.</P>
        <P>That was the tipping point whereby we had to re-examine the legislation on our statute books and one of the aspects we considered was amending the provisions on participation, which were in existing legislation but had not been used because the proofs required were convoluted.  This Bill amends that to make it easier and simpler to ground a prosecution for participation.  For the first time, we are including an offence of directing a criminal organisation, something not in our legislation heretofore, and there was a lacuna in that respect.  It was necessary to introduce it to follow those people because the Garda have been extremely successful in getting the people who pulled the trigger but not so successful at getting the gang lords and orchestrators of these awful murders.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government strongly believes that the Bill is required, based on the advice given by the Garda Commissioner and on the statements of State solicitor Michael Murray over the past five years about a level of fear and intimidation in communities making people not co-operate as witnesses and not come forward for jury service, not just in Limerick but throughout the country and in areas in Dublin such as Finglas.  One must consider the figures that clearly show when a gangland trial occurs in Limerick the numbers drop dramatically and they go back up when the trial is over.  People suggest we should move the trials to Dublin but I assure Senators that the strong advice of the Garda is that in a country the size of ours this is not feasible and the Garda has empirically hard evidence that these people have tentacles throughout the country with colleagues and associates who can take out people and intimidate people.</P>
        <P>The Bill is necessary; it is not taken lightly but I would not want anyone to overstate it.  Let us be frank, up to last weekend people have stated that the Bill contains provisions for opinion evidence whereby a garda of any rank can state that Mr. Joe Bloggs is a member of a criminal gang.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in the Bill and I wish people would stop stating it.</P>

	<P>Expert.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that we were asked to include it in the Bill but we did not do so because it is completely different to try to prove that someone is a member of a terrorist or paramilitary organisation than to prove that someone is a member of a criminal gang; it is far more difficult to prove that somebody is a member of a criminal gang.  That is why as an alternative to opinion evidence the Attorney General advised that to set the scene and prove the existence of a criminal gang it was necessary for a garda to give evidence that a criminal gang existed in a particular geographic area, but that garda would not indicate a view or opinion as to the guilt or otherwise of the accused.  The garda would not state that an accused was a member of that gang; that would require other proofs.</P><Col N="1210"/>
      
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael tabled an amendment in the D&aacute;il and tabled one here to state that the garda giving this evidence should be a chief superintendent.  A chief superintendent could sit in an office and would not have any direct knowledge of the existence of a gang.  Any lawyer worth his or her salt would be able to drive a coach and four through that evidence on cross-examination because of the lack of personal knowledge.  The Garda was strongly of the view that we should leave the rank as any rank.  I have been given an assurance that normally it will be a detective inspector who will give evidence on the existence of a gang.  People should not confuse this and criticise the Bill for what is not in it.  There has been a large element of that and whether it is that people have not read the Bill, put pen to paper, gone on the public airways without reading it or are endeavouring to throw some confusion into the system, I strongly urge people to hone in on what we are trying to do here.  I believe we all have the same goal, that is, to rid this country of the significant threat from criminal gangs.  The killing of Roy Collins was the tipping point in that it is clear there are people who are prepared to intimidate and the more we can do to obviate the necessity for civilian involvement in gangland crime trials before the criminal justice system, the better.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, it is the Director of Public Prosecutions who makes these decisions but the Oireachtas is sending out a strong signal that only these particular offences should be triable in the Special Criminal Court where there are no juries unless the DPP orders otherwise.  That is the correct way because it is sending a strong message to Irish society and to the criminal gangs who know they will not be able to intimidate jurors.  That, combined with the surveillance legislation the President signed today, will obviate the necessity for civilian witnesses in gangland crime trials.  I am not saying we will not require witnesses in the Special Criminal Court.  We will but as much as we can, while maintaining the right to a fair trial and adhering to people&rsquo;s human rights, it is important that we reduce as much as possible the civilian element of gangland crime trials because that has been acknowledged by the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Hederman committee, which examined the issue of the continuation of the Special Criminal Court.  It is not just for paramilitary crime.  It is also for organised crime because it is to the advantage of those people that they thwart the trials that are taking place to ensure they continue operating as they have done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would welcome the comments of Senators.  We have accepted amendments in the D&aacute;il.  We accepted a Fine Gael amendment as part of the submission from the Irish Human Rights Commission.  We accepted a substantial amendment, which is now part of the Bill before us, on the issue of inferences.  We accepted what they were saying regarding the wide nature of the original proposal.  The Bill has been amended fairly substantially by Government amendments, by the Fine Gael amendment and by the Irish Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s suggested amendments also.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for outlining the purpose of the Bill.  He has not explained, however, why it was necessary to guillotine the discussion on this Bill in the Lower House and the reason it is necessary that we deal with all Stages of this Bill today.  I assume that is taking place at his prompting.</P>
        <P>I raise that issue because we all share the same concerns about gangland and organised crime, which I will come to, but the divisions created on this Bill in the Oireachtas would not have been necessary if the Minister had allowed adequate time for debate and consideration of amendments both in committee and on the different Stages.  The Minister makes my case in that regard because he has just referred to accepting an amendment from Fine Gael but I <Col N="1211"/>understand only six amendments were debated in the D&aacute;il.  If there had been further debate on the other amendments and the matters teased out, the Minister might have found it wise to accept other amendments.  Guillotining the legislation and rushing it through this House, and not having the D&aacute;il in session to receive the Bill if amendments are made in this House, means that the whole process is guillotined.  That is the root of the division on this issue.</P>
        <P>On the Bill itself, Fine Gael agrees with the principle of the Bill.  We agree with making it an offence to direct, participate in or actively support criminal gangs and we believe it is appropriate to make all of those matters offences.  There is no division regarding the principle of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The background to this is that we have moved from a position of zero tolerance, which was the electoral platform of Fianna F&aacute;il in 1997.  Twelve years later, far from that being realised, we are in a position where gangland crime has flourished under the watch of this Minister and previous Ministers of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administrations in the past 12 years.  Since 2005 there have been 102 gun murders, as a result of which there were only four convictions.  There have been 15 gangland murders to date in 2009.  There were 20 in 2008.  That is what has occurred under the watch of the Minister.  It is an admission of failure, in setting out the justification for this Bill, that the system of administration and justice is ineffective to deal with these issues but that is the position we are faced with and that is the reason we support the main elements of this Bill.</P>
        <P>Everyone has had a view on the Bill including the criminal Bar, the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and former judges but it is for the Oireachtas, after careful scrutiny of this legislation, to make a judgment on whether the legislation is necessary and proportionate and, in that regard, whether there are adequate safeguards to ensure it is upheld by the courts and found, when challenged, to be constitutional.  That is the only concern we in Fine Gael have with regard to this legislation.  We wish to play our role in scrutinising it, ensuring it is immune from legal challenge and that it does the job it is intended to do.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk about intimidation of witnesses and jurors.  I have no difficulty with the concerns expressed about the intimidation of jurors, whether it is occurring wholesale or in specific instances, in terms of gangland crime.  It is clear, however, that we cannot know that because what juror whose life or family is threatened if he or she acts in a particular way will ever reveal that is happening because then the threat will be realised?  Given the insidious and pernicious nature of gangland crime and the extent of intimidation, I see justification for having recourse to the Special Criminal Courts.  In debates in this House I have indicated that I believe the Special Criminal Courts have a role in that area.</P>
        <P>That is not just a political judgment.  The Special Criminal Courts, which originally were designed to deal with subversive activities and the threat to the State, have been found, as the Minister said, to be appropriate in dealing with other forms of crime and offences.  The Oireachtas Library &amp; Research Service has outlined the number of cases in which this issue has been addressed by the courts.  In the case of The People (DPP) <i>v.</i> Quilligan, Mr. Justice Walsh in the Supreme Court stated that it does not follow that the power of the Government to issue a proclamation to the effect that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of peace and order must necessarily apply only with reference to the type of offences created by Parts 2 and 3 of the Offences Against the State Act.  He went on to state that there could well be a grave situation in dealing with ordinary gangsterism or well financed and well organised large scale drug dealing or other situations where it might be believed or established that juries were, for some corrupt reason <Col N="1212"/>or by virtue of threats or illegal interference, being prevented from doing justice.  That goes back to 1986 and it is, perhaps, where we are today.</P>
        <P>There was also a legal challenge in the case of Kavanagh <i>v.</i> Ireland [1996].  The applicant argued that, even though the appropriate certificate had been granted by the DPP that his was a case in which ordinary courts were inadequate, the continuance of the Special Criminal Court for avowedly non-subversive offences was manifestly unconstitutional.  Judge Barrington found that &ldquo;the issue involved is not the nature of the offences but the adequacy, in the opinion of the Government or the Director of Public Prosecutions, of the ordinary courts to secure the effective administration of justice in relation to them&rdquo;.  Hogan and Whyte in <i>J. M. Kelly: The Irish Constitution</i> <i> (Dublin 2004)</i> , conclude that the practical effect of this decision is &ldquo;to render it all but impossible to mount a legal challenge to a decision of the Government to establish or maintain in force the Special Criminal Court&rdquo;.  The Bill deems these offences as appropriate to be dealt with by the Special Criminal Court.  In the case of gangland crime it is appropriate to establish the legal basis for this.</P>
        <P>The real question is what safeguards are being put in place.  A number of amendments have been tabled by Fine Gael.  We see the uncorroborated opinion of a garda, the departure from the principle of jury trial and secret hearings for the extension of detention as problems.  There should, at least, be some record of those proceedings.  In these types of issues, the introduction of safeguards makes interference with the constitutional right to liberty proportionate.  That is why Fine Gael believes that proper debate on these amendments and proper scrutiny of the Bill can improve the legislation and ensure that it is fit for purpose.</P>
        <P>The Minister presents the Bill as a panacea for every ill.  This Bill, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill and other recent criminal law legislation leave the Minister with no excuse not to ensure more effective detection and prosecution of crime.  The record, to date, is dismal.  The Minister says this Bill is very important and that he has information from the Garda Commissioner and from all his intelligence resources and advisers that it is important.  A legislative response to recent atrocities and brutal killings of innocent people is required.  When this Bill is enacted there can be no excuses.</P>
        <P>It is not legislation which is getting in the way of effective law enforcement and it is not always the lack of legislation which creates the barrier to effective law enforcement.  There is an inconsistency between this legislation and the Minister&rsquo;s decisions regarding the allocation of resources.  We are freezing Garda numbers and cutting Garda overtime.  Key equipment is required by the Garda.  Digital radio is only now being provided.  A DNA database, which is required by EU legislation, is long promised but has not been delivered.  In 2009, there was a very modest, inadequate and ineffective increase in the budgetary allocation to Operation Anvil.  With regard to the importation of illegal drugs, one boat monitors more than 3,300 km of coastline, there is one mobile scanner for all ports and a virtual free-for-all at smaller and private airports.  The failure of the Government adequately to resource the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs and Excise service and to provide them with the most modern equipment is a serious impediment to effective law enforcement.</P>
        <P>The south-west coast has become a favourite arrival point for major drugs importation.  In 1996, &euro;125 million worth of cocaine was found on a boat in Cork Harbour, in 1998, &euro;61 million worth was seized in Kinsale and in 2007, &euro;444 million worth was seized in Dunlough Bay in west Cork.  More recently, the largest seizure in the history of the State was made 200 miles off the south-west coast when a joint EU task force traced a yacht carrying &euro;500 million worth of cocaine.  The resourcing of the Garda and the Customs and Excise service is vital.</P><Col N="1213"/>
        <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has stated that the reduction in the budget for his office will mean it will not be able effectively to carry out its task in the prosecution of crime.  I do not understand why the Minister is silent on this issue.  Fine Gael emphasises the importance of this legislation and supports it, subject to adequate scrutiny and the inclusion of adequate safeguards to ensure it works effectively.</P>
        <P>The Minister has not addressed the prioritisation of resources for the forces of law and order.  There must be a balance between introducing and enforcing  legislation.  We recently passed the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.  If that legislation is to be effective, we need the most modern surveillance equipment and training resources for those who will operate it.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will submit amendments on Committee Stage to improve the Bill and make it more effective and fit for purpose.  Our major objection is to the manner in which the Minister conducts his business in the D&aacute;il and in this House.  To rush legislation which is important for law enforcement and fundamental rights is unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill.  I compliment him on the manner in which the Bill was presented to the House.  His presentation was inspiring and his hands-on approach to the issue gives us confidence that he is well briefed on the issue.  </P>
        <P>The Bill is not being introduced on the Minister&rsquo;s whim.  It follows advice from top level garda&iacute;, particularly the Garda Commissioner.  This fact must not be ignored.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the comments of the State solicitor for Limerick city, Mr. Michael Murray, on a recent radio programme.  I empathise with his comments.  They solidify and add another dimension of support for the Bill.</P>
        <P>One cannot ignore the remarks of people like Mr. Justice Flood.  Among his other comments, he stated that major trials had fallen the wrong way.  One would also be foolish to ignore the remarks of Deputies from Limerick, including Fine Gael&rsquo;s Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, an outspoken individual by nature who lives in the hub of gangland activity.  Unfortunately, Limerick seems to be the capital of major criminal gangs and the Minister has second-hand knowledge from the people on the ground.  These issues cannot be ignored.</P>
        <P>A few years ago, Canada had a considerable problem with biker gangs.  For two decades, ruthless gangs intimidated and infiltrated Canada&rsquo;s major cities and drastic legislation needed to be introduced to control them.  With the aid of good policing and a strengthening of the laws available to the police and judiciary, some of the largest and most ruthless gangs ever to stalk Canada were brought to heel and broken up.</P>
        <P>Let us be realistic.  In Limerick and parts of Dublin &mdash; I noted heroin&rsquo;s recent impact in Cork city, which is closer to home for me &mdash; the situation is out of control, more or less.  I listened carefully to Senator Regan&rsquo;s comments on providing better technology to the Garda, providing more funding to Operation Anvil etc.  To a large extent, I do not have a problem in this regard.  However, there is not much point in giving the Garda the best equipment and radios if we fail at the last fence.  A Beecher&rsquo;s Brook seems to be emerging in legal parlance, that is, we can only get so far.  The garda&iacute; on the ground know what is occurring and which culprits are directing the crimes, but they do not have a legal framework.  The Bill provides the necessary mainstay of a legal framework in addition to the surveillance Bill and other criminal justice Bills.  The Minister is correct to ensure that the legislation moves through the House swiftly.</P>
        <P>The direction of organised crime is an appalling action.  Some of it has been done from prison cells, the Costa del Sol, Bulgaria or apartments in Amsterdam.  As we must strengthen our laws in response, the Bill is not before time.  When reading stories in the media, one would be <Col N="1214"/>inclined to take one side or the other unless one was balanced.  Since the Bill came into the limelight two or three weeks ago, I have read a number of journalists&rsquo; substantial reports.  I was taken aback when three eminent crime journalists stated that they were afraid due to the intimidation and threats by certain individuals and gangs.  This situation cannot be ignored.  Do we wait for another Veronica Guerin-style murder?  Do we wait for a member of the Judiciary or a politician who stands up against gangs to be intimidated or attacked?  I think not.  We should move swiftly and introduce the legislation into the Statute Book.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and his discretion.  A number of innocent people have been affected in recent years.  The Minister made an impassioned comment that the murder of Roy Collins was the step too far, that someone had dared to take out a person who, rather that being directly involved, was a relation of a witness who had been brave enough to give evidence.  Other victims include Shane Geoghegan, Brian Fitzgerald, Anthony Campbell, Donna Cleary, Baiba Saulite, Edward Ward and Wayne Doherty.  The Bill will try to deal with this type of crime.  In fairness to the Minister and with all respect to my learned colleague, Senator Regan, the Minister never stated that the Bill would be a panacea, a utopian answer to everything, unless it was stated on the QT.  He realises that, put together with other criminal legislation like a jigsaw puzzle, it will buttress our defences and strengthen the arms of the Garda.</P>
        <P>I was taken aback when I read the letter sent to <i>The Irish Times</i> by a group of defence lawyers.  They were outspoken in their condemnation of the Bill.  While I do not question the integrity of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, I sometimes wonder where it is coming from.  I am baffled that, when the people I named were murdered, those eminent lawyers and the ICCL did not express their outrage in a letter.  We need a balance and it is important that we get it right.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains tough measures, but they are necessary.  It is not an easy step for the Government to include organised crime in the Schedule of offences in the Offences Against the State Act so that people can be tried in the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP directs otherwise.  It is important to note the creation of a new offence of directing a criminal organisation that will carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, the mules who take drugs from A to B and who are often drug users who cannot stand up to bullies are those who are given five, seven or ten years in jail.  The people behind the scenes are professional and sophisticated.  Most do not even use drugs or alcohol.  They are the ones who direct the organisations and the trafficking.  They seem to be above and beyond the law.  This legislation will see some of them quaking in their shoes.  If so, I will be happy.</P>
        <P>The Bill will create an amended offence with a penalty of up to 15 years, namely, the participation or involvement in organised crime.  It is important to note that expert Garda opinion evidence on the existence and operations of criminal gangs will be admissible in evidence.  I had a small doubt about this, but the Minister clarified the situation.  Previously, such difficult legislation demanded, for example, a chief superintendent.  Senator Regan referred to my area, which has an expansive coastline where major drug hauls came ashore recently.  A chief superintendent might live 60 or 70 miles from where the activity is, but a local detective, detective sergeant or, as the Minister stated, a detective inspector would have a more intimate knowledge of the offences occurring on the ground.  It is a serious matter.</P>
        <P>It is important to note the reason for the Bill&rsquo;s urgency.  On my way to the Oireachtas today, I was glad to note that the surveillance Bill had been signed into law by the President.  It is an important bow in the armoury of criminal justice legislation.</P><Col N="1215"/>
        <P>I believe I am correct in stating this legislation is to be reviewed annually.  If, in three years, circumstances change and the criminal gangs have been dispersed, it will be possible for the Oireachtas to amend it and revert to more normal legislation for dealing with criminal offences.  One might assume every action encompassed by this Bill will end up in the Special Criminal Court without any jury but there are safeguards in this respect.  It is important to note these checks and balances, whose aim is to protect human rights and avoid miscarriages of justice.  In particular, section 3 provides that the legislation will apply only to criminal organisations that exist for the purpose of committing or facilitating serious offences.  This will not affect the daily lives of ordinary citizens.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides that Garda expert opinion evidence is only admissible in evidence in regard to the proof of the existence of a criminal organisation, not to the proof of the particular crime being investigated.  It is important to note this.  The constitutional rights of the defendant are, therefore, protected.  Anybody in custody will always have the right to seek a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or to apply to the High Court to protect his constitutional rights.  The Bill does not have an impact on his constitutional rights.</P>
        <P>The safeguards in section 8 include a provision stipulating the legislation will lapse after one year unless the Oireachtas passes a resolution that it should continue in operation.  This must happen annually.  Section 8 also provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions has absolute discretion to determine whether an accused person should be tried in the Special Criminal Court or the ordinary courts.  That is a very important balance and I welcome it.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides that inferences can only be drawn from the failure of an accused to answer questions in certain defined circumstances.  The first is where the defendant is told in ordinary language the effect of such a failure when being questioned.  Second, the defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult a solicitor and, third, the interview in question must be recorded electronically.  Checks and balances protect the rights of the accused before any inferences can be drawn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that this legislation is tough but it is necessary.  If it saves even one life over the next 12 months or during the Oireachtas recess, it will have proved its worth.  If one gangland criminal, be he from Limerick, Cork or Dublin, is put behind bars on foot of the enactment of this legislation, it will be worth its weight in gold.  The legislation is strong and tough but necessary.  As Deputies, Ministers of State and Ministers stated in the D&aacute;il, things are out of hand.  The public, whose confidence must be restored, requires the coat of armour the Minister is providing with this legislation.  I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Quinn.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister.  I declare an interest in that I am a barrister who practises in the area of criminal law and who has done some work in the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>To respond to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, I have read the Bill in full.  The Minister stated some individuals who had commented on it had not.  Having read the Bill, I welcome the opportunity to debate it in the House but am very sorry we are having such a truncated debate.  It is most unfortunate that the Government is seeking to take all Stages of the Bill in one day.  This renders the debate a sham given that we know the D&aacute;il is not sitting and that a Minister will not be accepting amendments.  The ordering of business in this House needs to be carried out in a more measured and realistic manner that permits proper, reasoned debate on important legislation such as this.</P>
        <P>To respond to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, every speaker on this side of the House and the other would like to express outrage at the horrific killings that have taken place in the name of organised crime and which we all recognise have prompted the introduction of this Bill.  Senator <Col N="1216"/>O&rsquo;Donovan has listed some of those killed whose killings have caused considerable public revulsion, including Shane Goeghegan, Wayne Doherty and Roy Collins.  I agree with the Minister that the killing of Roy Collins represented a watershed in that it appeared to have been a direct attempt to undermine the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>While we all share the goal of ridding society of the threat of criminal gangs and share in the general revulsion of the killings, the main reason I oppose the Bill is because it will not help in any way the families of the victims of gangland killings.  It will not be effective in fighting organised crime.  Many people have expressed opposition to the Bill on that basis, including some garda&iacute;, who have expressed strong concern that it may be rendered ineffective, even if it is not referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26.  They fear it will very quickly become bogged down in constitutional challenges given the many changes it makes to some of the fundamental principles of our criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>There has been some exaggeration on the part of those who support the Bill in total.  The Minister, for example, began his speech by referring to the threat to witnesses and potential witnesses of crime, which is clearly accepted.  It is important, however, to point out the Bill does nothing to protect witnesses or potential witnesses.  The legislative steps already taken have been aimed much more directly at ensuring witnesses are afforded some protection or that other ways of giving evidence can be provided for.  I certainly welcome the recently passed Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, which, as the Minister stated, will result in a means of providing evidence without having to rely on witnesses.  We welcome the continued operation of the provision introduced some years ago allowing witness statements to be given, even where the witness later retracts.  Those measures were introduced to offer some protection against witness intimidation.</P>
        <P>The other side of the House has engaged in some lazy or cheap name calling, aimed at those who have expressed serious opposition to or concerns about the Bill.  It is not conducive to proper debate to call those us who have expressed doubt about the Bill woolly liberals or to state we are soft on crime.  That language has masked real concern by the Members on the Government side that they have gone too far with this Bill in an attempt, by the Minister it seems, to appear tough on crime.</P>
        <P>We do not oppose this Bill for the sake of it.  Many of us welcomed other criminal justice measures that were introduced.  I welcomed the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, which gives surveillance a statutory framework.  We were all anxious that that Bill be watertight and, in so far as possible, immune from challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not by any means oppose all the provisions in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009.  As with other Members, I recognise the need for certain measures, including tightening up the definitions in sections 3,  among them the definition of &ldquo;criminal organisation&rdquo;; the making of provision for extra-territorial effect in Part 3; and the increasing of the penalties for the intimidation of witnesses and jurors in section 16.</P>
        <P>While many elements of the Bill are welcome, it is worth noting, however, that many of its provisions amount to amendments of Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which itself was introduced to combat organised crime.  Many of the provisions in the latter have proven to be problematic, thereby resulting in the amendments.</P>
        <P>Serious objections must be raised regarding three aspects of the Bill in particular, which aspects were referred to by the 133 practising criminal barristers and solicitors who wrote a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> last week.  They were correct to ask for the withdrawal of the Bill and for more detailed and comprehensive debate thereon at a later date.  I share their view.  The provision in section 7 of the Bill that the existence of a criminal organisation can be proved by <Col N="1217"/>the opinion evidence of a garda or former garda of any rank is fundamentally flawed.  I have read the Minister&rsquo;s defence of it in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  That is based on a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of first principles of evidence because expert evidence is opinion evidence.  It  amounts to an exception to the general rule against the admission of opinion evidence but it does rely on a common understanding of what is meant by an expert.  We all accept that a forensic pathologist can interpret facts differently from a lay person.  I cannot look at a dead body and give the sort of evidence that Dr. Cassidy gives so well in so many cases because I do not have that expert knowledge.  By declaring somebody in legislation to be an expert does not make that person an expert in the sense of the exception to opinion evidence.  That is my fundamental concern about a garda or former garda giving evidence in this way.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />

	<P>It does not.  The court has to establish whether the person has the expertise or the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very difficult to see how a court will establish that in any proper way without going into the nature of the evidence.  </P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; have expressed some concerns that following cutbacks in the force and early retirements, the insertion of the &ldquo;former&rdquo; member may be recognition that many experienced garda&iacute; will have retired by the time the Bill comes into effect.</P>
        <P>I accept that the Minister is not inserting in legislation the provision that a garda can give opinion evidence that a person is a member of an organisation.  That would definitely have been a step too far.  There must, however, be a real concern about garda&iacute; giving evidence on matters such as this.</P>
        <P>My second principal objection is to the sweeping declaration in section 8 that &ldquo;the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice&rdquo;.  This undermines our criminal justice system.  The Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, to which the Minister referred, stated in page 6 of its observations: &ldquo;The IHRC considers that the developed system of criminal justice which exists in Ireland is capable of effectively confronting the problem of organised crime without resorting to a parallel criminal justice system that does not provide the accused with the right to trial by jury.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Section 8 contains the unprecedented adoption of a &ldquo;parallel criminal justice system&rdquo; outside the realm of so-called subversive offences in which the Special Criminal Court already operates.  It is unnecessary because the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, has the power to refer non-scheduled offences to the Special Criminal Court and used that power following that other watershed murder, that of Veronica Guerin, and the cases arising.  In Britain the prosecution can apply for a non-jury trial if there is evidence of the potential for jury tampering.  That is a preferable approach to this blanket or sweeping provision.  In sections 35 and 36 of the Offences against the State Act there is a different mechanism for declaring that the ordinary courts are &ldquo;inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice&rdquo; and that must be done by the Government.  Why is the Oireachtas doing this in this sweeping way in section 8?</P>
        <P>I am gravely concerned about the provisions of sections 21 to 23, inclusive, for secret hearings, that can take place on the extension of a person&rsquo;s detention in the absence of anyone other than the garda seeking the extension and the judge, and possibly a court clerk.  The Minister has defended these provisions on the basis of what is now a rather tired anecdote about an unnamed lawyer in Limerick.  A corrupt lawyer is a  very serious matter and that lawyer must be tried and if found guilty punished accordingly.  I do not believe, however, that we should throw the baby out with the bath water, or change the entire basis of the hearing system for extending detention just because there may be one example of corruption.  An <Col N="1218"/>alternative is possible, to exclude from the courtroom all except those directly concerned with the case or all except the lawyers for the prosecution and the defence.</P>
        <P>I have tabled amendments on the lawfulness of arrest and detention.  The Minister said that there is nothing in this Bill that is not already in Irish law, but I beg to differ.  The three points I have raised are unprecedented in scope and in the way they encroach on the fundamental right to a fair trial.  That is why I oppose the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Senator Bacik&rsquo;s giving me time to speak.  I feel reticent because most of those who spoke on the Bill are lawyers and I am not.  However, I opened a supermarket in Finglas many years ago and one in Limerick a few years ago, and I have been threatened with kidnap while several of our managers have been subjected to &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; kidnapping.  While I support what the Minister is attempting to do, I wonder do we have to go this far.  Are these the correct steps?  I agree with the Minister that the murder of Roy Collins was a tipping point, but there have been many other tipping points.  We have not had to face this horrific gang activity before.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said these are tough but necessary measures.  They are tough but are they necessary?</P>
        <P>I thought the problem with the juries had been solved because the DPP can certify that a case should go to the Central Criminal Court.  If that is so why does the Minister need this extra legislation?  I thought the Criminal Justice Act 2006 had solved the problem of witnesses who changed their minds after the garda&iacute; had videotaped their evidence.  That was a serious matter of witness intimidation.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that 700 jurors might be called but only a handful would turn up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>They could not get 12. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not seem to solve that problem, apart from doing away with jurors.  That is horrific.  We must be able to solve that problem.  I did not realise that was happening.  I have served only once on a jury.  I do not think this provision solves that problem.  </P>
        <P>The Garda Representative Association, GRA, is concerned about the Bill because it could be open to a legal challenge.  It is mainly worried about the Minister&rsquo;s amendment that would allow any serving or former garda to give opinion evidence in court relating to the existence of a criminal gang.  This could be interpreted as an individual opinion, rather than an expert opinion as the Minister claims, and could lead to defendants challenging the legislation.  The secretary general of the Garda association, P. J. Stone, said that the GRA was concerned that the onus and responsibility for garda testimony will be placed on all ranks.  The rank and file garda&iacute; are often the investigators who produce the files of evidence and it is sufficient for senior ranks to present these to the jury.  Will the Minister put my mind at rest about that?  I listened carefully to what he said today and support his intention to solve this problem but let us not repeat what the British did when they did away with their courts, and the Birmingham Six and others got an unfair deal.  Is there any danger that something like that could happen here too?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Rights in a free society are hard won.  They are protected by custom, precedent, common law, the Constitution, implicitly and directly, and legislation.  A free society should strive to protect all such rights at all times.  Very often rights are compromised by citizens who fail to act responsibly to respect the rights of others in society.  Unfortunately, a group of no more than a few hundred people are choosing to behave irresponsibly.  They do so in ways that are often loathsome and vile and they have threatened the security and often the lives of many of our citizens.  Regrettably, this has resulted in legislation of this type being <Col N="1219"/>proposed and debated.  It must be acknowledged that consideration of measures that compromise the rights of citizens as they have been practised diminishes us as a society.</P>
        <P>It is important that political debate is held in a proper context.  All the concerns that have been raised in this debate so far today and in the debate in the other House are legitimate views.  They should be aired and responded to.   We should be concerned about the fact that the measures proposed in this Bill will have an impact.  We need to strive to ensure that impact will be minimal and short-term.  The main measure in ensuring such protection exists is the review process.  This legislation will be reviewed on an annual basis.  There is an onus on the Minister in this respect.  When responding to this debate, I hope he will outline how such a robust review process can take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The template for legislation of this type is the legislation on the prevention of terrorism, which was also renewed on an annual basis on foot of a report that was laid in the Oireachtas Library and on which debates were subsequently held.  This current legislation deals with the rights of citizens and gangland crime as opposed to terrorism.  The review process of this legislation must be over and above that which applied to the other legislation in the past.  The onus should be on the Minister and the Department to prepare a review of the effect of this legislation in the first year following its enactment in terms of whether it is effective and whether any of the rights discussed in the debates in both of these Houses have been compromised in any way.  The review should also involve the input of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women&rsquo;s Rights before a report is finalised and debated in this Chamber and the other House.  If such a process does not take place, the fear has been expressed that the rubber-stamping exercise that took place year after year in terms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act will also happen in respect of this Bill.  We must acknowledge that these are measures that it is hoped will be temporary in nature.  We, as legislators, and the citizens of this country, need to see that they will be effective.  We must make sure that they will not be used in any way to compromise the rights of our citizens in general.</P>
        <P>Concern has been expressed about the role of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of powers they will be given under this legislation to identify the existence of a gang as opposed to individual gang members, which has been misrepresented in some contributions to date.  Concern has also been expressed about the power that will be given to judges in non-jury trials.  In passing legislation of this type we are placing great faith in trusting in people we believe are serving the interests of the State, our police force and our Judiciary.  It is hoped that in giving them that power, they will use it wisely.  It has tended to be used wisely in the past, but these powers should be used sparingly and we should strive to ensure that in time they may not be needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The existence of non-jury trials has been the subject of much of the debate on this legislation.  As the Minister pointed out, the difficulty in acquiring juries in particular cases has been used as a mitigating circumstance for what has been proposed in this respect.  It could well be that in general people are fearful of intimidation in terms of serving on a jury.  I have a concern that this legislation does not address that fear.  The wider problem of whether citizens are willing and able to serve on juries is one we as legislators need to address.  Many of the concerns expressed about those provisions can be taken on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all share a common view of the nature of the problem that exists, its seriousness and the fact that it needs to be dealt with.  This is not the type of legislation that can be dealt with in a &ldquo;politics as usual&rdquo; way.  This is not legislation in respect of which one can claim to be indulging in macho posturing to be harder than the people we are seeking to punish for threatening the lives of our citizens because that would diminish us as a society.  Neither is it the type of <Col N="1220"/>legislation in respect of which we should be engaging in knee-jerk liberalism that the right rather than the person is what we should be protecting in our society.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that we are debating this legislation more with a sense of sadness than of euphoric delight that the right thing is being done.  As to whether it is the right step, we will find that out at the time of the first review process in 12 months time.  From my party&rsquo;s point of view, if that review process is not robust and if it reveals that the legislation is ineffective and that rights are being compromised in an unnecessary way, then this legislation will need to be replaced.  We must be open and honest in saying that.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister responding to the ongoing concerns about this legislation.  In the sense of this legislation being necessary to deal with a serious situation, I appeal to him to also recognise that all who have participated in this debate have done so on the basis that they too wish to see a safe and secure society and their contributions need to be acknowledged rather than treated in a way that suggests their response is somehow soft on crime and missing the mark in regard to what needs to be done to solve this serious problem.</P>
        <P>I look forward not so much to the passage of this legislation today but to a time when we will not be talking about people in areas like Limerick who use threatening behaviour, who threaten to take the lives of innocent citizens to get their way and, by so doing, compromise the rights of all our citizens.  I hope that in a short timeframe legislation of this type will not be needed and we will live in a more peaceful, prosperous and safe society.  On those grounds I support this Bill, albeit reluctantly, and look forward to the Minister responding to the concerns people still have about the legislation.</P>

	<P>Before I deal with the substance of the issue before us, I wish to deal briefly with two matters.  On the confusion, to which the Minister referred, there may well be confusion in some quarters in terms of the debate about the Garda evidence and as to the issue that this is covered in the Act, but I do not believe there is any confusion in that respect in this House.  As we do not have a great deal of time within the next few hours to deal with this legislation, we can leave that issue aside.  I do not believe anybody is confused in this House as to what the Bill proposes in regard to Garda evidence.  That is clear.  We can debate whether it is right or wrong, but it is clear in the Act.  We should leave the issue of confusion aside.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The second matter relates to the debate on this legislation.  We are here to participate in this debate and we want to do so for as long as it takes.  I made the point on the Order of Business earlier that, unfortunately and regrettably, there did not seem to be much point in debating this legislation because the Government was clearly intent on not accepting any amendments, which would render this debate somewhat irrelevant.  The Leader shook his head in response to my comment, which I took to be an indication that he disagreed with me.  Senator Leyden then indicated to the House that if amendments were brought before the House that the matter could be dealt with during the course of the summer.  The Minister has now put that issue at rest and has made it very clear, in no uncertain terms, that no amendments to this legislation will be accepted by the Government and that, to use his words, &ldquo;we need this legislation now&rdquo;.  Let us be clear about this, there is no intention on the part of Government to permit this House to amend this legislation in any respect today or on any other day.</P>
      
        <P>Notwithstanding the Government&rsquo;s view as to whether we should be listened to in this House on this legislation, we still have to reflect on our role as legislators.  We are paid to come here <Col N="1221"/>by the people to deal with legislation.  As to what is our role, I accept that the Government has a very particular role, perhaps an enhanced one in the sense that it has the expertise and advice of the Garda available to it and it is dealing on a day to day basis, operationally and in policy terms, with the management of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Therefore, it is in a position of expertise far greater than anything available to any of us.  I accept that.  That is how the system works.</P>
        <P>Let us examine our role.  I do not wish to oversimplify it but it appears to be the case that a Minister comes to the House to inform us of the changes that need to be made to the law because there is a problem that needs to be addressed and he outlines the changes he proposes we should make.  It is our role to ask him to tell us why that is the case and to demonstrate it to us.  We then consider whether that explanation is adequate and we either vote for or against the proposals brought by the Minister.  I accept that is an oversimplification but it is not an unreasonable description of our role.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Am I correct in that are we not entitled to ask the Minister to do more than simply assert the need for certain legislation?  The Minister must demonstrate the need for it to us.  He must show us why it is necessary, not just simply by anecdote, the expression of his opinion or the communication to us indirectly of an opinion given to him by the Garda.  He must give us some evidence on which we can take the rest of the argument in trust that what he says is necessary.  I cannot, and do not, exclude the possibility &mdash; I say this genuinely &mdash; that these measures are necessary, but I am not prepared to agree to them simply by it being asserted to me without any evidence or convincing argument &mdash; in some cases without any argument at all &mdash; as to why they are necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is very serious legislation.  We are dealing with the curtailment of rights and the liberty of the citizen, irrespective of what he or she is accused of, and in view of this we are under a bound duty to exercise the strictest possible scrutiny of any such proposal.  That is all I am interested in doing.  Senator Quinn, and to some extent Senator Boyle, have expressed the hope that the Minister will return with responses to some of the questions that have been raised.  I do not know whether the Minister will do so when he replies to Second Stage.  However, he has made it clear that he does not intend moving from his position.  That puts us in a very odd position in terms of trying to debate the issue, or any expectation we might have that the Minister might address any of the difficulties we have.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two propositions that I hope we all share in this debate.  In fairness, I accept that the Minister&rsquo;s objective is to address the serious problem of gangland crime.  I accept his bona fides in that respect.  I agree with Senator Boyle and others that we should also accept the bona fides of others who have raised queries and doubts about the necessity of some of the measures that have been proposed.  It is clear that there has been a shocking increase in the level and ferocity of gangland crime, especially in cities.  There has been a huge increase in gun murders.  What has preyed on many people who have debated and discussed the matter and who observe it in the newspapers is the utter contempt shown by gang members for even basic civility in society, to say nothing of people&rsquo;s basic safety and their human rights, and the shocking contempt shown for human rights and human life by those people.  I completely accept that it has to be addressed in the firmest possible way and I do not exclude any reasonable proposal brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That is the first proposition, that there is a major problem to be addressed.  There is no use in any organisation, NGO, politician or anybody else trying to suggest that there is not.</P>
        <P>We all, including the Minister, share the second proposition also.  He appears to have considered introducing some of these measures at various stages in the past year or two but decided against that.  The awful murder of Roy Collins brought these matters back onto the agenda and <Col N="1222"/>the Minister decided it was time to move.  I do not think the Minister has to answer to us on this point.  It is clear he too believes the criminal justice system should have integrity and that there must be a basic protection in it for the rights of the accused.</P>
        <P>I have never believed in the rights of the accused versus the rights of the victim.  That is not a zero sum game.  I do not agree with people who say that if one is for the protection of the basic rights of the accused that, therefore, one is in some way seeking to reduce the rights of the victims of crime.  That does not stand up to scrutiny.  It is clear the Minister agrees there is a need to protect basic rights.  He has suggested at certain stages that he could have introduced further restrictions but he determined not to do so because he did not consider that was appropriate or necessary.</P>
        <P>The first proposition was that there is a big problem to address.  The second proposition is that the integrity of the criminal justice system must be maintained and that the rights of the accused must be protected within the limits that we determine are correct.  What has the Minister done in recent months?  I find it difficult to accept the point from the Minister, which he made two or three times in his speech, that he did not do this lightly.  I hope he did not bring forward the proposal lightly.  I presume the discussion in the Department between the Minister, his advisers and the Attorney General took place over a period of months.  I presume that is the case but I, rightly, do not know.</P>
        <P>Why should the Oireachtas not also have an opportunity to address this matter seriously?  Why is that indulgence not extended to the people who are supposed to be the legislators?  Sadly, it is because the Legislature is not taken very seriously by the Government.  The careful consideration of this issue, which I have no doubt went on between the Minister, his advisers and the Attorney General, is all done now in the eyes of the Minister and all that remains to be done is for the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to rubber-stamp it.</P>
        <P>That brings me back to my point that the Minister comes to the House and asserts the necessity for change, such as that the Garda advises it is necessary.  The Minister refers to the Garda again and again.  The advice of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would probably be the first item on the agenda if one was seeking to be advised on any of these issues.  I accept that, but it is not the only issue that needs to be addressed.  The expertise and experience of the Garda is vital in any of these matters but it is not the only issue to be considered.  We have Ministers, a Government and a Parliament and they make these decisions.  I hope it is not to be suggested, as it was implied almost in the Minister&rsquo;s speech from time to time, that if the Garda thought something was necessary, <i>ipso facto</i>, it was.  I do not accept that.  I do not say I accept the opposite either, that simply because the Garda want something it should not be allowed.  However, it is not of itself sufficient justification and the measures must be scrutinised.</P>
        <P>I hope the measure was scrutinised by the Minister.  I believe it was to some extent from something he said in his speech but why can the Parliament not have at least some opportunity to engage in examination, scrutiny and questioning?  Why are we being completely excluded from that?  The debate in the other House was guillotined and we are being told by the Minister that it does not matter what amendments we wish to put forward, as they will not be accepted.  This is in the context of where a piece of legislation solemnly states: &ldquo;It is hereby declared that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to an offence under each of the following provisions&rdquo;, which are listed.  Let us just pause here.  It is an extraordinary statement.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik and others referred to the various issues of concern in the legislation.  I acknowledge that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the lawyers who wrote to <i>The Irish Times</i> and others are motivated by absolutely the best intentions in regard to these issues. <Col N="1223"/> However, it is a bit much for some commentators to bring forth the notion that we are playing the man and not the ball and to suggest that people are motivated by anything other than the wish to see a system in place that respects the rights both of the accused and of victims.  We strayed somewhat into that area in this House some time ago before people thought better of it.</P>
        <P>There is much in the legislation with which I agree, including the creation of the offence of directing a criminal organisation.  As I recall, that proposal was brought forward by my party in the D&aacute;il some time ago, only to be dismissed by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, on the basis that such an offence was too amorphous.  As Deputy Rabbitte observed in the other House, it is now included in the Bill.  As I said, certain of the provisions in the Bill are welcome.</P>
        <P>However, the most striking aspect of the Bill is the momentous statement we are being asked to endorse, namely, that the ordinary courts are &ldquo;inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace&rdquo;.  I am not persuaded of the veracity of that statement.  No case has been made to this House &mdash; not even a bad case &mdash; that the ordinary courts are inadequate for purpose.  It is important to clarify that this Bill is not about the intimidation of witnesses.  There are two references to witnesses in the legislation, only one of which &mdash; the provision in section 16 allowing for an increase in the penalty in respect of the intimidation of witnesses &mdash; is substantive.  People should stop conflating witnesses with jurors, as the Minister and others have done from time to time.  That is not what the Bill is about.</P>
        <P>The main objective of the Bill is to remove certain offences from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.  I am not persuaded by the case that has been made in this regard.  No convincing evidence has been brought before the House to demonstrate the necessity for this change.  Only one example has been given in regard to the intimidation of jurors in a trial in Limerick.  As I understand it, that trial was moved to Dublin and a conviction was secured.  We must bear in mind that convictions are being secured every day of the week, including in many of these awful gangland cases.  If a trial cannot successfully proceed in Limerick, it should take place in Dublin.  There are many other measures that can be taken in terms of protecting the integrity of the jury system.  A new criminal justice building is currently being completed on the quays.  Even in terms of the physical environment of the courts and the arrangements that are made in regard to jurors, much can be done to ensure they are protected.  There is an unfounded perception in regard to the prevalence of juror intimidation.  Even the references to Garda support for these provisions refer to the concern that such intimidation might happen in the future.  We have been shown no evidence that it is already happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House for this important debate.  Much legislation relating to the criminal justice system has come through the House in recent years, most of which has been targeted at the serious criminals involved in the drugs trade.  There was an element of turning a blind eye by society when such persons were murdering their gangland competitors in a cavalier way.  In recent times, they have also targeted innocent people.  It is evident that despite the incremental improvements we have seen in legislation, they have not arrested the problem.  I followed the debate on these measures in the newspapers and in the other House.  I agree that when we are making changes to legislation, we must be mindful of fundamental human rights.  However, there is no more fundamental right than the right to life, it being the basic human right which underpins all others.  If that right is not protected, other rights become irrelevant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would be more inclined to take note of the statements made by the Irish Human Rights Commission and others on this matter if they had included any acknowledgement of the human rights of the victims of these murderers and gangsters.  It is seven years since we spoke in this <Col N="1224"/>House about the savage murder of Brian Fitzgerald.  As I recall, Senator Cummins was Fine Gael spokesperson on justice at the time.  Mr. Fitzgerald, a security guard, was trying to safeguard the clients of the premises in which he worked by not allowing people with drugs into the establishment.  He was murdered in cold blood as a consequence of that.  Richard Kelly was a 19 year old who stole a car from a member of one of the Limerick gangs.  When he discovered the identity of the owner, he quickly returned it but was subsequently murdered by the gang.</P>
        <P>We all recall the murder of Shane Geoghegan.  We must ask ourselves about the human rights of his parents, colleagues and those with whom he played rugby.  His human rights have never been flagged in lights.  The murder which was the ultimate catalyst for this legislation was that of Roy Collins in Limerick.  His father and the journalist, Paul Williams, spoke about the murder on the television some days ago.  Both of those men are under Garda protection because they have been articulate in criticising the thugs involved in gangland crime and in promoting the interests of society.  Another murder victim was Anthony Campbell, a young man shot in Dublin because he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The most recent murder was that of Wayne Doherty last week, shot down in cold blood in Dublin.  We must acknowledge the human rights of his wife, Karen, and their two children.  We have an obligation to address these issues.</P>
        <P>I do not buy into the overemphasis that is placed on ensuring the human rights of criminals are ring-fenced and protected when they are in court.  Many such criminals are able to exploit the system and evade justice.  We must be realistic in all of this.  The Minister is taking a measured approach in this legislation.  Some of the negative commentary is predicated on a misinterpretation of its provisions.  The Bill provides that organised crime offences shall be scheduled offences, which means they will be heard in the Special Criminal Court provided that the Director of Public Prosecutions directs that it should be so, presumably on the basis of the evidence with which he or she is presented.  What is objectionable about that?  The argument has been made that this removes the jury from the process and thus represents a departure from ancient traditions.  We must meet the current onset of very serious, destructive and irresponsible organised crime in an effective way.  If it cannot be eradicated, we must at least ensure everything is done to diminish it significantly.  We are far too wedded to some of the current features of the justice system.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  Heretofore, very few of the major leaders of drug gangs have been imprisoned.  Of those few who have been sentenced, conviction was secured on foot of an offence other than that for which they are notorious.  I understand one such person is currently imprisoned on a tax default charge.  If we are realistic in the manner in which we target crime, we must tackle it on the basis of the offences that are being committed almost with impunity by these people.  Existing legislation provides for a minimum sentence of ten years for those found guilty of dealing drugs.  However, it is often the mules who are arrested rather than the ganglords themselves.  The latter, some of whom are worth hundreds of millions of euro as a consequence of their illegal activity, seem to be able to operate with impunity.  It is right that we are now creating this new offence, which is overdue.  I applaud the Minister for introducing it.</P>
        <P>In the context of our judicial system, we need to examine sentencing.  Life imprisonment should mean exactly that, and if a sentence is for 15, 20 or 25 years then that is what it should be.  There should not be remission just because somebody behaves themselves in prison.  We have strong anecdotal evidence that many prisoners still carry on running their organised crime gangs while in prison, which is an untenable situation.</P><Col N="1225"/>
        <P>There is an amended offence concerning participation and involvement, which carries a penalty of 15 years&rsquo; imprisonment.  There is also evidence based on the expert opinion of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The emphasis there must be on the fact that it is an expert opinion.</P>
        <P>There is an expectation that these new measures will be a panacea.  While they will be a significant improvement, I do not believe they will amount to a panacea.  We need to look at the next step, but I do not go with those who say we should consider internment.  We should examine the capacity of our criminal justice system, however.  I do not see why we should necessarily be wedded to the common law system, which is so beloved of barristers for a variety of reasons.  The Napoleonic code, for example, would allow for these gangsters to be taken into custody, await trial while in custody and subsequently the courts would dispose of the cases before them, by prosecuting, convicting or releasing the accused.</P>
        <P>If we fail with this legislation, I would strongly argue that we must examine the next step, including the advantages of the Napoleonic code where there is a presumption of guilt.  If one asks garda&iacute; or people living in the affected areas, they know precisely who are the crime gang lords.  They also know about the money they are raking in through their involvement in illegal activities.  We should be pragmatic in the way we approach this matter.  Society wants results and I applaud the Minister for taking a courageous step in this direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am on the record of this House as having called, on at least two occasions, for gangland criminals to be treated the same as terrorists.  Jury intimidation, interference and threats, and the killing of fellow gangland figures &mdash; but especially innocent victims such as Roy Collins and Wayne Doherty &mdash; constitute an attack on the very fabric of this State.  Whether we like it or not, criminal gangs thrive in this State at the moment.  These gangs who terrorise entire communities, especially in Limerick and Dublin, pose a genuine threat to the State and they must be put out of business.</P>
        <P>I fully support the new provisions in this Bill and especially the new powers to allow the non-jury Special Criminal Court to try suspected gang leaders and members.  I see this as an essential step in removing jury intimidation from the courtroom.  We must remember, as has been pointed out, that the Director of Public Prosecutions still retains the discretion to seek a jury trial.</P>
        <P>While supporting the Bill and its provisions, I totally disagree with rushing this legislation through the House without adequate research, consultation or debate.  I recall that when the Criminal Justice Bill was going through this House in 2006, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, listened, debated and exchanged opinions with several Members of the House for weeks.  He accepted amendments from Senators, including several which I tabled myself.  Whether or not one agreed with him on the Bill, one at least knew that it had been teased out properly and the democratic process was clearly seen to work.</P>
        <P>If this Government was serious about allowing proper debate on this Bill and others, it would have held back both Houses of the Oireachtas for another week or two to ensure that this legislation was not rushed and was debated properly.  Be that as it may, the Bill is now before us and we must deal with it to the best of our ability as legislators, despite the time limitations that are being imposed.</P>
        <P>I read with interest the comments of a parish priest, Father Joe Coyne, at the recent funeral of Wayne Doherty.  His words deserve to go on the record of this House.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is utterly scandalous, totally unacceptable and beyond any conventions of right or wrong that somebody would be shot brutally outside his parents&rsquo; house.  How dare anybody think they have the right to decide who lives or who dies.  How can anybody have the gall to carry <Col N="1226"/>weapons, or to drive people carrying weapons or to supply weapons?  People or society could never give in to that type of violence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Fr. Coyne said that such matters were now under discussion in the Oireachtas, and asked why people should not be accountable for their actions if they are known to be involved in criminal activities and particularly organised violence.  With reference to this Bill, he said, &ldquo;It is complicated.  Nobody wants a police state, yet there is a decision, and wisdom is needed among our legislators&rdquo;.  Fr. Coyne&rsquo;s words covered a lot of ground and I hope that we in our wisdom will make the right decisions today.  It is unfortunate, however, that no matter how salient or relevant our amendments are, we are only going through the motions because the D&aacute;il will not be recalled to deal with any of them.  This is a negation of democracy and an insult to the Members of this House.</P>
        <P>The rights of citizens are protected through the rule of law.  It should mean speedy, effective and affordable justice.  It should mean guarding communities against thugs and gangsters.  We need to bring back respect for the rule of law and law enforcers.  Members of the legal profession must also accept it is their duty to ensure that citizens have the right to prompt and affordable access to the courts.  Let us face it, this is not currently the case.</P>
        <P>The growth of gang crime, intimidation and fear in communities have grown out of all proportion in the last decade.  The Criminal Assets Bureau has been a valuable tool in assisting the State in bringing many criminals to justice, but can we say that we have less crime now than when the bureau was formed following the killing of Veronica Guerin?  We seem to have many more drug-related gang lords and their lieutenants on the streets of our towns and cities.  We must respond with adequate &mdash; and some may say, draconian &mdash; laws to address modern needs and the ever-changing methods employed by these ruthless people.</P>
        <P>These new laws will, I hope, target those who see themselves as being above the law and who show contempt for all decent people and society at large.  They prey on the vulnerable, destroying communities and threatening the very fabric of society.  They must be brought to justice and taken out of society for a long time to allow good people in communities to live in peace, without fear and intimidation, and to prosper as many other communities have done in the last decade.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope this Bill will be a start in stemming the tide of crime which is swamping our country at present.  Making laws is one thing, but it is a futile exercise if garda&iacute; do not have adequate resources to enforce them.  This is a test for the Government.  Will this legislation be enacted just to satisfy a public which is weary and angry at the level of crime?  Will it gather dust or will we see the necessary funds being allocated to ensure its provisions empower those charged with enforcing the law to carry out the laws as intended?  The jury is out on that, but I will not shirk in my responsibility in supporting laws that will assist in bringing gangland figures and murderers to justice.  It is over to the Government to back up this legislation with the necessary resources.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to an article in last Saturday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>  by Jim Cusack, a journalist who is an excellent commentator on criminal matters.  He reported how a retired senior detective, who faced down some of the worst criminals in the State, has condemned the Government for not properly resourcing the witness protection programme to allow gang members to turn State&rsquo;s evidence against their associates.  He also referred to the ludicrous requirement for senior garda&iacute; to retire at 60, which resulted in the loss of people with invaluable experience and knowledge.  I hope better resources will be provided to enable the provisions of the Bill to be enforced.  This should be financed and run in a better way than the witness protection programme.</P><Col N="1227"/>

	<P>I will not waste time in hand-wringing about guillotining and the rest of it.  The fact that some of our contributions are terse and to the point may be valuable.  This Bill is necessary but not sufficient.  We will be back here again, but there is nothing particularly reprehensible about that; law is a process, not a product.  We must respond to events as they occur.</P>
        <P>As a non-lawyer, I will turn to the historical hinterland of the Bill.  All western European thought about crime and punishment goes back to Plato, who thought man was born an angel, and Aristotle, who thought man was born fundamentally flawed.  Aristotle said we must protect society from those members who behave like beasts.  He said that without law men are beasts and that society would have to be hard enough to deal with enemies foreign and domestic.  That is what the State was set up to do, to protect its citizens from its foreign and domestic enemies.</P>
        <P>These are not essential matters in the sense that we are dealing with essences; we are always dealing with context.  Thus, when the Minister says the Roy Collins murder was a tipping point, he is right because it is the context in which it took place that matters, not the essence.  If a man tells one he has killed somebody, one would want to know whether he killed the fellow as part of the UN peacekeeping force in Chad or at his front door in the course of a robbery.  The essential killing is not the point, it is the context that is important.  The context is that the symbiosis between degraded sections of the IRA campaign and the drug culture has created a new form of gang, one whose criminal members are capable of turning up on the streets of a major city during a demonstration and photographing citizens.  There is no other city in the UK or on the Continent in which this could be done.  This is new and it is a threat to the safety of the State.  It needs the steely face of the State to deal with it.</P>
        <P>The context means we can introduce harsh and punitive measures and then pull back from them when we no longer need them.  We did this in 1922, when it brought the Civil War to a quicker end.  We did it in 1939 and it saved our neutrality from being traduced.  We also did it in 1956.  Each time the State went back to the rule of law and did not maintain these draconian <Col N="1228"/>measures.  This is a special time and a special context, and special measures are required.  The Minister has at least walked the walk rather than talking the talk.  I wish, however, he would indicate whether he is prepared to go further, if necessary.  For example, the entire legislation arises from the emergency anti-terrorist measures in our history.  It is the son of the Offences against the State Act 1939, the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, the Criminal Law Act 1997 and the Criminal Justice Act 2006, and these are all sons of the Emergency Powers Act 1939 and of the political history of the State against terrorism.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins and others are right in saying we should treat gangland criminals as terrorists.  As this Bill is the son of the aforementioned emergency legislation, I am sorry the Minister did not go the full distance and allow a detective inspector or chief superintendent to give evidence of gang membership.  There are problems in this regard and that is why I have recommended again and again &mdash; I agree fully with Senator Jim Walsh in this regard &mdash; that we should move slowly between the British and the continental system.  We must begin to think of a system of investigating magistrates who would head up crime task forces.  These would conduct the preliminary hearings and actively interrogate witnesses, and then bring the case to the Special Criminal Court.  Being lawyers, the investigating magistrates would carry much conviction with their judicial peers.</P>
        <P>As the old saying goes, there is a lot done but more to do.  Everything that has been brought in is necessary, although, as I said, I do not believe it is sufficient because the criminals will change.  I hope the Minister is not prepared to stop here and that, having walked the walk so far, he will go the extra mile and treat this as a special period in Irish history similar to the beginning of the Second World War, the 1956 campaign and the emergency in 1922.  This is a special emergency in modern Irish life.  The combination of drugs gangs with a pathologically degraded section of the old IRA campaign, plus a recession, creates a specific set of circumstances which require the most severe measures.  I hope the Minister will not flinch.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not naive enough to think this Bill will cure all the ills of our society or get rid of all the gangland crime in the country.  Of course it will not.  Senators Harris and Walsh mentioned the possibility of going further.  I would not exclude this possibility, nor should the Oireachtas.  I reiterate that the Bill is not what some people have made it out to be.  It is not a seismic change in the criminal legal system, it is a relatively measured response, as the Garda Commissioner said, and a proportionate one.</P>
        <P>After the murder of Shane Geoghegan we were called upon by members of Fine Gael, in particular, to take measures in this regard.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, and others wanted internment.  They wanted people lifted off the street.  Others, including Deputy Noonan, raised the possibility of allowing opinion evidence &mdash; real opinion evidence, not expert evidence as provided for in the Bill &mdash; whereby a chief superintendent or senior member of the Garda would say a particular person was a member of a criminal gang.  We have not gone that far.  What we have done, however, is to send a strong signal.  The reaction of the Oireachtas and the vote in the Upper House will send a strong signal to the wider community and particularly the criminals that if they direct or participate in an illegal criminal organisation they will receive severe penalties if found guilty &mdash; up to life imprisonment for directing activities and 15 years for participation &mdash; and that they will not be in a position to intimidate jurors.  In this legislation these two offences are being made scheduled offences, which means they go to the Special Criminal Court unless the Director of Public Prosecutions otherwise directs.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle mentioned the 12-month review, which was included to allow us to see how the legislation operates.  It may well be that after a year no case has been referred to the Special Criminal Court, which I would welcome, because the DPP has made a judgment that the ordinary courts are sufficient.  However, that is the decision of the DPP alone.</P>
        <P>I do not accept what Senator Alex White stated in respect of a lack of evidence.  The Government and I made our decision based on the hard evidence presented to us by the Garda Commissioner and his senior management.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>What about us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not make that decision based on comments from judges, State solicitors or Paul Williams, who is well-respected and who holds strong views on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We based it on the hard evidence given to us by the Garda Commissioner and a large number of the testimonies provided by individuals such as the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not provided that evidence to us.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1230"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>People came to me privately and indicated the difficult situation that obtained in Limerick and elsewhere in respect of the intimidation of witnesses.  I want to nail that matter on the head.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid the Minister has not done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ironic that I should be accused of rushing the legislation through.  As stated in this House following the murder of Roy Collins, I was pressed to introduce various measures in the aftermath of the murder of Shane Geoghegan.  I did not believe it was necessary to do so but, as Senator Harris stated, the murder of Roy Collins was a clear indication that there are people who are willing to take out the family members of those who are willing to co-operate with the criminal justice system.  Roy Collins&rsquo;s murder was an attack on the State, on its criminal justice system and on the concept of law and order.  It is clear that those to whom I refer were telling people who were willing to participate in criminal trials against them, that they were prepared to take revenge against them.</P>
        <P>I cannot put it any better than the leader of Senator Alex White&rsquo;s party who, in November 2008 &mdash; following the murder of Shane Geoghegan and prior to that of Roy Collins &mdash; said, &ldquo;We do not want to hear the reasons certain things cannot be done.&rdquo;  A couple of days later, Deputy Rabbitte stated, &ldquo;The public mood is to assent to measures in the present crisis that people would not otherwise tolerate.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister stating that we should assent to any measures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we are now being criticised for reacting to the situation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the hard evidence provided by the Garda, we also received evidence from court officials, particularly those who work in the Limerick area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give way for a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have very little time in which to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Why can we not be shown the evidence to which he refers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The evidence provided by the officials to whom I refer particularly related to the difficulty of encouraging jurors to participate in trials.  The top official in Limerick indicated that there is &ldquo;a tacit understanding that there is no point in holding gangland murder trials in Limerick&rdquo;.  That view was clearly underlined a number of years ago when, in the context of the murder of Kieran Keane&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister discuss that matter with Mr. Murray?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there was an inability to encourage people to act as jurors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should quote Mr. Murray.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>At that time, and in the space of two months, jury attendances had declined from one third to less than one fifth.  In one instance where 350 people were called, 195 medical certificates were received.  Every excuse in the book was offered in order that people might not be obliged to participate in these trials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is irrelevant.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1231"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It was stated that there was no hard evidence.  Mr. Michael Murray stated that he is aware of one case in respect of which he was so concerned with regard to the level of intimidation that he made a report to the Garda authorities.  Mr. Murray also stated that he asked the Garda to investigate a case where a person was acquitted in circumstances where it was clear to him that the jury was afraid.  He further stated that there has been a distinct reluctance on the part of people who are called to participate in juries and that he was aware of a case where it was clear that an adverse decision, based on the intimidation of jurors, had been reached.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should quote the entire statement made by Mr. Murray.  I have a copy of it here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither I nor the Government can guarantee the constitutionality of the Bill.  We bring forward legislation on the advice of the Attorney General.  The latter is absolutely satisfied that the Bill will pass constitutional muster.  Immediately following the murder of Roy Collins on 9 April, I clearly indicated that we intended to bring forward this legislation.  The Taoiseach and I held a joint press conference on 13 May at which we issued a press release containing all of the details relating to the Bill.  The only matter which is not contemplated in the Bill, but which was referred to in that press release, is that relating to membership of a criminal organisation.  We were of the view that such membership would be impossible to prove, particularly in light of the surreptitious nature of these criminal organisations.</P>
        <P>I reject the premise that we did not have enough time to debate the Bill.</P>

	<P>I have no doubt that this Bill and that which relates to surveillance will prove significant.

    <Title>Northern Ireland: Statements. </Title>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on Northern Ireland matters.  It is my first occasion to do so as Taoiseach.  It is fitting that we gather to reflect on one of the great achievements of this democracy, the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The achievement has been brought about by successive Governments of all parties, with the steadfast support of all shades of opinion in the Oireachtas and Irish society.  It was built upon unprecedented partnership between the British and Irish Governments, and the strong support of our friends in America, the EU and around the world.  In more recent years it has been greatly strengthened by a transformation in relationships between North and South and between Nationalists and Unionists on the island.  At this time of great economic challenges for our country, it is important to reflect on how our democratic values and democratic institutions have successfully faced the historic challenges of bringing peace to Northern Ireland and building reconciliation between all the peoples on these islands.  It is an achievement to treasure, one that is recognised and applauded around the world.  It should offer us great inspiration as we face into the enormous economic problems of today.</P>
        <P>This House has often been to the forefront in the quest for peace and reconciliation in the North.  Many Members, past and present, have given strong and thoughtful leadership on this most complex and emotive of issues.  In particular, the House has benefitted greatly from the participation of Senators from both traditions from Northern Ireland who have served here.</P>
        <P>Time does not permit me to mention all those Members but I hope others will forgive me if I mention two former Senators in particular, Senators Gordon Wilson and Billy Fox.  Who in Ireland will ever forget the courage and generosity displayed by Senator Wilson in the face of the unspeakable atrocity that was the Enniskillen bombing ?  At a time of what must have been unimaginable personal pain he somehow found the strength to speak up for peace and forgiveness.  His strength served to fortify us all in our determination to bring peace for future gener<Col N="1235"/>ations.  He showed that there was a better way, that violence and hatred are not inevitable.  It took far too long, and too many people suffered in the meantime, but we are all thankful that the horrendous violence and hatred that scarred this island for decades is now a thing of the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann who I wish to recall today is former Senator Billy Fox.  Billy Fox was the only Member of the Oireachtas to be killed during the recent Northern Ireland troubles.  His murder was also an attack on our democracy.  The fact that we all stand here today with our democracy intact and peace secured for our people is a fitting memorial to Billy Fox and to all Members of the Oireachtas who have worked over the decades for peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
        <P>While we quite properly reflect on our collective achievements, we are not complacent and we fully recognise the very serious challenges that remain.  Last March, in the space of a few days a small group of people who reject the wishes of the Irish people murdered two British soldiers in Antrim and a PSNI officer in Craigavon.  This House joined with D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in expressing its deepest sympathies for the families of those killed and it reiterated its resolve that peace and stability which has been endorsed by all the people on this island would not be undermined.</P>
        <P>The enduring image of that week in Northern Ireland was of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister standing alongside the Chief Constable of the PSNI, all three united in their determination that Northern Ireland would not be pushed back into the dark days of the past.  That proved that we are truly in a new era in our history.  The rejection of that mindless violence and the united response of the political parties and of civic society sent a potent message that we should not allow a return to instability and violence.  Yesterday&rsquo;s violent events were a further challenge to us all.  The democratic institutions and the peace that we all worked so hard to achieve are being challenged by a tiny and unrepresentative group of people with no mandate and no support for their actions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They must not succeed.</P>
        <P>The bedrock of our peace and of our common future on this island is the Good Friday Agreement.  It is the founding document of a new era of peace, mutual respect and co-operation.  It opened a new chapter of reconciliation and renewal and helped to bring to an end not just decades but centuries of mistrust and conflict.  It ushered in a new era of tolerance and set out a template which affords respect and protection for all people and all points of view on this island.  As set out in the constitutional amendment so emphatically endorsed by the people in 1998 it says that we will work in harmony and friendship to unite all the people who share the territory of the island of Ireland in all the diversity of their identities and traditions recognising that a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of the majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island.  These are the principles that continue to guide Government policy today.</P>
        <P>Through all the twists and turns of the last 11 years, it is the agreement to which we have always returned, not just to its institutions, although they are central, but also to the principles and aspirations that it embodies.  Those principles and aspirations continue to guide us as we continue to work to make a better future and resolve never to return to the pain and suffering of the past.  Crucially, as democrats we hold fast to the agreement because it represents the democratic will of the people of this island, North and South.  The implementation of the agreement is not just an aspiration but a solemn duty given to us in an historic act of self-<Col N="1236"/>determination by the Irish people.  I would like therefore to reflect on the progress we have made as well as the difficult challenges that still remain.</P>
        <P>We have recently seen the second anniversary of the successful restoration of the institutions in May 2007.  It is important to recognise that this is the longest period of uninterrupted operation of the institutions since the agreement.  Certainly there have been disagreements and frustrations, including an extended period when the Executive did not meet, but the institutions have continued to operate and to carry out the work of government.  That is a very positive sign for the future.</P>
        <P>Alongside the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, we have also had the benefit of the full operation of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and the British-Irish Council.  Last week, we held the eighth meeting of the NSMC in plenary format since 1998 and the fourth such meeting in the past two years.  A further plenary meeting will take place by the end of the year.  There is also active work in each of the sectors of the council, with the number of sectoral ministerial meetings already this year running into double figures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have also met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on several other occasions for talks in Dublin and Belfast, at the British-Irish Council summits in Edinburgh and Cardiff and in the United States on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  Alongside these important formal engagements there is now an unprecedented range of contacts between Ministers, Departments, agencies and other bodies with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on the many matters that are of mutual interest to people on both sides of the border.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know that Members of the Seanad are also developing their contacts with their colleagues in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Meetings and contacts between Oireachtas and Assembly committees are becoming more frequent and much good work can and should be done in that way.  We need to build actively on that work.  In that regard, the proposed North-South parliamentary forum is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  It can play an important role in building understanding and co-operation for the common good of everyone on the island.  The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly have been in contact about this on a number of occasions.  Working groups have now been established in both the Assembly and the Oireachtas to take forward the necessary arrangements and the respective commissions plan to meet in October.  I understand the sensitivities involved but I firmly believe we can reach agreement in a way that both respects and indeed benefits all concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As with the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, improved links between elected representatives can only be of mutual benefit.  In that connection, I warmly welcome the recent decision by the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland to participate actively in that forum, alongside representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster and the devolved assemblies in Scotland and Wales.  I also commend the work of the Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which has already provided a very useful forum for discussing a range of matters.  The involvement of Westminster MPs from Northern Ireland on that committee has given an innovative and valuable new dimension to the work of the Oireachtas.  I hope we can build on that committee&rsquo;s work to help deepen co-operation and mutual understanding.  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the very active participation of Members of the Seanad in the work of that committee.</P>
        <P>Alongside engagement at political and official level, it is also important to have a structured engagement between citizens and groups in civic society from North and South.  While we have not yet been able to reach agreement with the Northern Ireland Executive on the establishment of the North-South consultative forum, the Government has made a proposal on how such a <Col N="1237"/>forum should operate.  We will facilitate a further conference in the autumn with representatives of the social partners and interested organisations from North and South, which I intend will give further momentum to this important facet of North-South relationships.</P>
        <P>Given the history of mistrust and conflict on the island, the mere facts of engagement and the building of new relationships are valuable in their own right.  However, that should not be the limit of our ambitions or the sole purpose of our work.  We can and must work together by agreement and for mutual benefit to deliver a programme of practical North-South co-operation that improves the lives of all the people we represent.</P>
        <P>Last week&rsquo;s North-South Ministerial Council meeting reaffirmed and reinforced that objective.  We noted very good progress on major cross-Border roads and telecommunications projects, health, education, tourism, trade and innovation and on regional co-operation in the north west and along the Border.  We reviewed the significant co-operation on health and social issues, such as the issues of swine flu, child protection and suicide prevention, all areas which impact very directly on lives of citizens.</P>
        <P>We had a good discussion of the economic challenges that we all face.  Over the past year we have seen significant exchange rate movements and Senators are all keenly aware that many companies here have suffered from the adverse effects of that.  On the Northern side, there is considerable and understandable concern about future developments in the Southern economy and the possible implications for the North in terms of the impact on cross-Border trade and the potential implications of the banking crisis.  It is clear from those discussions that we must face this crisis together.</P>
        <P>Despite the current difficulties and concerns there are also opportunities and I have no doubt that the only way forward is to develop the all-island economy to its fullest potential.  The growing dynamic of the all-island economy and North-South co-operation can make a vital contribution to the economic recovery.  I am pleased that practical co-operation between the trade and development agencies on the island continues to strengthen and that we are beginning to look at developing greater synergies in the area of innovation, higher education and the smart economy.</P>
        <P>Infrastructure is also a key area of co-operation.  A major policy which demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to mutually beneficial co-operation is the upgrading of the inter-urban routes from Dublin to the north west and along the eastern corridor serving Belfast and Larne.  Both projects are proceeding on schedule, with the preferred route to the north west chosen and to be formally announced later this month in Omagh.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to help with funding for these projects remains firmly in place.  It is in the north west and Border regions, where once we saw the awful economic and social costs of partition and conflict most vividly, that we now see the enormous potential for transformation that the peace process has brought within reach.</P>
        <P>As well as unprecedented levels of North-South interaction and all-island co-operation, we continue to develop the east-west dimension of the agreement, including through valuable work in the British-Irish Council.  That has done some considerable useful work in areas such as the misuse of drugs, transport, road safety, sustainable travel, early years education, minority languages, spatial planning, housing and health.</P>
        <P>A feature of the discussions at recent summits has been the commonality of the problems that confront all member Administrations.  We are all striving to address the consequences of the downturn for individuals, families and businesses.  As an example of how we can work together to tackle the economic crisis, we have good discussions on energy co-operation and the potential contribution green energy can make to future energy needs on these islands.  I <Col N="1238"/>particularly welcome the initiative of Scotland in putting forward energy as a work stream for the British-Irish Council.</P>
        <P>The British-Irish Council is an essential part of the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement.  As well as providing a valuable expression of the east-west dimension of relationships on the island, it also allows us to deepen our historical links with Wales, Scotland and the other Administrations in these islands.</P>
        <P>The process of devolution from Westminster to the Administrations in Scotland and Wales has been seen as very significant in changing the relationships within Britain in recent years.  These changes have important implications for this State as well and the British-Irish Council will provide an ideal forum for addressing those changes as they evolve in the years to come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this way, too, the Good Friday Agreement provides the essential template and the flexibility that will enable us to navigate successfully the political, economic and social changes we will inevitably see across these islands in the years to come.</P>
        <P>I mentioned earlier the very real threat of violence which remains and one of the key pillars of the Good Friday Agreement, and an essential objective of both Governments, is the elimination of the gun and the triumph of democratic politics on this island.  As well as the construction of the new democratic institutions, and the key reforms in areas such as policing, equality and human rights, this found practical expression in the decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals and the ending of paramilitary activity.  This in turn created the environment for the dismantling of military installations that were built up during the conflict.  We have made historic progress in helping bring paramilitarism to an end.</P>
        <P>The Independent Monitoring Commission report in September of last year made clear that the Provisional IRA was maintaining an exclusively political path, that the army council had been allowed to fall into disuse and that military departments had been disbanded.  That gave everybody further assurance that the historic transformation signalled by the IRA statement of July 2005, followed by full IRA decommissioning later that year, was genuine.</P>
        <P>The continued successful operation of the institutions, and the clear statements by Sinn F&eacute;in leaders of support for the police, are further clear evidence of how far we have thankfully come.  I am also greatly heartened by the recent progress on loyalist decommissioning.  The Irish Government welcomes leadership shown by those who have helped bring about decommissioning and we urge all concerned to bring that process to a conclusion also.  We remain committed, as we always have been, to working with all traditions and communities on this island to ensure the peace process leaves nobody behind.</P>
        <P>I now believe a vital next step is to complete the devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland so that locally elected leaders can deal with some of the most serious and central issues faced by our society.  We have already seen a radical and hugely successful transformation of the policing and justice system in Northern Ireland.  I welcome the progress made to date and urge the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to reach an early agreement on the completion of devolution.  I assure them, and this House, of the full support of the two Governments in helping to put in place this last piece of the jigsaw.</P>
        <P>Serious challenges to the peace and to a shared future remain.  The recent murder of Kevin McDaid in Coleraine is a stark reminder of the divisions between the communities within Northern Ireland.  Yesterday&rsquo;s violence was further evidence of the road we have yet to travel.  Recent weeks have seen attacks on churches, Orange halls and GAA facilities.  Families from both sides of the community have again had to leave their homes.</P><Col N="1239"/>
        <P>The continued existence of sectarianism, peace walls and deep communal divisions in parts of the North is an affront to democracy and to a civilised society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It defies belief that this is continuing in 2009.  It must be energetically tackled and confronted by political leaders and by the wider community.  The Irish Government is more than willing to play its part, as we try to do in our work on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>I am firmly of the view that over a decade on from the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland needs to move proactively to reach the goal of a shared future.  People from all communities, and especially those who have been marginalised in the past, need to see hope and opportunity for their children.  We all know that poverty and hopelessness provide a fertile ground for disaffection and alienation.  At a time of economic crisis across the world, to which the North cannot be immune, we cannot allow old hatreds to fester and renew themselves.</P>
        <P>The task of reconciliation and of ending sectarianism will not be easy.  It will take time and effort, and it will be a long road, but it is vital for the future of everyone on this island.  I know everyone in this House shares that goal.</P>
        <P>I want to express my gratitude to Members for this opportunity to address the House on progress and recent developments in the peace process.  While many challenges remain, we are living through a period of unprecedented co-operation and contacts between all of the parties within Northern Ireland and on these islands.  We are finally seeing the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement come to fruition.</P>
        <P>We continue to work closely with the British Government, with the strong support of President Obama and the United States Administration, to secure the peace and to build a better future.  We will not forget the enormous suffering endured in this generation, in living memory, on this island.  We recognise and applaud the huge steps, taken by people on all sides, to bring about peace and understanding.  We do not ignore the serious challenges that remain.  We can and we must ensure that future generations have a different, better, peaceful and common future.</P>
        <P>In that respect, from my point of view as leader of this Government, the downturn, the current economic recession, which affects us all, reinforces our mutual dependence on each other.  It reinforces the need for politics to be seen to work.  It reinforces the need for those hard-pressed taxpayers&rsquo; revenues that are being provided to Administrations now, the need to avoid duplication, to work with an open mind and an open heart and to be prepared to sit down, regardless of the past, and find ways in which we can develop better public services together in health, higher education, social welfare and a range of areas.  We can assist each other and show the people that politics is the better alternative.</P>
        <P>Too often in the past, once we settled on the structures and met the agreement in the letter, we forget about its implementation in the spirit.  The spirit of the agreement is about partnership, forgetting about the past, putting a line under it and being prepared to work for future generations.  The great genius of the Good Friday Agreement is that it has overturned the old historical analysis where people from different traditions sought an end destination which was mutually exclusive from the other.  The great genius of the Good Friday Agreement is that it commits us to a common journey, regardless of the destination, that is about signifying our mutual interest in working together and seeing co-operation rather than conflict as the means by which we can resolve our problems.  That is a central place for the primacy of politics to operate.</P><Col N="1240"/>
        <P>For those in a divided society who have seen the absence of politics, it behoves those of us who are part of that profession to make it work now for a people who for too long have been alienated from the institutions of law and order and a civilised society that is central to decent and full living.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Members from all sides in welcoming the Taoiseach to the Seanad to discuss Northern Ireland.  I endorse his comments, particularly in reference to the late Senators Billy Fox and Gordon Wilson, and those about the spirit of the agreement and putting it into practice for the benefit of people in communities.</P>
        <P>It is ironic, after a period of relative calm in the North, that on the eve of these statements we saw on our television screens upsetting and violent images of youths involved in riots against members of the PSNI.  In this, we see the face of dissident provocation to the peace process and the undermining of police authority.  It shows there is still a long road to travel to build on respect for the police force across communities.  This hatred and violence has no place in a modern tolerant Ireland and cannot and must not overshadow the trojan efforts for peace and the great progress that has been made.  Clearly, a threat exists and must be dealt with on the journey to normalisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In our democratic system, we often see sparks fly between parties, disagreement on policies and plans, changes of position in Government policy as one party enters Government and another departs, and rightly so.  It is refreshing and commendable that throughout the vibrant political process the one item which has remained constant from one Taoiseach to the next and from one Government to another is the underlying commitment in time and energy to achieving peace on this island.  My party is proud of the role Fine Gael-led Governments played, be it Liam Cosgrave and the Sunningdale Agreement, Garret FitzGerald and the Anglo-Irish Agreement or John Bruton and the part he played in laying the foundations for future, long-lasting, sustainable plans for peace.  Equally, Fianna F&aacute;il taoisigh have played a critical and effective role in furthering and building political stability.  The progress and success of the Northern Ireland peace process is a testament to the tenacity, determination and dedication of all the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessors, and he continues this tradition with his own high level of commitment to the ongoing process.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Agreement are built on the cornerstones of consent, parity of esteem, equality of representation and cross-community support.  Today, the institutions of Northern Ireland are beginning to bed down.  Unionists and Nationalists work side by side in the Assembly and Executive, charged with delivering for all the people of Northern Ireland.  Former political enemies are united in a desire for peace and prosperity for their community, their families and children and future generations.  It was upsetting to see so many young people involved in last night&rsquo;s riots.  The recent decommissioning by the UDA is the latest welcome development in the long walk to stability and normalisation in the society north of our Border.</P>
        <P>The country faces challenges in building an all-Ireland economy.  With these challenges come opportunities to develop industry, increase trade, improve co-operation and share ideas.  Like many Senators, I have had the opportunity, as a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, for example, to meet our Stormont counterparts.  We shared ideas and viewpoints on mental health issues, tackling suicide in our society and working together in the interests of all on the island of Ireland.  Group leaders from the Seanad travelled to Stormont and met parliamentarians there.  We need to see more of these types of exchanges in the future.  The concept of establishing a parliamentary forum poses a real opportunity for meaningful dialogue and productive discussion.</P><Col N="1241"/>
        <P>While great credit goes to successive Irish Governments, British Governments, the political parties in the North and, crucially, the people of Ireland North and South for creating peace, the contribution of the European Union is rarely mentioned.  It is appropriate, as we renew our national conversation on Ireland and Europe and move towards the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, that we acknowledge the work of the EU in assisting peace on this island.  Throughout the years of violence and division, European leaders and institutions played a key role, in public and behind the scenes, in encouraging moves towards peace and a shared future based on equality and fairness.  EU funding has helped communities in Northern Ireland to work to address social disadvantage and build relationships which have been critical across communities.  The engagement of community organisations in dealing with the day-to-day work of building peace and creating tolerance has been outstanding.  The international community, in the EU and the US, has supported peace in Ireland and for that we are extremely grateful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Northern Ireland is a good news story.  However, as we saw last night, complacency cannot set in.  A small segment of subversives, some trying to recruit south of the Border, is determined to destroy, hurt, maim, kill and end peace.  We saw this in recent months with the killing of two young soldiers who simply ordered a pizza and a police constable who was savagely murdered without provocation.  To these enemies of peace and democracy, let the word go out loud and clear from this House, from Government and from Irish society: You have no mandate, no right, no authority and no claim to speak on behalf of the Irish people.  The Irish people have conclusively disowned you in referendums North and South.</P>

        <P>I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to do everything possible to track down these subversive elements and remove the threat they pose to our hard-earned peace and stability.  Today, Northern Ireland faces many new economic and social challenges.  If the past 40 years have shown anything, it is the resilience of the people of Northern Ireland.  Members of the Oireachtas must continue to work with our Northern counterparts to build relationships in a spirit of co-operation, respect and, crucially, consent.</P>
        <P>As the process continues and evolves, obstacles and opportunities will arise and Fine Gael looks forward to working with the Taoiseach on Northern Ireland in the spirit of bipartisanship and in the national interest.</P>

I acknowledge that six Members, or 10% of the membership, of the House come from the province of Ulster.  As one born in the last parish in Leinster on the Ulster border, the importance of this issue is brought home to me on a daily basis.  We abhor the views expressed on our television screens last night.  We did so on the Order of Business today.  Nothing that has happened in recent days was done in the name of the people, North or South.  We speak for nearly everyone on the island today. </P>
        <P>Today, we see huge progress towards the goal of a better society in Northern Ireland and on the island as a whole, informed by the institutions and structures established under the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  While the full potential inherent in these agreements remains to be fully developed, much has been achieved.  We have moved on from a politics of opposition to a genuinely new relationship between the people of Ireland, North and South, and indeed between Britain and Ireland.  This is something to be cherished, nurtured and protected.  We can speak and relate to each other in ways that would have been <Col N="1242"/>unthinkable before, standing on the shoulders of those visionaries who consistently argued for a better relationship, one based on equality between all those who share in this society and who desire a better place in which to bring up their children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I acknowledge the proud record of Se&aacute;n Lemass, Jack Lynch, Charles J. Haughey, Albert Reynolds, Bertie Ahern, the Taoiseach, and our founder, Eamon de Valera, with other taoisigh, in their hard work and determination to bring us to where we are today.</P>
        <P>Continued fair political and economic progress, based upon the principles of equality enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement, will create that better and truly shared society.  While differences remain between parties and individuals, and perhaps will remain for some time, there is now at least a shared framework in which differences can be addressed and resolved.  The same framework has also provided immeasurable benefits in relations between the islands of Ireland and Britain.</P>
        <P>Our very positive experience of parliamentary contacts and co-operation on an east-west basis, through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, should encourage us to pursue greater parliamentary collaboration on this island, between North and South.</P>
        <P>Over the past two decades, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has played a crucial role in the improvement of the British-Irish bilateral relationship.  It has proved to be a useful forum to foster dialogue and establish important bonds between the two parliaments.  Continual engagement with each other on matters of mutual concern is vital if real understanding is to be achieved.</P>
        <P>We are in the fortunate position of being able to work at building on the peace and progress of the past decade and to focus on the wider partnership of common interests between the people of these islands.  In the early days, the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, as it was then known, acted as a link between the Oireachtas and Westminster.  More recently, as the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, it has served to open channels of communication and new relationships between all of the administrations on these islands.  Like myself, many Senators have benefited from the strong interpersonal relationships that they have made as members of the assembly.  I am also aware of the effective level of engagement between many assembly and Oireachtas committees.  I participate in the excellent work of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, so ably chaired by Deputy Treacy.  Therefore, I am heartened to hear from the Taoiseach of the work ongoing in respect of a North-South parliamentary forum.</P>
        <P>There can be little doubt that the increased level of North-South co-operation represents one of the remarkable successes of the past 11 years.  In particular, we have seen a remarkable amount of progress in the two years since the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.  Co-operation on a shared infrastructure, such as the road to Derry and Letterkenny, which the Taoiseach mentioned, and the eastern corridor between Dublin and Belfast, is critical for the future economic growth of the island.  This is complemented by exciting new initiatives in areas like broadband telecommunications and co-operation in higher education and cross-Border provision of health services.  It is wonderful that communities North and South are finally beginning to reap the fruit of political relations that have never been better on this island.</P>
        <P>I join the Taoiseach in his condemnation of the attacks at Craigavon and Antrim, which tragically cut short the lives of three men.  I am heartened that all parties in the Assembly and the Oireachtas were clear in their denunciation of these acts and united in their determination that the peace we have built on this island will not be undermined.</P><Col N="1243"/>
        <P>I wish to make two final points.  In recent years, we have seen significant progress.  Many people played their parts in that endeavour, namely, the Irish and British Governments, the Northern political parties, community leaders, representatives of civic society and parliamentarians across these islands.  Many people worked hard along the way, reached out, stretched beyond their own deeply held beliefs and took risks to create a sustained peace.  Collectively, they deserve the highest praise and commendation of the people of Ireland and this House.</P>
        <P>It is a great honour and privilege to have the Taoiseach in attendance regarding this important topic.  I thank him for appearing.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Taoiseach and thank him for his words.  Whatever criticisms can be made of politicians where the management of economic matters in recent years is concerned, the Northern Irish peace process will be an enduring positive legacy for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor in particular, the Taoiseach himself, other members of the Government and political leaders on all sides of the House.  This issue has united politicians over many years and people have been willing to make the necessary sacrifices and find a common voice.  That voice is vital.  At a time when we are reflecting on the back-sliding of a certain minority seeking to disrupt our delicate settlement, it is important that we all emphasise the need for a firm and moral commitment across all levels of society.  Now that the bullet has been replaced by the ballot, no one who wants to go backwards should ever find comfort or support in any failure on the part of true democrats to call a spade a spade.  For this reason, the unity of political voices is essential in facing down those who would seek to sow discord and regenerate chaos.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach rightly discussed peace being secured, but peace must be constantly resecured.  It is vital that there be economic development to secure that peace.  Politics has delivered peace, but eaten bread is soon forgotten.  Now, we all must deliver prosperity and hope so that people who have been marginalised for many years will see the tangible improvement in their quality of life that is part of the fruit of peace.  It is easy for elites to get on with one another.  I had the good fortune of hosting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

D&eacute;anann s&eacute; beag den cheist nuair nach bhfuil againn ach uair a chloig ar an l&aacute; seo.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the most pressing issue in terms of the implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews agreements is the need for the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast.  This long overdue and essential work must be completed.  It is a key element of the Good Friday Agreement.  For the new dispensation to function in the North, we need a new beginning in policing and justice.  While much has been achieved by all concerned in this respect, we must move quickly to the next phase.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement and urge him to use his office to ensure we move to the next phase as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P>I note the progress made at last week&rsquo;s all-Ireland ministerial council on a number of infrastructural projects.  I refer to those mentioned by the Taoiseach, projects that affect my constituency in the north west, the N2, Project Kelvin and other projects that are important for the <Col N="1244"/>island&rsquo;s economic recovery.  However, I wish to refer to some projects that are not going well, such as the all-Ireland autism centre for which the Government has withdrawn funding.  I urge the Taoiseach to reconsider this matter in light of what would benefit all children with autism.</P>
        <P>We have welcomed the many positives, but we have seen some terrible shadows in recent months, two of which I will discuss.  The first is the recent treatment of the Romanian families in Belfast by racists who forced them out of their homes and the city.  I condemn those racists.</P>

I deplore last night&rsquo;s activity throughout many parts of the Six Counties.  In particular, I deplore the individuals and micro-groups responsible for it.  Let us be clear that they exploited a situation in which the Orange Order refuses to show real leadership and continues to force five or six marches among thousands through an area where they are not accepted by people on the ground.</P>

	<P>As the Independent group&rsquo;s nominee on the all-party Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I appreciate the Taoiseach&rsquo;s kind words of acknowledgement of the work done by the committee&rsquo;s members.  It is a privilege to sit on it alongside colleagues from Northern Ireland and I look forward to continuing to work on it to end the divisions that have scarred the island for so long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House and acknowledge what he said about the contributions of party leaders and Ministers for Foreign Affairs over the past 20 years in the context of the considerable achievements in this period.  In particular, I recall the contributions of a former leader of my party, Mr. Dick Spring, in that period of the 1990s from the Downing Street Declaration until the ceasefire.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, he has been most generous in acknowledging the various contributions by Members of all parties on what has been achieved.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech was good and I thank him for it.  He will appreciate there are not many occasions on which Members on this side of the House congratulate those on the other side on their speeches.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In this case, the Taoiseach has given a very fair-minded and helpful account of the Government&rsquo;s management and stewardship of the peace process and what has arisen therefrom in the past two or three years.  This was important because we do not get an opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland very often in the House.  The Taoiseach was correct to point to the achievements and my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, and others were correct to express their regret and revulsion in respect of events in the North last night.  It is hoped these <Col N="1245"/>will be short lived and that the police and others will take all the steps necessary to ensure they do not recur.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty, in addition to the Taoiseach, was correct to state the bringing into the North of policing and justice is an important next step.  It is long overdue.  There are difficulties and sensitivities pertaining to policing but it constitutes a vital step that needs to be taken as early as possible to make progress and bed down the normality that has been achieved in the North.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, when referring to the economic recession we are facing, implied it has the potential to reinforce mutual dependency between the North and South.  I agree with his statement.  He referred to the measures we can adopt together, North and South, to build a genuine all-island economy.  We talk about it a lot and, in this regard, colleagues referred to the transport infrastructure projects that have been pursued and to the problems associated with health and higher education co-operation that need to be addressed.</P>
        <P>While endorsing all the points made on what has been achieved, I ask the Taoiseach and the North-South Ministerial Council to consider east-west infrastructural developments in addition to North-South infrastructural projects.  This is a time of recession and people might believe such proposals are fanciful in such a context but very often a time of pressure and recession is the very time to be more ambitious.  If we consider the relative proximity of this island to its neighbouring island and the developments between Denmark and Sweden, we will realise Ireland is likely to constitute the only part of the European Union that is separated from the European mainland by the sea.  Bearing in mind that this matter has been considered by many expert technical and engineering groups in Britain, including the rail companies, will the Taoiseach consider a feasibility study on some form of physical link, by way of a tunnel or bridge, between this island and the neighbouring island?  This is not an entirely fanciful suggestion as it has been taken up in other parts of the world where the distances in question are much greater.</P>
        <P>When focusing on economies, particularly city economies, we should take into account the considerable importance of high-speed rail links between cities across Europe.  On more than one occasion <i>The Economist</i> has stated that Europe is in the grip of a high-speed rail revolution.  What better project could we imagine for the future generation?  I accept it is unlikely to be carried out in our generation given the sheer ambition, application and funding required, perhaps on the part of many different sources.</P>
        <P>When bearing in mind what has been achieved on this island, we should look back less often than we used to.  We can afford to look to the future and, in this regard, the Taoiseach may consider the project I propose, even at the level of a very basic feasibility study or at the level of considering whether it would be desirable in the first instance to link this island to the neighbouring island, which itself has a high-speed rail link to the European mainland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  Today&rsquo;s statements are informed by the events of yesterday evening.  The events are disappointing and still have a capacity to shock.  There was a time when the events of last night were an everyday occurrence in the North.  The sense of hopelessness and despair at that time generated indifference such that there would have been no shock in respect of last night&rsquo;s events.  That violence born of hatred still occurs implies we have a responsibility to build bridges to ensure it occurs less frequently.  This is a challenge for the political system as a whole and the Government is rising to it.</P>
        <P>The journey we have made has been amazing.  The Taoiseach, in his opening contribution, referred to the infrastructure by which co-operation is being enhanced on this island and between islands.  The success of the North-South Ministerial Council, the work of the British-<Col N="1246"/>Irish Council and the existence of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body are a case in point.  The latter comprises representatives of all political parties from all parliamentary forums on these islands.  The work being done is very valuable and the work that needs to be done necessitates involving non-governmental organisations and community groups and winning the hearts and minds of the people.  It is a question of bedding down the peace process in the coming years.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Taoiseach is correct in stating bedding down the peace process has an economic dimension, especially in the times in which we live.  We must constantly examine how the economic relationship with the North can be developed.  There are obvious difficulties in that the two jurisdictions have different currencies and rates of corporation and other taxes.  We should work to overcome these obstacles.  There are natural economic hinterlands we should be trying to exploit and turn into enterprise zones.  I refer to the relationships that exist between Dundalk and Newry, Letterkenny and Derry, Sligo and Enniskillen, and Monaghan and Armagh.  If there is a job for us to do in trying to restructure our own economy, it is mutually beneficial to examine cross-Border economic relationships because doing so will bear fruit.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>We can already point to some significant areas of success that will assist with the types of economic developments to which I refer.  The work being done at Strangford Lough under the auspices of the ESB and its partners in respect of renewable energy demonstrates exactly what can be achieved mutually, both economically and environmentally.</P>
        <P>One of the real successes associated with the ongoing work between the various political representatives on this island is that where disagreements occur, they occur not so much on constitutional issues but on issues of political policy.  I was particularly pleased with the appointment of a new Minister of the Environment in the Northern Ireland Assembly because the views of his predecessor on environmental policy do not coincide with those of many others.  However, that we differ only on this type of issue demonstrates the success of where we are going as a people on this island.</P>
        <P>My party is organised on an all-island basis.  There is a distinction between being organised on an all-island basis and an all-Ireland basis.  Our sole representative in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr. Brian Wilson, represents the constituency of North Down and most of his constituents define their identity in terms of their Britishness.  Our agreements on trying to make progress with regard to common purpose on this island, be it the Belfast agreement or the St. Andrews Agreement, must give due recognition to people&rsquo;s identities, how they are valued and how we can share them as we proceed.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">Despite the fact that we will see more events such as those of last night, they will occur less frequently and the prognosis is optimistic.  The work of all public representatives on all parts of this island, with the co-operation of our colleagues on the neighbouring island, shows that this process is going in the right direction and achieving success.  I am confident the Taoiseach and the Government will help to bring it to its next level.  I value the opportunity to mark that progress in this House today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>All the amendments we are bringing back are technical, minor, drafting style amendments so I will address most of them together.  The amendments to sections 3 and 21 on the long title arose out of proposals originally put forward by the Seanad.  This Bill was the subject of an intensive and lengthy debate in this House on Second and Committee Stages.  Arising out of those debates several amendments tabled here were either accepted here or the Government agreed to introduce them in the D&aacute;il.  I appreciate the impressive contribution of the Seanad to the development of this Bill. </P>
        <P>In total eight amendments were agreed to during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il, four of which were the result of a commitment given in this House to introduce such amendments on foot of suggestions by the Labour Party.  These amendments to sections 3, 21 and the long title update the legislative citations used for the Harbours Act and the planning and development Acts.  I brought forward another four amendments on foot of the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel which corrected a drafting imperfection in section 7 and altered the wording used in section 9 to further protect the section against any future challenge should a ministerial order be made under it.  These changes do not alter the substance or intent of the sections as originally debated in the House.</P>
        <P>The amendments are relatively minor, technical drafting amendments and meet the requirements of the House as discussed when the Bill was here previously.</P>

        <P>I will limit my comments to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  One improvement the House made in the original legislation was acceding to the request that any changes in the boundaries of the harbour or any changes that might take place as a result of this legislation be congruent and consistent with the planning laws and background of the area within which the harbour is located.  The Chamber added great value to the Bill by focussing on this area.  The amendments under discussion ensure that the legislation to which the Bill will refer will extend to the present moment, in contrast to the previous draft in which the references extended to 2006.  All the amendments I have considered appear to be technical and hopefully will make the operation of the Bill more effective.</P>

This is an exercise in democracy and highlights the importance of the Seanad as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are here to amend legislation, to agree and disagree.

The protracted debate on this Bill has probably led to many who are not here, the general public, especially in west Cork, having a say in the Bill, which is important.  The Minister appreciated the effort made when the Bill was thrashed out on Second Stage.  The communities that felt they would be swamped and controlled by greater powers will see the benefit of the work done here.  </P>
        <P>I thank the Minister on behalf of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, who is not present.  He and Senator McCarthy had a grievance about one part of the country.  The Minister saw the wisdom of their intentions and was more than supportive when he saw the necessary amendments being made.  I compliment him and thank him and his officials for the way they dealt with this Bill.</P>

I am confident that the changes introduced in this Bill will ensure that our ports are well-placed to assist the State, not only to recover from the current economic difficulties but also to take advantage of future economic opportunities.  </P>
        <P>I thank the Members and staff of this House for their assistance, co-operation and support in facilitating the passage of this Bill.  I also thank my officials for their work on it.

The basis for the amendment is found in section 71B(2) of the 2006 Act, which defines &ldquo;expertise&rdquo; as &ldquo;experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications.&rdquo;  The member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who has the requisite expertise within that meaning is none other than the chief superintendent.  One accumulates experience during the years working in the field and to have the evidence of just any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not necessarily fulfil that criteria.  Specialised knowledge is what one would expect somebody who qualifies for the rank of chief superintendent to have acquired.  By definition, if a member of the Garda has graduated to the rank of chief superintendent one would expect him or her to have such qualifications.  The very wording of the section speaks to the amendment that is being made.  I do not think it would be denied by the Minister that a chief superintendent would have the expertise required to provide an opinion as to the existence of a criminal organisation.</P>
        <P>The section stipulates that the member or former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must appear to the court to &ldquo;possess the appropriate expertise&rdquo;.  How is a judge to determine that a particular garda or former garda has such expertise and is, therefore, an &ldquo;appropriate expert&rdquo;?  My amendment would introduce the necessary safeguard that only garda&iacute; of the rank of chief superintendent could be deemed suitable to provide such expertise.  Such persons would, by definition, fulfil the requisite provisions of subsection (2) without any need for the court to make that assessment.  The chief superintendent would be drawn on all the information available from his or her subordinates to make a determination in regard to a particular organisation.</P>
        <P>This Bill provides for a new offence of directing a criminal organisation, while existing legislation provides for the offence of acting recklessly in terms of co-operating with or participating in a criminal gang.  To designate a criminal organisation is a major determination and is the ultimate precondition for the conviction of the crimes of participating in, directing or otherwise being involved in a criminal organisation.  It is important, therefore, that we get this aspect of the legislation right and that the necessary safeguards are in place.  The wording of the Bill must be precise and effective.</P>
        <P>There is a precedent for the requirement that evidence may only be provided by a garda of the rank of chief superintendent, although I appreciate that the role of the latter under the Offences against the State Act is to name an individual who is a member of an organisation and therefore commits an offence.  Nevertheless, the responsibility to designate a criminal organisation is a serious one and should only be made by a person with the requisite knowledge, experience and qualifications, as the Bill requires.  A garda of the rank of chief superintendent meets those requirements and is the person best qualified to make that determination and provide that opinion and evidence to the court.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment No. 2 is put forward largely for the same reasons as those rehearsed by Senator Regan.  I ask the Minister to clarify the notion of &ldquo;expertise&rdquo; in this section.  The extent to which this is explained will influence Members on this side of the House in ascertaining whether it might be acceptable for such evidence to be given by any member or former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Like Senator Regan, I cannot understand, <Col N="1250"/>from my reading of the section, how a court is to come to the conclusion that a particular garda or former garda has the appropriate expertise.  &ldquo;Expertise&rdquo; is defined in the section as &ldquo;experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications&rdquo;.  Any garda or former garda deemed to have such expertise is then referred to in the section as the &ldquo;appropriate expert&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>An obvious argument in favour of the amendment is that a chief superintendent, with all his or her experience, background knowledge and judgment, is a person who, at least at a superficial level, would be regarded as possessing a high level of expertise and in whom one would perhaps be more likely &mdash; without meaning to cause offence to individual members of the force &mdash; to repose a high level of reliance than may be the case in respect of &ldquo;any&rdquo; member or former member.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain the rationale for this provision.  One possible explanation may be the argument that levels of expertise can be developed by individual members of the force which would not require them to be an inspector, superintendent or chief superintendent.  There are individual garda&iacute;, whether community garda&iacute; or otherwise, who, by virtue of their day-to-day activities, become experts on this or that aspect of Garda work.</P>
        <P>If that is what the Minister has in mind, it is not what has been stated in defence of the provision.  I am not completely sure, from any of the material I have seen or read, why we are to depart from what may not be an absolute policy but is certainly a practice with which we are familiar in legislation, whereby one relies on relatively senior garda&iacute; to deal with matters such as this.  To clarify, I am not at all confused in the way that the Minister has suggested people outside the House may be confused.  That is, I understand fully that the role of garda&iacute; under this section has to do with evidence in regard to the existence of an organisation rather than membership of it.  However, I cannot see the basis for the argument that an individual garda could have developed any particular level of expertise other than that he or she knows of the existence of a particular organisation.  I am trying to navigate my way around this provision but cannot understand the rationale behind it.  I hope the Minister will be able to put me right in this regard.</P>
        <P>Nor can I understand the inclusion of the provision whereby any former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may be deemed to be an expert in these matters.  There is not even a stipulation that such a person&rsquo;s membership must have ceased within a particular time limit.  Under the section, it is comprehended that a person who left the force many years ago may be deemed to have the requisite expertise.  It is somewhat perplexing that any such person could be regarded by a court as possessing such expertise regarding the existence of a criminal organisation.  It would be of assistance if the Minister would elaborate on the rationale for this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am opposed to section 7.  While either amendments No. 1 or No. 2 would go some way towards improving it, I am fundamentally opposed to the principle expressed in the section that a garda or former garda of any rank may give evidence as to the existence of a particular criminal organisation and that this evidence shall be admissible as expert evidence.  As I explained earlier, this flies in the face of established rules of evidence.  I accept, as I said on Second Stage, that the Minister has not inserted a provision whereby a garda can give evidence of his or her belief that a person is a member of an organisation.  Nonetheless, the evidence proposed in section 7 is a prerequisite for proof of the commission of an offence under section 71A, as inserted by section 5, section 72 and section 73 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, all of which relate to criminal organisations.  Clearly, some level of proof as to the existence of a particular criminal organisation will be part of the proofs for that.  In section 7(4) there is already a range of different types of evidence from which a court may <Col N="1251"/>deduce that a particular group constitutes a criminal organisation, or that it exists.  I am not clear why this extra provision is inserted when it seems to me to be so problematic.</P>
        <P>I have been re-reading the Hederman report of 1999.  I am not suggesting that report was against the Special Criminal Court.  In fact, the majority argued for the retention of that court.  However, when they looked at the nearest equivalent of this provision, which was section 3(2) of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1972 that provides for the evidence of a chief superintendent as to membership, they provided various commentaries on page 124 of the report, which seem to be relevant in considering this provision.  They point out that the opinion evidence rule in section 3(2) appears to violate three established rules of evidence.  Paragraph 6.91 of the report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">First, while acknowledged experts are permitted to give evidence of opinion, their expertise must be established and their opinion is generally confined to scientific, medical, engineering and cognate matters, and the application of such knowledge to factual dicta in accordance with established professional norms.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is very different from the sort of opinion evidence we are talking about here.  As I said earlier, expert opinion is allowed as an exception to the normal rule against the admission of opinion evidence.  This section purports to declare somebody to be an expert.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking to the amendments.  If we are going to go down the road of declaring people to be expert at the very least the persons concerned should be of a high enough rank in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their opinions to carry a certain weight.  Even then, I am against the principle of section 7, in particular subsection (1) which seeks to insert a new section 71B.</P>
        <P>I see the Minister has a copy of the Hederman report and has presumably examined the provision I mentioned.  The majority of the Hederman committee went on to say they did not believe that a person should be convicted of the offence of membership solely on the basis of the opinion of a chief superintendent.  They said, however, that such opinion might be treated by the courts as corroborative evidence in appropriate cases.  The majority were not in any way liberal in their thinking generally in terms of the Special Criminal Court.  However, it is interesting to note that they looked at the case law on section 3(2) and pointed out that the courts were reluctant to convict where there was no other evidence.  I accept that it is a different type of provision but it is the same principle &mdash; that it declares the opinion of a garda in some way to be admissible in evidence as to the existence of certain facts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a concern that the provision as currently drafted does not have any reference to the need for any corroboration.  Neither does it have any reference to the need for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of any particular rank to give the evidence.  It simply seems to allow any member or former member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who appears to the court to possess the appropriate expertise, to give evidence as to the existence of a particular criminal organisation.  The only guidance for the court as to what is expertise is in section 7(2) which states that: &ldquo;&lsquo;expertise&rsquo; means experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications&rdquo;.  That is very different to the sort of experts we are used to seeing in the criminal courts, such as a forensic pathologist or engineer.  They are persons with professional qualifications who give an interpretation of facts that no lay person could give.  The sort of evidence that, inevitably, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have to give will be based on a mixture &mdash; the Hederman committee said this &mdash; of hearsay and other inadmissible evidence, which would not in themselves be admissible as evidence.  They are talking about the opinion of a chief superintendent there, in section 3(2).</P><Col N="1252"/>
        <P>I think therefore that there is insufficient guidance for the courts as to how they will judge expertise.  There is no provision for any requirement of corroboration, although there is a list of matters which could be regarded as separate evidence of the existence of an organisation or, indeed, could be regarded as corroboration.  As a whole, the section is drafted so broadly in terms of the sort of evidence it appears to allow, that it is very much flawed.  It does not even say whether the garda concerned should have any particular personal knowledge of the facts on which he or she is to give evidence.  There is no requirement that they be linked in any particular way to the area about which they are speaking or any other matter of that nature.</P>
        <P>In his speech, the Minister said the reason he has put in &ldquo;any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of no particular rank&rdquo; is so that it can be at the level closest to the ground, the person who has the most direct personal knowledge.  However, there is nothing in the section to say that the court must be satisfied that this is in fact the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is closest to the organisation, the existence of which is alleged.  There is nothing there to give the court that connection which the Minister says is so important.</P>
        <P>For all those reasons I am opposing the section.  The proposed amendments would improve it somewhat, but I would still have a fundamental objection to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened carefully to what my colleagues Senators Alex White, Bacik and Regan said.  I also heard the Minister speaking on this very point in section 7.  Like many others, there is a certain degree of mixed feelings among all of us on this matter.  We all share the concern that something needs to be done in the fairly unique circumstances in which we find ourselves.  As I said on the Order of Business earlier, however, it is because this is so important that it is so regrettable the Bill is being rushed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is right to clarify that there may have been people who mistakenly understood this section to provide that what would be admissible was the opinion of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether a person was a member of a certain criminal organisation.  We are all clear that is not what is being proposed.  It is simply and solely about the word of a garda being taken as evidence of the existence of a particular criminal organisation.  It is significant that many people who operate in the legal world and are dealing with victims as well as accused parties have such concerns about this legislation.</P>
        <P>I am indebted to one barrister, Ms Catherine McGillicuddy, with whom I have been in correspondence.  She wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">Many people will be relieved to hear that the Government is doing something to tackle gangland crime.  However, it is important to ask if these new measures are the right solution for the problems that gangland crime presents.  New laws do not necessarily mean better laws.  New laws must fit into the broader legal system; that is to say they must be constitutional.  They should also address existing concerns and produce concrete results.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Does this legislation make the achievement of a successful criminal prosecution more likely?  Or is it something that has the appearance of making a successful prosecution more likely?  The danger is that the untested opinion, even of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, could form part of a patchwork of deception in which an innocent person could potentially be successfully prosecuted.  This is what is at stake.  As it has evolved, our entire legal system is careful about making sure that innocent people do not go to jail.  In order to do that, it puts a very high onus on the prosecution.  It requires that a prosecution must reach a very high threshold in proving the case.  I heard the Minister refer earlier to things being the opinion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that X should be done.  We discussed this last week in the context of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I am uncomfortable about that type of situation where we are <Col N="1253"/>being told that it is the opinion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this should be done and that it is the only thing that can be done.  However, we are not actually having the discussion behind the presentation of the proposed legislative change.  For all these reasons, I join in the concern expressed by Senators Bacik and White.  However, with regard to the requirement that the garda giving a statement on the existence of a particular criminal organisation be not below a certain rank, I do not see how that brings about a situation in which the person with the closest knowledge of gangland activity would not be in a position to assist the courts.  If there is a serious issue such as the existence of a criminal organisation one would expect that a senior member of the Garda would be in a position to give the requisite testimony.  Therefore, to require that the person be not below a certain rank is a reasonable amendment to what is, to say the least, a rather adventurous change in the law proposed by the Minister.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator anticipating something?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will rephrase that and say that I urge the Minister not to change his stance because he has hit the nail on the head with this Bill.  It shows tremendous courage and conviction and that he is prepared to take action, not just talk.  As far as I can see, the Opposition is all talk and no action.  It is trying to delay the Bill.  The Minister has outlined why the Bill must be passed and be available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to fight organised crime.  That is what it is all about.  The fact that a garda, whether in the force or retired, could be called on to establish the existence of particular organisations, although not an individual as such, is clear in the Bill.  The Minister outlined it extremely well today and it is a very clear Bill.  It is the Director of Public Prosecutions, an independent authority, who decides whether cases are suitable for a non-jury court, namely, the Special Criminal Court.  There are many safeguards in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I note the concerns of the Garda Representative Association, which has, I presume, expressed them to the Minister.  However, I have one question about the giving of evidence by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether current or retired.  What protection is there for that garda in court with regard to his or her identity?  The garda should identify himself or herself and be satisfied that the judge knows his or her identity.  Would the Minister consider amending the regulations so that the garda would not be identified?  These garda&iacute; have families and are subject to vendettas by these criminal organisations.  Garda&iacute; are at the cutting edge of the fight against organised crime.  Many have sacrificed their own lives in defending the State.  That is why the Minister is supporting the Garda in its work.  I note the input of the Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, a courageous leader of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who has urged the Minister, as far as I can see from his statement today, to introduce the Bill as quickly as possible so that he may have more tools with which to fight organised crime.</P>
        <P>The idea behind the Bill is to deal with the intimidation of juries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  I will not be coming in and out of the Chamber all evening as I have one specific question for the Minister and I would like to hear his response.  Juries can be nobbled in different ways.  I came across one case in which it was understood that people came, apparently innocently, to the houses of the jury members selling vacuum cleaners and told the jurors how good the person on trial was.  No threats were mentioned; it was all done in a different way.  This may be anecdotal and there may be no truth to it, but I was told it in conversation a long time ago.  I will not say where or when the incident was supposed to have taken place.</P>
        <P>When one goes into the Four Courts or any court one can see the jury, and it is easy, in a small country, to identify the jurors.  The threat to those people&rsquo;s futures is what the Minister is attempting to deal with in the Bill.  I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, trying to fight organised crime and not putting the lives of innocent citizens and their families at risk, as happened in Limerick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept these amendments, about which we had a good discussion in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>As expected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue under discussion is opinion evidence.  Senator Bacik referred to the Hederman report.  The normal understanding of opinion evidence is based on section 3(2) of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1972, which states with regard to certain offences related to paramilitary organisations: &ldquo;Where an officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not below the rank of chief superintendent, in giving evidence in proceedings relating to an offence ... believes that the accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation, the statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.&rdquo;  That is not in this Bill and I thank the Senators for at least acknowledging that fact.  The reason this amendment was tabled in the D&aacute;il was a misunderstanding that what we were proposing in section 7 was similar to what is contained in the aforementioned Act with regard to opinion evidence.  The penny has finally dropped that we are not going as far as the Act does, mainly for the reason, as mentioned by Senator Bacik, that the interpretation by the courts is that it cannot be accepted solely as evidence of guilt and that there must be corroborative evidence.</P>
        <P>The difficulty with gangland crime, as I mentioned in my Second Stage speech and in the D&aacute;il, is that it is far more difficult to prove the existence of a paramilitary organisation than a criminal organisation or gang.  Gangs by their nature do not have membership lists or the types of structures that paramilitary organisations are recognised to have.  The members of such organisations, when they go into court &mdash; now that they have latterly recognised the courts &mdash; accept that it is easier to ground a conviction.  That is one of the reasons the offence of membership of an illegal paramilitary organisation has been one of the more successful in terms of prosecutions with regard to the paramilitary threat to this country.  However, it is different for criminal gangs.  A certain number of people who are known to be part of a criminal gang could be meeting on the side of the street but they could be talking about last night&rsquo;s football match.  Thus, it is more difficult to prove that the gathering has criminal intent.</P>
        <P>After the Shane Geoghegan murder I was exhorted by Members of the Oireachtas to consider again the issue of opinion evidence.  I was encouraged to introduce what was effectively internment &mdash; lifting people off the street, as one Member said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      
      </Speaker><Col N="1255"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was then encouraged, as a more reduced measure, to bring in opinion evidence.  As I pointed out, opinion evidence has been successful but one must obtain corroborative evidence, which is much more difficult in the area of gangland crime.  The reason we are now introducing these measures is that we regard them as an alternative.  It has been extremely difficult to ground prosecutions on the basis of the offence contained in the existing legislation in respect of participation.  Only one such prosecution has been taken and in that instance the individual pleaded guilty.  In such circumstances, the position was not really challenged in the court.</P>
        <P>We re-examined the position in respect of opinion evidence following the murder of Shane Geoghegan as a result of the exhortations of Members of the Oireachtas.  I asked the Attorney General to reconsider this matter in order to discover whether a provision relating to it might be included in the legislation.  He gave exactly the same legal opinion to the Government as his predecessor did when the original legislation was being drafted.  The basis of that advice is that opinion evidence only goes so far.  The courts have decided that corroborative evidence must be provided and that a witness cannot merely state that a person is a member of the IRA or that someone else is a member of a particular gang.  Section 7 is, therefore, an innovative way of trying to establish that there is, in a particular geographical area, a criminal gang.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The point the Senators have made in respect of the amendments is that the person who provides the evidence required should be a chief superintendent.  Let us consider what would be the position if a criminal gang were operating in my hometown of Dundalk and what would happen if we were trying to establish grounds to prosecute some of its members.  The chief superintendent for our area is based in Drogheda.  Are the Senators stating that he would have better knowledge than a garda operating on the ground in Dundalk?  The position could be similar in Limerick where, perhaps, an assistant commissioner for the area could be based in Cork.  The latter would be obliged to give evidence in a court case and would not possess the same knowledge, expertise or opinion as, for example, a detective inspector who operates in Limerick on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that it is more than likely that a person giving evidence under this section would hold the rank of detective inspector, namely, a person who would know seed, breed and generation of the various people involved in the gangs in a particular area.  The Garda has insisted that it is not the rank of the individual garda that is important, it is rather the actual knowledge, expertise and experience he or she possesses which should qualify him or her to provide evidence as to the existence of a gang and not in respect of whether a certain individual is a member of that gang.</P>
        <P>As stated on Second Stage, any good lawyer would be able to drive a coach and four through the evidence of a chief superintendent who might spend most of his or her working life sitting behind a desk and who might not possess knowledge relating to the existence or the workings of a particular gang.  In view of what Opposition Members stated on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, and leaving aside the various arguments with regard to getting it wrong in the context of the provision of opinion evidence, prior to the debate on Committee and Remaining Stages there, we returned to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and pursued the matter further.  Again, those at the highest levels in the force indicated that as far as they are concerned it is not the rank of the garda that is important but rather the expertise he or she possesses.</P>
        <P>I do not accept Senator Bacik&rsquo;s contention that the section does not provide guidance to the courts in respect of this matter.  Such guidance is clearly outlined in the relevant subsections.</P>
        <P>Section 13 states that nothing shall prevent a court, in proceedings under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, from excluding evidence that would otherwise be admissible if, in its opinion, the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value.  This safeguard <Col N="1256"/>is being included in order to ensure that only a certain weight, and no more than that, will be placed on this type of evidence.  It will obviously be the responsibility for the Garda to establish the expertise of the person.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to ensuring that a garda providing the evidence should remain anonymous.  That would be neither acceptable nor feasible because he or she must be subject to cross-examination in open court in respect of his or her experience and knowledge.  Unfortunately, it is a hazard of the job that garda&iacute; must give evidence.  Garda&iacute; are resolute in performing their duties and we compliment them in that regard.</P>
        <P>We have made provision in respect of former members of the force for the simple and valid reason that the person who may possess the most expertise might be a garda who has just retired.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might put forward an ex-member who might be ten years out of the force and who might now have a career in a completely different area.  What has been stated in this regard is nonsense, particularly in view of the fact that the court must be satisfied that the ex-garda in question is capable of imparting knowledge that is relevant to his or her experience.  The section provides a belt and braces approach in respect of a situation where a trial might be initiated and where the person who possesses the most expertise might only have left the force a couple of months earlier.  In such circumstances, it would be far better to oblige that individual to provide evidence than it would be to have a garda with less experience or an officer who has not been serving in an area for a long period do so.</P>
        <P>When one is dealing with gangs, in many instances one is dealing with families or a number of families that have come together to form a gang.  It is, therefore, important that there be a continuity of experience in respect of who might or might not be a member.  In certain instances, a member of one gang might transfer his or her allegiance to another.  This has happened quite often.  Again, the section is designed to contemplate such an eventuality.  Those operating on the ground who possess the best knowledge should be the ones charged with providing evidence under this section.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fundamentally disagree with the Minister.  I do not understand why we are running the risk of proceeding with this provision or why he is refusing to accede to my amendment.  There are many elements which come into play in order to form the opinion that a criminal organisation exists.  A person of the rank of chief superintendent can call on all of the resources required, such as the knowledge relating to a criminal gang and the various reports relating to the previous convictions of particular individuals.  Under the section, the question of bad character is also taken into account in forming this opinion.  Criminal law legislation has been misused in the past.  All we are doing is trying to ensure that the necessary safeguards will be put in place in order to ensure that such misuse will not be repeated.</P>
        <P>In many instances, individual garda&iacute; can be too close to an issue and cannot see the wood for the trees.  A chief superintendent will have a broader view of an entire Garda operation.  It is not merely a question of an officer possessing requisite or direct knowledge of some individuals who may have previous convictions or be guilty of bad behaviour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, the Senator stated that a person&rsquo;s bad character must be taken into account.  That is not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is how I read the new section 71B(4)(<i>a</i>)(ii), which section 7 inserts into the 2006 Act.  The Bills digest provided by the Oireachtas Library &mdash; which I find extremely helpful in dealing with matters of this nature &mdash; states:</P><Col N="1257"/>
        <P LI="1">While the section does not address the question of an individual&rsquo;s guilt or innocence it does allow the Member to infer from the previous convictions of individuals that an organised criminal gang exists.  It is the finding of the existence of this gang that is a condition precedent to the ultimate finding of guilt or innocence.  Therefore, allowing evidence of previous bad character of alleged gang members to be used by the Member to form an opinion as to the existence of a criminal gang marks a departure from the common law&rsquo;s traditional reticence to allow this evidence to be give cognisance at trial.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While this is not <i>per se</i> a criticism of the Bill, it provides that a garda infers from previous behaviour, convictions etc. that there is a criminal organisation.  The Minister spoke about the knowledge of a garda on the beat in Dundalk, compared to that of a chief superintendent in Drogheda.  However, it is not knowledge <i>per se</i> that is the criterion contained in the Bill, but expertise, which means &ldquo;experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications&rdquo;.  As they are the criteria in the Bill itself, the Minister&rsquo;s argument is contradictory.  In saying this, I do not criticise the Bill but merely suggest this amendment is appropriate to ensure the necessary safeguards against abuse in the unlikely event that it should happen.  However, past experience suggests such things do happen.</P>
        <P>The Minister does not intend to accept either this amendment or any other tonight.  However, the Minister could introduce it as a guideline within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the implementation of this Bill.  It would be an important safeguard to ensure that chief superintendents play the role of assessing and pooling all of the information and exercise their judgment based on their expertise, namely, their knowledge, experience and qualifications.  That is a role for a chief superintendent and the Bill would be all the more powerful, were decisions to be made on that basis.  They would be less likely to be challenged and I make the point that all Members support this legislation and want to make it work. As for former members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I have read that since chief superintendents are forcibly retired at the age of 60, at least one has indicated that he certainly would not make himself available to provide evidence.  I presume this is not the reason the Bill simply refers to &ldquo;former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo; as distinct from the rank.  It is important to have this safeguard in place.  The Minister mentioned internment.  Executive internment was introduced in Northern Ireland and I would not like this measure to be branded as judicial internment.  Safeguards are required and this legislation must work, which is the reason I have tabled this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The most striking argument the Minister put forward for not accepting a change requiring a chief superintendent rather than a garda to give evidence concerned the advantage an individual garda&rsquo;s direct knowledge would bestow.  The Minister gave the example of Drogheda versus Dundalk, which is not a particularly compelling argument.  I am familiar with and understand the point that chief superintendents may be based in one area but are obliged to cover two discrete areas.  However, I would have thought the role and duties of a chief superintendent would be such as to ensure he or she had an appreciation of the problems, issues and operational challenges to the force throughout his or her area of management.</P>
        <P>This provision pertains to evidence being given as to the existence of a gang and I accept the Minister&rsquo;s contention that a chief superintendent cannot be expected to know everything that is going on in every nook and cranny across the board.  However, I refer to operational problems or issues, such as the existence of a gang.  While I may be wrong, I would have thought that for something as important or as significant as the existence of gangs, a chief superintendent would be aware of, or would have a means of being informed by his or her subordinates on, the existence or otherwise of gangs.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan is correct to note this provision is not about local knowledge.  Were that the case, the Bill would say so.  However, it does not mention local knowledge.  Consequently, the <Col N="1258"/>Drogheda versus Dundalk example is not reflected in the legislation.  It refers to &ldquo;experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications&rdquo;.  I thought the Minister might make the point that levels of expertise exist within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, such as, for example, special detective units and the special branch or whatever it is called these days and that people involved in this important aspect of the Garda&rsquo;s work are those who more properly should be called upon to give such evidence.  That is a specialised specialism and an expertise one can understand.  However, the argument the Minister put forward in favour of this section is more akin to a question of local or direct knowledge.</P>
        <P>As Members discuss the difference between opinion and expertise, my concern is the measure is open to the criticism that it constitutes opinion masquerading as expertise.  I believe the Minister stated this is an ingenious way to deal with this question.  The problem in this regard is that opinion evidence must of course be corroborated.  Consequently, the way to get around that is simply by calling it expert evidence.  In reality however, it is the expression of an opinion.  As for expertise, I would have thought that all garda&iacute; have expertise, qualifications and knowledge.  Will a differentiation be made to the effect that some have more expertise on the existence of gangs than others?  I could understand such an argument from the Minister.  Were he to make such an argument, he might state it is more appropriate for specialised units within the force, such as the special branch, to give such evidence.  However, his justification did not include such a point.  Given general acceptance regarding the trust and credibility the community places in senior members of the force with long years of experience, I cannot understand what is the problem with specifying they should be called on and be relied on to give such evidence or how that is considered not appropriate.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden has a point, albeit perhaps a slightly different one from what he intended.  Why should a junior garda on the beat, perhaps the officer who came across the initial information, evidence or whatever, be exposed?  Surely it should be the chief superintendent or those superior officers who collate such information and direct activities within the force who should be exposed.  Moreover, it seems a chief superintendent will have the established public credibility in the eyes of the public.  This is not to demean or undermine anything in respect of individual garda&iacute;, junior or otherwise, past or present.  However, calling on a chief superintendent to do this would be a protection the community would value.  I cannot believe a chief superintendent would be so divorced or removed from such crucial information as the question of the existence of gangs.</P>
        <P>Lest I give the contrary impression, I emphasise my party&rsquo;s support in this regard.  The Minister has stated a number of times that although he had been called on by Deputy Rabbitte and others to do things, the Labour Party now appeared not to support him in so doing.  I wish to make clear that I support what the Minister is attempting to do in this section.  Obviously, the Minister and the Attorney General have been obliged to struggle with the question of how exactly one deals the issue of gangs, their existence and direction, the direction of activities and so forth.  I understand this is a difficult issue and one to which it would be difficult to come up with an answer.  I genuinely understand the difficulties in this regard.  However, it would be a protection for all concerned, that would command confidence across the wider community, were Members to continue to repose such a level of trust on such issues in senior members of the force, rather than in junior members on the beat. Finally, this is more of a debating point than otherwise, but it probably will arise again depending on how late into the evening Members will be obliged to debate these matters.  It is no answer to any criticisms Members might make for the Minister to assert that he could have gone a lot further.  The Minister states repeatedly that it could have been a lot worse and that he could have gone much further.  He talks about people discussing internment and all the rest of it.  Presumably he could have gone <Col N="1259"/>much further and Members would have a different level of debate.  However, the assertion that the Minister could have been more draconian is no answer to the genuine, reasonable criticisms Members are putting forward in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill states that &ldquo;In subsection (1) &lsquo;expertise&rsquo; means experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications&rdquo;.  That does not mean that any garda will be called on.  We presume the person called will have expertise in this area.  Until a month ago I knew very little about gangland activity.  One month ago, Councillor Arthur McDonald asked me to visit Carlow because of the number of bank robberies in the area and the subsequent lack of cash in ATMs.  The whole economy was affected by the lack of money.  I met a chief superintendent and a detective inspector.  A chief superintendent has an overall knowledge of the area.  His opinion on the detail of a human being before the court would not stand up to forensic inquisition.  It must be the person with the intelligence on the ground.  The detective inspector I met spends his day on the road.  He is not in an office, he moves around and the person on the road has more knowledge and expertise.  </P>
        <P>The Bill refers to retired garda&iacute;.  A new friend of mine is a former assistant commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Mr. Martin Donnellan.</P>

	<P>I do not want people named.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>He is helping me on an all-Ireland project on ageing.  He brought a case to the High Court claiming that he should not have to retire at 60.  An assistant commissioner should not have to retire at 60.  His expertise is lost to the force.  I would have that man on any project I was working on because he is a great person with tremendous knowledge.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being deprived of his experience and knowledge.  There should not be an age at which an assistant commissioner must retire.  I support what the Minister is saying.  It is important for the Minister to qualify what he means by expertise.  Perhaps the Minister already did so but I was not able to attend the Chamber until now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the words of Senators Regan and Alex White.  I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the cross-examination of a garda on the beat or the garda who proposes to give this evidence.  The difficulty is that a garda, of chief superintendent or another rank, routinely claims privilege.  Perhaps I will wait until I have the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  The garda claims privilege over sources or claims that it is confidential information.  This makes it difficult to cross-examine or get to the root of the basis for the belief.  The difficulty with this provision is that it does not require any basis for the belief, nor corroboration.  It is flawed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support the Bill but I support Senator Regan on this amendment.  Senator Regan raises an important point.  The Minister has the value of three eminent lawyers on this side of the House in Senators Regan, Alex White and Bacik.  As a lay person, does the Minister seriously think that a garda near retirement, living in the community, will stand up and name someone as a member of a criminal gang?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The garda would not be called to give evidence that a particular person was a member of a gang.  That is not what this section is about.  It is about the fact that a gang is in existence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The garda would have to give evidence on the existence of the organisation.  I cannot see him doing that and putting himself in that position.  This garda will more than likely live in the community for the rest of his life.  Surely a high-ranking official of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in a better position to present the case.  The ordinary garda is gathering intelligence but there is a system in Dundalk, for instance, where there are 100 members in the <Col N="1260"/>force to gather intelligence.  Each member adds to the intelligence.  A chief superintendent would be in a better position to give the evidence rather than a single member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The amendment would strengthen this Bill.  It brings gathering intelligence into focus.  Senior members of the force are not taking responsibility and are handing responsibility for this down the line to a garda on the beat.  The latter is only gathering intelligence on a daily basis and is bringing that back to his or her superiors after his or her shift.  Surely they are in a better position to give this evidence than a single member of the force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>We support this Bill.  My experiences as a public representative mean that I am glad to see such a Bill before the House.  The constituency in which I live, Dublin Central, has been utterly terrorised by the existence of gangs and what they have done.  My experience leads me to support the aims of this legislation and to support the amendment of Senators Regan and Alex White.  There are three points for the Minister to consider.</P>
        <P>This Bill allows a garda to offer testimony in court regarding the existence of a gang.  I have dealt extensively with chief superintendents in my role as a public representative through community policing fora that were set up in Dublin Central.  Any of the chief superintendents I dealt with would be fully aware of the existence of any gangs, who constitutes them and their activities.  Based on how these people perform in private and in public meetings, they would have the experience to provide that testimony in court.  If we find ourselves in the situation where chief superintendents do not have the expertise or background to put the case in court and survive cross-examination, what is their role in the first place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Donohoe saying they are the only ones who can offer this testimony?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does Senator Donohoe say that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to answer that.  Senator Mary White referred to becoming aware of the existence of gangs over the past month.  Over the five years I was a public representative, I have been deeply aware of what gangs are up to and the effect they have in the community.  This is why I support the Bill.  However, this amendment would improve the Bill.  In response to what the Minister stated my reason for stating this is based on my experience of the performance of chief superintendents.  To state that a chief superintendent would not be able to offer testimony in court on the existence of a gang within an area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we are not stating that either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will continue and in the Minister&rsquo;s response&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a garda of any rank and can equally be a chief superintendent under the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will respond afterwards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>What I am stressing is my contention that it should only be a chief superintendent.</P>
        <P>When the Minister responded to what one of my colleagues stated he made the point that a chief superintendent might not have the knowledge on the ground to put forward an effective <Col N="1261"/>testimony in court.  I am making the point that from my experience of seeing chief superintendents perform I am equally certain that they would.</P>
        <P>I have two further points to make in support of this.  The first is with regard to the idea of distance.  I am not sure it is appropriate that inspectors and sergeants operating in their communities and having daily engagements with gang members are the same people upon whom this power is conferred.  I have seen the intimidation to which some of these garda&iacute; are subjected.  I would have thought that for the safe exercise of their duty and the safety of those on the beat in the community, that this responsibility should be conferred on people who are not on the footpaths of the community all day long.  It is appropriate that something such as this be limited to the very senior ranks of the Garda.</P>
        <P>The second is that the Bill makes reference to expertise, meaning experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications.  Surely somebody who reaches the rank of chief superintendent is one who will accumulate all these qualities on his or her way up the promotional ladder in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  For all of these reasons the amendment would improve the operation of the Bill and would ensure that the Garda can ensure the objectives of targeting gangland crime are delivered safely for themselves and the community in which they are operating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to labour the point; the arguments have been made on both sides and the Minister has responded.  The Bill mentions a garda of any rank and does not exclude a superintendent or a chief superintendent.  I am not disputing what my colleague, Senator Donohoe, stated, particularly given the area in which he lives.  However, one must also consider the area in which I live.  Senator Regan mentioned the substantial quantities of drugs &mdash; some of the largest consignments in the history of the State &mdash; coming into areas such as Dunlough Bay, Mizen, Castletownbere or parts of Sheep&rsquo;s Head.  Primarily, these drugs were not for the Irish market.  No superintendent lives in most of the area I represent and one usually comes from Cork city.  The sergeant or detective sergeant on the ground &mdash; and they include some excellent people &mdash; know who is involved in the gangs.  They mingle with the people, they know who drinks in what pub and how they mix.  To exclude that evidence in this situation would be ludicrous.</P>
        <P>If one takes any situation in Dublin, by and large the boys who are out day and night covertly tracking these criminals are not chief superintendents.  They are of lesser rank but probably have more expertise in what is happening and with whom they are dealing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make this point in support of what the Minister is trying to do and not to denigrate.  We are dealing with a very serious situation and what the Minister is trying to do is to broaden the definition of a gang.  I have no doubt that people of lesser rank than a chief superintendent or a superintendent have more hands-on knowledge of what is happening in a part of a city or a remote part of Ireland such as where I come from.  It would be ludicrous to exclude their expertise.  That is what would happen if we accepted the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan eloquently explained what is meant.  In case Senator Donohoe thinks I was not aware of gangs, nothing could be further from the truth.  I received a detailed briefing from garda&iacute; at the highest level on what is happening and I intend to have them come to the audio-visual room in the autumn to present to all Members of the Oireachtas the tremendous work they are doing to try to get to grips with these intimidating gangs based not only in towns but also in rural areas.  The way Senator Donohoe responded made me feel as though I did not have a clue about it, I do.</P>

	<P>I am just giving a preamble.  Perhaps the Minister might include in the Bill reference to fights in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The broad thrust of the Bill is to be welcomed and there is an important need for it.  Anyone who watched Miriam O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s programme on Saturday night would have been struck by <Col N="1263"/>Mr. Collins and the issue of gangland crime.  I am concerned that the Minister is pinning down rank and file garda&iacute; and that he will not allow the ranking of garda&iacute; to be denoted in the Bill.  The rank of chief superintendent has status as a commanding officer and stating this rank in the Bill would take away the emphasis from local garda&iacute;.  The provision will cause difficulty for local policing.  The work of local garda&iacute; receiving information on crime, working in local neighbourhoods and gathering intelligence helps to solve much crime.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister provide the House with his definition of what constitutes a gang?  Is it one or two people who gather at the corner of a chipper on a Friday night with intent to sell or partake in drugs or to partake in anti-social behaviour?  We need to have a serious approach to the issue of gangs, not only with regard to gangland crime but the wider issue of the congregation of gangs which is not provided for in the Bill.</P>

These garda&iacute; are a bit like local councillors; they have all the information.  The supply of information would dry up if this amendment was not included in the Bill.

It would have to be someone of senior rank of the Garda to give that evidence, obviously with the addition of corroborative evidence, but that is not what we are about.  What we are about here is the proof of the existence generally of a gang, not that the accused or any accused before a court is a member of that gang.  That is subject to additional proofs.  This is purely and simply about the existence of a gang and I repeat that the strong advice of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &mdash; I accept that Members of this House would be willing to accept the advice of the garda&iacute; in this respect &mdash; is that they do not want their hands tied in regard to the rank that is required under this section to prove the existence of a gang.</P>
        <P>As I said previously, while a chief superintendent is not excluded from the section as drafted, it may be that the local chief superintendent may have recently been appointed to the area and may not have the first clue about the place.  The garda&iacute; are very much of the view that their hands would be tied in regard to the people they would proffer to the court as the people who have the direct local expertise or knowledge.  They have indicated that, more than likely, it would be a detective inspector but it may be a detective sergeant or an ordinary sergeant.  They do not want their hands tied in this regard because they believe that if it is put at the level of chief superintendent it will cause severe difficulties and it could result in a chief superintendent going into court who would not have particular direct personal knowledge of the existence of the gang.  That would leave that chief superintendent exposed under severe cross-examination because any good lawyer would ask the question: &ldquo;Do you know from your own knowledge of the existence of a gang&rdquo; and if the chief superintendent did not know that for a fact, and there was somebody else in the garda&iacute; locally who did know that fact, this legislation would be somewhat of a laughing stock in that we are forcing them to produce somebody who does not <Col N="1264"/>necessarily know of the existence, from their knowledge, of a gang whereas there is someone else in the local area who has that knowledge.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and Senator Mary White put it very well in terms of their experience.</P>

	<P>We have probably exhausted the debate on these amendments, which are similar, but I want to make some brief points.  I do not understand the rationale.  If the Minister is dealing with proving the specific offence, it is the direct knowledge of the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of that offence that is required, but at issue here is the opinion of the existence of a criminal gang, which is a more complex task.  The Minister keeps referring to knowledge.  That is not the criterion in the Bill which refers to &ldquo;... experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications&rdquo; and a chief superintendent would fulfil all those criteria, regardless of whether he was in the specific area for some time.  The Minister is not accepting this amendment and I believe he is wrong in that but it should be the rank of chief superintendent, where possible.</P>
        <P>With regard to the definition of criminal gang, the Library &amp; Research Service has provided me with information to the effect that the definition is very similar to that which applies in New Zealand as contained in section 98A of the Crimes Act 1961, which deals with participation in organised criminal group.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(1) Every person commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years who participates in an organised criminal group&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(a) knowing that 3 or more people share any 1 or more of the objectives ... described in paragraphs (a) to (d) ... contributes, or being reckless as to whether his or her conduct may&rdquo; [constitute an offence].</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I notice a distinct parallel with this legislation in regard to the definition of a criminal gang.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister said that he takes his advice from the Attorney General.  On different occasions in the debate in the Lower House and here he indicated that he would be happy to have the chief superintendent as the designated person to give the opinion of the existence of a criminal gang and draw the inferences from the evidence available and expertise, intelligence reports etc. but that the Garda insists on the wording he now has in the Bill.  I would have thought the Attorney General should have the last word on that, not the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because the Minister, ultimately, must exercise his judgment on these matters.  Time and again that argument has been used in this House.  There was a proposal that the witness protection programme should be put on a statutory basis but that was not to happen, notwithstanding the fact that it is proving very ineffective because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na insists that it be left on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The Minister should exercise his judgment in this case based on the best legal advice from the Attorney General and the safeguards that are necessary in this legislation.  The cool eye of a chief superintendent assessing the information available would be the most appropriate procedure.</P>

	<P>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the definition of a criminal gang, it is very similar to the definition in the New Zealand legislation but that is no coincidence <Col N="1265"/>because that is the internationally recognised definition under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, and a number of countries across the world have the same definition.  It is not just New Zealand that has that definition in its legislation, it is also in legislation in Canada and other countries.</P>

	<P>To respond to the Senator&rsquo;s point about following my gut instinct and that it is not necessarily the Garda Commissioner I should be listening to, the Attorney Generally fully accepted, in the discussions we had both before the drafting of this Bill and in the period between the taking of Second and Subsequent Stages in the Lower House, the issue of whether we should put in some rank but the strong advice from the garda&iacute; was not to tie their hands in regard to the rank because garda&iacute; of a particular rank who would have the knowledge might not be included under the legislation.  The Attorney General fully accepts that position from a legal point of view. </P>
        <P>A point I omitted concerned the issue Senator Bacik mentioned about privileged information.  There is a saver in section 13 on the exclusion of evidence in certain circumstances.  The new section 74(B) states: &ldquo;Nothing in this Part prevents a court, in proceedings thereunder, from excluding evidence that would otherwise be admissible if, in its opinion, the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value.&rdquo;  That is put in as a saver to protect the position in regard to the particular type of evidence that is being given.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) A person shall not be convicted of an offence under this Act based on the opinion given under this section in the absence of corroborating evidence, which shall not include evidence given to a Court based on section 9 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">While it is not provided in this section that one is giving evidence or otherwise of a specific offence, the amendment concerns inferences, etc.  Notwithstanding the section&rsquo;s purpose, the amendment is to be recommended as an additional safeguard.  When an opinion is formed by a chief superintendent or whichever member of the Garda is to provide it, the definition of &ldquo;criminal organisation&rdquo; to be used is that of a number of people who have previous convictions and are established as being members of a gang, which is itself an offence.  One can be convicted for being a member of or involved with the gang, for directing its actions or otherwise.  Evidence can emerge from the opinion that is relevant to securing a conviction.  The amendment is that there would be corroborating evidence before a court before any such offence could be deemed to be committed under the Bill.  It is a necessary and useful safeguard.  If accepted, there would be sufficient safeguards regarding the provision of essential evidence that would be normally considered admissible in court before an offence could be deemed to have been committed, and there would be corroborative evidence to support a conviction.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment and have already stated the reasons for my opposition to section 7 and the fundamental premise on which it is based.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment would not address my concerns but would improve matters in that it would certainly confirm existing case law on the nearest parallel, section 3(2) of the 1972 Act, thereby requiring the provision of corroborating evidence.  The courts will require this in any case if section 7 is ever operative.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We touched on this in respect of the preceding amendments and on Second Stage.  I cannot accept the amendment on the basis that doing so would give rise to the suggestion that opinion evidence as to the guilt of a person is provided for in the Bill; it is not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 13 provides that nothing would prevent the court from excluding evidence that would otherwise be admissible if, in the opinion of the court, the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value.  The provision in section 7 resembles section 3 of the Offences Against the State Act, which requires evidence to be given by an officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not below the rank of chief superintendent.  However, under the 1972 Act the evidence of the chief superintendent is to a person&rsquo;s membership of the unlawful organisation, i.e., the offence.  That is not the case here.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik stated she is opposing this section.  However, the section is particularly important because it endeavours to surmount the difficulty that has been present in the fight against gangland crime, that is, establishing proof of the existence of a gang.  To omit the section would take away one of the very important building blocks we believe is necessary to proceed to the next step, that is, to prove the accused is a member of a particular gang and committed offences under the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not satisfied with that response and will press this amendment.  The evidence of the existence of a criminal gang is premised on the existence of individuals who are involved in crime.  The opinion provided by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could very well prejudice an accusation of an offence against an individual and the position should be crystal clear in the Act.  There must be corroborative evidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>My opposition to section 7 relates to subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the proposed new section 71B.  The fundamental premise is that the opinion of a garda will constitute evidence as to the existence of a particular criminal organisation.  I do not have the same objections regarding subsections (4) and (5) of the proposed new section.  The fundamental premise of the first three subsections is to create a provision for so-called extra evidence.  I object to this because there are other ways of proving the existence of a criminal organisation, as in subsections (4) and (5).</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">8.&mdash;(1) The Director of Public Prosecutions shall not exercise his or her power under section 46(1) or (2) of the Offences against the State Act 1939 (as amended by section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999) to certify in writing that the ordinary courts are in his opinion inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, in relation to the trial of an offence that is not a scheduled offence within the meaning of that Act, unless the Director is of opinion, on reasonable and objective grounds, that there is a real and substantial risk that jurors or potential jurors in the case may be intimidated or put in fear.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) In any proceedings in a court where it is sought to challenge or review the basis of the opinion of the Director of Public Prosecutions referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, the court shall take all such measures as seem to it appropriate, consistent with the administration of justice, to ensure that the necessary confidentiality of information available to the Director is maintained and that the integrity of the criminal investigation and prosecution processes are preserved.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) For the avoidance of doubt, in arriving at the opinion referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, it is not necessary for the Director of Public Prosecutions to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, or on the balance of probabilities, that jurors or potential jurors in a case will be intimidated or put in fear; but the Director must be satisfied:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) that there is a real and substantial risk of such an outcome in the particular case concerned; and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) that measures lawfully available in relation to the protection of jurors and their identities are inadequate to meet the situation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have touched on this vital aspect of the proposed legislation on a number of occasions, including on Second Stage.  The Minister has acknowledged this is an area in respect of which there is considerable unease and concern although he has not yet been willing to yield to the view that the proposed section 8 of the Bill is excessive.  He has not yet set out for the House any hard evidence as to the necessity of what he is proposing.</P>
        <P>When the Minister responded on Second Stage, he was unhappy with the suggestion of mine and others that he had not produced any evidence.  He criticised our statement but did not take the opportunity to set out any evidence for the House.  Instead he referred to a number of speeches made by one of his colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  I examined those speeches, all the commentaries I could find in the newspapers and every relevant statement by the Minister himself but could find a reference to only one instance in which it was alleged that a jury was intimidated or interfered with.  It was a case in Limerick and it was referred to in a newspaper article in recent days.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was referred to in the other House by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea.  I am open to correction in saying the case &mdash; it is the only actual case referred to by anybody in the course of the debate in the past week or ten days &mdash; was moved to Dublin where a conviction was ultimately secured.  I do not contend this case should not be part of the debate but that there is a considerable difference between suggesting juries might be interfered with or intimidated and indicating or demonstrating this is the case.  While I accept that action must be taken if it is feared that <Col N="1269"/>intimidation will genuinely occur, the Minister must accept the case he is making is on a completely different level from a case in respect of which he might argue, if possible, that intimidation has in fact occurred.  I am not being pedantic because there is a quite serious distinction to be drawn.</P>
        <P>There are many awful circumstances in respect of which fear might pressurise us into considering preventive action but we do not take such action because we believe in the integrity of the criminal justice system.  We believe in holding firm with the checks and balances that exist.  It is often argued, not only in Ireland but also elsewhere, that one should think twice, or more, before taking apart the fundamental elements and pillars of the criminal justice system.  We do not allow criminals, in addition to the havoc they wreak through their crimes, to undermine and take apart our criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>Our courts secure convictions for gangland crimes that have occurred in Limerick, Dublin and other parts of the country.  Mr. Justice Carney, who is the one of the most experienced of all the judges in the Central Criminal Court, has been quoted in the newspapers as saying that when gang members are brought before jury courts over which he presides there is no difficulty convicting them.  A colleague of Senator Regan&rsquo;s, Deputy Charles Flanagan, asked the Minister recently whether he had any evidence of interference with, or intimidation of, jury members.  As I understand it, although I have not seen the letter, he said in a written reply that the Garda keeps no statistics on those matters.  I presume that if there was evidence of this the Minister would be able to tell us so.  I am sure, as Deputy Rabbitte said in the other House, that the Minister, or any Minister, who so robustly advances his proposals would not withhold examples of interference with members of juries if such information were available to him.</P>
        <P>There has been a constant conflation of threats to witnesses and jury members but these are different matters.  When people defend this legislation they refer, whether unwittingly or otherwise, to people&rsquo;s concerns about interference with witnesses.  This Bill does not deal with interference with witnesses.  There is only one reference in the Bill to witnesses and that is in section 16 which amends the 1999 Act by substituting 15 years for ten years as the penalty for witness or juror intimidation.</P>
        <P>There was a reference at the beginning of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill that gave the impression that the Bill deals with threats to witnesses.  That is not the case because the Bill does not go down that road.  The Minister has properly confronted that question elsewhere and my party has not only supported some of the legislation the Minister introduced but proposed similar legislation prior to his doing so.  This included surveillance and witness protection.  A little over a year ago I moved a witness protection Bill in this House which the Government did not support.  Parties on this side of the House have been to the fore in proposing measures to deal with this problem.</P>
        <P>The amendment we have tabled would delete the notion of providing for crimes that would automatically be triable in the Special Criminal Court but would preserve the role of the DPP in particular cases to send certain serious offences for trial to the Special Criminal Court.  He would, however, have to be satisfied on reasonable and objective grounds that there was a risk of jury intimidation.  Presumably that is the outcome the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>The legislation has gone from the initial proposition that we should do that to abolishing juries altogether in respect of a range of offences.  The Minister assured us that he has carefully considered all the alternatives.  What level of attention was given to those alternatives?  Why were those alternatives rejected?  Did the Minister rely on the opinion of the Garda only or did he debate or deliberate this with other experts?  The Minister said on Second Stage that the time for debate is over and the time for action is here.  I cannot imagine that the Minister <Col N="1270"/>misunderstands us when we say we want the Bill to have more time.  We mean we want it to have more time in the open.  We want more public debate, including in these Houses.</P>
        <P>He and his officials may have been dealing with this for months or weeks and he regards that as sufficient attention and deliberation in order to proceed.  He and his officials know the issues, as do the Attorney General and the Garda, because they have been dealing with them but we are not privy to that deliberation.  How many more times do we have to repeat that we want more time for these Houses to scrutinise the decisions that he has made?  It is not enough for him to say that he has given it all this consideration.  I accept that he has considered it carefully but he cannot abrogate the role of the Oireachtas in this process. It does not have to be particularly lengthy.  It does not have to go on for months on end, as Senator Leyden and others suggested, but we should have an insight into the basis for these decisions.</P>
        <P>I am not prepared to agree, simply because it is proposed that I should, without any persuasive argument, that &ldquo;the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order&rdquo; in respect of these offences until and unless the Minister proffers some argument that holds water on the question of the intimidation of jurors.  The case in that respect has not been made.  It would be a major statement for the Oireachtas to make the case at this point that the ordinary courts are not capable of securing the effective administration of justice.  I for one am not prepared to make that statement because I am not persuaded that is the case.  There are many other measures the Minister and the Government could take to ensure the effective administration of justice to protect jurors and to ensure the integrity of the system short of removing juries altogether.  Many other measures could be taken that have been suggested to the Minister, but there does not appear to be any wish or inclination on his part to take them.</P>

	<P>Before Senator White proceeds, I wish to draw to his attention a printing error in the list of amendments.  The words &ldquo;<i>Section opposed</i>&ldquo; appear in the middle of amendment No. 4 and they should appear at the end of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I thought.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have said that when we reached this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion the Minister appears to be making seems implausible.  I suggest that the outcome that would flow from this subsection is that it would become the norm that these matters would be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  That seems to be what is intended and what would flow from the subsection.</P>
        <P>In the current circumstances, the Minister will accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions is required to send a particular matter to the Special Criminal Court, but under the new regime matters would go automatically to the Special Criminal Court and, essentially, they would have to be taken out of the Special Criminal Court by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Juryless trials for these offences would become the norm and, clearly, that seems to be the case from this subsection.</P>
        <P>If the Minister was minded to insert in the legislation the kind of regime he appeared a moment ago to be claiming would follow, I believe he would support our amendment.  Our amendment would provide for the Director of Public Prosecutions exercising a power to certify in writing that the ordinary courts in his opinion were inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice in relation to the trial of an offence that is not a scheduled offence.  In other words, the Director of Public Prosecutions would have to form this opinion, but we make the case that the protection should be that it would have to be formed on reasonable and objective grounds that there was a real and substantial risk that jurors or potential jurors in the case may be intimidated or put in fear.  Instead of making a presumption that a jury is not appropriate or that it should not be in place, the Minister makes a presumption that it should be and that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be required to demonstrate on reasonable grounds that it was not appropriate for the reasons that he would advance for a case to be tried in the ordinary courts.</P>
        <P>I understand that there is a provision in British law that a hearing is held in respect of a proposal that a particular prosecution should be dealt with in a juryless court.  It is not an unusual proposal we are making.  It would certainly require the Director of Public Prosecutions to demonstrate in a given case that this should happen and that the matter should go to the Special Criminal Court, but it is wrong that the norm and the presumption should be that those cases in regard to those particular offences would go to the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>I am reminded of what Senator Boyle said earlier, to which I did not get an opportunity to respond, which is relevant to this amendment.  He made the point that there is an important protection in respect of the yearly renewal of aspects of legislation that come before the Houses.  We had a recent experience of that in this House, and it occurs every year around this time &mdash; I cannot remember the particular legislation as it has been a long day &mdash; where in respect of the designation of certain offences to be tried in the Special Criminal Court&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

	<P>The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1272"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for that.  Aspects of the 1998 Act are required to be renewed each year in the Oireachtas.  I was less than impressed by the rigour of the scrutiny we were able to give that renewal because of the lack of information in that respect.  While a report was laid before the Houses, in terms of knowing the background to the necessity to continue to use that legislation, we were not put in a position where we could have a satisfactory examination of those matters.  In fairness to Senator Boyle, we need to improve greatly the level, extent and nature of our scrutiny of such legislation before we can rely on that as a way of giving comfort to those of us who think this proposal is excessive.  It is not, I repeat, that we believe there is not a need for the Minister to take seriously any concerns there are about interference with juries but rather that we should respond not in an excessive but in a proportionate manner to those kinds of concerns.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On that basis, the amendment we advanced would meet that test of proportionality.  It is not excessive.  It allows for trials to take place in the Special Criminal Court in respect of these kinds of offences.  It puts a certain onus on the Director of Public Prosecutions to express an opinion but one that is based on reasonable and objective grounds.  The norm would not be that all these trials on offences would go to the Special Criminal Court unless they were taken out by the Director of Public Prosecutions but rather that the Director of Public Prosecutions would have to make the case to put them in there in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I record that I oppose this section.  I support Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment, which is a sensible and proportionate response to the concerns the Minister expressed about potential jury intimidation.  I support what Senator Alex White said about the need to show some evidence for that.  We have not been given that sort of evidence.  Given that we can accept that there are genuine concerns about jury intimidation in this sort of case, there are real dangers in the approach the Minister has taken to dealing with those concerns, that is, the approach of making a sweeping declaration that the ordinary courts are inadequate for the trial of certain organised crime offences.</P>
        <P>If I have the Minister&rsquo;s attention I might point out that this sweeping declaration is most concerning because it amounts to a pre-emptive announcement that our jury courts are not up to the task of dealing with certain offences.  That goes towards undermining the integrity of our criminal justice system.  It is a serious matter.  It amounts to an admission of defeat at the hands of criminal gangs.  It is a serious matter if we are coming to that stage.  It is unprecedented that we have made such a sweeping declaration in respect of offences that are not of a subversive nature.  I note the section appears to be modelled on section 14 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act but that related to offences committed in the context of unlawful organisations under the offences against the State legislation.  It amounted to a different type of offence to the offences of organised crime, about which we are making a similar sweeping declaration in section 8.</P>
        <P>This type of pre-emptive announcement is worrying because it amounts to what the Irish Human Rights Commission has said represents resorting to a parallel criminal justice system that does not provide the accused with the right to trial by jury.  There is a danger that we are admitting defeat by criminal gangs and that we are saying our Central Criminal Court and Circuit and District Courts are not up to dealing with organised crime and that instead we must create this parallel system of justice.  The idea of a parallel system gives rise to echoes, and I accept it is a slightly overblown comparison, of the Guantanamo Bay regime, which we must not forget was set up as a sort of parallel regime for dealing with people by the US authorities, where they felt their courts were not up to it or they were concerned about the inadequacy of their courts.  We must be careful before we make sweeping statements about the inadequacy of our courts.  Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment makes a much more proportionate response <Col N="1273"/>in the sense that it provides for the DPP to refer such cases to the Special Criminal Court, where he is of the opinion on reasonable and objective grounds that there is a real and substantial risk that jurors or potential jurors may be intimidated or put in fear.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment is much more sound constitutionally and legally in two ways.  First, it answers the criticisms made by the United Nation&rsquo;s Human Rights Committee in the Kavanagh case, where it indicated that the decision to try Mr. Kavanagh in the Special Criminal Court should have been based on reasonable and objective grounds.  It outlined that the State had not offered reasonable and objective grounds for its decision in referring his trial to the Special Criminal Court.  In that way it is a sensible response.  It also has echoes of the British law to which Senator Alex White referred, and to which the Human Rights Commission also referred.  They speak of the legislative framework in Britain where the prosecution must satisfy the court that there is a substantial likelihood that jury tampering would take place, notwithstanding any reasonable steps such as police protection that might be taken.  It is only when the prosecution has shown that is the case that it can resort to non-jury trials in respect of this sort of crime.  That would be a much more forensic and targeted approach to answer the real concerns about jury intimidation.</P>
        <P>The other issue pointed out by the Human Rights Commission is that we need to know that there are no alternative methods of dealing with the fear of jury intimidation without resorting to the Special Criminal Court.  I note that the Human Rights Commission recommended that consideration would be given to alternative methods to protect jury members against intimidation, including providing for anonymous juries, screening the jury from public view, the protection of the jury during the trial or locating the jury in a different place from where the trial is being held with communication by video link.  We might add a couple of points to those potential alternatives.  First, the new Criminal Court building that is being brought on-stream near the Phoenix Park will have much better facilities for keeping jury members separate.  Senator Leyden referred correctly to problems in the past with jury panel members mingling with everybody else going into court rooms in the Circuit Criminal Court.  There were problems in that regard, some of which have been resolved.  The coming on-stream of the new premises will answer some of those problems.  There have also been suggestions that where there is a difficulty with swearing in a jury in a particular location, a jury panel could be widened or a trial moved to Dublin, for example, if the location is outside of Dublin, so there is less potential for intimidation.  If one considers alternatives such as those, we might see a better method of protecting juries without doing away with them altogether, as in this model.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister said he is not entirely abolishing trial by jury for those offences.  I note that section 8(3) preserves the power of the DPP to direct that a person would not be sent forward, but given the presumption under section 8(1) that the ordinary courts are inadequate, and the declaration by the Oireachtas to that effect, it becomes very difficult to envisage the DPP taking a stance against that sweeping declaration in any individual case.  I hope I am wrong about that.  In fairness to the DPP, it would be going against what the Oireachtas has declared in a sweeping way about the adequacy of the ordinary courts to deal with certain organised crime offences.  It is the sweeping nature of the declaration in section 8 that requires criticism and opposition as it calls into question the integrity of our system and its ability to cope with crime more generally, which is a serious matter.</P>
        <P>To be fair, I welcome the provision in section 8(4) that the section shall be subject to review in 12 months.  That is recognition by the Minister that this is a significant departure from previous powers and that in section 8(5) and 8(6), before the section is to be continued in operation, a report must be prepared and placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, that is very important, although, as Senator Alex White said, there has been a somewhat cursory review of similar provisions in the past.  However, it is important that review is built in <Col N="1274"/>if a provision of this nature is to be introduced.  I urge the Minister to consider adopting an alternative approach such as that outlined in Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment and to give us some indication that he has considered alternative ways to protect jurors where he fears they may be subject to intimidation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to contradict my colleagues on this side of the House, but this is where I part company with them.  This goes to the heart of the Bill.  The nature of the offences at issue is such that intimidation comes to the fore.  My experience of constituents being intimidated is that it is insidious and pernicious and gives rise to a difficult situation.  I appreciate that Mr. Justice Paul Carney and others have questioned where the evidence is of intimidation of jurors.  It would have been wise for the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights to have examined the provision in more detail before it was proposed and for the Garda Commissioner to meet the members of that committee to provide information on the basis of the proposal.</P>
        <P>Every Member in this House is exempt from jury duty, both as Members of the Seanad and, in some cases, as lawyers.  Many people who speak about jury duty are exempt.  There are not many people who, if called up to serve on jury duty in a case relating to gangland crime, would not look for every conceivable way to get out of it.  I do not have the same concerns and reservations about this proposal.  I do not believe that the notion of trial by judge, as distinct from jury, for serious offences is altogether bad.  We have the tradition of trial by jury in the common law system but trial by judge is common practice in the other member states of the European Union and I do not believe their systems of justice are less effective.  This is an exceptional situation.  We have a problem with gangland crime and in this instance the provision is not unreasonable.  The amendment cuts across that entirely.</P>
        <P>I welcome two safeguards contained in the Bill.  The first is the one year review.  The second is the provision whereby nothing in section 8(3) relating to scheduled offences affects the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s powers to direct that a person would not be sent forward for trial by the Special Criminal Court.  Those two safeguards are saving clauses in this provision.  In general terms the amendment would cut across that section and weaken the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it appropriate to quote the comments of former judge, Mr. Feargus Flood, in the newspapers at the weekend?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it relevant to the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  He said that he had presided over gangland trials where juries had returned the wrong verdict.  In what was described as the most outspoken contribution on the Bill by a sitting or former judge, Mr. Flood said the plans of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to send gangland trials to the non-jury Special Criminal Court were necessary to maintain order.  He said that until we take a firm stand these people will walk all over us and steps have to be taken to bring this under control.  He said that if one has a problem with juries and intimidation, which we obviously have, three to five High Court judges presiding over a gangland trial in the Special Criminal Court would be reasonable and would be certain to get a fair result.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to delay matters by quoting what the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, said about how difficult it is to get people to serve on juries.  It is a pity so few people are aware of what was said in the D&aacute;il last week regarding the difficulty in getting people to serve on juries in gangland trials.  It is understandable that people are nervous and fearful.  However, it is shocking to discover that in the 2003 trial for the murder of Kieran Keane, 729 people <Col N="1275"/>were called for jury service but the State found it impossible to get 12 to serve.  It is important that people are aware of that reality.  There must be an engagement with the public where there is a change in public policy.  The facts must be made known so that there is an informed public debate.  This type of intimidation is the reality in the areas where these gangs operate.</P>
        <P>As I said, garda&iacute; are apparently aware of the identity of gang members and are of the view that specific legislative measures are required to ensure these people are brought to justice.  I do not see how it can be claimed that a person cannot get a fair trial where that trial is conducted before three to five High Court judges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Regan put it very fairly when he said that to accept this amendment would weaken our objective in this legislation.  It is important to reiterate that the decision to introduce this provision was not taken lightly.  At the same time, as I said before, it does not constitute a seismic change in terms of the powers already available to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, it is a signal of intent from the Oireachtas.  It is the strong view of the Government that these provisions are necessary in view of the strong and definitive evidence we have received from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the degree of intimidation of witnesses and jurors in recent times and the heightened tension surrounding gangland trials, particularly in the aftermath of the Roy Collins murder, as well as the empirical evidence, as referred to by Senator Mary White, in regard to the dramatic dropping off in the numbers of people willing to come forward to perform jury service in a gangland trial.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has stated that the level of threat posed by these gangs in certain sections of our community is similar to the threat posed formerly by paramilitaries on this island.  The Government is strongly of the view that we should send out a signal to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the public and, in particular, to those criminals who are directing and participating in criminal gangs that they run the risk of very serious penalties and will find themselves in circumstances where they will have less opportunity to take out and intimidate civilians, be they witnesses or jurors.  I hope Members will support us in this endeavour as their colleagues did in the Lower House, where the legislation was passed with a substantial majority.</P>
        <P>Contrary to claims made by some Members, the changes we made to legislation in 2006 have been very successful.  Under those provisions, written statements made by witnesses who subsequently recant those statements because they are intimidated or fearful when it comes to testifying in open court can be used as evidence by the presiding judge.  There have already been successful prosecutions in several trials where those circumstances have arisen.  In one case, for example, 11 witnesses recanted their written statements but, because of the legislation passed in 2006, the judge was able to accept them as evidence and ignore the recantations.</P>
        <P>Therefore, we have provided, to a large extent, for the issue of intimidation of witnesses.  Some commentators have pointed out that Roy Collins was not a juror but a relative of a person who gave evidence as a witness.  As such, the question has been raised as to why we are looking after jurors in this legislation.  Does anyone suggest for one minute that these gangs will have any qualms about murdering a juror given that they have already shown themselves willing to murder a relative of a witness and to continue their intimidation of that particular family?</P>
        <P>As I said, this provision was not introduced lightly.  It was a decision based on strong advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the existing powers to deal with organised crime are not adequate to meet the level of threat which currently pertains.  I accept that this legislation makes a very serious declaration.  However, it is not a permanent one in that the Bill provides for regular reviews of the continuing need for its provisions.  As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I must, before a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, place a report before each House concerning the operation of the provision to date.  The initial period of the <Col N="1276"/>provision will be one year.  Therefore, one year after the enactment of the legislation and when the report is laid before both Houses, I expect that they will give it due consideration, will examine the prevailing circumstances and consider whether the legislation has operated effectively in the previous year, and will then decide whether or not to renew it.</P>
        <P>I ask Members to consider the number of entirely innocent people who have been murdered by organised gang crime in recent times.  That number includes Roy Collins, Shane Geoghegan, Anthony Campbell and Baiba Saulite.  Members should ask themselves whether they believe that persons responsible for the bloody murder of ordinary people will hesitate for a moment to intimidate or otherwise undermine members of a jury.  That is the crux of the issue.  It is in the interests of these people, particularly the ganglords who are not pulling the trigger but are orchestrating the pulling of the trigger, to ensure these trials do not proceed.  As I said on Second Stage, that is why we are endeavouring as much as possible to take out of the equation the issue of civilians either giving evidence or being part of the jury system.</P>
        <P>Several Members referred to the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Commission.  The commission has acknowledged that the Hederman committee concluded that the paramilitary threat justified the retention of the Special Criminal Court and, in addition, that the threat of organised crime was sufficient to justify its retention.  The commission also recognised that organised crime is a problem in the State and that it has the potential to cause great harm to our society.  The commission went on to observe that developments in the criminal justice system are capable of effectively confronting the problem of organised crime.  That view is based on its own consideration of the matter, without the type of information available to the Cabinet from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the level of intimidation that is taking place.</P>
        <P>Several speakers raised the issue of what is happening in the United Kingdom.  If the right to a jury trial is removed in that jurisdiction, the trial is conducted by a single judge.  In this country, it is conducted by three experienced judges who have expertise in trying criminal cases.  They are persons of the highest calibre and know exactly what is required in terms of protecting the rights of the accused.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Human Rights Commission has also referred to alternative measures that could be taken to protect jurors.  These have been examined but none is seen to provide full protection to jury members.  Moreover, the employment of these methods in a particular case would almost inevitably send a signal to the jury that is incompatible with the presumption of innocence in respect of the accused because it would convey that the State has strong grounds for believing the safety of the jury is in jeopardy by the very reason of the criminal associations of the accused.  Judges by their own training do not allow such matters to influence their thinking.  There is therefore, in our view, a real danger that in suggesting we look at alternative ways, the Human Rights Commission would significantly undermine the benefit of the presumption of innocence to which the accused is entitled.</P>
        <P>I suggest that these relate to very specific offences and they have been geared in that shape.  I accept what Senator Regan says.  There is a saver in that there is provision in this section that these specific cases or offences will go into the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP directs otherwise.  We made those decisions based on the empirical evidence we have received on jury levels and the public response to gangland trials.  The decisions were also based on the evidence the Garda Commissioner and his senior officials have given in recent months.  They were also based on the tipping point of the murder of Roy Collins, where these people were clearly willing to take revenge on a family who participated in a criminal trial.  They were not only taking revenge but also sending a strong signal to the rest of the community that if any of them participated in a criminal trial against members of this gang similar retribution would follow.</P><Col N="1277"/>
        <P>We made the decision, based on the aforementioned matters, to bring this legislation forward.  Since then we have had a cacophony.  People have raised valid criticisms but in some instances there has been a misconception with people criticising things that were not even in the Bill.  Apart from that, the Human Rights Commission raised issues.  In the Lower House we accepted one of the suggestions from the Human Rights Commission on the issue of inferences, so it is not as if we are unwilling to listen.  We accepted an amendment from Fine Gael in the Lower House.  However, there has been a cacophony from people since this legislation was published.  They include people whom I respect very much, such as Paul Williams.  In a recent interview he said that he had seen one of the most reputable judges in the Central Criminal Court make it very clear, in the absence of a jury in a trial within the past year, that he was aware that people were being intimidated left, right and centre.  He went on to say that he was aware of another case where a phone was taken from a man in a cell.  On the phone were instructions to people to make sure that certain people changed their evidence when they were before this judge, and that the judge was aware of this.  He went on to instance a number of other circumstances where people were being intimidated when going before trials and jurors.</P>
        <P>John Hennessy is a solicitor who is under constant protection because of threats against his life.  He recently stated that there is absolute evidence that people are extremely reluctant to serve on a jury in a gangland criminal case.  He also said it is proving increasingly difficult to secure a jury in these trials.</P>
        <P>Michael Murray is a man for whom I have the greatest respect.  Criminal elements in Limerick tried to burn down his office not so long ago.  He has given strong anecdotal evidence of the difficulties in Limerick concerning jury trials.  He instanced a case where clearly there was a change in the verdict because of jury intimidation.  As I said earlier, a senior court official in the Limerick area stated that there is a tacit understanding that there is no point in holding gangland murder trials in Limerick.   Who better to give empirical evidence than the people on the ground, such as the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;confirmed in the D&aacute;il that, as far as he was concerned, there was jury intimidation in Limerick.  Members of the Lower House said to me privately and publicly &mdash; the latter group includes Deputy Finian McGrath and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power &mdash; that when their constituents got a jury service summons they were shaking like leaves from fear.  They tried to use every trick in the book to get out of giving jury service.  Experience has shown that any time a jury trial is held in a place like Limerick there is a dramatic drop in the number of people coming forward.  We have empirical evidence in that respect.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers raised the issue of alternative methods.  Many people accept that something has to be done to protect juries and recognise that unless steps are taken there will be an interference with the effective administration of justice.  The focus is on the alternatives.  As the Hederman report points out:</P>
        <P LI="1">Comparisons with jury practice in the United States, and it could equally be said for other countries, is essentially misplaced.  In larger countries, trials with anonymous juries often take place in sensitive cases.  Unlike a vast country with a huge population such as the United <Col N="1278"/>States, the small and dispersed nature of Irish society means that the risk of jury tampering and intimidation will remain significant.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Suggestions of cases with juries behind protective screens inevitably convey to the jury the belief that these precautions are necessary in respect of a particular accused.  This effectively removes, in the jury&rsquo;s eyes, the presumption of innocence because it indicates in unmistakable terms to the jury that the accused is an extremely dangerous person and will stop at nothing to obtain acquittal.</P>
        <P>I strongly urge Senators, as I urged Deputies in the Lower House, to accept that what we are about here is sending a strong signal to the wider community, particularly the criminals who orchestrate these gangs, that if they continue with this they will get the full rigours of this law.  In addition, inasmuch as we can do so within any democracy, we will prevent them from intimidating witnesses and jurors.  I am not saying this in an emotive way, but it is important that on 8 February 2008, Stephen Collins wrote to my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I will quote from the letter as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">We were assured that we would always have the support of the State to protect us and we were told the State owed us a debt of gratitude for all our help. [He finished by saying] We are a hard-working, honest family who were put in this position by one of Ireland&rsquo;s most dangerous thugs.  We know the service we have done for the State has saved many lives and improved the quality of life for many more.  We are praying that the State could now improve the quality of our lives which at present is a living hell.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He wrote that letter months before his son was murdered.  Following his son&rsquo;s murder, Mr. Collins subsequently wrote to me on 18 May 2009.  He was aware of what we were proposing because I had already stated publicly exactly what we were proposing in this Bill.  He finished a very emotive letter by stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">Please get the proposed new laws passed as a matter of urgency.  Myself, my family and the whole community are depending on it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On why we are rushing this legislation, I can put it no better than Mr. Collins who said that neither he nor his family could wait three months.  He validly said that the only people who should fear this legislation are the criminals and that the ordinary decent people of this country have nothing to fear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to respond to a couple of the points the Minister made.  I think I understand the Minister&rsquo;s position a little better now.  On more than one occasion in his last contribution he emphasised the importance of sending out a strong signal.  He repeated that several times and he said something akin to that in the other House as well.  Having looked at this legislation and having heard the Minister&rsquo;s speech on Second Stage, most of the arguments in favour of it have tended to concentrate on what the Minister believes is the necessity for this legislation and on the tangible benefit it would bring to the prosecution of such offences and securing convictions where appropriate.  I would be much more comforted if the Minister were talking about ensuring the law was changed in a manner that was necessary and that he had evidence of definite levels of intimidation of witnesses and juries.  He keeps talking about empirical evidence.  I said earlier, and I say again, that we need more of a glimpse of such evidence.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to what the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, said in the D&aacute;il and to the Keane trial in Limerick, which has been mentioned a couple of times.  He also referred to comments made by Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell in the D&aacute;il.  Is there anything else?  I do not say this <Col N="1279"/>in a smart way; I am asking the question genuinely.  If the Minister is saying to the House that in the course of his deliberations in Government there was empirical evidence, above and beyond the anecdotes to which he referred from the Minister for Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not make the decision because of those examples.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister then saying there is more available to him and to the Government than what he has communicated to us?  Can he tell us what it is or give us some insight into the empirical evidence to which he refers?  When he is pressed on it he talks about what the Minister for Defence said and about the Keane case.  With regard to the latter case, by the way, which has been invoked over and over, am I correct in stating that the trial was moved to Dublin and a conviction was secured?  I must be, because I have not been corrected and I am sure I would have been if I were wrong.</P>
        <P>With regard to the evidence we are seeking, obviously the Minister will not reveal everything said to him by the Garda and by others in the course of his preparation of this legislation &mdash; although, in a spirit of openness in any society, including in the area of criminal justice, it would be preferable if the default position were to reveal everything rather than withholding it.  I accept there are operational and security issues in this regard and that not everything can be revealed.  The Minister cannot open up the file with the evidence and hand it around in public.  However, I would have thought some summary of the nature and, in particular, the extent of the evidence for intimidation of jurors would be appropriate.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister has addressed &mdash; under pressure and with the support of Opposition parties &mdash; the issue of witness intimidation.  However, he keeps invoking this in support of this Bill, which is not about witnesses, as we must keep pointing out.  It is about a perception and an apprehension, which we are asked to accept on trust, that there are, as the Minister said, definite levels of intimidation of witnesses and juries.  Yet, apart from the mention of that single trial in Limerick which was moved to Dublin and a conviction secured, and the assertions of the Minister for Defence, no evidence has been offered.</P>
        <P>I am a citizen of this country.  I have children and I want them to be safe; I want all of us to be safe.  However, as a legislator, I cannot in all honesty stand here and agree to a momentous statement that the ordinary courts are not sufficient or appropriate for dealing with these matters, because I am not persuaded of this.  Senator Mary White talked about the statement by the former High Court judge Mr. Feargus Flood in which he indicated he had presided over gangland trials in which he felt juries had returned the wrong verdicts.  This is not at all the same as saying they returned the wrong verdicts in circumstances in which he believed, perceived or even was concerned that they were being intimidated.  He did not say that.  In fact, the piece referred to in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> goes on to state, &ldquo;Flood said he had not witnessed jury or witness intimidation first-hand as a judge but over the course of his career, juries had brought back what he felt was the wrong verdict in gangland trials.&rdquo;  The Minister might reasonably ask how he would know whether somebody had been intimidated.  However, we are being asked to accept this proposal on the basis that it could happen.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the Minister&rsquo;s question, which he has repeated, about whether anyone believes that if such people will intimidate witnesses they will not intimidate jurors.  It is a reasonable debating point, but it concerns an apprehension of something he is concerned might happen in the future and is not predicated on any evidence of its having occurred in the past.  Nor is there any evidence of, for example, perverse acquittals.  The point made by Mr. Flood was with regard to his concern about juries bringing in incorrect verdicts.  Is that part of the evidence considered by the Minister and the Cabinet?  Was there widespread or even extensive <Col N="1280"/>evidence of perverse acquittals in which people were left with a genuine concern that the reason for an acquittal was that a juror had been intimidated?  I am simply asking that.</P>
        <P>With regard to the difficulty of impanelling juries, although we are talking about gangland offences in particular, everybody knows there is a massive problem with jury service in general.  Senator Boyle mentioned this earlier.  We cannot seek to advance an argument in the context of this Bill simply by pointing to the enormous problems that exist with regard to impanelling juries.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the unfortunate fact that every day of the week people, particularly middle class people in the professions or with their own businesses, seek too quickly and successfully to have themselves excused from jury service.  It is happening everywhere and not just in the area of gangland trials, although it would be churlish not to accept that jury service would not be the most welcome thing in the world, to put it mildly.  It sounds as though I am diminishing the point, although I do not wish to.  I am sure there is nobody who would feel particularly good if he or she were being impanelled on a jury to deal with one of these trials.  I accept that and I agree that people would be concerned.  However, we should not underestimate the sense of support people have on juries.</P>
        <P>When one talks to people who have served on juries one finds they believe in the task they are given and engage with it.  I do not practice in the area of criminal law and I never have, but I know from speaking to such lawyers that juries exercise a high level of responsibility towards the job in hand and give everything to it.  There are sometimes difficulties for the State with impanelling juries; that is part of the criminal justice system we have.  We must understand that it is not always easy but the State must stick with it.  The State sometimes has a difficult task in obtaining prosecutions before juries but that does not mean it should not engage in it.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that rather than making a case in respect of a tangible benefit from this change, which is what I would expect, the Minister is sending out a signal.  I wonder &mdash; as I am entitled to, although I know this argument probably irritates the Minister &mdash; whether this is about sending out a signal to the public that the Minister, and thus the Government, are taking a hard line on crime.  Are they trying to communicate this to the public rather than seeking to achieve a tangible benefit from the changes they are proposing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to answer one point made by the Minister in which he quoted from the Hederman report on the issue of jury tampering.  It is fair to point out that the Hederman committee went on to say that while the majority did agree with the retention of the Special Criminal Court, there was a significant minority view, expressed by Mr. Justice Hederman, the chair of the committee, Professor William Binchy and Professor Dermot Walsh, to the effect that juries could be protected in other ways and that even in a small country such as Ireland, the risk of effective jury intimidation could be dealt with through other means &mdash; for example, by ensuring that jurors remained anonymous and were kept at a secure and secret location.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="8" />
        <P FLI="0">Those to whom I refer also pointed out that no other common law jurisdiction has come to the conclusion that the risk of jury intimidation warrants non-jury trial in a special criminal court.</P>
        <P>The committee was unanimous in its view that it would be preferable that decisions to transfer proceedings to the Special Criminal Court would be based on the merits of individual cases &ldquo;instead of some preconceived statutory assumption that persons charged with certain types of offences should be sent to the Special Criminal Court unless the Director of Public Prosecutions otherwise orders&rdquo;.  The committee, therefore, unanimously came out strongly against the provision proposed by the Minister in section 8 in respect of the automatic classification of a group of offences as being capable of being presumptively tried before the Special Criminal Court.  It was very much guided in its view in this regard by the decision in the <Col N="1281"/>Kavanagh case, to which I already referred.  The UN Human Rights Commission was extremely critical of the law that existed in Ireland to the effect that the DPP could elect to try people before the Special Criminal Court.  The commission stated that this should be based on reasonable and objective grounds.  The Hederman committee stated that this could only be done on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>It must be stated, therefore, that the Hederman committee opposed the type of sweeping categorisation that marks section 8.  That is a strong reason to oppose the section and to consider an alternative of the sort proposed by Senator Alex White, which would place the presumption in the opposite direction.  In other words, the DPP would be obliged to justify referring cases to the Special Criminal Court.  I ask the Minister to consider the fact that, quite apart from any issues with may arise in respect of the Constitution, the sweeping provision contained in section 8 is going to be in breach of the UN Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s interpretation.  It will also be in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>

	<P>If these gangs with which the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, has been obliged to deal were operating in the constituency of Dublin South, I do not believe Senator Alex White would have adopted the position he currently holds in respect of this Bill.  The Senator lives in one of the most sedate and well-off constituencies in the country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>In the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Defence outlined his experience of dealing with gangs in Limerick and the evidence he provided in that regard is compelling.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago I visited St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, part of which is devoted to catering for children between the ages of 16 and 18.  Many of the children who are being held there work as couriers for the mobs and gang leaders in Limerick.  The lives of these children will be ruined unless they can be rehabilitated.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the sedate constituency Senator Alex White represents is far removed from that which the Minister for Defence represents.  I presume the Senator would speak as passionately as the Minister if he lived in a city such as Limerick.  The Minister for Defence has vast experience in representing his constituency in the D&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

	<P>Earlier in the debate, reference was made to the ICCL, lawyers&rsquo; letters and people being described as coming from Dublin 4, Dublin 6 or wherever.  In addition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was upset about people playing the man rather than the ball.  I thought we had moved on from that.  Is it not possible to discuss the issues that arise rather than trying to personalise matters by referring to the places in which people live or the constituencies they represent?  We are better than that.</P>
        <P>On a separate point, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, was not giving evidence in the D&aacute;il, he was one of the Government speakers commending the Bill to that House.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Alex White that it does not really matter from where one comes.  Equally, however, I resent the implication he offered in his earlier submission to the effect that I put forward the legislation purely and simply because I want myself or the Government to appear strong in respect of this matter.  I assure the Senator that I take my job very seriously.</P>
        <P>I resisted the promptings of his party and his party leader in the aftermath of the murder of Shane Geoghegan to the effect that they did not want reasons to be provided as to why we would not act and that we should do more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Did those comments relate to the Special Criminal Court?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so.  For example, Deputy Rabbitte stated that &ldquo;The public mood is to assent to measures in the present crisis that people would not otherwise tolerate&rdquo;.  He also stated that &ldquo;the first test of any Government is the protection of its citizens&rdquo;.  He further stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">This cannot go on, Minister.  There must be some tipping point where the State asserts its democratic mandate and asserts decent values ... people are saying that enough is enough, and that it is the Government&rsquo;s duty to put gangs out of business.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In respect of the publication of this Bill, the Deputy stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I acknowledge that these are exceptional powers that the D&aacute;il has now been asked to provide to the garda&iacute;, but, subject to proper oversight, they are necessary to deal with the exceptional threat being posed by armed criminal gangs, which have claimed 11 victims so far this year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Following the awful murder of Shane Geoghegan, the leader of the Labour Party said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The public wants to get a sense that these people will be smashed... We do not want to hear the reasons certain things cannot be done.  We need to see, led by Government, which my party will support in this, definitive measures taken that will solve and address this problem.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Labour Party called for action in November 2008 in the aftermath of Shane Geoghegan&rsquo;s murder.  I resisted its promptings and stated that the existing legislation was adequate and that the Garda had at its disposal all the resources it required.  I also indicated that if the force needed further resources, these would be provided.  I was genuine in the comments I made at that stage.  When Roy Collins was murdered, however, I spent the Easter bank holiday weekend thinking long and hard about the matter.  I was due to be abroad at the time but I was obliged to remain in Ireland to attend the funeral of a garda who was killed when knocked down by a getaway car in Donegal.  I attended the garda&rsquo;s funeral in Mayo and asked to meet the Garda Commissioner afterwards.  Our meeting lasted approximately 90 minutes and we agreed during the course of it that we would meet the Attorney General and the Secretary General of my Department the following week to discuss how we might do more.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, I do not wish to create a hierarchy in respect of the people who have been murdered in this country.  Every murder is disgraceful and I send my sympathy to all of the families that have been affected by this crime.  However, the killing of Roy Collins was clearly a message to society that there are those who are determined to take out anyone who <Col N="1283"/>co-operates with the State or its criminal justice system in respect of the conducting of normal trials.  I am of the view that we were obliged to make a decision to fight that.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, I resisted promptings from people on all sides of the Houses to introduce opinion evidence.  I did so because of advice received from the Attorney General that it clearly was extremely difficult to prove in respect of criminal gangs that opinion evidence is sustainable, even with corroborative evidence.  It is not as difficult in respect of paramilitary organisations.  That is the reason I took this action and I greatly resent the Senator&rsquo;s implication.  However, I do not wish to labour this point.  Senator Regan put it well by stating that acceptance of Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment would dilute what this legislation proposes to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have given way on several occasions in the spirit of debate, I will not be interrupted by the Minister this time, nor will I have him portray me, my party or anyone else as being less committed to dealing with these gangs, murders or threats to our society than is he.  I will not accept that for a moment.  In this instance, it is clear that I am talking about a particular section of the Bill.  The question for Members is whether the measures contained therein are necessary, namely, to remove a large number of trials from the ordinary courts and send them to the Special Criminal Court although such trials could continue to be dealt with in the ordinary courts.  This is the issue being dealt with at present and to which this section pertains.  There is no way that either Deputy Rabbitte or Deputy Gilmore agreed to that.  The Labour Party tabled this amendment in both Houses in order that a particular safeguard should be included and a particular procedure put in place in respect of the circumstances in which such trials should go to the Special Criminal Court.  That is what the record shows.</P>

There are two barristers, a professor of criminal law and the Minister.  However, I am speaking from a commonsensical point of view.  I do not agree with Senator Alex White and I beg to differ with the Minister.  I believe that one&rsquo;s experience as a representative matters.  One learns what changes one wishes to make to society by engaging in dialogue with one&rsquo;s constituents.  Why did Deputy Broughan abstain?  I suspect he abstained because one of his constituents was murdered.</P>

One awakens every morning to the news that someone somewhere has been shot, and something must be done in <Col N="1284"/>this regard.  The socio-economic consequences of such gangland warfare and organisations must be dealt with in a firm manner.  Moreover, there should be a place for people with common sense, in which one is not obliged to be a legal professional.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This concerns the appendix to the Offences against the State (Scheduled Offences) Order 1972, and my amendment proposes to revoke Paragraph 1 of the appendix, under which malicious damage is an offence.  The offence of malicious damage has been renamed criminal damage, which does not appear to be treated as a scheduled offence.  The reference to malicious damage seems obsolete and needs to be revoked.  Otherwise, the reference will cause confusion as to whether it should be read as covering criminal damage in light of the Interpretation Act 2005.  It is suggested that this would have practical ramifications for the trial of anyone accused of criminal damage.

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I state my opposition to the section which purports to add a new section 72A to the Criminal Justice Act 2006 providing that inferences may be drawn from silence.  I am conscious that there are a number of inference drawing provisions in the Offences Against the State Acts and in the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  However, I am also conscious of the need for safeguards.  On Second Stage, the Minister stated he had taken on board some of the criticisms of the Human Rights Commission on this provision in particular and had inserted new safeguards.  I have examined it but I still do not see that he has answered the primary concerns of the Human Rights Commission.  In its observations it pointed out that in drawing adverse inferences from an accused&rsquo;s failure to answer a material question the court or the jury should be satisfied that the circumstances clearly called for an explanation from the accused.  It also asked that section 9(1) should not apply unless the accused had first been provided with legal advice.  It also suggested that it would be preferable as a matter of best practice for an accused person to have a legal adviser present throughout interrogation, which is a much broader recommendation relating to police interrogation generally and I share its view on that.</P>
        <P>Leaving aside the broader point, I ask the Minister whether he considered placing the stronger protections that the Human Rights Commission recommended into section 72A and, if not, why he did not do so.  Section 72A(2) states that the defendant must be told in ordinary language about the effect of a failure and must be afforded reasonable opportunity to consult a solicitor.  Why did the Minister not go further, as the Human Rights Commission suggested?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This section introduces a new section 72A to the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The new section will permit inferences to be drawn as a result of the failure in particular circumstances of an accused to answer questions.  It will apply to organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, including an additional offence of directing.  As with other aspects of the Bill this provision is not new; it is based on section 2 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, as amended by section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  Section 2 of the 1998 Act applies specifically to persons accused of membership of an unlawful organisation under section 21 of the Offences against the State Act 1939.</P><Col N="1286"/>
        <P>As has been acknowledged, a number of safeguards contained in the inference provisions in Irish law are replicated in this section, such as that a person shall not be convicted solely or mainly on the inference drawn from a failure under this section; the defendant must be told in ordinary language when questioned what the effect of a failure under the section might be; the defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult a solicitor prior to a failure occurring and the questioning of the person by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be recorded by electronic or similar means unless the person consents in writing to it not being so recorded.</P>
        <P>As I indicated previously, concern was expressed by the Human Rights Commission that the meaning of words in section 72A(1), specifically, &ldquo;question material to the investigation of the offence&rdquo; could apply to a very broad range of questions.  The commission recommended that where such inferences are to be drawn it should only arise under narrowly defined circumstances.  Following consultation with the Attorney General and with a view to addressing this concern, an amendment was tabled in the D&aacute;il to replace section 72A(7) of the provision.  This new section specifies the meaning of &ldquo;any question material to the investigation of the offence&rdquo;.  It sets down the questions that can be put to a person and links them to the specific evidence provisions of the relevant offences.  For instance, section 72A(7)(<i>b</i>)(i) allows a question relating to any statement or conduct of the type referred to in section 71A(3) as inserted by section 5 of the Bill.  Section 71A(3) concerns the directing offence and provides that: &ldquo;Any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct, by the defendant implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he or she was at a material time directing the activities of a criminal organisation shall, in proceedings for an offence under this section, be admissible as evidence that the defendant was doing such at that time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Sections 18, 19 and 19A of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, as amended and inserted by the Criminal Justice Act 2007, also allow inferences to be drawn in certain circumstances.  Section 18 provides for inferences from failure or refusal to account for objects, marks etc.  Section 19 provides for inferences from failure or refusal to account for an accused&rsquo;s presence at a particular place.  Section 19A provides for inferences from failure of an accused to mention particular facts.  These provisions apply to arrestable offences, that is offences carrying a penalty of five years&rsquo; imprisonment or more, and consequently apply to the organised crime offences under the 2006 Act.</P>

	<P>I am conscious of the amendment to section 72A(7) but I was wondering whether the Minister had an answer on the point on consultation with a solicitor.  I do not think that provision was changed and certainly I did not see any change to it between the initial version of the Bill and the Bill we have now.  It seems that section 72A(2) remained the same and that all that is required is that a defendant is afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult a solicitor, but the defendant does not have to have legal advice prior to the adverse inferences being drawn.  I am conscious that as with all adverse inference provisions these represent an encroachment on the right to remain silent, which is key to the presumption of innocence.  Therefore, it is important there are sufficient safeguards in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the issue of solicitors, we considered what the Human Rights Commission sought but its wording does not allow for where a person refuses or does not want legal advice.  This would effectively give the detained person a veto as to whether the inference provision could be used against him or her.  We felt that we could not accede to that.  The Human Rights Commission also recommended that the court must be satisfied that the circumstances at the time clearly called for an explanation by the accused and I consider this matter to be one that the courts would consider on its own in any event.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is an attempt to change the section because it seems to be wrong conceptually to categorise a post-release order as part of a sentence.  Perhaps it was badly drafted.  Will the Minister provide a response which would justify categorising a post release order in this way?  A post release order appears to be an order which is designed to prevent reoffending.  It is not much different from orders in regard to the sex offenders register, anti-social behaviour orders or orders that stalkers cease to contact their victims, which are the kind of orders with which we are familiar.  It would appear to be inappropriate to categorise, as the Bill does, these post release orders as part of the offender&rsquo;s sentence.  The suggestion is to remove those words and insert &ldquo;by way of a civil order following conviction,&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to speak briefly in support of this amendment.  I declare an interest in that I have acted for the State in a number of cases involving a question of whether post-release matters are part of an offender&rsquo;s sentence or whether they are better characterised as civil orders consequent on conviction.  Notably, with regard to the registration provisions under the Sex Offenders Act 2001, there have been a number of cases in which those were considered, one of which was Enright <i>v.</i> Ireland in which I appeared.  In those cases it was considered, ultimately, that they were not such orders, that is, an order that somebody must notify the State of their movements subsequent to their release from a sentence of imprisonment imposed following conviction for a sex offence.  That sort of restriction, registration or notification requirement is not characterised as being a penalty and therefore it is better akin to a civil order or an order consequent on conviction.  The language used in subsection (3) is misleading in that something that seems to me to be similar in nature to the registration requirements in the Sex Offenders Act, or to matters of that nature, is referred to as part of the offender&rsquo;s sentencing.  That is somewhat misleading and it could lead to problems.  I support Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment.  It is a constructive amendment in that it seeks to strengthen the power in the Bill.  None of us is opposing the power of the court proposed in section 14 to impose this sort of post release restriction on a person&rsquo;s movement.  We make this suggestion in a genuinely constructive way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a huge amount at issue between us but the advice I have been given is that this order is essentially one of crime prevention and that it is properly imposed at sentence.  The order will arise because a person has been convicted and given a custodial sentence for a very serious criminal offence.  Given that the order takes effect immediately on release from prison it is an extension of the sentence which must be set down in court at the time of sentencing with precision and certainty.</P>
        <P>Essentially, the introduction of post release orders in section 14 is another form of crime prevention and therefore accepting the amendment would create an inconsistency as the crime prevention orders contained under section 26 of the 2007 Act are similarly imposed at sentenc<Col N="1288"/>ing.  I hear what Senator Bacik said but it is really a matter of semantics.  It is important that they are regarded as a criminal sanction following on from the sentencing.</P>

	<P>The Minister seems to accept there is an issue in this regard as he said there is not too much between us but as Senator Bacik rightly said, the amendment was proposed in a constructive spirit.  Despite what the Minister said it does not seem to sit particularly well to describe these orders as being &ldquo;part of the offender&rsquo;s sentence&rdquo;.  If the legislation was not being subjected to such a rush in these kinds of circumstances the Minister might have been prepared to accept this amendment but, unfortunately, we have confined ourselves to a situation where, as I indicated earlier, no amendments can be accepted no matter how meritorious they are because of the obvious implications in regard to them having to go back to the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this amendment.  The reason for this amendment is that it would appear to be permissible in international law to criminalise someone outside the State who directs the commission of an offence inside the State.  I do not understand the reason there is a particular issue in regard to that.  There is no requirement for that person to be an Irish citizen or resident.  To be clear, this is somebody who is directing or is accused of directing the commission of an offence inside the State who is outside the State at the time.  There is no requirement for that person to be an Irish citizen or a resident.</P>
        <P>We believe section 19(1) is unduly restrictive.  There might be more rationale for what is done in section 19(2) and (4), which is limiting the liability for people who assist after the fact but there does not appear to be any strong justification for paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) in the new subsection 19(1A) in section 19(1).  The subsection would simply read: &ldquo;Any person who, outside the State, aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an indictable offence in the State shall be liable to be indicted, tried and punished as a principal offender&rdquo;.  There is no need for those prerequisites to be in place.  I would have thought there is certainly no requirement that the person be an Irish citizen or an Irish resident.  I am curious to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The effect of this amendment would be to remove the circumstances under which the State would establish extra territorial jurisdiction over the offence under section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1997, namely, the offence of impeding the apprehension or prosecution of another person who has committed an arrestable offence.  Besides the inconsistency created by the amendment whereby it only applies to one of the offences contained in Part 3, it would also have the effect of establishing universal jurisdiction over the offence where committed outside the State.  Moreover, it goes beyond the provisions of Article 15 of the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, which Part 3 addresses.  Article 15 of that convention more or less mirrors what is contained in this section.  However, the main objection to the amendment is that universal jurisdiction is not permitted in international law and, accordingly, is not constitutional in accordance with Article 29(8), which allows for the State to exercise extra territorial jurisdiction only in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;who for the purposes of this section shall be a Garda not below the rank of Sergeant&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Part 4 of the Bill deals with detention and re-arrest.  The Bill suggests that if at any time during the detention of a person pursuant to this section a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with reasonable cause, suspects the person of having committed an offence, referred to in the subsection as &ldquo;being an offence other than the offence to which the detention relates&rdquo;, and if the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in charge of the station at the time has reasonable grounds for believing that the continued detention of the person is necessary for the proper investigation of the other offence, the person may continue to be detained in relation to the other offence.</P>
        <P>There is a number of elements here linked to the safeguards which should be included in this section.  The amendment requires that the member of the Garda should not be below the rank of sergeant.  That would add an element of oversight and authority to a decision involving detaining someone in the circumstances provided for in the Bill.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I respond to Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment I would like to make a number of general remarks on Part 4 of the Bill.  It is necessary to clarify some basic issues which will assist in dealing with the amendments.</P>
        <P>Part 4 is devoted almost exclusively to the detention of suspects under various statutory detention orders in the Offences Against the State Act, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  It deals, in particular, with the hearings of applications to extend the relevant periods.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the hearings is to satisfy the court that there is sufficient reason for the continued detention.  The hearings have been, and always were intended to be, conducted by the judge in a manner similar to that of an investigating magistrate in other jurisdictions.  In other words, the purpose of the hearing is to allow the judge to satisfy him or herself that the investigation is being properly progressed with the necessary speed and diligence, thereby ensuring the suspect is detained for no longer than necessary.  The hearings are not concerned with the guilt of innocence of the detained person.  That is a matter for the trial court.</P>
        <P>The adversarial system used at trial to test the quality and nature of the evidence is, therefore, not appropriate to hearings on the extension of detention periods.  In recent times these hearings have taken on a very strong adversarial character.  Every effort is made to elicit information pertaining to the current state of an ongoing investigation and its likely future direction.  The disclosure of information at that point can do immense harm to the investigation.</P>
        <P>As a result of this new approach to the hearings, large numbers of garda&iacute; have to wait for many hours in court rooms.  This delays and interrupts the investigation.  In addition, the garda&iacute; must go to extraordinary lengths to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation.  From the suspect&rsquo;s point of view, there is much to be gained.  The investigation is interrupted, some valuable information may become available and, of course, while away from the Garda station he is not being questioned but the clock is still running on the detention period.  I am not saying there is a strategy in this new approach.  I am simply saying it is harmful to the fight against serious crime and is not an approach that had been originally intended.  I am convinced of the need to take steps to rectify this position.  I believe Part 4 of the Bill goes a long way in that direction.</P>
        <P>The changes present no threat to the rights of the suspect.  He retains the right to bring a case to the High Court under Article 40 of the Constitution if there are grounds to believe that <Col N="1291"/>the detention is in any way unlawful.  However, many years ago in 1990, in the case of Keating <i>v.</i> Governor of Mountjoy Prison, the Supreme Court made it clear that it was not appropriate to raise questions as to the lawfulness of the detention in any court other than the High Court, save in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>Hearings to extend detention periods are held in the District Court, or occasionally in the Circuit Court.  These courts have no jurisdiction under the Constitution to hear or determine questions relating to the lawfulness of a detention, yet as part of the new approach I have mentioned, this is attempted regularly.  Part 4 seeks to give effect to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s view in Keating <i>v. </i>Governor of Mountjoy Prison and thereby clarifies the matter.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 21 would require that the member in charge must be of a rank not below sergeant.  The concept of the member in charge is by now a well established one.  It has its origins in section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 and the custody regulations made under that Act.  The Act and the regulations ascribe very significant duties to the member in charge, especially in relation to the treatment and welfare of the arrested person.  The provisions in the 1984 Act and the regulations apply not only to persons detained under the 1984 Act but also in all other cases where the person is arrested or detained under statutory powers.</P>
        <P>Section 4 does not specify a rank but, in practice, we know that it is commonly a sergeant.  To depart, after all this time, from the accepted approach would introduce a significant rigidity.  I see no reason to depart from the accepted wording as used in this Bill and in several other statutes.  The text in the Bill mirrors precisely the text in the other three statutory detention powers, that is the Acts of 1984, 1996 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The amendment, if accepted, could cause serious operational difficulties without any hint of benefit.  It would open another line of inquiry for those wishing to delay the detention hearing and thereby disrupt investigation, and would cast doubt unnecessarily on the existing provisions in the other statutes I have mentioned.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment is linked to amendments Nos. 12 and 14 in terms of precautions and safeguards in this area of scheduled offences.  It proposes that it would be the Circuit Court rather than the District Court which would determine the extension of detention.  This would reflect the seriousness of the issue.  The Bill provides that a judge would have the power to exclude from court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bone fide representatives of the press and other such persons as the court may permit to remain.  Given those powers, it is appropriate that matter would be determined at Circuit Court rather than District Court level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments seek to make it mandatory that all new procedures in the Bill relating to applications to extend the detention period must be heard in the Circuit <Col N="1292"/>Court.  I am not sure if the Senator appreciates that his amendments would have the effect of splitting jurisdiction in individual cases.  The District Court would handle the hearing of the application for the extension of time but the Circuit Court would handle applications as to who would be present or excluded from the proceedings.  This would be unworkable.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan might suggest that all proceedings be transferred to the Circuit Court.  This is not necessary nor is it justified by experience.  It would also have the effect of delaying Circuit Court trials.  Extension of time applications, by their nature, must be heard urgently and in the Circuit Court this would have the effect of delaying the start of trials and, indeed, could push trials back to the next session.  Much good work has been done in improving trial times in the Circuit Court in recent times.  The Senator&rsquo;s proposals would give the Circuit Court a much greater role in the extension of time applications and would undo some of the work that has been done in that respect.</P>
        <P>Multiple District Court judges are available to every Circuit Court judge.  The easy availability of judges is essential where applications must be heard urgently as to the extension of time applications.  The Senator might also note that section 30 of the 1939 Act provides for hearings in the District Court only.  This has been the case for a very long time and nothing has emerged that suggests we should change the existing arrangement.  This arrangement has proved more than adequate.  Even at the height of the subversive threat, it was seen to be more than adequate.  I see no reason not to continue with the arrangement.</P>
        <P>As for the 1997 and 2007 Acts, hearings to extend the periods of detention may be in either the District or Circuit Court.  This approach has been taken in the interests of maximising flexibility and operational efficiency.  However, almost all of the applications are heard in the District Court.  As with the 1939 Act, nothing has emerged to suggest a need to restrict that court&rsquo;s role, which would thereby reduce choice and make the arrangement inflexible and unsuitable in the context of ongoing investigations.</P>

Where a judge makes a direction or exclusion under this section, he or she shall direct that proceedings of the application be recorded by an official stenographer.  It would be a minimalist precaution to create a record of such a hearing and an important safeguard in terms of the legitimacy of not carrying out the hearing in public.  Given the constitutional requirement that justice be administered in open court, this amendment is the minimal amount of precaution that should be included in this rather novel provision in the Bill for persons to be excluded from the court.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

	<P>I will make a few comments on the section in general.  Attention has been focused on one of its aspects where the provision is to hear information from a garda in the absence of an arrested person and his or her legal representative.  It has been alleged that these would be secret hearings and are likely to be unconstitutional, but it is fair to say that this provision is necessary to protect sensitive information.  The remarks by the State solicitor for Limerick give powerful support for the provision&rsquo;s inclusion, as he stated that there is evidence that certain information is leaking out to known criminals.  In the Lower House, I emphasised the point that we introduced this provision before Mr. Murray made that public statement.  We did so based on good information that suggested it would be necessary.</P>
        <P>As one would expect, the provision has been examined by the Attorney General and his staff.  The Irish and UK case law has been reviewed, in particular, the Court of Criminal Appeal&rsquo;s judgment in DPP <i>v.</i> Kenneth Donohue of 2007.  The advice to me is that the provision satisfies constitutional and ECHR requirements.  Its operation is entirely at the discretion of the judge.  It is only that the judge may make certain directions.  The section gives clear guidance to him or her, as there are clear references to its being employed where doing so is in the public interest or necessary to avoid prejudice to the ongoing investigation.  Having heard the information from the garda, the judge may, at his or her discretion, direct that the information be given again, this time in the presence of the parties and their representatives.  In effect, the new provision establishes a hearing within a hearing on a specific matter for a specific purpose.  This is a necessary measure presented in a balanced way.</P>
        <P>I remind the House that the hearing is not a trial.  The fact that the procedure being used at the hearing will not be an issue to be mentioned at the trial, assuming the person is charged, means that its use will not impact on the trial process.  I am satisfied that the proposal has been carefully scrutinised and is proportionate and appropriate to the circumstances for which it is intended.</P>
        <P>The lawyers among us might raise an eyebrow at the suggestion that a legal representative should be excluded.  I emphasise that the provision only relates to the extension of the seven-day detention period.  For example, the Garda could give evidence to the judge in its application for the extension to the effect that there has been a significant development in the investigation.  Defence lawyers, on behalf of their clients, have attempted to discover these substantial developments.  In certain instances, judges have been put under pressure to get more information, which shows the Garda&rsquo;s hand in terms of how well its investigation is going.</P>
        <P>If it is proposed to exclude the suspect &mdash; at this point, he or she is not a defendant, as the application is in respect of his or her continued detention &mdash; leaving his or her legal representative in open court to listen to what the substantial development was would be to place that representative in an invidious position, as he or she would be unable to disclose that information to the client.  For this reason and if the client is being excluded from the detention hearing, it might be in the lawyer&rsquo;s best interest to be excluded, as he or she would not be privy to the information and, subsequently, be in an invidious position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the client.</P>
        <P>Concerning Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment on the judge&rsquo;s directions to be recorded by an official stenographer, I have already noted that almost all applications to extend detention periods are held in the District Court.  The Senator will be aware that stenographers are not normally used in that court.  Therefore, this amendment would create new logistical problems without any apparent benefit.  In any event, the amendment is at odds with current developments in the courts.  A digital audio recording system is being introduced to court rooms, beginning in the higher courts.  Installation at District Court level will commence this year.  The introduction of the new system will result in stenographers being phased out totally.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 22, lines 33 to 35, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;, including&rdquo; in line 33 down to and including &ldquo;applicant)&rdquo; in line 35.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These six amendments relate to the same procedural principle the Minister is proposing to introduce, that is, the secret hearing as it has been colloquially called.  The amendments represent my third main objection to the Bill, the first two being a garda&rsquo;s opinion evidence as to the existence of a criminal organisation and the encroachments on the right to jury trial.  This third matter goes to the heart of fundamental safeguards in the criminal justice system and the secret hearings represent a dangerous departure from our normal rule of law provisions.</P>
        <P>The six amendments relate to detention hearings under three statutes.  Perhaps I will await the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  Before I discuss my reasons for tabling these amendments, will he confirm what is it we are dealing with?  We are dealing with detention hearings under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Minister stated that the Act permits detentions of up to 72 hours.  I look forward to being corrected if I am wrong, but my understanding is that, following an amendment by the 1998 Act, persons can be detained under section 30 for up to 96 hours &mdash; I want to ensure that I have this fact right &mdash; and that an application must be made to a District Court judge where a garda desires to extend detention beyond the first 48 hours.  Ordinarily, a person can be detained for 24 hours under section 30.  If a chief superintendent directs, a further 24 hours may be permitted.  Beyond that period, the two further 24-hour extensions must go to a District Court judge.  This is to what section 22 refers.  In section 23, the detention provisions are those comprehended by the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996.  The Minister pointed out that the maximum detention period is seven days although the maximum period is rarely used.  The third set of detention provisions, referred to in section 23, relates to detention under the Criminal Justice Act 2007, which concerns certain specific offences.  Will the Minister confirm whether seven days is the maximum detention period?  I did not have time to check myself but meant to do so.</P>
        <P>In section 23 it is proposed to extend the detention power in the 2007 Act to all the organised crime offences that fall under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  There are significant detention powers in all three statutes.  Will the Minister confirm that I have interpreted them correctly?  He may have stated inadvertently in his speech that the detention period under the 1939 Act is shorter than it actually is.</P>
        <P>The amendments I propose to each of sections 21, 22 and 23 are to change the provision for what I describe as a &ldquo;secret hearing&rdquo;.  Section 21 best illustrates my point.  Section 21 inserts a new subsection into section 30 of the 1939 Act providing that a judge may exclude persons from an extension-of-detention hearing and may direct that the application be heard otherwise than in public, or exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, etc.  I do not object to this and believe there may be a need for it but I have sought to amend the Minister&rsquo;s provision with regard to secret hearings, to which many objections have been made, particularly by the 133 prosecution and defence lawyers who wrote to <i>The Irish Times.  </i>The objections relate to the fact that the judge may, in certain circumstances, direct that evidence on the basis of which the extension is extended &ldquo;shall be given in the absence of every person, including the person to whom the application relates and any legal representative (whether of that person or the applicant)&rdquo;.  I object to these words and propose to delete them.</P><Col N="1295"/>
        <P>The provision is fundamentally wrong and, as the 133 lawyers stated, it is anathema to the rule of law to make provision for hearings to extend substantially the detention of a person who already has been in detention for a considerable period under the authority of senior garda&iacute;.  It is fundamentally wrong to suggest one can have an extension-of-detention hearing in the absence of the accused, his legal representative and the lawyer for the prosecution.  To contemplate an extension-of-detention hearing where the only people in the courtroom would be the judge and garda seeking the extension is extremely dangerous.  There would be nobody present to contest the statement of the garda.  As Senator Regan stated, there would be nobody even to record what was said.  This is fundamentally wrong.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated it would be invidious to exclude the suspect in detention but not his lawyer. Why exclude either of them?  The Minister justified his statement by referring endlessly to one allegation by the Limerick State solicitor that one lawyer was passing on information he had apparently gained at an extension-of-detention hearing.  This is not sufficient evidence on which to make such a fundamental change, not just to one set of detention powers but to three different sets in three different statutes.  As I stated on Second Stage, it is throwing the baby out with the bath water.  If a lawyer has been involved in corruption of the kind in question, action should be taken against him and he should be penalised.  To tarnish all defence lawyers with this suspicion is wrong, yet it is effectively what the Minister is doing in this Bill.  He has gone further because he is even tarnishing prosecution lawyers with that suspicion.</P>
        <P>It is nonsense to suggest Garda investigations are compromised through having the suspect and his lawyer present at the hearing.  In this regard, I refer the Minister to the comments made by the 133 lawyers.  My experience suggests that during extension-of-detention hearings, the court hears generalised evidence about the necessity for time to carry out interrogations, forensic testing or assessments of evidence.  The standard comments offered by garda&iacute; seeking to extend detention relate to the need to check fingerprints, to conduct further inquiries and to question the suspect further.  I have not heard of any example that suggests otherwise, other than the anecdote related by the Minister.  Very rarely is substantial or significant information in respect of an operational development given in court in extension-of-detention hearings.</P>
        <P>It was put to those who criticised this provision that they did not have faith in judges.  I have faith in judges and find it difficult to believe that many District Court judges will actually use this provision.  The Minister may ask why I am objecting to it in that case but the fact that the provision is unlikely to be used begs the question as to why we are bothering to include it.  If the provision will create such a shift in our criminal justice system that judges are reluctant to use it, as I believe will be the case, its effectiveness will be all the more questionable.</P>
        <P>My amendment would change the nature of the provision such that a judge may:</P>
        <P LI="1">[. . .] direct that, in the public interest, the particular evidence shall be given in the absence of every person other than&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(I) the member or members whose attendance is necessary for the purpose of giving the evidence to the judge; and</P>
        <P LI="2">(II) if the judge deems it appropriate, such one or more of the clerks or registrars of the  Court as the judge determines,</P>
        <P LI="2">(III) the person to whom the application relates and any legal representative (whether of that person or the applicant).&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My amendment changes the presumption and makes it necessary that the person to whom the application relates, that is, the person in detention, his legal representative and any legal <Col N="1296"/>representative of the applicant be present in court.  I do not understand why it is necessary to provide for hearings in secret.  The case has not been made for this in any way.</P>
        <P>There are three different sets of detention powers at issue and three different types of detention hearing relating to different detention periods.  All are substantial and concern persons who have been already in detention for a significant period.  The Minister&rsquo;s provision encroaches significantly on the constitutional right to liberty and it removes the safeguards currently in place.  The European Court of Human Rights has issued various rulings on the extension of detention and on the need for judicial intervention, as the Minister is well aware.  I find it difficult to understand how judicial intervention can be justified where the judge has heard from the garda applicant alone in the absence of the accused person, his legal representative or any other legal representative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments tabled by Senator Bacik and endorse her arguments in support of the changes she wants to make to the Bill.  It is important to reflect on the fact that when we were debating the use of the Special Criminal Court and the Minister&rsquo;s apprehension about the intimidation of jurors, we were critical that he did not seek to employ or appear to seek to employ any other means of addressing that apprehension.  He stated repeatedly he has considered the matter carefully, in addition to all the alternatives, but we have not been apprised of any of the alternatives.  The conclusion the Minister arrived at was very blunt, that is, that juries should be taken out of the equation altogether in regard to the offences in question, with the proviso that the Director of Public Prosecutions may direct that a particular case be taken back from the Special Criminal Court, although that seems unlikely to occur.  He seems to take the same approach in respect of the extension of detention hearings.  The view or apprehension is largely based on one allegation and one case, to which Mr. Murray referred on television a couple of weeks ago.  That is the only hard evidence placed before us to justify this provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his Second Stage speech the Minister said &ldquo;Experience in recent times has made it clear that hearings of applications to extend the detention period are being used to elicit as much information as possible from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the current state of the investigation and its direction.&rdquo;  I understood the Minister to say in his earlier remarks that he was concerned that judges were put under pressure and he almost suggested that the judge was being &ldquo;blackguarded&rdquo; in some way by the lawyers and put under pressure that he could not withstand to reveal certain matters or to allow the Garda to reveal certain matters that it would not have been appropriate to reveal in those circumstances.  The Minister did not use the word &lsquo;blackguarded&rsquo; and I do not want to offend him by my paraphrase.  If I do I will think twice about the word.  Surely the way to deal with that problem is to re-examine the process and the sort of information that is, and requires to be, opened to the court to deal with a proposal to extend detention rather than take everybody out of the room.</P>
        <P>This is the approach he has taken to the non-jury trials, a problem is perceived and everyone is removed from the court except the judge and the garda.  It seems such an excessive response to a perceived problem as to be disproportionate.  We do not know much about the instance to which Mr. Murray referred of solicitors sending text messages to their clients warning them about what was going on.  That would be a very serious thing for a solicitor to do.  It would seem to be a serious criminal offence for a solicitor to interfere with the course of justice, not just a question of ethics.  If this matter is as serious as the outline given on television suggests I hope that it is being dealt with in the appropriate manner and has been referred to the DPP.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik is absolutely right to say that if solicitors are involved in such activity it blackens the profession and it is unfortunate that is being seen as evidence of a widespread <Col N="1297"/>activity rather than being one particular case.  If there are other cases let that be said and brought into the debate in a more honest way than it has been.  In his argument a few minutes ago the Minister seemed to refer to a plurality of such instances rather than one.  Is he saying that?  When did that case come to light?  Did it happen recently or did the Minister know about the allegation made on television when the legislation was being drafted?  Is that the reason for this provision or is it being invoked as a <i>post facto</i> justification for it?  If there is a worry about the process of these detention hearings and concern that the management of the hearing is not quite right and about the nature and extent of the information given out why not address that and find a way to deal with it, rather than eliminate the key principals from the hearing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Senator Bacik on section 30, the initial period is 24 hours, the first extension authorised by a chief superintendent is a further 24 hours and the first extension authorised by a district court or circuit court is 24 hours.  Normally the district court follows an application by a superintendent, making a total of 72 hours or three days.  The total under section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act is seven days, and under section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 is seven days in respect of murder involving a firearm, capital murder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, kidnapping and hostage taking involving a firearm.  </P>
        <P>Senator Alex White asked whether there is a plurality of cases.  This was drafted before the State solicitor said anything publically because there were strong suggestions of instances in which information had been passed.  This refers to a pre-trial hearing in respect of extending detention on which there is case law.  The case of the DPP <i>v</i> Donoghue involved defendants prosecuted for membership of an illegal organisation contrary to section 21 of the 1939 Act.  The prosecutor relied on the belief evidence of the chief superintendent.  This belief was based on confidential information available to the chief superintendent.  He claimed privilege in respect of the sources which provided the information on the grounds that to disclose them would endanger the lives of people and hamper ongoing security measures for the security of the State.</P>
        <P>The Special Criminal Court required the chief superintendent to produce all relevant documentation upon which he relied.  Following a review the court ruled that it was adequate and reliable information and that nothing in the documentation would assist the defence in proving the innocence of the accused.  Ms Justice Macken delivered the judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal and reviewed the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, authorities in her judgment.  In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal was satisfied that the trial judge took sufficient steps to satisfy himself that the garda was entitled to claim privilege against disclosure of information.  The judgment stated that withholding documentation, as in that case, was consistent with Article 6 of the ECHR, the right to a fair trial, where the decision to hold it was within the supervisory control of judges which is exactly the position on this issue.</P>
        <P>The provisions we are putting in allow the exclusion of the detained person and their legal representatives.  It is not entirely without precedent.  The concept of certain material evidence being privileged and not made available to the accused or his legal representatives is not new.  Section 4 of the Bail Act 1997 and section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, as amended, which refer to similar pre-charge hearings, replicate the limited access of the public.  The rules of procedure governing the Special Criminal Court also allow it to exclude the public or a portion of the public or to direct the removal of a person who is interfering with the proceedings.  There is a precedent for this provision.</P>
        <P>The seven day detention exists for several other serious offences.  It has been forgotten in the public debate that these provisions already exist and have done so for some time.  We are allowing the judge to exercise his power where he believes that it is necessary to do so to avoid <Col N="1298"/>the risk of prejudice to an investigation.  This is subject to judicial scrutiny as held in DPP <i>v</i>. Donoghue.  The limited power the judge has only arises where the judge is satisfied that the evidence could prejudice the proper conduct of an inquiry or investigation.  It is self-evident that in such circumstances the judge should have this power or otherwise the investigation could be prejudiced.  Where the judge believes the investigation will not be prejudiced, the lawyers will not be excluded.  This is part of the investigative step.  Where detention is extended for a 48-hour period, the senior garda can approve it already without a hearing and without the presence of any legal representatives.  We are referring to a hearing before a judge who has a limited power to hear evidence in the absence of any other person where otherwise the investigation would be prejudiced.  This does not prevent the accused raising these matters at the trial.</P>
        <P>In regard to the exclusion of the accused&rsquo;s solicitor, there may be a fear that he or she, if he or she remains in court, will be pressurised to reveal the information.  Lawyers would be put in an invidious position if their client was excluded whereas they were left in for the detention period.  It could be argued that to allow them to remain in court on the basis that they would not divulge the information to their client would create an undesirable chasm in the relationship between the solicitor and the client and expose them to considerable pressure.  This was recognised by the Supreme Court &mdash; albeit in a civil case, not a criminal case &mdash; in the case of Burke <i>v</i>  Central Independent Television.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Special Criminal Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal has held that in the case of a trial on a criminal charge, it is permissible in certain circumstances for the trial court to review information on which a chief superintendent bases his opinion of membership without disclosing it to the defence.  The provision in this Bill only creates a very limited restriction in very limited circumstances in the context of an application for longer detention and, accordingly, is more limited and inconsequential than such a restriction in regard to evidence at a trial.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to the publication of this Bill, Mr. Michael Murray referred to one particular case.  There are two cases where there is serious evidence that what I referred to has happened.  Mr. Murray said in one particular case a witness was arrested for withholding information and consulted a particular solicitor.  He also said in a subsequent follow up search and in the course of a murder investigation, a mobile telephone was found that was examined.  He said it was discovered that the solicitor was texting information to the suspect and the person in custody was in fear of that suspect and was not speaking and not telling garda&iacute; what happened.  He said this was a very serious incident.  I regard it as a serious incident.  I do not know if it is the subject of a separate investigation but it confirms the view that resulted in bringing forward Part 4 of this Bill to be fair to everyone concerned during a detention period while ensuring that the procedure is streamlined.</P>
        <P>After the Shane Geoghegan murder I spent some time in Roxboro Garda station where I met all the senior garda&iacute;, all the detective inspectors, detective sergeants and senior people who are fighting gangland crime in Limerick.  At the end of a long meeting, I asked them was there anything that I could do for them.  One of the them made the point that detention hearings have now become full blown trials, which was not what was originally intended in terms of the extension of periods of detention.  I can fully accept what they said because I was aware of that from my own knowledge.  There have been attempts by solicitors on behalf of clients at a pre-charge hearing, a hearing in regard to only an extension of detention period, the defence lawyers, representing &mdash; not the charged person because the person has not been charged at this stage &mdash; the person who is detained for questioning, to find out more information than would be acceptable in regard to the investigation of the Garda.</P><Col N="1299"/>
        <P>As a result of my meeting with the garda&iacute;, I followed on in regard what was necessary in this legislation to streamline the detention provision and bring it back to what originally it was intended to be, a pre-trial hearing, not a fully blown trial.  Senator Bacik referred to the prosecution lawyer being excluded; normally there is not a prosecution lawyer present.  Because no one is charged at this stage, it is a senior garda who makes the application to the court and that senior garda is normally up against substantial legal expertise on the other side.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is not represented at that stage.  The garda&iacute; have to represent themselves in these applications.  To ensure there is a belt and braces approach to an application, it means that literally every garda involved in the investigation must be down in court and be there for the duration of the hearing to prove anything that is raised by the legal team.  I emphasise that this is only a detention application, it is not a hearing that will prove the innocence or guilt of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>This is a proportionate response to the view that has been expressed by my officials in regard to the way in which these detention hearings have become full blown trials.  It is a response to the request from the Garda that the procedure should be streamlined to allow garda&iacute; to get on with the investigation at the initial stage very shortly after the offence has been committed and for their time not to be tied up in court.  It is also the case that there have been attempts, particularly where many people are in detention, to use detention hearings to string out the period such that by the time the detention hearing is over, the people detained have to be released because the period of detention has expired.  This is a proportionate response to all the difficulties that pertain in regard to the extension of periods of detention, whether it be for 24 hours, 48 hours or  seven days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the nature of the detention powers with which we are dealing.  These are all substantial detention powers.  He has also confirmed that the power to detain a person for seven days pre-charge is now being extended to all organised crime offences under Part 7 of the 2006 Act.  It is evidence of creeping changes in the criminal justice system.  When the seven-day detention power was first introduced in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996, it was described as being an exception to the general rule and necessary for particular purposes relating to detention of persons suspected of drug trafficking and so on and we have seen it used more and extending to other areas of law.  That is a separate but related concern.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are dealing with substantial detention powers.  The Minister said there are already effectively secret hearings where senior garda&iacute;, chief superintendents, approve detention periods.  That is right and I acknowledged that in my earlier contribution.  It is correct that senior garda&iacute; approve detention but that is at an earlier stage for a lesser period of detention.  The reason we have judicial intervention provided for is because the European Court of Human Rights requires judicial scrutiny once persons are to be detained prior to being charged for any lengthy time.  We have already got powers for senior garda&iacute; to approve detention but that is only up to a certain point, as the Minister is well aware, and beyond that we need judicial scrutiny but judicial scrutiny must be proper scrutiny and this provision for scrutiny in the absence of the accused and their representative is not sufficient.  Nobody is arguing that the defence lawyer should be left in the court room without the client.  That would be invidious.  Both should be left in and there should not be provision for a judge to exclude both from the court room for one of these extension of detention hearings.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I accept it is not new that we would have in law a concept of material withheld from the defence.  That is quite routine in the Special Criminal Court and the Minister has correctly given other provisions where material may be withheld but this is a difference of substance.  It goes well beyond the hearings <i>in camera</i> and removal of the public from the court room and <Col N="1300"/>it also goes well beyond the withholding of material from the defence because it is based on confidential information and so on.   It goes much further towards having a secret hearing, which removes the right of the person in detention to be present in the court room.  The allegation by Mr. Murray, the solicitor from Limerick, requires investigation and the appropriate response and sanction if the lawyer is found guilty following a criminal investigation.  That is a serious matter but it is not enough to put forward that allegation as a reason to change the entire basis on which we conduct detention hearings on three different types of detention power.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was a general attempt to suggest that defence lawyers are potentially colluding, that they are using those hearings to gain information.  Up to a point lawyers are entitled to gain information during the course of their client&rsquo;s detention about the nature of the charges that may be pressed against them.  We do have a criminal legal aid system and lawyers may be appointed under that system to advise clients during detention.  The purpose of that appointment of a lawyer is to advise the client on the potential charges that may be proffered against him or her.  We should not forget that in the neighbouring jurisdiction, in England and Wales, the person in detention is entitled to have his or her lawyer present during questioning because it is recognised that he or she should have legal advice.  We do not have that provision, as we do not go that far, but of necessity we provide that a person in detention is entitled to legal advice because the European convention and the Constitution requires it.  It is clear that lawyers are entitled to certain information, not to prejudice or compromise an investigation, but they are entitled to be able to advise their clients.  That point should be noted.</P>
        <P>The other matters in these sections deal with a creeping change, a general move away from the principle that justice should be done in public, especially with criminal matters.  I am concerned also at the blanket provision that re-arrest applications under these three separate statutes and search warrant applications in general must now be made otherwise than in public.  That is a concern because it again moves away from the general principle.  Section 26, to which I am opposed, states that search warrant applications should be heard otherwise than in public, and similarly with re-arrest applications.  There is no requirement that the judge must be convinced that there is risk of prejudice to an investigation before he or she makes an order that an application of this nature would be heard otherwise than in public.  It is just a blanket change that these applications will now be heard otherwise than in public.  It is one thing to say that where a judge believes there is a risk of prejudice, as we have in the extension-of-detention hearings, that they can exclude members of the public.  I do not object to that, but to say these applications should be heard otherwise than in public without any requirement that there is a risk of prejudice shown is a worrying and concerning encroachment on the general principle that justice should be done in public.  I am not convinced that the Minister has given enough of a justification for these changes to the extension-of-detention hearings procedures.  I will be pressing the amendments.</P>

	<P>I wish to reply to the accusation that there is a creeping move towards longer periods of detention.  It had been suggested that in the context of the legislation we should consider longer periods of detention but I resisted those calls because I believe seven days is sufficient.  When one considers the figures it is quite clear that under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act that for the two-year period November 2006 to November 2008 the number of people detained for long periods was kept to a minimum.  A total of 821 people, <?oasys _dc18- ?>47.98%, were detained for periods of detention up to six hours.  A total of 664 people, 38.81%,<?oasys _dc0- ?> were detained for between six hours and 24 hours.  A total of 208 people, 12.16%, were detained for between 24 hours and 48 hours.  A total of 15 people, 0.88%, were detained for between 48 hours and 120 hours and three people or 0.18% were detained for between 120 hours and 168 hours.  It is evident from those figures that only 18 people in two years were affected by the extension of the period of detention to 120 hours or 168 hours.  Despite what Senator Bacik said, it is obvious the power of detention has been used very sparingly.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  I understood the Senator to say it was used more frequently.  Since 2007, a total of 19 individuals have been detained for questioning by the Garda under section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  A total of four persons have been detained for up to 48 hours.  A total of 13 persons have been detained for up to five days.  A total of two persons have been detained for up to seven days.  Again, there was a relatively sparing use of the provision.</P>
        <P>This is a limited provision for use in limited circumstances.  It is at the sole discretion of the judge.  It was established in the DPP <i>v</i>. Donohue case that this is in total conformity with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a fair trial.  It is a proportionate response to the various issues that have been raised.  One of those is seeking to return to a situation where pretrial hearings are exactly that and not full-blown trials with all the legal paraphernalia that goes with that.  The provision addresses to a certain extent, at the discretion of the judge, any perception that a few rogue solicitors or other members of the legal profession are passing information.  As a member of that profession, it would be disgraceful if anybody were engaged in that activity.  This is a good and balanced response and one which I have no doubt will be looked upon as a provision the purpose of which is to protect everyone.  I emphasise again that this is not just for the protection of the investigation process but also for the protection of lawyers by ensuring they are not put in an invidious position whereby they may come under severe pressure by dangerous people to divulge the information to which they were made privy during the pretrial hearing.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 23, to delete lines 42 to 46.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments are grouped together because they all seek to do the same thing with regard to three different detention powers in sections 21, 22 and 23.  In all three cases, the amendments seek to delete the Minister&rsquo;s provision stating that no issue as to the lawfulness of the arrest or detention of the person may be raised at an extension of detention hearing.  The Minister has already given us a brief rationale for this section.  In the course of speaking to an earlier amendment he said the courts have already stated that these issues should only be dealt with in the High Court.  It seems somewhat unnecessary in that, generally, these issues are ventilated in full in any case in the High Court, as the Minister said.</P>
        <P>However, what has happened is that defence lawyers have understood that they are precluded from raising issues, or at least objection is taken to their raising issues later about the lawfulness of detention, if they have not raised them at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Minister will be aware that there has been some case law suggesting that they should raise their objections to the lawfulness of detention and jurisdiction of the court at the earliest possible stage, otherwise they may effectively be precluded from raising them at a later date.  At the very least, the prosecution will use against them the fact that they did not raise these points earlier.  That is why the issues have been raised.</P>
        <P>I am not sure the mischief the Minister speaks about, concerning these hearings being dragged out as a result, is right.  Perhaps he might give us a little more information about that.  However, I see these provisions he is proposing as being unnecessary.  I am simply proposing to delete them because in any case the full ventilation of these issues has to occur before the High Court.  It may be difficult, however, for the defence to raise them in the High Court if they have not already raised them at an earlier point.  That is why they started to be raised at the extension of detention hearings.  Perhaps the Minister can elaborate if there is a particular reason why he is placing these provisions in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of explicitly stating in statute that no issue as to the lawfulness of the arrest or detention of a person to whom an extension of time application relates may be raised, is to counter a growing tendency in recent years on the part of the suspect to try to turn the hearing into a hearing on the lawfulness of his or her arrest or detention.  This has a number of undesirable consequences.</P><Col N="1303"/>
        <P>First, such matters are outside the jurisdiction of the lower courts, with one exception being where there is a glaringly obvious problem with the arrest, which the judge must be permitted to fix.  This is the judgment of the Supreme Court as set out in the Keating case in 1990.  The qualifying words in the text of the Bill, &ldquo;save where any rule of law requires such an issue to be determined by the court&rdquo;, are intended to capture this exception.</P>
        <P>Second, this attempt to shift the focus of the hearing leads to unnecessarily prolonging hearings and affects the conduct of investigations.  Garda&iacute; who should be carrying on with the investigation are being diverted from that work in order to be available at the courthouse to give evidence about the arrest and detention.  I stress that there is nothing in this Bill which prevents the making of an Article 40 application to the High Court.  In the Keating judgment against the governor of Mountjoy Prison, delivered in July 1990, the Supreme Court Judges Finlay, McCarthy and O&rsquo;Flaherty, in dismissing the appeal, held that the District Court has no jurisdiction to inquire into the lawfulness of the detention of a person before it for the purpose of ordering that person&rsquo;s release from custody.  Such a jurisdiction was confined under Article 40 of the Constitution to the High Court.  That is the rationale behind what we are doing in this part of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for giving a little more detail.  He referred to the Keating case in 1990, but I am aware of more recent cases.  In the Bernie case &mdash; I was involved also in a related case &mdash; one of the reasons the Court of Criminal Appeal objected to a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court was because the accused has not raised the point concerning the lawfulness of rearrest and consequent detention at an earlier stage.  That case was much more recent than 1990, so there has been an organic shift to putting some pressure on defence solicitors, in particular to flag issues of lawfulness of detention and jurisdiction at an early stage.  That may be why that matter has arisen, if indeed it has.</P>
        <P>The provisions the Minister is inserting are too restrictive of the accused&rsquo;s right to raise what may be legitimate challenges.  The Minister himself said he could appreciate that there might be some issues where there was a glaringly obvious problem &mdash; for example, with the detention &mdash; where they could be raised in court.  I still fail to see the point of this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Bacik seriously arguing that an accused who may have been charged in this instance with being the leader of a criminal gang&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is before being charged.  We are concerned with the pre-charge period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the suspect is going to face charges of a very serious nature.  Are we going to indulge in technicalities?  This is the kind of thing that brings the whole law into disrepute.  Many people are aghast at some of the technicalities that are used by lawyers.  Instead of looking at that, we need to look at what people want, which is justice.  We should not just think of the human rights of the accused but also those of the people &mdash; as I outlined earlier, and there are very many of them &mdash; who have been murdered by some of these thugs.  We need to get our focus a little more on what is right for the general populace, rather than on what is right for people who have committed serious crimes.</P>
        <P>In his response, the Minister clearly pointed out the exception which has arisen from the Supreme Court case.  Other than that, those technicalities cannot be indulged in.  It happens as well with other minor offences.  We need to strike the right balance in all of this.  A lot of the human rights arguments I have read in recent weeks are one-sided.  We must come back to the <Col N="1304"/>human rights of the innocent individuals who are being murdered, as well as their bereaved families.  We should talk to the parents, wives and children to find out where the pendulum should be, and whether we should allow technicalities to be injected into the administration of justice.</P>

	<P>I cannot put it any further than the advice of the Attorney General that the overriding principle in the Keating case is the one that applies concerning detention hearings, that is, that the District Court has no jurisdiction and that under Article 40 of the Constitution it is purely and simply a matter for the High Court.</P>

I wish to put this on the record because we have taken enough of such abuse from the other side of the House.</P>

The human rights of the bereaved families need to be pursued and I applaud what the Minister is doing in the legislation, which is going some way towards achieving this.  We are not going far enough; we need to go much further.  We will be back again to discuss this.  Serious gangsters in our cities, particularly in the capital and in Limerick, are getting away with crimes and walking free, and it is only their agents who are being prosecuted down the line.

        <P FLI="0">The subject matter of this amendment has been the subject of debate on a previous amendment.  The issue is that the Circuit Court, rather than the District Court, would have jurisdiction on the issues arising under the Act.  I will be pressing the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The four amendments proposed to sections 21 and 24 of the Bill appear to be aimed at requiring applications for warrants for re-arrest to be heard by a Circuit Court judge rather than a District Court judge, as has been the law for almost 25 years.  No one has ever drawn to my attention any difficulty in having these applications heard by the District Court.  I repeat the point I made earlier about the impact the Fine Gael proposals would have on the workload of the Circuit Court in terms of the timetabling of trials for serious cases.  In addition, District Court judges are more accessible and there are far more of them, which is a major consideration given the urgency of some re-arrest applications.  Thus, the amendments offer no added benefit in terms of efficiency.  We are all of the same view that people should not be detained any longer than is absolutely necessary, and Circuit Courts, as the Senator knows, do not operate as frequently as District Courts.  Given that the system has worked well for 25 years and we have had no representations about this from the legal profession, I believe we should leave it the way it is.</P>
        <P>The additional section proposed in amendment No. 33 would create serious logistical difficulties for the Garda.  We must keep in mind that the criminal investigation will be ongoing while the Garda is applying for judicial authority to extend the period of detention for suspects in custody or for re-arrest warrants.  Requiring the Garda to establish that the Circuit Court is unavailable before it can resort to the District Court is simply introducing a step which will act as a hindrance to the investigation and result in much more work for the Garda.  As has already <Col N="1307"/>been said, the District Court has been dealing with extension of time applications and re-arrest applications for many years and I see no necessity to change that.</P>
        <P>Apart from logistical difficulties with a system under which the Garda must establish that the Circuit Court is not available before resorting to the District Court, I see several drafting problems with this proposed section.  Does the phrase &ldquo;this Part&rdquo; refer to the 1939, 1984, 1996 or 2007 Act?  There are no applications under the part referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment, which concerns amendments to other Acts.  Therefore, if I were inclined go down this route, which I am not, individual amendments would be required to the 1939, 1984, 1996 and 2007 Acts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 25, subsection (1), lines 25 and 26, to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>).</P>
        <P FLI="0">This refers to the detention powers in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996, which we have already discussed.  This amendment is to retain the requirement that a chief superintendent be involved in the detention rather than reducing the requirement, as the Minister&rsquo;s provision does, to superintendent.  As I have already said, there are measures in this Bill that amount to a creeping extension of detention powers, including the lengths of detention for different offences.  However, we are also seeing a creeping reduction in the level of checks and balances placed on powers of detention by legislation.  In section 22, although removing the reference to a chief superintendent and replacing it with superintendent is not a highly significant change in itself, it is part of a general reduction in the safeguards that are necessary to ensure, as the Minister himself has said, people are detained for no longer than is absolutely necessary and that their detention is subjected to sufficient scrutiny and to the rigour of law.</P>
        <P>There is another provision in section 22 which, again, raises concern about a creeping reduction in checks and balances; namely, subsection (4), which provides for the removal of the requirement that the 1996 Act be reviewed.  As I understand it, the effect of subsection (4) is to remove the Oireachtas review mechanism that is currently in the 1996 Act so that the detention provisions of the Act in particular will continue in operation indefinitely.  Given that we have already debated review powers and given that section 8 of the Bill provides for a 12 month review, which I welcome, it is unfortunate the review mechanism in the 1996 Act is being removed.  I ask the Minister to consider retaining the requirement in respect of a chief superintendent in the 1996 Act, particularly as these are seven-day detention provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In effect, the Senator is objecting to an amendment that was passed in the Lower House.  Paragraph (<i>a</i>) amends section 2(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996, which specifies the rank of garda who may authorise the first extension of detention following the expiry of the period authorised at the time of arrest.  In the case of the 1996 Act, a period of six hours is authorised upon arrest.  The next period is 18 hours.  At present, this requires authorisation by an officer not below the rank of chief superintendent.  Following the implementation of paragraph (<i>a</i>), it may be authorised by an officer not below <Col N="1308"/>the rank of superintendent.  A second detention may be authorised by an officer not below the rank of chief superintendent.  Thereafter, the extensions require authorisation by the District Court or Circuit Court, normally the former.  The maximum period allowable is 168 hours, or seven days.</P>
        <P>The revised authorisation arrangements bring the 1996 Act in line with the arrangements under section 50 of the 2007 Act, which also permits detention up to a maximum of seven days.  The amendment contributes to the standardisation of the arrangements across all the statutes dealing with detention.  Within section 2 of the 1996 Act there will be an incremental increase in the grade of authorising officer as the period is extended.  There is rationality in such an approach.  It also has the benefit of ensuring that two different officers of different ranks must review the case for extensions.  Under the previous arrangements the same officer could authorise two periods of extension lasting 48 hours.</P>
        <P>The Senator referred to subsection (4), which states: &ldquo;Section 11 of the Act of 1996 is repealed and, accordingly, sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of that Act (being the sections to which that section 11 related) shall continue in operation indefinitely&rdquo;.  As stated on Second Stage, I indicated earlier in the year that it was my intention to leave this in operation indefinitely.  That is the reason for the inclusion of the subsection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief because I have already referred to my opposition to this provision, which will change the way in which the search warrant procedure is dealt with in court.  It is a sweeping provision which states, &ldquo;An application under any enactment to a court, or a judge of a court, for a search warrant shall be heard otherwise than in public.&rdquo;, and which we should not pass lightly.  Section 21 states that a judge may exclude members of the public in which an extension of detention hearing is taking place in order to avoid a risk of prejudice to an investigation.  As a result, there is a requirement that the judge must be satisfied that it <Col N="1310"/>is necessary to do this in order to avoid such a risk before ordering the hearing to take place other than in public.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that section 26 is a blanket provision under which all search warrant applications shall be heard otherwise than in public, without even a requirement that a judge must be satisfied that holding the hearing in public would prejudice the investigation.</P>
        <P>This is a breach of the normal rule of criminal law which is that proceedings should be heard in public and I do not believe any reason for it is advanced in section 26.  As stated in respect of section 21, I am willing to concede that where a judge is satisfied there is a risk to an investigation, he or she should be entitled to exclude members of the public.  However, there is no justification of that nature provided in section 26.  The latter constitutes a general departure &mdash; applied in a blanket way &mdash; under which an application for a search warrant, under any enactment, may be sought.  I do not understand the rationale behind the inclusion of this provision.</P>
        <P>People on any side with an interest in fair procedures should be concerned with regard to this section.  The Minister will be aware that a search warrant application is a fairly routine matter in the District Court and that no information which might disclose the nature of operational matters is given in open court in any event.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware, from experience, that applications for search warrants should be heard in private.  When the Garda authorities apply for such warrants, there is a substantial risk that the intended subject might be alerted to the planned search and might avail of the timelag in order to dispose of evidence.  Some District Court judges have recently been refusing to hear applications for search warrants otherwise than in public.  There have been instances where such applications have been abandoned because members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been unable to refer to sensitive matters in open court, as required by certain judges.  The purpose of this section is to end any confusion in respect of the matter and to provide that all search warrant applications will be heard otherwise than in public.  That is only fair and proper because if any information relating to a search warrant application is leaked, the person involved would, possibly, be in a position to destroy important evidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am willing to accept that this might be a real concern in respect of cases involving organised crime, section 26 goes beyond the range of organised crime offences and applies to every search warrant applied for under any enactment.  In my opinion, the provision is too broad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has a point.  However, we are endeavouring in this legislation to clarify any confusion that exists in respect of search warrant applications in general.</P>
        <P>Regardless of whether it pertains to organised gang crime or normal crime, if there is any indication, it is important that these are made in effect <i>ex parte</i> and in private to prevent information from leaking out and in order that no one is under suspicion.  If they were made in public, I would hazard a guess that the information would get to the intended target quickly who then could destroy the evidence.</P>

	<P>No.  I object to moving this matter to Report Stage now.  While many issues have been discussed and clarified, as a matter of principle it is inappropriate for this type of legislation simply to move Report Stage.  It requires time for consideration of amendments and such time should be allowed.  It is inappropriate to rush through all Stages of the Bill on the same day.  This point was made this morning and was made last week in respect of other Bills.  Fine Gael objects strongly to simply moving immediately from Committee Stage to Report Stage.</P>

	<P>I agree entirely with Senator Regan&rsquo;s comments.  I see no reason Report Stage could not be ordered for tomorrow.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support this.  Many Members have made the point that this Bill was guillotined on Second Stage, leaving many who wished to contribute on that Stage unable to so do.  However, given that Second Stage and Committee Stage took place on the same day, at the very least Members should wait until tomorrow before taking Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it intended to table amendments on Report Stage?  Were that the case I would be inclined to have a reasonable sos to facilitate that.  The position is that it has been ordered that all Stages be dealt with tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I make the point that a number of Members would have liked to have made a contribution on Second Stage.  Moreover, there have been some good debates on the amendments that were tabled.  It was a shame that Members were denied the opportunity on Second Stage to outline a range of views and reactions to this legislation.  It is part of our democracy that this should have been allowed and I regret that did not happen during the passage of this legislation and that we are taking all Stages today.  That is not how it should be done.</P>

	<P>Senator Boyle should be concerned about the way legislation is being dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the guillotining of the Bill on Second Stage, there was a good discussion, albeit rushed, on many of the concerns about this legislation.  We teased out many of the issues and there was better understanding as a result.  If ever proof was needed that it is unwise to rush legislation of this type, it is evidenced here today.  Once explanations are given and issues are elaborated on and teased out, there can be a greater meeting of minds in this House.</P>
        <P>There are motions from Fine Gael on the Seanad Order Paper dating back to 18 November 2008 on the killing of Shane Geoghegan, the 17th gangland murder victim, and we called for action by the Minister and the type of Bill before the House today.  That is the reason Fine Gael supported this Bill but we wanted to deal with the concerns about the safeguards that are necessary for this type of legislation.</P>
        <P>I made the point earlier, and I believe the Minister recognises its validity, that legislation on its own is not sufficient.  We need to ensure that the Garda has the resources and the technology to fight organised and gangland crime.  We need prisons also which can accommodate the effect of this legislation and other law enforcement measures.</P>
        <P>Given the number of criminal law Bills we have dealt with in recent weeks and the extent to which they refer to a host of other Bills, if ever there was a time to have codification of the criminal legislation it is now.  I recommend that to the Minister.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister has spent a long time in the House today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and gave many elaborate explanations and clarifications on many of the issues we in Fine Gael raised but if more time had been allowed both in the Lower House and here it would have been possible for the Minister to accept some further amendments tabled, which would have improved the legislation.  As the D&aacute;il has gone on summer recess the Minister was set against taking any amendments but there has been some clarification of the legislation.  Fine Gael supports this Bill because there is a major problem of gangland crime and criminality.  Many innocent people have been killed and many communities have been disrupted and intimidated.  If this legislation goes some way to addressing that problem, our work will have been justified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Regan on one point, namely, that there was a very good discussion in the course of the day.  The Minister was attentive, and I thank him on my behalf and on behalf of my party for his willingness to listen and to engage in the debate.  However, part of our role in this House, and in any parliament, is not just to express our opinion but to have the ability to bring forward proposals for change to what the Government <Col N="1315"/>proposes to do.  We did not have that ability in this House and, unfortunately, we have to record that.</P>
        <P>I made that point on the Order of Business.  The Leader shook his head at the time but he did not come back to me in response and he did not disagree with me, nor can he or anyone disagree with me that the debate we had today, however good and well-informed, was always characterised by an air of unreality because it was signalled clearly to us that there would be no question of any amendments being accepted.  I regret that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That was very clear.  With the D&aacute;il in recess it was clear to everybody that this was the case and there is no point in anybody suggesting otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because it is flying in the face of the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is spinning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That having been said, it was an important debate.  We carried out our duty as Members of this House to read, study and scrutinise the legislation as best we could.  I said I was genuinely open to being persuaded but I do not believe the case the Minister made was sufficiently persuasive, particularly in regard to the core issue of the trials to be heard in the Special Criminal Court.  I am a democrat.  I accept that he has persuaded a very large majority in this House.  He has not persuaded my party.  He has not persuaded two other persons on the Independent benches, nor would it appear has he persuaded the two members of the Green Party in this House who, to their credit, abstained from voting on this legislation.  I congratulate them for that.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister but I particularly thank his officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This was complex legislation.  They were present throughout the day, and for the debates in the other House also.  They have given major input and support to the Minister on this legislation and I thank them for their availability in the House today in terms of the flow through of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I will conclude on what I hope is not too discordant a note.  In regard to legislation the Minister brings forward in the Houses, I ask him to seek to ensure if at all possible &mdash; I do not want to put this request in too adversarial a way because I have made the point previously in a more robust fashion &mdash; that if and when he finds it necessary to bring forward legislation he could pace that legislation a little more throughout the session because it is not satisfactory, and I am sure it places a huge burden on him and his officials, that in recent weeks important justice legislation &mdash; five Bills at the last count &mdash; were before these Houses in quick succession.  There must be a better way of doing this and pacing important legislation from his important Department.  I ask him to try to do that in the next session if legislation should arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the words of Senator White in thanking the Minister for his engagement with us throughout the debate today.  I thank also his officials who worked so hard on the Bill and staff in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office who I understand also advised on different aspects of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Although I agree this was a good and measured debate and that we engaged on many of the points about which we had concerns, it could have been a much more constructive debate had <Col N="1316"/>it been conducted when the D&aacute;il was sitting so that we might have had some real prospect of having amendments accepted or taken through the D&aacute;il.  The debate was conducted in a somewhat farcical situation, where we knew the D&aacute;il had risen and there was no prospect of having amendments accepted.</P>
        <P>We all share a common goal of ensuring that gangland crime is tackled and that we have a robust criminal justice system so that the chaos and killings caused by organised crime can be stopped.  We disagree on some of the measures in the Bill to tackle organised crime.  I note the Green Party Senators abstained on the Bill in the end.  They too were not persuaded about its overall merit, in some way.</P>
        <P>It is important that we had the opportunity to debate these issues and I regret deeply that we did not have more time to debate them.  We did not have enough time on Second Stage.  A guillotine was exercised on Second Stage and we then had to rush through all remaining stages and had no real opportunity to put amendments on Report Stage.  A more robust debate would have benefited all of us and made more effective legislation.</P>
        <P>With those reservations, I thank the Minister and officials who are here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for quite a robust debate.  Despite the assertion that amendments could not be taken because the D&aacute;il is not sitting, there were several votes on Committee Stage, some of them quite tight.  Defeating the Government in a vote is one way of sorting out amendments.</P>
        <P>The necessity for this Bill was brought home to me by a headline in today&rsquo;s <i>Evening Herald.  </i>As a result of a row in a prison, an inmate was battered to death.  While in a funeral home, his body was tampered with and something written on his forehead.  That indicates how low criminals can stoop, and copperfastens my certainty that the Bill is necessary.  During the First World War, for example, when the fighting ended at Gallipoli and Suvla Bay each side was allowed to bury their dead.  We have now come to the stage where that is not allowed to happen.  How low can one stoop in the criminal world?</P>
        <P>In bringing forward this legislation, the Minister is sending out a strong, clear and concise message that this will not be tolerated.  I appreciate those who supported the Bill.  I understand those who had reservations but the legislation is necessary.  I hope the President will sign the Bill sooner rather than later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and the Cathaoirleach for facilitating this debate.  I thank the Senators who contributed.  This was an excellent debate where we teased out many of the issues and everyone understood each other.  The level of debate was higher than some of the debate I heard elsewhere, in that people fully understood what the legislation involved.  It is clear that the position of the Government was accepted in that a number of amendments were not pushed.  I thank Senators in that respect.</P>
        <P>There has been criticism of the fact that all stages of the Bill were taken in the House today and in the D&aacute;il last week.  The Bill was debated for ten and a half hours in the D&aacute;il and for nine hours today.  There was significant debate on the Bill and it was teased out.  It was necessary that the Bill be passed before the recess.  If we had waited, as some people suggested, until September to pass the Bill we could not have charged people under the legislation.  Criminal legislation is not retrospective.  The argument that we should wait until the courts re-open in <Col N="1317"/>September is not valid.  As soon as this legislation is signed and enacted its provisions can be implemented, people charged under it and, I hope, found guilty of their crimes.</P>
        <P>It is important not to have it said that Members of the Oireachtas went off on their holidays and did not pass very important legislation which the people desired.  It is useful to tease out issues and, having gone through the House, people accept this is good legislation.  It is not seismic.  It does not make a dramatic change in the criminal law.  Virtually everything in the Bill is already enacted in other measures.  It sends a strong signal to the wider community and particularly to the criminals that if they engage in the particular offences of directing and participating in criminal organisations, not only will they be subject to very serious prison sentences but they will go before the Special Criminal Court, unless the DPP decides otherwise.  That is one of the key savers in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Another saver is the review after a year.  The Oireachtas will be able to examine the legislation to determine how it was implemented in the previous year.  The Oireachtas will continue with the provision if it wishes.  This is not a permanent provision but it is needed at this time.  After one or a number of years, the Oireachtas may decide that the threat of criminal gangs in certain parts of the country no longer requires this legislation.</P>
        <P>I have heard much about the protection of human rights.  We must maintain people&rsquo;s civil liberties.  Equally, we must maintain the human rights of people like Roy Collins and his family, the Geoghegan family and of all of the people who have been tragically murdered.  It has been said, with some justification, that we in the Oireachtas and others in the wider community were not particularly worried when gangsters were killing each other and that it was only when they began to kill innocent people, such as Shane Geoghegan, Roy Collins and others, that the Oireachtas began to pay attention.</P>
        <P>The legislation contains checks and balances.  It does not make a dramatic change in the criminal law.  It was criticised for provisions that were not included in it.  After 20 hours of discussion in the Oireachtas, I hope people will fully understand its import.</P>
        <P>I thank the officials of my Department who have slaved over this legislation for the past few months.  Within days of the murder of Roy Collins on 9 April, I indicated that we would bring in new legislation and change existing legislation.  My officials have been working on a daily basis in that respect.  I thank the Attorney General and his staff for their work.  While no government can guarantee that any legislation is constitutional, the Attorney General, who has gone through the legislation line by line, and I are absolutely happy it will pass constitutional muster.  I am confident that is the case.  However, no government can guarantee the constitutionality of legislation but we are happy  we did our work in that respect.</P>
        <P>I also thank the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who worked closely with us and advised us as to the practicalities and logistical difficulties with which they have had to put up regarding some of these issues.  The legislation mirrors the practical difficulties they face in dealing with this very insidious crime.</P>
        <P>I thank the staff of the Seanad and of the Oireachtas in general for their work on this Bill and on many others passed in the past couple of days.  They have done excellent work and I compliment them on that.  I thank the media for reporting on the deliberations of the Bill.  It is important that the media articulate what has been said here so that there is no confusion outside.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Bill has finally passed through the Oireachtas and I hope it will be signed into law in the not too distant future.  With regard to the Early Signature Motion, I believe there was a surreptitious effort to bounce the President into passing the legislation to the <Col N="1318"/>Supreme Court.  It is my view that even though this is urgent legislation, we should not sign an Early Signature Motion but give the President enough time to decide on the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to re-table this matter and the Minister for attending.  The issues of drugs and drug treatment have presented challenges for many communities.  I am highlighting the drugs issue on the Adjournment in light of the plans of the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the HSE and other agencies to improve waiting times for drug rehabilitation, intervention and detoxification facilities in the Cork region.</P>
        <P>Drug addiction requires a multi-agency and multifaceted plan if the criminal, drug user and pre-user levels are to be tackled.  More resources and treatment places are necessary.  We need a serious debate on the matter, particularly on the reasons for young people&rsquo;s attraction to drug use and what factors make some more susceptible to addiction than others.  We must ask who profits from the sale of illegal drugs and the infection of thousands of people.  Are they common criminals or do they have links with paramilitaries?  This is a question that I asked in the House previously.</P>
        <P>There is a deficit of treatment places and programmes in the Cork region.  The waiting list of up to 150 heroin users for methadone treatment at the Arbour House treatment centre, which is run by the HSE, is a disgrace to us all, especially the Government.  Two doctors operate as one whole-time equivalent doctor to administer the programme in a county the size of Cork.  Not only is there a waiting time, but there is a lack of expansion in the methadone treatment programme to community pharmacists and a deficit in education.  It must be acknowledged that we do not have enough rehab beds.  Cork has no detox beds at all.  As I stated previously, the report of Dr. Mai Mannix highlighted the fact that the region should have 24 beds, 12 of which should be in Cork city.</P>
        <P>Over the years, drug rehabilitation outside Dublin has suffered a considerable lack of funding.  Drug prevention and rehabilitation projects must comprise the cornerstone of any strategy.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill placed the role of the Garda as a cornerstone.  I am confident that garda&iacute; in Cork have a plan, but do the Government and the HSE have one?  Under articles 48 and 72 of the national drugs strategy, treatment and rehabilitation centres are required.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s report of the working group on the residential treatment and rehabilitation of substance users and the availability of dedicated drug residential places made strong recommendations.  I will not go through them, but that report must be implemented, particularly in terms of detox and providing access to facilities.  A waiting list to access treatment is not good enough.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1319"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Much of the concern expressed about waiting times for access to addiction services in the Cork area in recent times has been in respect of the waiting times for opiate users to access methadone treatment.  Currently, 106 opiate users in the Cork area are awaiting this service, a decrease of almost one third on the 150 opiate users who were on the waiting list in January.  The average waiting time in Cork city is ten months.  While recognising that this situation needs to be improved, we should also acknowledge that there has been a substantial increase in the numbers receiving treatment.  There were 94 patients with addresses in Cork on the central treatment list for methadone at the end of March this year, which represents a 40% increase over the number at the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working to reduce the waiting time in Cork.  Before turning to that situation, I would like to set the national context.  The HSE provides treatment and rehabilitation services for those misusing opiates and other drugs through a combination of direct provision by HSE staff or voluntary agencies that it funds to provide services on its behalf.  There is also a wide range of partnerships with community-based groups and agencies.  Individuals presenting for treatment for opiate related issues are provided with a full and comprehensive assessment, not only in terms of medical, but also psychosocial needs.  The assessment process can take up to three weeks.  Some people may be prioritised for clinical reasons, for example, pregnant women.  The range of interventions includes assessment, stabilisation, harm reduction measures, care planning, methadone maintenance, counselling and detoxification either in specialist clinics, residential settings or community settings.</P>
        <P>A total of 36 beds are available for medical and community detoxification.  While all of them are situated in the greater Dublin area, they are available to appropriate clients nationwide, with the exception of the 13 beds in Cuan Dara in Cherry Orchard Hospital, which only takes clients from Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
        <P>The funding committed to addiction services has increased year-on-year over the lifetime of the National Drug Strategy 2001-2008.  In 2008, &euro;101.87 million was spent by the HSE on specific addiction services provided directly by the HSE and those that it funded.  This represents an increase of &euro;45.9 million from the 2001 levels of funding.  In addition, it should be noted that HSE mainstream services, such as accident and emergency services, acute hospitals and mental health services, address the treatment needs of alcohol and other substance misusers who avail of them.  The cost of these services is not included in the figures that I have already cited.</P>
        <P>The number of people receiving treatment continues to rise and addiction services continue to develop, with an additional 3,686 methadone treatment places created from 2001 to 2008.  In addition, needle exchange services have been developed in 13 local drug task force areas and five regional drug task force areas covering the areas most affected by opiate misuse.  Training needs have also been addressed.  The establishment of the national addiction training programme in partnership with Waterford Institute of Technology and the community and voluntary sectors has resulted in the upskilling of 1,645 front line staff.  This training has enabled the HSE addiction service to respond to the changing trends in prevalence, for example, polydrug use, cocaine use and the misuse of alcohol, as well as maintaining a focus on opiate abuse.</P>
        <P>The HSE, as the lead agency, has commenced the implementation of the report of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, which was published in May 2007, by establishing the national drug rehabilitation implementation committee and employing a national senior rehabilitation co-ordinator.  This committee is developing a rehabilitation framework for all addiction services, <Col N="1320"/>as recommended in the report, and is building on co-ordination arrangements that are already in place.</P>
        <P>With regard to the situation in Cork, regional drug co-ordinators in the HSE southern area are working with the national GP co-ordinator to increase the number of level 1 and level 2 GPs in the methadone treatment service.  An additional GP has been providing services in Arbour House in Cork since January 2009, which has enabled an increased number of sessions to be provided for clients.</P>
        <P>To address the issue of waiting times further, the HSE, with the assistance of minor capital grants provided by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is developing additional methadone clinics in a number of locations, including two locations in the Cork area, namely, one in the local drug task force area and one in the regional drug task force area.  It is expected that these additional clinics in Cork will be operational in late 2009 or early 2010.</P>
        <P>Services for opiate users comprise just one element of the much wider range of drug services provided under the umbrella of the national drug strategy by the statutory, voluntary and community sectors.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is providing &euro;1.76 million for the Cork local drugs task force in 2009.  In addition, the southern regional drugs task force is supported by funding of approximately &euro;800,000 for County Cork.</P>
        <P>The HSE acknowledges that there are challenges with respect to waiting times for treatment in certain parts of the country where drug usage has increased significantly in recent years.  It points out that while there are approximately 600 clients on waiting lists, more than 10,000 clients received methadone treatment in 2008.  Overall, the Minister for Health and Children considers that progress is being made in this area nationally and in the context of services being provided and developed in the Cork area.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply, although he did not mention the implementation of detox beds in Cork.  I am amused by the last section of the reply.

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to the Government&rsquo;s plan to address the quality of rental property.  In my constituency of Dublin Central and elsewhere, the issue of substandard rental accommodation is causing significant concern to those who are living inside and beside such accommodation.  My interest in this issue was first sparked when, as a member of Dublin City Council, I had to inspect some rental accommodation in the city of Dublin, including in my constituency.  I saw many homes that were not fit for animals to live in.  They amount to a small percentage of the total stock of rental accommodation in the city and across the country but persistent flouting of the law by the owners of these properties is causing great misery to those living therein and considerable difficulty for those living around them.</P>
        <P>Statistics from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicate that in 2009 only eight landlords were prosecuted for being in breach of minimum legal requirements, while in 2006, 36 were prosecuted for such offences.  The figures for 2008 indicate there has been a dramatic decline since 2006.  The total number of properties surveyed for compliance in 2008 amounted to nearly 17,500.  The landlords of only eight of these had action taken against them.  Out of all those checked nationally, the local authorities concluded there <Col N="1321"/>were problems with approximately 2,300 properties and that, in respect of those properties, only eight actions were initiated in the courts.</P>
        <P>I have stated regularly that if one must take legal action against a landlord, it is an admission of failure.  The problem should be sorted before reaching this point.  I have no doubt there are many more properties causing difficulty than the statistics demonstrate and that action is not being taken, bearing in mind the paltry number &mdash; eight &mdash; of court actions.</P>
        <P>We spent a lot of time today discussing the very significant threat of gangland crime.  Running parallel to this is anti-social behaviour in communities all over the country.  My experience suggests that a disproportionate amount of anti-social behaviour, particularly in urban areas, is associated with rental property that is not being looked after.  If tougher action were taken in this regard, it would have a knock-on effect that would benefit the entire community.</P>
        <P>The new Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 will confer powers on local authorities to impose significant fines on rogue landlords.  The fines amount to many hundreds of euro per day and the initial fine that can be imposed has been increased to &euro;4,500.  The ability of local authorities to generate revenue and invest this in tackling the problem has been increased.  However, I am worried that, on the basis of the figures I have received, not enough prosecutions are being made in respect of landlords who are not taking their responsibilities seriously.  We need to do more in this regard and I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this item and for the opportunity to outline the progress that has been made in recent years in tackling the issue of substandard accommodation in the rental sector.  New regulations were signed at the end of last year updating the minimum standards for rented housing.  These regulations are part of a package of measures delivering on a commitment in the partnership agreement Towards 2016 to update and effectively enforce the minimum standards in the regulations for rented housing.</P>
        <P>The new regulations, which came into effect generally in February this year, are being implemented by all local authorities and prescribe higher, updated standards in a range of areas, including sanitary services, heating, food preparation, ventilation and lighting.  Further measures to deal with the outward appearance and structural condition of rental dwellings will come into force following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, which will also introduce a comprehensive new sanctions regime that will allow local authorities to deal more effectively with landlords who do not comply with the regulations.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is mindful that the key to the success of these regulations is their effective enforcement.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure their rented dwellings comply with the regulations, and responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This funding increased significantly between 2005 and 2008, from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million.  The Minister will be in a position to maintain funding for this purpose in 2009 at the 2008 level of &euro;4 million, bringing the total funding allocated since 2004 to &euro;15 million.</P>
        <P>In line with this increased funding, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activities in recent years.  Indeed, the number of inspections carried out more than doubled in the two-year period from 2005 to 2007, to just over 14,000 inspections.  Full details of the inspections carried out on a county and city basis, up to and including 2007, are published in the Department&rsquo;s annual housing statistics bulletins.  Work is under way on finalising the data for 2008, which will be published before the end of the summer.  However, preliminary figures <Col N="1322"/>indicate a further year-on-year increase in the number of inspections carried out of approximately 23%, with over 17,200 inspections carried out last year.</P>
        <P>Information is not available to the Department on the amount of revenue raised by fines.  However, a report by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007 points out that landlords&rsquo; responsiveness to notices of non-compliance issued by local authorities has ensured the need to prosecute is relatively low and that the low volume of cases taken each year suggests most examples of non-compliance are on a relatively minor scale.  As such, the Minister does not regard the revenue raised by fines as indicative of the success of the enforcement activity of local authorities in any given year.</P>
        <P>The number of inspections carried out is the real barometer of enforcement activity and, as I outlined, this is an area that has seen a very dramatic improvement in recent years.  The further significant increase in activity in 2008 reflects the positive impact of the overall action programme on standards.  The Minister is confident that the increased number of inspections, coupled with the new standards regulations introduced earlier this year and the measures included in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, provide a firm foundation for the continued development of the private rented sector as an attractive, sustainable and well regulated housing option into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Bradford.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been in the House all day and I do not want to have a go at him in particular but I must say that, in respect of an important issue such as the cut to the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, I would prefer if the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or one his two Ministers of State were present to respond.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, mentioned Towards 2016 in his response to Senator Donohoe.  One of the most objectionable aspects of the Government&rsquo;s shock announcement to cut the REP scheme is that it is part of social partnership.  The farming pillar is part of the social partnership agreement and the unilateral decision that has been taken flies in the face of social partnership, which the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, takes pride in supporting, particularly in this time of economic uncertainty.</P>
        <P>There is unprecedented and justified anger among farmers and farming families on foot of the Government decision to cut the scheme.  Over 60,000 farming families nationally are involved in the scheme in some way.  It was projected that the new REPS 4 would attract approximately 62,000 farmers before it finished &mdash; that was understood at the time it was drawn up.  There are approximately 27,000 farmers in the scheme at present.  The maximum payment is approximately &euro;9,500 and the average payment is approximately &euro;6,500.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 midnight</TimeSt><P>In this time of economic uncertainty, farmers, as with everybody else, are being asked to contribute by way of the income levy &mdash; the Lenihan levy &mdash; and they are being hit by every other aspect of the Government&rsquo;s attempts to grapple with the economic difficulties.  They are also being affected by a number of cuts directed specifically at agriculture.  Since the budget last October, the suckler cow welfare scheme payment has halved, there has been a change to the rules concerning the farm waste management scheme such that funding will be made available over three years, the installation aid and early retirement schemes have been suspended and forestry premiums have been cut dramatically.  The disadvantaged areas scheme, which applied to many farmers in the REP scheme, has already been subject to a cut in the order of 11% and it is projected to be subject to a cut in <Col N="1323"/>the order of 15% as part of the REPS-related announcement made last week.  That is a shocking indictment of this Government which has neglected rural Ireland.  It might feign interest in rural development but the most obvious and direct way of ensuring that is to ensure that as many viable farming enterprises are maintained as possible.</P>
        
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>REPS has been shown to be successful.  A recent report on farm waste management shows that farmers have markedly improved their facilities, whereas more than 50% of local authorities are polluting.  Only a few farmers are in that category.  The Government decided last week to initiate a move that would particularly hit small farmers, dry stock farmers, who have suffered a great deal in recent years because of the price of beef and lamb, and those who operate on marginal land.  That is reflected in the decision to cut the disadvantaged area payments.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will be able to outline to the House the details of the scheme to replace REPS that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food mentioned last week.  I understand this will come nowhere near replacing the income lost by farm families as a result of this cut but I will await the Minister&rsquo;s response before passing judgment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, who has had a long day, for being here tonight.  It is important to have a Cabinet Minister here to hear what we have to say.  The REPS programme has been very successful and contributed significantly to the quality of rural life.  Since 1994 more than &euro;3 billion has been spent on the scheme benefiting tens of thousands of farmers, their families and communities. </P>
        <P>The scheme helps to supplement farm incomes which are dwindling year on year.  Its purpose was to benefit the local environment following an EU directive.  Farming is one of our oldest indigenous industries, along with fishing, and merits support on that basis.  The alternative for many farmers who would not be eligible to re-apply for REPS and go on to the new scheme would be to avail of a farm assist scheme, a subvention programme operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is equivalent to the dole, paying &euro;204 per week, and is means-tested.  If those farmers who do not now qualify for the farm assist were left with that as their only means it would be an additional burden on the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>According to the Teagasc report published last week, the average farm income is approximately &euro;17,000 per farm.  In the north west that figure was approximately &euro;8,600 per farm.  The average REPS payment was &euro;6,200 per farm.  Taking that away leaves farmers with next to nothing.  I spoke to farmers over the weekend and met the county executive of the Irish Farmers Association and saw farmers at my clinics in Donegal.  They are all very worried because they use the money they get from the REPS payment to subvent other loans and their incomes.  For example, it services the loans they have taken out to deal with the 40:40:20 investments under the farm waste management scheme.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that there is EU pressure on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to consider a new mechanism.  The Irish model has been very successful and may be a victim of its own success.  The Department must meet the farm organisations as quickly as possible to discuss this issue.  I understand that talks may have broken down and while I am not laying blame we need to open the channels of communication immediately.</P>
        <P>There should be a cost-benefit analysis of this decision because while it may save money in one Department it may cost money in another, the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Farmers need clarity on the new scheme.  This is a menu scheme similar to one in the North of Ireland which runs from 2007-13 with available resources of &pound;220 million, including EU money, <Col N="1324"/>which aims to sign up 18,000 farmers by 2013.  The farmer selects the area from which he wishes to gain money.  There must be absolute clarity on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my two colleagues for allowing me to say a few words on this important issue which is causing grave concern in rural Ireland.  I thank the Minister for his presence here at this late hour.  We hope that he will pass on our concerns to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  </P>
        <P>It was sadly ironic that last week as the Government shut down the D&aacute;il at the end of the political season, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was shutting down a significant income stream for rural Ireland and farming families.  REPS has been an unqualified success in bringing income to rural communities, improving and maintaining our environment and giving farmers some degree of certainty in their financial planning.  Thousands of farmers are in a state of disappointment, despair and shock following the Minister&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>Last weekend we all met farmers who were deeply concerned and angry and very surprised at the Minister&rsquo;s announcement.  No agricultural issue in recent years has caused the same degree of disquiet.  It is important that dialogue between the farming organisations and the Minister and his officials be re-started at the earliest possible opportunity.  There is some talk of an alternative scheme but its details are sketchy.  The bottom line, however, is that the combination of EU and State money that REPS ploughed into agriculture, the rural income stream and the environment is being significantly reduced and for some people it will be totally cut off.  That is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister, notwithstanding that it is not his decision, to convey our sincere concerns to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and ask him to reconsider this urgently and try to bring some degree of aid and hope to Irish farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter.  As they have said, the rural environment protection scheme has undoubtedly been a successful measure.  By the end of 2009, payments made to farmers since the launch of the scheme in 1994 will have passed the &euro;3 billion mark. REPS has always been about much more than money.  It has delivered enormous benefits in enhancing the rural environment, water quality, biodiversity and the landscape.</P>
        <P>However, the success of the scheme has brought its own challenges.  When the applications submitted last week are included, the number of participants in REPS is at the highest ever level at well over 60,000.  Payments arising from liabilities this year will also exceed expenditure under the scheme in any previous year.  We are, therefore, now at a point of both record participation and record funding for the scheme.  The scheme is now oversubscribed and, at a time when there are unprecedented pressures on the public finances, the Government had no option but to announce the closure of entry to the scheme last week.</P>
        <P>It is important that I make the point that REPS was never intended to be purely an income support like the single payment or the disadvantaged areas schemes.  In fact, the EU regulations are quite explicit in providing that agri-environmental schemes like REPS can only compensate farmers for income foregone and additional costs incurred through farming in a more environmentally friendly way than they are otherwise obliged to do, whether under legislation or, more recently, according to the requirements of the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>I want to stress the ongoing scale and benefits of payments under the scheme.  Despite the closure of entry to the scheme, the fact is that this year, the Department will issue REPS payments amounting to &euro;330 million to some 63,000 participants in the scheme.  Next year, the numbers in the scheme will still be around 54,000, a level of participation as high as in any year <Col N="1325"/>to date.  Applications received in the Department up to last Thursday are being processed and, if they are valid, the applicants will enter into new five-year contracts.  If farmers, with contracts ending after 31 January 2010, submitted new applications by last Thursday, they will be eligible for REPS 4 contracts running to the end of 2015.  The Department will continue to honour payments to all existing participants for the remainder of their five-year plans.</P>
        <P>In acknowledging the impact of the closure of the scheme, its value since its introduction in 1994 and the need to replace REPS with an agri-environmental measure, the Government has decided to allocate all the modulation funds secured by the Minister in the recent CAP health check, as well as funding negotiated under the European economic recovery plan, to a new agri-environment measure.</P>
        <P>The total funding of this new measure will be determined only in the context of the 2010 budget-Estimates process later in the year.  It is not possible, therefore, to indicate, at this stage, what the level of individual payment under the new scheme will be; no decisions in this regard have yet been taken nor will any be taken until much later in the year.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined, though, that all available EU funding will be drawn down and is committed to providing the necessary matching funding.  The Government will have to provide an amount from national funds equivalent to one third of what is available from the EU to draw down the modulated funds, all of which are being allocated to the new agri-environment scheme.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s intention is to give priority in this new measure to farmers who have previously been in REPS and officials will be entering into discussions very shortly with the farming organisations and the other stakeholders about the details of the new scheme.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, an outline of the new measure is included in proposals to the European Commission for amendments to the current rural development programme, which will be with the Commission by tomorrow to ensure the availability of the modulation funds.  I expect that the new agri-environmental measure will be available no later than 2010 for those who no longer have an opportunity to apply for REPS 4.</P>
        <P>I readily acknowledge the response of farmers to the decision to close entry to REPS but I must emphasise that an alternative measure is being put in place, which will be quite different from REPS, in so far as it will involve the selection of individual measures, selected from a menu of such options, rather than the existing &ldquo;whole of farm&rdquo; approach.  It will be a simpler scheme, both in terms of participation and administration, and the compliance costs will be considerably lower than those associated with REPS.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that a range of significant investment measures also announced last week did not receive the appropriate coverage.  This package of new measures, worth &euro;113 million, includes a range of supports for the dairy and sheep sectors and for young farmers.  These measures demonstrate that the Government, notwithstanding the extreme difficulties the country faces, is committed to continuing investment in the agri-food sector and to the long-term future of farming.  I want to assure the House on behalf of the Government that this commitment will be delivered on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was indicated last week when the announcement was made that the current scheme is 60% funded by the Government and 40% funded by the EU.  The Minister concerned indicated that the 40% European funding would be retained in whatever new scheme was being drawn up.  That is not indicated in any way, shape or form in what the Minister present said in his reply.  He also said that REPS was not designed to be an income <Col N="1326"/>support scheme but he has outlined that the new scheme when it comes into force will contain funding from modulation funds and from the European economic recovery plan.  In other words, will he confirm that the new scheme as it will take shape will be an income support scheme?  He outlined that &euro;113 million of new supports.  Can he confirm that what has happened is that the farmers who would have received &euro;330 million under REPS will now only receive &euro;113 million under different headings under a series of new schemes that will be set up and effectively the Government has decided to take  &euro;220 million out of the pockets of farmers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Senator that the Government will do its level best to ensure that we access all the EU funding that is available and that we will provide the necessary funding in this respect.  In regard to the new scheme, its details have not yet been indicated and they will be available later this year.  </P>
        <P>There is no easy way around the fact that our public finances are in a difficult state.  People like the Senator in opposition can call for cuts everywhere while also calling for more services and more spending but the two will simply not meet.</P>
