	<P>I have received notice from Senator Terry Leyden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to instruct the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to remove the necessity to purchase permits for coarse and pike angling, under the auspices of the Midland Fisheries Group, in respect of the River Suck, River Inny, River Brosna, Little Brosna river and Camilin river.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to take immediate steps to resolve the difficulties in both County Donegal Vocational Education Committee and Donegal County Council whereby, due to the unprecedented number of student grant applications, the recruitment embargo placed on both bodies and the unavailability of overtime, many students will now have to wait until January to receive their student grant payments and students currently attending third level institutions are unregistered, leaving them without access to many services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport to authorise Bus &Eacute;ireann to re-route a service to facilitate students attending Athlone Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give the name and number of water and sewerage schemes in County Donegal that are not in compliance with current European directives and the towns and villages that are still awaiting schemes to come into compliance with all relevant EU directives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make Lyme disease a notifiable illness in Ireland, thus increasing the specialist medical help available to sufferers of the illness, as well as publicising the risk of the disease.</P><Col N="328"/>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Leyden, Doherty and McFadden and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the proposed postcodes, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, the contributions of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes, on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from spokespersons; and No. 31, motion 33, regarding INFOMAR, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 but not earlier than 5.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by paying tribute to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the staff of the aid agency GOAL and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the role they played in securing the safe release of Sharon Commins and her colleague, Hilda Kawuki, from captivity in Darfur.  The strength and courage they demonstrated has been remarkable and is a credit to them.  We are delighted with the successful outcome and the fact that the women have been released.</P>

	<P>In politics, it is easy to call for change by other people, change to the way the public sector works and change in the HSE, but it is not easy to change ourselves and the way we do business.  Over the weekend, we saw a show of leadership and conviction from my party and its leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What about Fine Gael in government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Actions speak louder than words and we have proposed a radical package of reforms for the Oireachtas, which includes reducing the number of Deputies, reducing ministerial expenses and putting a referendum to the people on the future existence of the Seanad.  The people will ultimately decide.  We also recommend a list system to open up the political system in a way that it has not been opened before.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been many calls for change in other organisations over which we, as politicians, have authority but we need to look to ourselves in this regard.  When one looks at the agenda for the business of the House this week, it proves the point we are making about the work given to this House by the Government, the way the Government treats this House, and the lack of accountability in politics.  For that reason, I oppose the Order of Business.  We have been calling for Ministers to come to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to speak about the problems facing mortgage holders, the negative equity that so many families in this country face, the spiralling unemployment affecting every family, and the 1,000 operations cancelled for children in Crumlin hospital.  These are the issues we should be discussing in this House and hearing from Ministers about their accountability on these issues.  For this reason, I oppose the Order of Business, which is light in substance.</P>
        <P>For example, we should be discussing the threat to Protestant schools and the implications of that North and South.  These topics should be on our agenda in this House and Senators across this House agree with me.  This House should be dealt with more effectively and we should have business on the Order of Business every day dealing with the real issues confronting people in this country.  That is why Fine Gael has proposed a radical package of reforms for the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>I will resist the opportunity to make any snide comments at my loyal colleagues in front of me in the Fine Gael benches except to regret the contemptuous way in which they were treated by their leader over the weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael leader played right into the Leader&rsquo;s hands and I do not know why he is smiling because the world knows that he has managed to outmanoeuvre the Green Party in its attempts to reform this House time and again.  The Green Party must also play its part.  All I will say about Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal &mdash; unthinking and without rationale as it was &mdash; is that it might hasten some action from the Government, although I do not hold my breath.</P><Col N="330"/>
        <P>More than anything else I would like the House to debate the aspects of Fine Gael proposals regarding the D&aacute;il which are offensively anti-democratic.  The idea of reducing the number of elected Deputies by 20 in general and having 20 in a list system means 40 fewer people elected to the D&aacute;il.  The leader of the Opposition is riding a populist wave to peel back the layers of democracy, getting rid of one House and reducing the numbers in the other House while having an inbuilt majority of 20 people in the parliamentary party to ensure his continued existence and that there is never a threat to him.  It is appalling.  It is the type of thing that happened in the recessions of the 1930s in Italy and Germany and I appeal to my colleagues in the Fine Gael benches to examine this more than the proposals for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We can deal with Seanad &Eacute;ireann here; I am afraid of the chaps in the Lower House who do not see the full extent of what is being proposed.</P>
        <P>This is distracting attention from issues that need to be dealt with.  If anything needs to be reconsidered it is the proposal regarding taking power away from the people and giving it to party leadership, reducing the nature and centre of political democracy and always going backwards.  This should be resisted.  What we heard over the weekend is a regurgitation of the legacy we thought we had left behind with O&rsquo;Duffy in the 1930s.  This is going backwards.  I hope every Fine Gael person who believes in democracy, and I know the people in front of me in this House do, will examine, analyse and consider the consequences of what is being proposed not just for this House but also for the other House.</P>
        <P>The Leader is afraid of what would happen to this House were it to be elected by the people in general.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 31, motion 35 regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Seanad reform document, be implemented.  I want to hear from the Leader whether he accepts the basic principle of democracy that every citizen of the State should have a vote in some form or other in the election of this House as well as maintaining other things that are there at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in welcoming the news of the release of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki.  Good news is very welcome at such a bleak time and congratulations are due to all involved, and I pay particular tribute to the strength of character displayed by Sharon Commins since her release after 107 days in captivity.</P>
        <P>In response to some of what has been said in the debate on the status of the Seanad, to call Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s sudden conversion to the cause of abolition brave is to miss the point.  It seems a rather bizarre if not a rather pathetic attempt to grab headlines from what would otherwise have been a mundane speech to the Fine Gael party faithful on Saturday night.  The sudden conversion does not strike me as brave, particularly not after his party put forward very different proposals for reform of the Seanad a mere seven months ago.  However, the case for substantial reform of the Seanad is unanswerable.  There is a clear case for significant reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The schedule of business for the House this week confirms that.  We did not sit yesterday for a reason unexplained by the Leader and which many of us opposed on Thursday.  Today&rsquo;s business does not include the relevant and topical subjects we should debate.  To have statements on postal codes and a marine mapping programme calls into question the relevance of the Seanad and I would also like to propose an amendment to the Order of Business on behalf of the Labour Party that instead we debate what is being debated throughout the country, namely, NAMA&rsquo;s business plan which was published last week.  It is being debated everywhere but not in the Upper House where we should see relevant debate <Col N="331"/>take place every week.  Will the Leader amend the Order of Business to ensure we can debate the topic here? </P>
        <P>I would also like to have a full debate on the cuts to budgets of Protestant schools.  Senator Norris and I raised the issue here two weeks ago.  Archbishops John Neill and Diarmuid Martin are also calling on the Minister for Education and Science to reverse the cutbacks.  It is nice for an atheist to be speaking in support of two bishops.  We need a debate on the matter urgently with the Minister for Education and Science who must explain why he is reversing a policy of four decades to give funding to Protestant schools in recognition of their very different ethos within our sectarian education system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the voices that have welcomed the release of Sharon Commins and her Ugandan colleague from captivity in Sudan and thank all those responsible for securing their release.  </P>
        <P>It is important that we are starting a necessary debate on the future of this House.  I am grateful to the Leader of the Opposition in the other House for initiating that debate.  I question his motives and commitment to the wider range of the reform process in respect of the quality of democracy in this country.  The reform process should start in local government.  We will have a White Paper on local government.  The main Opposition party has been the main party of local government in the past ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This will require a constitutional referendum.  Before we debate this issue in detail &mdash; the Leader of the Opposition in the other House must consider this &mdash; I call for a referendum Bill to be submitted.  Let it show what a referendum on deleting or even reforming the Seanad would look like.  There are at least 20 references to the Seanad in the Constitution.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who are innocent about the ways in which business is conducted.  In the way the Leader conducts it, the agenda is constructed to deal with limited business.  It is the case in the way debates are conducted, the way Ministers fail to come into the House to answer Adjournment debates and the way Ministers are dismissive of amendments or legislative initiatives in this House.  It is totally an extension of the Executive.  The Leader has affected purposeful debate in this House as a result of those heavyhanded procedures.</P>
        <P>Thirty years ago there was a constitutional referendum which extended, or was to have done so, the franchise of the university panels.  That has been resisted by Independent Senators elected to this Chamber&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I understand Senator Regan would not have misled the House deliberately but I would like him to withdraw that comment.  It is factually incorrect.  We tabled a Bill and also supported a Fine Gael Bill which was presented at the time by former Senator Jackman.  That involved all the Members on this side.  I state that for the record.</P>

	<P>All these issues, observations and stances have fed into the current debate regarding the role of the Seanad.  I believe the Seanad can play a useful role but in the way the business has been conducted and the way the Government has acted in respect of it we have come to a situation where serious consideration must be given to the proposal by the leader of Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>As we sit here and contemplate the future of the House, 90% of members of the largest public sector union &mdash; IMPACT &mdash; have voted for industrial action if public sector pay is cut.  In these days and weeks, that issue is much more important than this debate, which has been held previously and can be held again.  The pressing preparations for the most severe budget ever are under way.  As the social partners meet in Government Buildings, I want to impress upon them the essential nature of agreement.  That 86% of people voted to take industrial action in the context of some of the measures that must be taken in the forthcoming budget should exercise these benches to be full and our voices to be the loudest.</P>
        <P>I would welcome any imminent and worthwhile reform of the Seanad.  I do not know a single Member of this Seanad or the previous one who does advocate reform or believe it is long overdue.  However, can I impress upon the Leader the need for an urgent debate on the economy to consider how the House might assist in creating a renewed and revitalised social partnership?  The future of the nation is more important than any other consideration at this time.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader indicate when time will be available to consider the report that I tabled before each Senator on the prevention of the repossession of family homes?  He indicated that we would be able to discuss it and make recommendations.</P>

        <P>On the first day back after the election, I tabled the Government&rsquo;s own proposals for reform.  They were enthusiastically supported by Fine Gael and opposed by the Government.  Fine Gael was in government for a number of years and could have reformed the Seanad easily with the enthusiastic support of the Independent Senators.</P>

He unilaterally decided to sacrifice this House on the altar of his own public political ambition to expiate principally the sins of the other House.  That was bad enough, but what of the dishonesty of the statements that went with it?  He stated that he had announced this at the McGill Summer School, but he was publicly confronted with the record, which showed he had not announced it.  The notion that we are going to solve the economic problems of this country by cutting back Seanad &Eacute;ireann would be laughable were it not so serious to think that a man so financially illiterate might be placed in charge of the destiny of this country.</P>

They, too, have gone through a hard time for the past 107 days.  I greet her grandmother, uncle and aunt.

        <P>I wish to comment on the proposals made by other speakers on Seanad reform and the comments of some of my colleagues about the statements of Senator Fitzgerald and Deputy Enda Kenny.  It all boils down to one simple point.  This institution has largely been created and formed by the Members opposite.  We propose asking the people whether they want to keep it.  What is wrong with that idea?  What is wrong with asking the people if the institution created by the Government is one they want to keep?</P>

	<P>Is this an institution of vested interests or is it one that will represent the common interest of the people?  We propose asking them for their views on whether the Seanad should be retained.  This is an institution which has been forged and heavily influenced by the Leader and the other side for the past 20 years.  We want to ask the people whether they are happy with this.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator Bacik in her call for a debate on the NAMA business plan which has been discussed in every arena and forum for serious debate.  It will have a fundamental influence on the financial outlook of the country for years to come.  There is no reason the House could not debate the issue this week.  It is the lack of such debates and discussion that has put our party in a position where we have to ask whether this institution is fit for purpose any longer.</P>

        <P>I am one of the senior Members of the House and have spoken many times on the issue of Seanad reform and on how the House should be reformed with regard to the selection and election procedures.  I have spoken at length about the role and functions of the Seanad.  If nothing else, I was taken aback on Saturday night when I heard the statement of Deputy Enda Kenny.  Perhaps he has jolted us into holding this debate once and for all and to get on with the reform of the Seanad.  We should have reform first and if that does not work then let us abolish it, but let us not put the cart before the horse.  We have not had a chance to have that reform and we need to have it.  Are the committees doing the role of the Seanad?  Is there a duplication?  Often when we could debate issues here related to European affairs they are being debated in the committee.  This Chamber could be used to monitor directives, for the scrutiny of European affairs and to bring in MEPs to the Chamber such that we reach out to the public as to how we do our business abroad.  There are many ways and I ask that we move on the reform, but I will not support the abolition.  The Seanad has served us well throughout the years.</P>

Equally, and most important, I congratulate the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Sudanese authorities and others involved on successfully achieving their target of the safe release of the two girls.  It was known from early on where the girls were located.  Given the intelligence available, people could have gone in to them to try to free them, to bombard where they were and try to get them free.  However, 107 days later they achieved their success without difficulty.  It is fair to congratulate all involved in the difficult and delicate discussions and negotiations that took place.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to what people have said about Seanad reform and one should take the opportunity to congratulate Enda Kenny on stimulating debate on this issue.  There is no doubt there is room for plenty &mdash; I underline that word &mdash; of improvement in respect of Seanad reform.  There has been comment on the work schedule of the Seanad this week.  There are many important economic and financial issues that should be on our agenda, such as the &euro;24 billion deficit for this year alone, the NAMA business plan, industrial unrest, the banking difficulties that everyone in the country is experiencing at present and the difficulties being experienced by SMEs.  Every household is experiencing difficulties with regard to job losses and so on.  We all know the list and we all know it goes on.</P>
        <P>However, I have called on the Leader, probably half a dozen times in the House, to consult the other leaders so as to have a debate on the economic and financial issues facing the country pencilled into our schedule every week.</P>

	<P>Is it any wonder that people are cynical about politics?  I agree with Senators MacSharry and Callely that Members from both sides of the House have been calling consistently for debates that relate to people&rsquo;s lives, such as house repossessions, job losses, NAMA and the economic future of this country.  The Fine Gael leader&rsquo;s decision this weekend has cast a strong spotlight on the workings of this House.  I get frustrated when I look at the Order of Business, such as this week, for example, and find that we are discussing postal codes and the seabed when we should be talking about the suffering that people experience in their lives.  Perhaps that is why the Fine Gael leader is stepping out from the spotlight and making leadership decisions.  The old saying &ldquo;Nero fiddles while Rome burns&rdquo; reminds me of the Government&rsquo;s inaction.  We are living in unprecedented times which call for strong leadership and radical decisions.  The Fine Gael leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, is making radical decisions now which will affect Members of this House.  They might not like it but that is the reality of the times we are in.</P>
        <P>I am asking the Leader for a real debate on our economic future, the future of politics in this country and how we can respond to the needs of those whom we are supposed to represent.  Day by day, the public is losing faith in the establishment and the political process.  The Fine Gael leader is leading from the front and the top.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on our democratic institutions.  There has been a specific proposal to abolish the Seanad.  It must not be forgotten that there is a good, democratic reason for having a bicameral system, although there is need for reform.  Ironically, the reports to date have mainly dealt with electoral reform, but it is the way in which we do our business that is most in need of reform.  We could serve very well by taking in issues such as Northern Ireland and Europe, as well as having foreign Heads of State address the Seanad.  By having more flexibility, we could go straight from the Order of Business into topical issues of the day.</P>
        <P>Not only was it proposed to abolish this main democratic institution, there was also a second proposal, which nobody seems to have examined properly, for committees to have quasi-judicial functions.  This is a serious attempt to undermine the Judiciary.  There is a clear reason for judicial independence, including the Haughey judgment and the Ardagh judgment.  Recent events in the Lower House have shown that due process and justice were not upheld.  We do not want a situation whereby committees are not giving proper justice to people by taking powers unto themselves that properly belong to the Judiciary.  Both the measures proposed this week could be quite dangerous.</P>
        <P>I am also seeking a debate on long-term unemployment.  We need to look at the changing role of F&Aacute;S, which is currently in the spotlight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>

	<P>It is time this House became relevant to life out there in the trenches.  Yesterday, we had a major job creation event in Oranmore which was attended by 240 people.  Deputy George Lee opened that event.  The view was that jobs, rather than NAMA, cuts or taxation, would grow the economy.  The House has not spent enough time discussing <Col N="341"/>job retention and creation.  One recruitment agency at yesterday&rsquo;s event said it had 200 jobs available, some of which it could not fill in this country because our graduates do not have the qualifications to fill high-end jobs in the medical device, IT and green sectors.  In many cases they need two languages for such jobs.  We should have a serious debate on how our education system is planning for the future, preparing for the needs of industry and delivering graduates into jobs.  These jobs are being filled by graduates from other countries.</P>
        <P>The Leader must take responsibility in this regard.  He has not led or given good leadership in the House.  He has organised poor schedules, he has been untimely and he has not made Ministers accountable to the House.</P>

I made a Freedom of Information Act request to establish whether Ireland has cancelled a bilateral adoption agreement.  I received a reply saying I would have to pay &euro;1,247 for information the Minister of State could give me if the Leader made him accountable to the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am a policy-driven Senator and I can stand over my record.  I produced a document in 2006 on suicide in the new Ireland.  I commend the<i> Irish Examiner</i> on publishing the tremendous article on suicide written by Fiachra &Oacute; Cionnaith.  He said it was reported by the national office of suicide prevention that 1.7% of all deaths every year are due to suicide.  This means one death in every 59 is by suicide and since the start of this decade more than 4,000 people officially have died by suicide while another 1,000 deaths have been <Col N="342"/>classified as undetermined.  He noted that these figures combined mean that almost 2,000 more people have died by suicide in Ireland this decade than during the 30 years of civil strife in the North.  I am critical of the Government because it has not delivered on the 33 recommendations in the Oireachtas report on suicide prevention.  There are more deaths by suicide than by car accident.  Our entire parliamentary party meeting last night was taken up with the issue of road deaths.</P>

	<P>Perhaps it is because it deals with our survival and future, and let that be the case, but there are times I wish there were even more Members on the Independent benches because they have been great contributors to debates in this House and in recent days they have been the best advocates in public for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I salute them for that because we need rational and balanced debate at this time.</P>
        <P>I also compliment those in the mainstream media, not because they are present but because in many ways they have not added to the frenzy surrounding the call for the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In fact, some of their editorials have gone in a different direction.  I heard Olivia O&rsquo;Leary make her arguments on RTE also.  It is clear it was not as popular a suggestion as might have been expected.</P>
        <P>What has come out of this debate is that when the people got an opportunity to examine the proposal, and the alternative, they were able to judge whether the perception about the Seanad was misplaced or arose because we do not get sufficient coverage in the media in terms of the more substantive issues dealt with here.  Parliamentary democracy is the bedrock of a normal society and we tinker with it at our peril.  If we abolish this House, and that is a matter for debate, and dilute D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann we will end up with a vacuum and we can be certain that vacuum will be filled by people who are virtually fascist in their approach to democracy.  We must be particularly careful in that regard.</P>
        <P>Each party in the Oireachtas has already made a submission on reform but not one of those submissions suggested the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I look across at good friends on the other side of the House and I do not believe they will join in the debate today in support of the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  If the intention was to focus on the possibility of reform, however, then let us have that but the Order of Business will not reach any conclusions.</P>

That is indicative of the way the political system is broken and in need of radical reform.  People see us as elitist, out of touch with reality and aloof and it is time we changed that perception.  I say that as someone who is proud to be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, has great pride in our Constitution and does not necessarily agree with Deputy Enda Kenny&rsquo;s remarks but it took leadership and courage to make them.  He was brave because there are interests in this Chamber who have had their heads in the sand for far too long, aided and abetted by the Ministers of this Government who have abdicated responsibility.

        <P>The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, of which Senator Coffey and I are members, recently compiled a report on the electoral register.  That report which was partly informed by a visit we made to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland contains some extremely radical and useful proposals.  Thus far, every effort that has been made to improve the electoral register has failed.  Successive Administrations, including that currently in power, are guilty in this regard.  People who voted in the most recent local elections have discovered that their names have disappeared from the register in the interim, which is unacceptable.  In such circumstances, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley who is anxious to address this important matter to the House in order that we might engage in a meaningful debate.  The Minister could take that opportunity to bring forward definitive proposals aimed at solving the problems in respect of the electoral register and people&rsquo;s democratic right to vote.</P>

	<P>The Seanad was established to protect minorities.  It is appropriate that a deputation is discussing with the Taoiseach the matter of fee-paying Protestant schools.  I know there is a delusion among certain sections of the Catholic bourgeoisie that Church of Ireland fee-paying schools are full of Ross O&rsquo;Carroll-Kelly type characters.  That is not the case; they are full of poor Protestants.  Many of my friends from among the Catholic bourgeoisie have never met a poor Protestant.  However, I have met many.  Plenty of them are scattered throughout rural areas and they need the support of the fee-paying system.  It would be pathetic for the Seanad which was set up to protect that minority not to speak with one voice today and I hope it will so do.  It is so squalid and sordid to try to save &euro;2.8 million which would hardly keep F&Aacute;S executives in fags for a day at the expense of scattered rural communities.  Let us have an end to this proposal.  Members should commend the two bishops.  It is good to see the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin not keeping his head down, as they kept their heads down for long enough.  The Protestant population fell from 10% to 3% between 1920 and 1990; at the same time the Catholic population in Northern Ireland rose by 10%.  These figures are highly visible to people in Northern Ireland.  Before this squalid mess is taken up by bad elements in Northern Ireland, let us have an end to it.  Moreover, I remind the House that every Minister who got into trouble in Ireland started off by asking for the opinion of the Attorney General on something.</P>

	<P>To an extent Senator Harris has stolen my thunder because I was about to state this House had been established by the State&rsquo;s founding fathers to include minorities and particularly in order that the voice of the Protestant religion, as well as Unionist voices, would be heard here.  Therefore, it is compatible with this intention for Members collectively to support the call made by the Senator and others for support for Protestant schools.  He has put the argument extremely well.  Many of the pupils in such fee-paying schools would not be in a position to cover the cost were they to be deprived of the funding of which they have been in receipt.  I add my voice to that call.  </P>

Were such a debate to be facilitated, the Leader should arrange to have a representative from the IMF to address the House as part of that debate.  Such a person could tell Members what action has been taken in other countries that found themselves in the fiscal difficulties we now face, or perhaps worse, and what were the remedies in those cases.  That might be a patent lesson for all Members.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment briefly on the general debate today.  Before I was old enough to vote, I campaigned in my first electoral campaign, Jack Lynch&rsquo;s referendum campaign in 1968 to seek to change the electoral system from the single transferable vote system.  A debate is required on both the Seanad and the overall democratic institutions of the State to ascertain how they can be improved in the light of modern requirements and demands.  One should be careful in how one approaches this issue as such an approach must be considered and comprehensive.  The proposal from the Leader of the Opposition to reduce the number of democratically elected Members of these Houses from 226 to 126 would have serious ramifications for the entire issue of democracy.  In particular, when one considers the failure of State agencies such as the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank in the face of the current economic crisis, I think greater, rather than less, political scrutiny is required to ensure the various agencies of the State are performing effectively.  Dismantling our democratic institutions would be fraught with danger and require the most careful consideration.  It is not something to be thrown out purely to get media coverage at a social event.</P>

	<P>First, I wish to be associated with the remarks made about the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I congratulate it on the release of Sharon Commins and her Ugandan friend and colleague.  </P>
        <P>The current situation has been arrived at because this country has an unaccountable democratic system in which the buck stops nowhere.  No one is accountable in any Department.  No Minister is accountable.  Oireachtas committees are toothless, while local government members are powerless.  This explains the current position.</P>
        <P>I have called for a debate on tourism on numerous occasions.  The failure of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to sell the country is at crisis point.  Ireland has the product required in the activities of golf, fishing, walking and mountaineering.  Moreover, access is available through Dublin, Knock, Shannon, Waterford, Kerry and Cork.  However, no one is able to put together these packages.  Both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have failed miserably in this regard.  Members should have an urgent debate on the subject before the onset of the new season after Christmas because the sector is in crisis.</P>

	<P>Like other Members, I note that other pressing issues affect society to a much greater extent than the debate that is exercising the House today.  One of them has been mentioned by Senator Norris, namely, the impending report on child abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin that has been delayed for one week.  Members have been given plenty of notice that it will be published next week.  As the House is not sitting next week, can the Leader arrange a full three hour debate on the issue either on the Tuesday on which Members return or the following Wednesday?</P>

        <P Just="Left">Other speakers have spoken of the need for real debate.  Together with other speakers, I have previously called for real debate in the House and have had such debate.  Sometimes, however, the House would not even have a quorum for what is called and stands for real debate.  As for the debate that is exercising everyone, I for one did not hear the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition.  However, on being told of them, I considered them to be somewhat knee-jerk in nature because I had read the report he had given to the MacGill Summer School when he called for reform.  I was one of the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators who appeared on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; a few months ago with my Labour Party and Independent colleagues when Fine Gael refused to send any representative.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is indicative of the reasons the House is held in such disrepute when the leaders of the groups are not aware the House is not sitting next week, even though it has been announced that this is the case.  It was a little premature.  In the course of this debate I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Leader because he has been manipulated by the Government into allowing the Seanad to be neutralised over time.  The fact that his party has been in power continuously in the Seanad for almost 20 years, during which time no reforms of any meaning to the people have been introduced, is an indication of what has gone wrong.  There is a sense that people want to shoot the messenger who has brought forward this debate in a way that has galvanised Members of this House with the idea that they might actually be out of a job in a number of years.  As a result, we might see some meaningful reforms in the lifetime of the Government.  Comments have been made about democracy and <Col N="350"/>the role of democracy.  It is the failure of democratic political systems and the political representatives elected by the people to connect with citizens that leads to dictatorship, not whether there might be 120 or 220 Members.  There is a huge sense among the public that we are not connected to the people we represent.  For that reason, we urgently need to reform both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and will discuss it with the leaders of the groups in the House tomorrow morning before the Order of Business.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators Bacik, Norris, Mullen and Harris expressed their serious concern about the reduction of funding for rural Protestant schools.  I fully support their comments today and propose inviting the Minister to the House to have another look at the situation and the terrific work that has been done for generations by good and decent people on behalf of the Protestant community.  A high percentage of people in my constituency are of the Protestant faith and my family has worked extremely closely with them for the past 100 years.  I will arrange a debate with the Minister present at the earliest opportunity during the next two weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Boyle raised local government reform and the imminent publication of the White Paper.  I will certainly allocate time for a debate on that matter.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Regan, I have already pointed out that Fine Gael was in power on two occasions in the past 30 years since the referendum on the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Senators MacSharry, Coffey, Hanafin, Buttimer and Walsh sought a debate on the economy, public sector pay and the challenge the budget poses for everybody.  This will probably be the most important budget of the past two decades and I will allocate time for these issues to be debated.  I hope to be able to discuss this with the group leaders tomorrow morning and possibly have a date for it to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry raised the issue of families who find themselves in the very difficult position of facing repossession of their homes because they are unable to meet their mortgage repayments as a result of being unemployed.  The Senator has done good work on this issue by producing his report, the MacSharry report.  I strongly suggest we include this matter with the debate on the economy.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on health issues and I am endeavouring to have the Minister for Health and Children come to the House.  Senator John Hanafin referred to the importance of democracy, Seanad and committee reform and a proposed reduction of 100 seats in the Houses.  This can be discussed in the last debate before the Seanad reform Bill is published.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to urgent matters.  She always seems to make such requests of me and I strongly suggest that Private Members&rsquo; time is another way of trying to find information that Senator Healy Eames sincerely requests every day.  I would do anything I could to help the Senator but Private Members&rsquo; time is a wonderful way to find the up-to-date position in respect of the matters Senators bring to the attention of the House from time to time.</P>

I commend Senator White on the work she has done and support her call for the Government to be proactive in doing everything it possibly can in this regard.  If another debate is requested and needed I have no difficulty in allocating time for it to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called on me to allocate time for a debate on the register of electors.  I have made a commitment on this and I will allow time for a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Paddy Burke called for an update on the major challenges facing the tourism industry.  The tourism business has been one of the three pillars on which the economy was built in the 1990s and it needs all the assistance it can get.  I have no difficulty in time being allocated for this debate to take place.</P>

    <Title>Proposed Postcodes: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan.  Spokespersons have ten minutes and all other Senators have seven minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to be here for statements on what I believe to be a very important part of the modern infrastructure needed in our country.  This proposal for a postcode goes back to the working group on postcodes which published a proposal in 2005.  It recommended the introduction of postcodes on the basis that we needed an efficient system for our postal sector that would improve national competitiveness and assist in the provision of public and private sector services.</P>
        <P>A second report was carried out in July 2006 by the National Postcode Project Board which again recommended the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland, one that would deal with the cost and benefits and implications of the postal code.  The board, which comprised representatives of the Government and public and private sector organisations, identified many postal and non-postal benefits of introducing codes.  A third report carried out by external consultants was commissioned on foot of a Government decision to do further analysis and quantify the wider benefits of the postal system.</P><Col N="358"/>
        <P>The National Postcode Project Board recommended an alpha-numeric, publicly available and accessible postcode model.  The country would be divided into approximately 200 post towns.  Within each post town there would be groups of approximately 40 to 50 properties.  The postcode would have the structure ABC 123 in its numeric code, the first three characters representing the post town, the second three representing the group of properties in which the particular building is located.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The benefits of a postcode lie in a number of sectors.  First, it will be of significant benefit in the delivery of postal services and it would be expected that we should look for such benefits.  Ireland is the only country in the European Union which does not have a postcode.  Although I believe An Post has done some very good work recently in improving the efficiency and quality of service delivery, we will be able to see further efficiency gains and improvements in the quality of the postal service through the application of this postcode model.</P>
        <P>People may be concerned that the application of the postal address code would have particular implications for people in their addresses.  I do not believe it will.  The type of postcode we propose will allow for existing Dublin postal district codes to be incorporated within the new postcode.  There has been much correspondence with regard to Irish language issues but there is nothing to prevent a person from using a form of address in either of the official languages of the State, as we develop the postal code.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I see it, therefore, as of really significant benefit for the postal service and the provision of a postal service which, because of evolving European Union directives in this regard, involves not only An Post but a range of different operators.  It will be of equal benefit to all operators working in the area.  More crucially, I see postcodes having wider benefit.  It is the provision of a facility by which, as well as providing a postal code, we will be able to devise a locational code for the country.  Real and evolving benefits will emerge in the management of spatial data and emergency services in this country and the development or provision of a range of infrastructural services.  For example, if one were sending a driver to repair a particular lamp in a postal area, or if there were a breakdown in a particular electricity network or in any of the evolving infrastructural networks, having a common locational code of which everybody is aware that can be used to direct people to a particular point in the country, will provide real benefit from the postcode system we are developing.</P>
        <P>One of the tasks we have undertaken is to consider what are the monetised benefits.  Reports indicate we can expect approximately &euro;22 million in benefit to the economy.  An example of where that will come from, in Government business alone, is in the likes of service providers such as the Revenue Commissioners.  Obviously, they have a very large postal requirement and must send cheques and demands.  In that business, the benefit to them of the application of a postcode system is &euro;3.6 million per annum, given the reduction in misdirected mailing and the proven efficiency in sending distributed mail.</P>
        <P>There is a cost.  We estimate the initial cost involved in establishing the system and implementing it could be approximately &euro;15 million.  The ongoing annual maintenance cost might be approximately &euro;2.5 million, which will be met by the revenues generated by the postcode manager charging for the value-added products and services that the system will deliver.  This is a crucial investment as part of our wider digital Internet economy, where people will increasingly access products and services through the Internet and will need a speedy, clear and simple system of locating the delivery of such services.  This offers our postal system considerable opportunities, particularly An Post&rsquo;s distribution system.  The local post office can be turned into one&rsquo;s local department store and access, notably for people in rural communities, can be <Col N="359"/>improved through this new Internet shopping technology.  The postcode is a crucial component in making the system work.</P>
        <P>I commend the proposal to the House.  My Department is working with An Post and various other private and public parties to set out the best way of tendering for the provision of this postcode service.  Completing the task and introducing the system will take us a number of months.  It has taken a long time and this is not an example of Government working at its fastest or most effective.  Since the starting date of almost four or five years ago, however, we have stepped up and the Government has made a commitment via its decision to introduce the postcode.  This will be of widespread benefit to people working in the postal sector, consumers requiring postal services and the development of new location code services that can help us to run the country more efficiently and effectively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhat, a Aire.  My party fully agrees with the introduction of a new postcode system.  We believe it should be done as a necessary part of a modern economy and as cost efficiently as possible.  It would speed up the post&rsquo;s delivery and increase efficiency.  At this stage, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the tangible improvements achieved by An Post in recent years in its delivery of the postal services.  An Post is constantly working on increasing the speed of its delivery.</P>
        <P>In the interests of greater efficiency and speed, we support the introduction of a postal code system, which forms part of a modern economy and is of extraordinary importance in the context of opening the postal services to international competition during the coming years.  It is important that competitors and An Post have a new system that improves efficiency, provides necessary information and a good service delivery and increases the service&rsquo;s use.</P>
        <P>We have a difficulty with the Government&rsquo;s position in that we believe a GPS system should be used to pinpoint addresses rather than the proposed numbers system, which will be less efficient and more cumbersome.  PON codes were designed by GPS Ireland Consultants to allow road users, particularly those in the logistics and service industries, to get better and more efficient use out of their SatNavs.  PON codes help to resolve the ambiguity of Ireland&rsquo;s property addressing system, which causes even locals confusion.  They can also be used by postal services and any service that involves navigating to somewhere at any time of the day or night.</P>
        <P>They are position orientated navigation codes, PONC, meaning a dot or point.  It is a seven-character alphanumeric code that defines a geographic position to within plus or minus 600 centimetres of the equivalent latitudinal and longitudinal Irish grid co-ordinates for the same location.  As a pinpoint, it is extraordinarily accurate and easy to use.  PON codes are easier to remember and work with than latitudes and longitudes on grids and, therefore, can be widely used and accepted as a postal code-type system.  The code&rsquo;s structure is simple to understand.  For this reason, we recommend it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are more than 500,000 GPS users in Ireland, 60% of whom are SatNav users.  It is conservatively predicted that there will be more than 1 million SatNav users in Ireland by the end of 2010.  They already share positional information widely for tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, accommodation, sports events, petrol stations, personal addresses and business customer locations.  These are widely distributed by e-mail or telephone or over the Internet in written reports.</P>
        <P>The easiest way to define location is by means of co-ordinates, which SatNav manufacturers already inherently support.  However, geographic co-ordinates in their natural form are cumbersome to handle and easily misunderstood or misinterpreted.  They also have too many characters and cannot be easily memorised.  While geographic co-ordinates are desirable, they must <Col N="360"/>be modified to make them user friendly.  PON codes are user friendly and can be memorised more easily and our party recommends them to the Government for an alternative delivery system.</P>
        <P>PON codes could be of use to people who are trying to seek out addresses, including those involved in the courier trade, food and flower delivery services, mail documentation collection and delivery services, which are what we are discussing, construction vehicles, car hire businesses, shop deliveries, mail orders and, more importantly, the emergency services, those being the fire service, ambulances, doctors, police, Civil Defence, Order of Malta etc.  The list of services that could be more readily developed with this system is large.</P>
        <P>The codes&rsquo; unique feature is that, unlike traditional postcode systems, they do not need to be allocated by someone on high.  One can create one&rsquo;s own.  It adds significant value to data and is a more efficient operating system.  It would be more accurate and cost effective in the delivery of the postal services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A GPS system is the modification to the postal system that we in the Fine Gael Party are proposing.  We fully accept the principle of a postal code system that is in the interests of competition, the efficient delivery of the postal service and a modern economy.  It is worthy of note that this is one of the last countries to adopt a postcode system.  It is necessary that we do so.  When speaking in general on this proposal it is worthy of mention that we want to preserve the social dimension, particularly in a new competitive environment and in a new evolved postal system open to international competition and other domestic competition.  We want to preserve the social dimension or the social factor of this element of the postal delivery system.  There should be no dearth of service to isolated places and no dearth of service to people who live in isolation and in locations which are difficult to access.  We want to ensure that in the interests of profit and greed there would not be an unequally balanced postal delivery system in this country.  It is incumbent on Government to ensure that as competition comes into the postal services and the postal delivery market the delivery of services is maintained on a similar basis in order that the constitutional rights of every citizen are preserved.  If this involves positive discrimination in financial terms to An Post in order for it to deliver that service &mdash; to maintain its social mandate &mdash; then this must be the case.  An Post must remain obliged and enabled to deliver post to all areas of the country.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports the introduction of a postal code system; therefore, there is no disagreement on this matter.  We believe the number system, the concept of Dublin 2, area one, two, three, is not the best system to use because it is not the most efficient system nor in the long term the best system in a modern context.  We propose the GPS system as an alternative.  We do not argue the principle or the policy position because this policy position has been advocated by Fine Gael for some time but we argue the methodology, the delivery of it.  We do not regard this proposal as being the best way to go about it.</P>
        <P>I recommend a rethink in this area.  The system can be achieved at no greater cost and with ultimately greater efficiency and providing a better service for the people.  I make the general observation in the style of a Second Stage discussion that the social dimension or the social service dimension of our postal services should not be lost in any new competitive environment or in any new configuration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to declare that I am a former employee of An Post and I was involved in the CWU having been on the executive of that union.</P>
        <P>I am not too quick to say I welcome this proposal as I have many reservations about it.  The Minister referred to an efficient system and many believed this was the reason for the introduc<Col N="361"/>tion of postal codes.  However, many other issues are associated with this proposal and which are of concern to me.</P>
        <P>The postal service is very efficient and it has improved greatly in the past few years.  I do not fear change but some points need to be considered.  For example, I refer to Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  Liberalisation and competition are to be commended.  However, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly stated, it creates a situation whereby in a liberalised market, greedy people only want to make money and amass personal wealth, and the customer comes last.  What happened in Telecom &Eacute;ireann is a good example.  Prior to the liberalisation and privatisation of the service, we had one of the best telecommunications systems in the world.  We were second only to France but now we are on a par with a Third World country and the public have a worse service.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated it would be of significant benefit to the customer.  I ask him to elaborate on that statement and spell out where the benefits would be.  This proposal should not be rushed.  I recommend a consultation process with the management and trade unions of An Post and some type of consultation with the public.  A change in the postal code system could alienate the public.  In previous years I dealt with members of the public who claimed that the use of a certain postal code would devalue their property.  We must be conscious of such concerns.</P>
        <P>The cost of designing this postal code system is estimated to be in the region of &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million.  This claim should be subject to scrutiny, given that the previous Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources suggested the cost of introducing the same system would be in the region of &euro;50 million with an annual maintenance cost of &euro;3 million approximately.  The Minister&rsquo;s latest announcement on postal codes does not clarify what the maintenance cost of this system might be.  This is a considerable sum of money at a time when other services are not being provided.  As a result there would be a public outcry if this proposal was introduced and this must be taken into account.</P>
        <P>Costs are associated with the introduction of postal codes.  For example, every company, including semi-State companies, will be required to update their address database, in addition to rebranding, marketing and stationary costs.  There could be a question of compensation payments arising.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the postal codes represents a significant cost to An Post as the existing sorting technology would have to be completely changed to deal with the codes.  An Post has made significant investment in cutting-edge technology to ensure the national postal code service is run as efficiently as possible.  Tampering with this system will not only involve costs but will ultimately lead to a potential temporary deterioration in the quality of service during the transition phase.  There would be an imposition of an additional cost factor on the national operator.  It is already preparing for liberalisation because there is no point raging against the inevitable.  It is no coincidence that the Minister&rsquo;s predicted time for the introduction of these post codes coincides with the deadline of January 2011 for the liberalisation of the reserved area in the Irish postal market.</P>
        <P>The Minister is on record as saying that the lack of a postal code system is a potential barrier to this liberalisation agenda.  However, he shows no evidence to support this view.  Throughout Europe the liberalisation of the postal market has led to a reduction in postal services and the loss of jobs in the postal market.  Members of this House and the other House frequently speak about securing and maintaining good, sustainable jobs such as those in An Post.  This proposal will do the opposite.  Given this potential threat to the Irish postal market in the context of the current consultation process and the third directive, one must question the appropriateness of introducing a new postal code system at this time.  An Post quality of service figures have been consistently improving year on year.  Therefore, it is important to be clear on how postal codes <Col N="362"/>will improve the system further.  This has not been explained sufficiently to my satisfaction.  I am not sufficiently informed to make any decision or vote one way or the other on this proposal.</P>
        <P>In the interests of clarity and transparency, to which we refer a good deal nowadays, it is important that the Minister makes public the two reports from PA Consulting which he has used to support the claims made on the benefits of postcodes.  In addition, the Minister should be called upon to release the reports produced by the postcode board.  The previous Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources arrived at a different set of figures altogether regarding the costs involved in such a project.  There is a conflict and we must have clarity and transparency in this regard.  Time and tax revenue is at an absolute premium.  It is vital in the interests of a healthy and public debate that these reports are made public such that all stakeholders and the public can consider who will benefit from the expenditure involved, especially given that approximately &euro;500,000 has been spent on these reports thus far.  The taxpayer has a right to examine these reports in the light of what has been proposed.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s suggestion that a postcode system will deal with Ireland&rsquo;s non-unique addresses is singular and serves only to create the perception that in rural Ireland the postal system requires a technological intervention to make it work.  In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.  The postal network is part and parcel of the fabric of rural Ireland.  Our postmen and women know their area and they are part and parcel of the fabric of rural society.  Everyone knows them and in some cases they bring news to those who live alone.  The postman may be the only person such people meet every day or week.  It is important to take this into account.</P>
        <P>I refer back to the case of Eircom.  In a liberalised market such contact would not occur as it is all about making money and it is nothing to do with providing a service for the customer.  In addition, in any system which identifies individual private dwellings or small groups of private dwellings, especially in a sparsely populated area, serious data protection issues arise.  The data from postcodes could be potentially used by insurance companies to target sections of the population in different ways.  For example, they could charge higher premiums for car, home and health insurance based on location.  The introduction of a postcode would lead to a great expansion of junk mail.  The average number of marketing deliveries in Ireland is significantly below the UK average, which is approximately 1,000 per day.  The environmental impact of such marketing should be considered in the context of the value it adds.</P>
        <P>We discuss jobs all the time.  There is no doubt if there were a liberalised market here good, sustainable jobs would be lost.  We must also take into account what takes place in a liberalised market.  Senator Reilly referred to the tendering processes that take place.  As part of the tendering process, firms cherry-pick and seek the best routes.  This takes place in other countries in the area of transport.  In a tendering process one should be obliged to take two or three non-profitable routes in addition to the lucrative routes.  That is for further down the road and I do not wish to pre-empt the matter or suggest that this would proceed so quickly.  We should not rush this matter for the reasons outlined as we may be back here in some years arguing that we should not have done this.  We could end up with a situation similar to that of Eircom.  I cite that example because I worked there and I am conscious of the service which the public receives now, which is zilch.  One cannot get a phone fixed or installed in parts of Dublin for up to six months.  One cannot get broadband.  We have the worst telecommunications system in Europe.  People cannot operate business because of the state of broadband availability.  Such people contact me every day and inform me the service breaks down and cannot be fixed for six months.  I call on the Minister to address the points I have raised and clarify them for me because I am not sufficiently informed to deal with it as matters stand.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="363"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The comedian Dara &Oacute; Briain has a routine in which he lauds the efficiency of the Irish postal service, claiming any letter from Britain will reach its destination here if it has the name of the person and &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; written after it.  It would be good if that were the case and Senator Brady has made a strong case for the efficiencies in our current system.  However, the fact is postcodes make a postal system more efficient and they do so in a cost efficient way.  Some 117 of the 190 member countries of the Universal Postal Union have postcodes.  It is right that Ireland, in common with all our European neighbours, should adopt such a system.  There are concerns as to how such a system could be implemented and subsequently used and Senator Brady has highlighted several of these.  However, these concerns can be overcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are concerns regarding the possibility of including an Irish component, similar to the vehicle registration system.  Since any system would be technologically or digitally read I do not believe the idea of a dual track system is likely to fly.  I am encouraged by the view within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that it may be possible for Gaeltacht areas to have a specified code that would reflect the language ethos of such areas at least.</P>
        <P>The efficiencies of a system of postal codes would extend not only to the better delivery of letters, parcels and other post.  There are also benefits to having a system in terms of how we organise other means of communication with our citizenry.  Let us consider a Member of the Oireachtas who engages in mass mailing using the Oireachtas database of their given local authority.  The number of letters which return because of the wrong address often reaches hundreds.  There is no more telling argument of the need for a postcode system.</P>
        <P>Our electoral register is very much out of date and does not reflect accurately the people living in the houses in which they are recorded as living.  A postal code system allied to a regularly updated electoral register would benefit from a new postal code system.  Such an alphanumeric system could identify houses within a grouping of 12 and in rural areas specified households could be identified.</P>
        <P>Some people have a difficulty with the elements of the current address system that may be lost with the introduction of postal codes.  I am satisfied that the view of the Minister and the Department, to the effect that a new system would involve simply the addition of one line on each existing address, would hold true.  People identify with communities, parishes and townlands and these will remain part of addresses.  It is not only in rural communities that people identify strongly with townland names.  I come from an urban community approximately one mile from Cork city centre.  When I married, I moved to a house approximately a ten minute walk on the other side of the parish church, where the people insist they do not live in Turner&rsquo;s Cross.  However, I still put &ldquo;Turner&rsquo;s Cross&rdquo; on my address.  That people hold such identification to placenames will not change with the introduction of an alphanumeric code.  This is about efficiency and having an address system that matches the technology and allows mail to be delivered quickly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the point made regarding whether this system could fit into a single provider system or a system of postal delivery in which there are already private sector interests.  That is another debate.  Whether there is a single provider system or a competitive postal service one still needs a postal code system.  It is probably a prerequisite to have such a system.  These are the matters we should debate to bring about the system.</P>
        <P>There is a cost to introducing a new system.  We live in a fiscal environment in which spending anything additional on anything new must be examined carefully.  However, in spending this money there will be efficiencies and economies for An Post, whatever the environment in which it will work in future.  We will save that expenditure and more in future.  The Minister <Col N="364"/>should be commended for proposing such innovation and encouraged by the House and all within the political system to ensure a system can be introduced in the quickest possible time.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am at variance with some of the comments made earlier on the Order of Business to the effect that this is so unimportant that it should not be debated in the Chamber.  There are implications and ramifications.  It does not reflect well on the people who have been putting forward various arguments for Seanad reform, however, to see the Opposition seats vacant for a debate on a topic which needs their attention.  If anything illustrates the importance of greater scrutiny in all aspects of public services, it must be the manner in which some of our important State agencies, such as the Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Central Bank, were found to be deficient in the run-up to the severe economic downturn we are experiencing.  It is only through the input and commitment of people in public life who scrutinise policies as they evolve in all public service sectors, that we can ultimately have the services to which we aspire.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Postcodes have been on the agenda for a considerable time.  They have been discussed and, as often as not, dispelled because it was felt that the cost benefit was not justified.  I listened with interest to my colleague, Senator Martin Brady, speak on this issue.  He has a particular knowledge of the area in that he worked with that company and has an insight into it.  I concur in so far as he says that we should maintain good quality jobs in public services.  I am a proponent of doing so.  The only caveat is that the efficiency and cost effectiveness of those operations would be a measure of the commitment we have to them.  We should not therefore be afraid to have efficiencies within those services.  There has been a significant change in the manner in which we undertake communications.  The advent of new technology, including e-mails and other forms of electronic communication, means there is less reliance on the postal service.  As a consequence we have seen a decline in mail volumes.  It is imperative that those businesses respond commensurately to the challenges, which often means embracing new technology, change, efficiency and cost effectiveness.  An Post has been applying itself to achieving all those things in recent years.  The company will be faced with more acute challenges when the liberalisation of postal services arises from the directive to be implemented on 1 January 2011.  Public services generally are faced with such challenges due to the propensity of policy in Brussels to ensure greater competition.  Businesses benefit from open markets, rather than suffering as a result of them.  It is only if one is inefficient and does not respond to change that one ends up being caught by the open nature of competition.  Competition is the lifeblood of business and, in fact, strengthens the value and quality of services provided.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note, as the Minister stated, that Ireland is the only country in the European Union without such postcodes in place.  There is widespread public support for the introduction of a postcode system, which must match the technology that is evolving, as well as meeting the needs of liberalisation.  It will have benefits, some of which may be difficult to quantify at this stage.  They may well be outside the public sector, particularly in linking databases with the Government&rsquo;s various spatial elements.</P>
        <P>We are considering using the first three letters of 200 towns in the proposed postcodes.  When we introduced the new registration plates for motor vehicles, it was a pity we did not make use of the Irish names of counties, rather than English names.  That could have been done.  It was talked about at the time, but for some reason we went with the English names.  We spend a lot of money on preserving and promoting the Irish language, which I fully support.  It is our heritage and part of what we are.  We have inherited the benefits of the sacrifice of previous generations, but if we do not value our heritage we can hardly expect anybody else to do so.  I <Col N="365"/>ask the Minister therefore to consider using Gaeilge when deciding that aspect of the proposed postcodes.</P>
        <P>I am a strong proponent of fiscal rectitude, greater cost effectiveness and efficiency across the public service, which makes people proud of being part of organisations that illustrate and display those criteria and qualities.  It is estimated that the benefits to various Departments could amount to &euro;22 million in the medium term, which is a significant saving.  I note the initial cost will be &euro;15 million, but the information to date shows there is a cost benefit involved.  Past arguments opposing the introduction of postcodes were that they did not pass the cost-benefit analysis test and therefore the cost of introducing them did not justify the savings that might be made.  As this matter is considered further, hopefully we will get more evidential support for that case.  The Minister is right in moving in this direction.  I welcome and support his proposal.  While some interesting comments have been made, there are also reservations which should be taken into consideration before the postcodes are finally implemented early in 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on postcodes.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who was here earlier, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  I would have liked the Minister to outline how this system would work in practice.  Senator Boyle outlined how he thinks it would work, whereby a number of houses could be grouped together.  I presume, however, that the new postcodes arrangement would not do away with the use of county addresses.  I hope we will still have a county identity, although we would also have numbers.  The counties that are dear to our hearts should not disappear from postal addresses.</P>
        <P>I like Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s idea about using the GPS system, which is probably the way forward for postcodes.  Postcodes have been on the agenda for a long time.  I hope we can include the GPS system before the new system is brought to fruition.  No matter where one is in the world, one can use a GPS system in a car or briefcase to reach one&rsquo;s exact destination.  The GPS system would be a revelation.  The potential problem for the use of GPS is townlands in some areas appear in Irish on maps and in English elsewhere and <i>vice versa</i> and, in some cases, the system might not recognise the location and one could find oneself in a different part of the country if one took full heed of the directions.  However, in London and cities on the Continent where the GPS system used by drivers is based on postcodes, it is absolutely marvellous.  The Minister stated the introduction of postcodes would lead to a more efficient society, business sector, communications system and postal service.  The GPS system would be revolutionary in this regard, particularly where there is a turnover of staff in a post office and the new postman is not familiar with the area or for courier operators who make deliveries throughout the country.  They would not have make inquiries on the side of the road about where a person or a firm was located.</P>
        <P>It is most difficult to establish where one is on industrial estates throughout the State and particularly in Dublin.  It is almost an impossibility in some cases and while a small signpost on a pavement or map on a noticeboard at the front of the industrial estate sometimes gives the location of various companies, it is still a nightmare to find them.  The use of postcodes in a GPS system would be revelatory, particularly for couriers because they find it most difficult and frustrating to reach their delivery address.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined his proposal in detail and it is welcome.  The set-up cost will be &euro;15 million and the ongoing maintenance cost is estimated at &euro;2.5 million annually.  Since such investment is taking place, how much more would it cost to put the navigational system proposed by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly in place or to couple it what the introduction of postcodes?  It would be beneficial for the emergency services.  It is critical that the staff of the ambulance service, the fire service and the Garda should arrive at a destination on time to carry out their duties. <Col N="366"/> On the Continent, if an ambulance does not arrive at an address within 15 minutes to collect  a patient, an investigation is carried out whereas it is difficult sometimes for ambulance crews in Ireland to find an address.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s proposal deserves examination and it is credible, particularly as it may not cost much more on top of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal, which is welcome.  I appeal to him, in light of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s contribution, to seriously examine our proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the introduction of postcodes, as proposed by the Minister.  This is long overdue and the cost involved is not prohibitive.  From a security perspective, it is important that items of significant value which are sent in the post reach their destination and people can be assured of the security that their letter will be delivered to the right destination.</P>
        <P>The proposal to incorporate postcodes into a GPS navigation system should be examined and the Minister has displayed an interest in such technology in the past.  I am sure he will take on board the suggestions of Opposition Members, particularly those enunciated by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.  When one uses the Internet to purchase goods, one is generally asked for one&rsquo;s postcode.  Ireland is one of very few countries that does not use postcodes.  Even from the point of view of bringing us in line with our European peers, this action should be applauded.</P>
        <P>When will the postcodes be fully operational?  Will they be introduced on a county-by-county or piecemeal basis or will a system be introduced nationwide on a specified date?  They should be introduced on the same day throughout the State and I presume that is envisaged but I would like the Minister to elaborate on that.  I thank him for his contribution and I hope he will take on board the issues raised by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This was a useful and important debate.  I will take on board the concerns raised by Senators about the protection of county recognition, the requirement for An Post to be protected by not applying excessive costs and the need to deliver this system in a timely manner.  As I acknowledged in my opening contribution, it has been a long and slow process but one which we are prepared to complete.  I will introduce postcodes for the benefit of every citizen and the postal service and for the development of a range of other locational application devices used by a range of public service providers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the postcodes come into play?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The key task is to agree the data system, the mapping, the allocation of small clusters of between 20 and 40 houses into a particular code and the allocation of addresses to each house.  It takes time, however.  I want to do it by way of open tender because we want to see the level of input from the range of public and private sector bodies which might have an ability to do those tasks for us.  Whichever system we introduce, I want other companies to be able to use the basic infrastructure in a flexible way to ensure they devise new applications for the use of the code.  It will take us most of next year to manage that system and therefore I expect the code to be introduced towards the end of next year or early in 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow two questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his participation in the debate.  Many Members asked when this system will come in and so on.  I raised many questions also but the Minister may not get an opportunity to read the Official Report in that regard.  When will I get replies to those questions because they are important to me as a former trade union activist <Col N="367"/>and a former employee of An Post, with which I am proud to be associated?  I take it from the nod of the Minister&rsquo;s head that he will reply to my questions but I would not like to take this as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  People on the Opposition side are asking when this system will be brought in but we must have proper consultation before we plough ahead with any new system, and I want an assurance that will happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s position on the adoption of a GPS rather than the number system such as Dublin 2, area 111 or whatever?  Ultimately, the GPS is more beneficial in economic terms, in terms of the delivery of the emergency services, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Senator Brady&rsquo;s question, my officials and I will go through the various questions he raised in his contribution and reply to him directly on those.  There will be ongoing consultation.  There has been a good deal of consultation.  The original postcodes body investigating this had representation from a range of different interests and therefore as we progress, we will continue that strategy of talking to people.</P>
        <P>We should recognise that while this new system will involve a change in working practices in certain locations, it will be of benefit particularly to the workers in postal companies because it allows us to get a much more efficient and effective service.  In a time when we are starting to see postal services contract in terms of volumes, we need to turn that around and start developing new businesses and new business services.  The ability that postcodes deliver to create new business opportunities will create the economic and the employment opportunities for people in the postal sector.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question, in the examination that was done of a variety of different options, cognisance was taken of the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s views on this issue.  There was a concern that if we have a code which brings one right down to a specific readily identifiable address, data protection issues might arise.  We must manage and protect people&rsquo;s freedom from intrusive mail or inappropriate identification systems that could arise in a postal service with specifics such as XY co-ordinates which give a location down to a specific house.</P>
        <P>The benefit of the postal code system being developed, as I understand it, is that the simple, alphanumeric, six-digit number will give one a postal code down to ten or 20 houses, depending on whether it is a country or an urban area, but there will be sufficient additional fields within the data system established to work such a code that an additional digit can give one much more specific locational details.  That will allow one apply that locational code in a similar way to the advantages one would get from a GPS XY co-ordinate code.  The code we are devising has the dual benefits of a postal code which does not infringe in a public way on people&rsquo;s right to privacy but which can be developed further to have those locational code characteristics that one gets off a GPS.  That is the reason I am supportive of it because I believe it does both tasks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply and thank him.  Is there not a risk of junk mail with every system?  Is that not something people will have to be given the option of preventing?  Is there not that risk already?  Does the Minister believe the GPS would be a more accurate way of pinpointing locations for the emergency services?  I appreciate the comprehensive nature of the earlier reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right in that one of the possible outcomes from having such a postcode system, and this goes back to what I said about the economic and employment opportunities available, is that there may be a greater facility for direct mail services on the back of a postal code system.  That is the reason we must be careful.  While we appreciate that may have certain benefits and advantages, it is not something we want to pursue without <Col N="368"/>providing householders with the ability to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to it and not be a recipient of such extensive additional mail.</P>
        <P>The mailing system is changing.  In quantity terms it is moving away from the typical social communication network that was the case previously.  We do not write letters to each other in this modern world.  We text, tweet or e-mail, but there is an increasing reliance on the mail for many business services and even public services through direct communication.  Direct mail advertising might be unnecessary but it also provides a valuable function for many companies here.</P>
        <P>As to whether GPS would be more accurate, that is possibly the case but the information I have is that using the data systems we will look to use for the provision of a postcode will allow us provide a location code that will identify a location down to the nearest square metre or few square metres.  That will allow an ambulance driver on an emergency call identify a piece of infrastructure or a roadway that will help them get to a specific location.  Subject to the approval of the Data Protection Commissioner, this code can be evolved in a way that provides that level of accuracy for the ambulance service and other infrastructural services while not infringing people&rsquo;s right to privacy.  I am told it is possible for us to do that in a way that is just as effective as GPS.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said changes in work practices could occur as a result of this measure.  That is an important issue because if there are to be changes in work practices, that is all the more reason there should be consultation with the people involved prior to doing anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the main changes in work practices is that if one is on the Internet and looks to get something addressed to oneself, we are changing the address we give and that will lead to a much more efficient system and may lead to a significant increase in mail business, parcel business and a range of other new services which will create economic and employment opportunities.  If there is any outcome from this, it is safeguarding jobs, especially in the postal service, and creating new economic opportunities, particularly in rural post offices which need footfall and need to again become the centre of the community for them to survive and thrive.  That is one of the biggest implications in work terms I see coming out of the development of a postcode.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Minister&rsquo;s view but the union, which represents the workers, will have its view and it is entitled to examine it.</P>

    <Title>National Marine Mapping Programme: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the Government&rsquo;s continued support of the national marine mapping programme, INFOMAR, on the tenth anniversary of its initiation as the Irish National Seabed Survey;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the findings of the independent economic study which has shown that the benefits of the work being undertaken are estimated at &euro;275 million across a range of sectors;</P><Col N="369"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the valuable work that has been carried out in the mapping of over 82% of the currently designated Irish marine territory to date;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the policy of carrying out this vital infrastructural work which is underpinning key and economically significant offshore development in renewable energy, environmental protection, detection of our shipwreck heritage, improvement of fishing efficiency and safety of maritime transport.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am not my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on the marine and must declare that my only interest in the sector stems from the fact that I live on the Foyle.  There is a large fishing cohort in the area in which I live.  Therefore, I welcome anything which considers how to put in place best practice in order that those involved in the fishing industry and other marine activities might achieve the best results.</P>
        <P>I extend my sympathies to the families of the many Irish people, both young and old, who have been lost at sea.  In recent times a young man from the area in which I live fell off a fishing vessel off the Orkney Islands and the fact that his body has not yet been found is adding to the distress experienced by his family.  People in County Donegal are, however, no strangers obliged to cope with marine tragedies of this nature.  I commend those who are at sea trying to provide for their families, either by fishing or working as rescue operators.  They do tremendous work and are sometimes not recognised for it.  If we mapped their activities, everyone would be extremely impressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I asked the Department to provide me with a specific figure to show how the national marine mapping programme, INFOMAR, would benefit County Donegal.  The estimated value of the project to the fishing industry in the next 16 years is &euro;95 million.  The overall benefit to the country of INFOMAR will be of the order of &euro;275 million.</P>
        <P>I accept that the intention is to improve the efficiency of the fishing industry by using the data and maps produced in order to target the best areas for fishing.  This will lead to a reduction in the use of fuel, etc., and an improvement in fishing stocks.  Some might state fishermen would have been in possession of this information in the first instance and that matters should have been discussed with them.  However, while they are good at what they do, some fishermen have at times fished juvenile stocks or entered areas into which they should not have gone.  As a result, certain stocks have depleted.</P>
        <P>I recently read an article which emanated from the UK Parliament and which relates to cod stocks.  It states the lifespan of a cod is 16 years but that cod are being caught at seven or eight years of age.  Global warming is giving rise to changes in stocks of plankton and other creatures which fish eat.  If species of fish have 16 years in which to adapt to such changes and develop accordingly, that is one thing.  However, if fish are caught at a younger age, the implication is that the overall species will not be able to adapt to changes in climate, environment and the nature of the creatures on which they feed.  I do not claim to be an expert on this matter but if fish are caught too young, then the species in general will not be able to evolve to cope with environmental changes.</P>
        <P>I am glad the work being done is supported by that carried out at Georges Bank, Canada.  The latter is already yielding results for local Canadian fishermen, which is an important aspect of this entire matter.</P>
        <P>The data gathered by INFOMAR are being used to update charts and improve safety.  When young people do not return from the sea, the issue of safety becomes extremely important.  During the past decade there have been major improvements in safety.  For example, the whitefish fleet was renewed and refurbished.  I recall occasions when I complained about the fact that many of the boats in that fleet were 30 years or more old, that they were dangerous to <Col N="370"/>work on and that their crews were being obliged to sail further afield in order to ensure they caught any fish.  However, the fleet was eventually renewed and people will now state County Donegal obtained 16 of the new boats in the fleet and that most of these have either been sold or are up for sale because their captains are not able to catch enough fish to allow them to make the money necessary to meet their repayments.</P>
        <P>The activities of INFOMAR are extremely important to my constituents.  Even though it has reached its tenth anniversary, however, I am of the view that fishermen should be asked to give of their knowledge in order that this might inform the work of INFOMAR.  The Mulroy Bay chart was updated &mdash; using INFOMAR data &mdash; when issues were raised about the approaches and access to the valuable aquaculture sites there.  The fact that people can have an input is extremely important.</P>
        <P>INFOMAR has mapped the entire offshore area of County Donegal beyond a depth of 20 m.  Shallower waters such as those of the Foyle, Donegal Bay and Mulroy Bay have also been mapped as part of a number of LiDAR surveys carried out.  I received some briefing material from the Department on why these surveys were being carried out.  One of the reasons provided relates to sovereignty, the Continental Shelf, the international law of the sea, etc.  I wish to refer to a matter, in respect of which there was a fudge when the British-Irish Agreement was concluded.  Under the Agreement, Foyle Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission was to have responsibility for salmon fishing on the Foyle.  However, it had already held this responsibility since the early 1950s.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the area has already been mapped.  Knowing that this debate was due to be held, I submitted questions to the Department over a number of days on the sovereignty of the bed of the Foyle.  However, I have still not received any answers.  I accept that I am stirring up the sand and that someone somewhere will be hoping I do not say too much more.  The Crown Estate claimed ownership of the bed of the Foyle until I challenged it.  When I did so, the Crown Estate stated it would make no such claim until the two Governments had made a statement on the jurisdictional matter.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the importance of mapping.  The plan for the mapping carried out by INFOMAR is to consider how to co-ordinate activity, identify the location of good aquaculture resources, where there is potential for wind energy generation, where there is good marine leisure potential, etc.  These are all things that we want.  What I want is one body to oversee the planning and development relating to the major resource that is the Foyle and all of its tributaries.  The people of the north west deserve to benefit from the economic advantage that can be gained from the marine leisure, angling, commercial and shipping activities that can be carried out on the Foyle.</P>
        <P>At present, one body is responsible, on a cross-Border basis, for controlling salmon fishing on the Foyle and will soon have responsibility for dealing with matters relating to aquaculture.  Why are we negotiating with the Crown Estate, given that it has told me it has no claim on the Foyle until the two Governments have sorted out the jurisdictional issue?  In recent months I have worked closely with a number of politicians and non-politicians who have interests both in the Foyle and its tributaries and further afield.  While attending the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly this weekend, I spoke to people from all backgrounds and thus far, no one has told me it is not a good idea.  Moreover, under the St. Andrews Agreement, an evaluation of the processes and bodies is in place.  I note my suggestion has been pooh-poohed by people from some Departments on our side who have stated it is an impossibility.  However, my point is that it is not an impossibility for anyone else to whom I have spoken.  My suggestion is that the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission should be expanded, broadened and rejigged to embrace all activity on the Foyle to achieve what this mapping project seeks, namely, a <Col N="371"/>single overall plan.  While I have taken a single example that could be spread right around the country, this point is quite specific and pertinent.  We need an overall plan and a single body which in this context must be a cross-Border body such as the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission to implement the plan without third party interference or subsequent third party claims from the honourable Irish society, the Crown Estate, the duke of this or that.  There is a serious problem when some people can tell anglers who have been fishing for many decades and whose groups have a membership of 500 that they can have two rods.</P>
        <P>We have local knowledge that might be part of what will be thrown up by the mapping but we cannot develop the potential of this mapping study until such time as there is real engagement on who delivers on the results.  How should it be blended together?  There are pluses and minuses associated with the existing departmental responsibilities for the marine sector.  It is disadvantageous to have seven Ministers or Ministers of State with responsibility for the marine.  One could argue that this is advantageous because people such as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, as well as his ministerial colleague, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry all have roles to play in this regard.  While this means everyone is feeding into the process, I have been in politics for long enough to know that &ldquo;feeding in&rdquo; means that if one does not have responsibility for an issue, it will be at the end of one&rsquo;s list of priorities.  Nevertheless, I accept that a subgroup under the Taoiseach has been established to deliver greater co-ordination in respect of the marine.</P>
        <P>Ireland is an island surrounded by a valuable resource.  It is of tremendous importance both to map what is there and that the Government should take our marine potential seriously.  We should have training colleges nationwide to prepare for careers to do with the sea.  We should support the marine tourism industry, which is not the case at present, as it constitutes an untapped resource.  I am unsure how long INFOMAR intends to take to finalise the project, as it has done quite a lot of work already.  However, by the time of its 15th anniversary, work on the next stage should be well under way, namely, the co-ordination of who is responsible for delivering on all the information it has collated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and will speak later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will restate the first paragraph of the motion which &ldquo;commends the Government&rsquo;s continued support of the national marine mapping programme, INFOMAR, on the tenth anniversary of its initiation as the Irish National Seabed Survey&rdquo;.  It is worth mentioning that Ireland now has the biggest marine territory of any country in the European Union.  As a result, we need to explore or map these territories for the long-term benefit of Ireland.  The national marine mapping programme, INFOMAR, is a joint venture between the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Marine Institute and the successor of the Irish national seabed survey.  Covering approximately 125,000 sq. km of Ireland&rsquo;s most productive and commercially valuable inshore waters, INFOMAR will produce integrated mapping products covering the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed.  The mapping exercise has been long-running and is a necessary responsibility for a large marine territory.</P>
        <P>The motion is relatively uncontentious and it could be argued that a motion in support of INFOMAR&rsquo;s activities is somewhat akin to supporting home-made bread and apple pie.  It is not contentious as all Members are in favour of the mapping project.  I commend the view expressed by Senator Keaveney that what really is at issue is the use of the outputs from the mapping programme.  It could be argued in the context of an earlier debate on the Order of Business today that Members should be in the Chamber tonight to discuss the number of people in Ireland who are unable to pay their mortgages or the small businesses which cannot access finance or the plight of those many homes with unemployed young graduates.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="372"/>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer lies in the marine sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Such issues should be Members&rsquo; real subject of discussion, given that no Member is against this motion or opposes the mapping of our marine territory.  While I will leave that point, it merited being made.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the motion in a general sense.  The main advantages of the mapping project relate in the first instance to the development of offshore energy projects as mapping is key to identifying suitable sites and cable routes for wind, wave and tidal generators.  That constitutes one good byproduct of the mapping project, while another pertains to safer offshore navigation.  Moreover, it will support work being carried out under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, whereby Ireland has been successful in extended continental shelf submissions, to which Senator Keaveney alluded.  Use of the data also includes the simulation of tides which is useful for aquaculture and coastal protection engineers, as well a production of maps on the nature of the seabed, whether mud, sand, rock or gravel, which is used both for environment protection and more efficient fishing practices.  Similarly, the data can be used to provide updates for the national shipwrecks database maintained by the national monuments service which is used by sports fishermen and divers.  These constitute the essential, immediate and practical outputs or benefits from the mapping programme being commended.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The INFOMAR programme began in the summer of 2006 with surveys of valuable fishing and fish farming areas in Bantry Bay, Dunmanus Bay and fish spawning areas off the south-west coast.  The 2007 survey began in April of that year to extend coverage of the biologically sensitive area around the Dingle Peninsula and continued by mapping Galway Bay in July and Waterford Harbour in October.  The programme has been extending gradually in that fashion and continues to map areas around the country.  To date, its achievement has been the creation of a marine dataset to underpin present and future Irish economic, environmental, infrastructural and social policy decisions, as well as upgraded Irish marine surveying infrastructure and so on.</P>
        <P>It is important to make a general reference to the use of mapping data.  I am completely in favour of approving the continuation of the mapping process, recognising the achievements in that area to date and commending its future use and continuation.  A subject worthy of mention in the House is the manner in which these data will be used.  The one thing that comes through from all the analyses of our current economic situation and the international situation is the fact that fossil fuel resources are running out.  They will become more expensive in coming years.  Oil will become an increasingly expensive commodity.  Consequently, the development and use of wind and wave energy as green alternative energy resources to finite fossil fuel resources is very important.  We must develop both onshore and offshore wind energy.  The mapping process will be useful in that context for the siting of wind farms and the identification of satisfactory locations on the seabed.  Wave energy is being explored in Ireland and is worthy of continued exploration.  I understand continued progress is being made in this area, which is important.  The mapping data will be important for developing wave energy.</P>
        <P>The data will also be important when the new Common Fisheries Policy is negotiated in the European Union.  This is due to come up for review, as is the Common Agricultural Policy, and the data from the seabed surveys will be critical in advancing the Irish position.  We must try to redress the fact that we were lax in protecting our fishing interests in the past and correct it in the future.</P>
        <P>The development of wave and offshore wind energy, the development and protection of our fishing industry and the development of safe buffer zones to generate new fishing stocks all make this survey of vital interest.  For that reason my party will not oppose the motion.  We <Col N="373"/>only oppose it to the extent that we consider it almost facile that it is on the agenda.  However, it is on the agenda and we will support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the fact that we are debating the Government motion on the national mapping programme, INFOMAR, on the tenth anniversary of its initiation.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for his contribution.  I am glad he is not opposing the motion.  The motion is worth debating because many benefits accrue to this country from the sea and it is important to be aware of them.</P>
        <P>We should pay tribute to the people who manned the ships long ago and who did not have accurate maps even to navigate into ports.  They had to do so through visual assessment and had to be extra careful where sandbanks were prevalent.  They are to be commended.  Mapping has always been important in Ireland.  We recall the men who mapped our land as well as the sea.  This is an island nation and that work was most important.  I am very conscious of it because my great, great grandfather was a map maker.  He mapped the land, not the sea.  I therefore have an interest in this issue from that point of view.</P>
        <P>To be parochial, the mapping of my native County Mayo will be very important, especially in light of the gas find off Broadhaven Bay.  The Minister will be well aware of that as he has spent a great deal of time in the area in the recent past.  The find has caused much controversy but, please God, it will work out.  I compliment both the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on all their efforts in trying to bring a successful conclusion to the events taking place there.</P>
        <P>Westport is one of the best tourist towns in the country.  There are many marine enterprises there, including yachting, aquaculture and so forth.  The mapping programme will be of huge benefit to people there in planning other enterprises to create employment.  Employment is the main issue, especially at present, and the mapping programme will give them an incentive to carry out the works they plan.  As has been mentioned, wave energy will be important.  I believe the west coast of Ireland experiences stronger winds than any other part of the country, so it will be worthwhile to investigate that also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should consider the benefits of the mapping programme for the different sectors.  For fishing, the estimated present value of benefit is &euro;95.404 million, for aquaculture it is &euro;57.816 million, for biodiversity it is &euro;11.118 million, for renewable energy it is &euro;40.026 million and for energy exploration it is &euro;49.309 million.  That is only the commercial aspect.  One can see it is a huge benefit to the country and I compliment the Marine Institute on the programme and the people who are undertaking the work.  The total benefit across the sectors amounts to &euro;275 million.</P>
        <P>I support the motion and I am delighted it will not be opposed by the principal Opposition party.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.  Taca&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis an r&uacute;n seo.  Is annamh na laethanta seo a bhfeicimid &aacute;is&iacute;nteachta&iacute; Rialtais &aacute; mholadh toisc n&aacute;r chaith siad airgead am&uacute; ach a mhalairt, go ndearna siad infheist&iacute;ocht chiallmhar le hacmhainn&iacute; agus airgead poibl&iacute;.  Ar an &oacute;c&aacute;id seo, ta moladh tuillte.  Is l&eacute;ir go mbeidh an teacht ar ais &oacute;n infheist&iacute;ocht sa tionscnamh INFOMAR an-mhaith ar fad.  De r&eacute;ir staid&eacute;ir neamhsple&aacute;ch, t&aacute; luach &euro;275 milli&uacute;n curtha ar an leas a bhainfear as an tionscnamh seo ar fad.  Is iontach agus is dearfach an sc&eacute;al seo.</P>
        <P>It is good to see, for a change, a Government agency being praised for sensibly investing public money instead of being criticised for wasting it.  An independent study has valued the benefits of the State&rsquo;s marine mapping programme at &euro;275 million.  This is more than four <Col N="374"/>times what will be spent completing the programme, which is impressive.  This is one of the largest science projects ever undertaken in Ireland and an excellent example of co-operation between State bodies, given that it is jointly managed by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Marine Institute.  It represents a truly impressive return on investment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I strongly disagree with those who suggest this topic is unworthy of consideration in the House or irrelevant to the great issues that now face the nation.  Investment in innovation, research and development is fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to address the economic crisis we now face and, more importantly, to generate high quality jobs and provide employment opportunities for a new generation of graduates.  When I was in secondary school, I was told that Ireland had no natural resources.  The INFOMAR project kills that myth once and for all.</P>
        <P>While the focus of much political attention has been on NAMA and the banking crises, we must not lose sight of the fact that solving the banking crisis on its own will neither restore competitiveness nor create new opportunities for Irish business.  We must maintain the integrity of the banking system but all that will do is put us on the same level as countries whose banks did not go mad lending money to highly speculative ventures in a bubble economy.  To get ahead of our competitors we must do much more.  Recognising that it was only a myth that we do not have significant natural resources, it is right that we should focus on the fact that we have the best wind and wave potential of anywhere else on the planet and a wonderful climate for growing biomass.  The exploitation of these natural resources requires investment in research and development and in the people with the skills to undertake this research.  The establishment of the Marine Institute and the investment in the INFOMAR project together form a belated recognition of the importance of the sea to Ireland&rsquo;s future economic development.</P>
        <P>Ireland is an island nation but, sadly, since the foundation of the State, we have failed to be a maritime nation.  We have failed to develop our fishing industry properly despite having a 220 million acre marine resource on our doorstep.  We failed to take a strategic approach to the development of the offshore wind energy sector despite having companies in Ireland with the potential to generate more than 2,000 MW of energy from existing resources.  That amounts to 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s total energy requirement from green energy sources.  If we were to take a strategic approach to the development of our maritime energy resources, I have no doubt that Ireland could become a world leader.  According to the National Offshore Wind Energy Association of Ireland, we have the potential to become a centre of excellence in green energy deployment.  This opens up a new economic opportunity for our nation, the chance to become a world leader in research, development and demonstration in a technological field that will be central to world economic development in this century.  Shell has estimated the value of the renewable energy sector at $1 trillion in the next five years.  Ireland can become a leader in this industry in much the same way we have developed technologies for information technology and pharmaceuticals.  A centre of excellence in offshore wind technology, perhaps based in one of the third level institutions, would support employment in areas such as turbine design, foundation technology, energy storage, installation, servicing and training.</P>
        <P>By involving our third level institutions in the development of this and other renewable sectors we can ensure our economy remains to the forefront of what will be one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing industries in the 21st century.  What IT and pharmaceuticals were to Ireland&rsquo;s economic development in the past, renewable energy can be to our future.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I am pleased to note the Marine Institute is not resting on its laurels but has embarked on another groundbreaking initiative, namely, Smart Bay.  This is marine-based research and a test and demonstration platform that will encourage leading edge researchers and industry consortia to collaborate on important commercial and environmental research to develop new products <Col N="375"/>and services to tap into the global market for environmental technologies.  The objective is to advance opportunities associated with marine resource development and to enhance our ability to monitor and manage our marine resources.  As Dr. Barbara Fogarty of the Marine Institute recently pointed out, this initiative will leverage the existing base of foreign direct investment in Ireland and stimulate new opportunities for collaboration with small and medium enterprises, attract international Framework 7 research projects and funding and contribute to the positioning of Ireland as a major player in emerging markets for innovative and green technologies.  I have no doubt this project will generate an impressive rate of return for the taxpayer and, more important, attract international focus on Ireland&rsquo;s maritime research potential.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to support the motion.  In these dark and dismal days we need not just to knock public sector failures but also to praise public sector successes.  In particular, we need to recognise and celebrate the great work now being done by Ireland&rsquo;s research community.  Ireland now has top researchers contributing to discoveries in science, engineering and technology.  This was recently recognised by the European Union which provided &euro;5 million in funding to help fund talented Irish researchers carry out their research internationally as part of its INSPIRE scheme.  The programme allows Irish researchers the exciting opportunity to spend time at a top level research institution of their choice worldwide and then reintegrate back into Ireland, bringing with them the knowledge, skills and networks they have gained during this time abroad.  The scheme enhances international collaboration and allows Irish scientists and engineers to be to the fore in global research projects.</P>
        <P>I urge my colleagues to look at the list of INSPIRE fellows and the work which they are doing across a broad range of disciplines.  Some examples include Dr. Robert Lynch, who studied at the University of Limerick before spending time in Germany working on his postdoctoral research in electrochemistry.  Now he is off to the Institute of Physical Chemistry at the Polish Academy of Science, Warsaw, to find out how to cut the cost of producing electrodes for renewable energy devices.  Dr. Aisling Redmond has been working at the Royal College of Surgeons on breast cancer.  Of the 2,500 women diagnosed with breast cancer every year in Ireland, 30% to 40% develop resistance to treatment and her quest is to identify a marker that can act as a target for drugs.  She stated: &ldquo;With this fellowship I will spend some time working at the Cambridge Cancer Research Institute.&rdquo;  At the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Dr. David Hoey applied his mechanical engineering skills to see how bone forming cells reacted to loading.  Many cells have hairlike cilia on their surface, and Dr. Hoey found that simply bending these could trigger bone formation.  The significance of this is that in surgery, repair might be a better option than replacement.  At Columbia University in New York, David will work on biomedical engineering.</P>
        <P>The brilliance of these young people, pioneers who are a source of pride and whose work must be supported, will drive not only Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery but also help to create a better world for all of us.  I commend both the Government and the European Union on funding the research.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mar achoimre bheag ar an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; agam, d&eacute;arfaidh m&eacute; gur mhinic, san am at&aacute; thart, a d&uacute;irt daoine nach raibh acmhainn&iacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha againn.

        <P>I would like to see something exciting, bold and daring that will reflect the importance of producing renewable clean energy and the importance of seeing Ireland jump ahead into a leadership position by doing something dramatic in the area of becoming a net exporter of energy, if that were possible, and clean energy at that.</P>

     <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Francis O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be sharing time with Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the motion on the marine survey, which is brilliant.  As Monaghan is an inland county, I ask forgiveness if I am not as well versed as other Members with the shoreline of the country.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, as previous speakers stated, the benefits to the country of this survey are enormous with regard to the commercial shipping and fish trawlers which use our coastline.  It will also be of benefit to marine leisure and yachting has been mentioned.  Safety at sea is very important and the loss of many lives over the years has saddened many families.  Aquaculture and fish farming are important and have improved and grown during the years.  Materials such as sand and gravel are extracted for use in the construction industry and coastal projects for environmental protection are very important.  The size of the area mapped is five or six times the size of Ireland.  Within this area the benefits that may come in the future such as gas and oil exploration are very important.  The Government and various people who carried out the survey have done something that will be of great benefit to the country.  It will help create jobs in wave and wind power and other renewable energies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Brien for sharing his time with me.  </P>
        <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a few brief remarks in the debate.  I agree with Senator Mullen who picked up on what Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly stated on how relevant the debate is in the context of the overall depressed economy.  I accept the point but this is a useful forum for such a discussion.  I cannot imagine this discussion taking place in the other House because it would break into a partisan row.  A Cabinet Minister is here to listen to our views on the topic and if it is going to get an airing anywhere, the Seanad is the best place for it.</P>
        <P>There is no question that huge strides have been made in the area of safety because of the work of INFOMAR and proper mapping of the ocean bed.  I happen to be reading the novels by Patrick O&rsquo;Brian who created a character who is a British naval officer at the time of the Napoleonic wars.  The books give a great insight into the type of maritime ability people had prior to proper mapping.  They were guided mainly by their observations of nature.  They knew winds, bird life and other natural movements around them.  They were able to do a great job and they were fantastic seafaring men.  However, that would not do in today&rsquo;s world where seafaring traffic has increased by multiples and safety must be our first priority.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The days when Davy Jones&rsquo; Locker was the only knowledge people had of the ocean bed are long gone.  Information is wealth and it is only in recent decades that we have begun to seek proper information about what is going on under the surface of the sea.  As an island nation, we have much to gain from the work of INFOMAR and we should look forward to the challenges that this new information is giving us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and recently I was afforded a couple of opportunities to visit counties Galway and Mayo.  I saw the work being done by the Marine Institute in Galway Bay on spearheading new technology for the harnessing of wave and tidal power.  Apart from creating energy, which will be valuable to the economy, we are poised to be leaders in the provision of this information worldwide. <Col N="377"/> We could possibly reprise our achievement in being leaders in the IT revolution which initiated the Celtic tiger.  I compliment the Minister and his party on putting the idea of renewable energy to the forefront of Irish political life in the past ten years.  We have all learned and my party is glad to learn and embrace this philosophy because it is the future and without it we have no future.</P>
        <P>I note that some county councils have started to pick up on this and in particular I pay tribute to Mayo County Council which seems to be very proactive on energy developments in Clew Bay.  Recently, representatives from there attended a meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee and I met the county manager.  Mayo County Council seems to be coming out of the traps very quickly on this and the work of INFOMAR in mapping will be essential to its chances of success.  I know the Minister is committed to completing the programme, of which 18% remains to be done.</P>
        <P>I live at the mouth of the Shannon Estuary and studies seem to indicate that the tidal conditions there would be quite suitable for some form of tidal energy plant or development.  As the Minister is more than aware, it is the proposed location for the new liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal which, unfortunately, has been held up by a serial objector but the matter is coming to the end of the tunnel and it should begin in 2011.  As we are at it we should examine the ocean floor and try to tie everything together.  We have a power station there which is being renovated and enhanced.  It is hoped to have a new gas facility there in a couple of years.  Let us tie the whole lot together and have something under the sea as well.  I commend the work and I am sure that the Government will continue its commitment and that we will complete the mapping process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  To be honest, I am not an expert on marine mapping and the expert back-up parliamentary research team that conducted all of my research on this consisted of myself as the rest of the team was off.</P>
        <P>The national marine mapping project is putting together a database of critical knowledge and this knowledge is critical for a number of reasons.  On previous occasions I would have made the point that the fact that we do not have a senior Minister or Department for the marine sends out the wrong message about how we do our marine business.  Responsibility for the marine is spread across a number of Departments.  Deputy Ryan is one of several Ministers who have come to the House to discuss various aspects of marine legislation as we have had the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Minister for Transport and now we have the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In the interests of joined-up thinking in the Civil Service I would have called before the current budgetary difficulties for a Minister with responsibility for the marine.  As an island nation we send the wrong signal by not having a Cabinet Minister responsible for the marine.  I recognise the obvious difficulties in realising that vision now.  Nonetheless, it was a backward step to row back on the Department of the Marine, as the previous Government did.  The marine sector is worth almost &euro;3 billion per annum to the economy.  It is a huge source of revenue, whether through fishing, shipping or leisure activities.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, is familiar with south-west Cork.  The INFOMAR programme began in Dunmanus Bay and is now moving towards Galway.  It is important not just from an academic point of view but also for the people of the area, whether coastal management committees under the auspices of various local authorities, fisheries managers or aquaculture operators, and others to which it intends to deliver a range of useful data products, for example, cable and pipeline installation, coastal zone management, renewable energy, coastal engineering, foreshore licensing, inshore fisheries, port security and safety, oil and gas exploration, shipping and navigation.  We spent many <Col N="378"/>evenings in this House debating the Harbours (Amendment) Bill introduced by the Minister for Transport.  It led to one of the recent record filibusters in the House because there was an issue about the control of ports and Bantry Harbour being subsumed under the Port of Cork.  We are very proud of the organisations in that part of west Cork.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fisheries and the marine are sectors in which we can re-boot the rural economy.  They are almost revenue neutral from the Government&rsquo;s point of view.  In recent years fishermen&rsquo;s organisations have lobbied most Members because the industry is on its knees, not through lack of demand but because of regulation, control and legislation that has gone mad.  The sea-fisheries legislation imposes severe restrictions and sanctions on those found guilty of breaking these laws.  In most other European countries they would face administrative sanctions.  Frequently, however, off the coast of west Cork the existing powers allow the authorities to seize equipment and the catch and bring fishermen to the Circuit Court.  The legislation has criminalised an entire industry or profession.  We need to consider this issue realistically and switch from criminal to administrative sanctions.</P>
        <P>The Government must make a decision about the next European Commissioner.  There is a great deal of debate about who that will be.  Many names are in play and I have no difficulty with any of them.  They are all very fine, able people.  We could rest assured knowing that they would do a fine job in any Commission in any area but we should chase the fisheries Commissionership.  It is of great importance to the country and we need to take the matter seriously.  I have listened to the fears, concerns and reservations of those involved in the industry.  To do this would send a strong message.  We cannot provide a Cabinet Minister but we need to seek a Commissioner in that area from among the very fine candidates mooted by political and non-political sources.</P>
        <P>I submitted a motion to be considered on the Adjournment three weeks ago about an issue affecting the coast of west Cork that is stifling marine activity.  The sea lettuce off the south west coast which is particularly bad off Inchydoney Island is an environmental mess and causing unquantifiable damage to that area.  That Adjournment matter was ruled out of order on the same morning that another Senator&rsquo;s Adjournment matter about a water quality issue in Bantry was accepted.  I was told the Minister had no jurisdiction over the matter I had raised.  I attended a meeting about the Courtmacsherry sewerage scheme and lobbied the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, during the summer.  Senator Boyle must be aware of that issue too.  It is incredible that I can table a matter for discussion on the Adjournment that is ruled out of order and then find that the county manager has established a task force which includes representatives from the Department.  Either we have jurisdiction over this issue or we do not.</P>
        <P>There is a total lack of joined-up cohesive thinking about the marine.  One of the biggest mistakes we make is not to have a Minister with responsibility for the marine.  It is not good enough to scatter these responsibilities to the four winds.  I do not know if the decision on the new Commissioner has been made.  I am not privy to Cabinet discussions but I urge the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ensure we go after this Commissionship because it is just as important that we seek it as we find a person to fill the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Senator McCarthy that whatever list of names is flying around as the next Irish Commissioner, or the next European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, I am not part of that list, even though the bookmaker Paddy Power is quoting me at 14/1.  I am quite happy to stay in this Chamber, despite all the turbulence of recent days.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.  This debate may, in many respects, seem esoteric but that is one of the reasons the Seanad should exist.  While we need to balance our daily Order of Business in respect of current events and the change agenda as represented in the preceding statements on postal codes, we also need a Chamber that takes a long-term view of Ireland and its resources.  We have not fared too well in the past in this respect.  It is amazing that as an island country it took us until 1999 to engage in a national seabed survey.  It has been a successful survey that has mapped a huge area, ten times the size of the national land area.  There is another 13% to be surveyed in the next phase.  </P>
        <P>This debate covers the effect of the survey on coastal communities, sea-dependent industries and the harvesting of the sea.  In the first instance, however, we are discussing the seabed and its use.  Our coastline covers the largest area in the European Union that can be used for manifold purposes, as the survey and the 2008 independent review of the mapping programme show.  Those uses have been mentioned &mdash; fishing, biodiversity, renewable energy projects and the like.  I would like to know how the seabed can be used.  The depths are significant but an apparatus can be attached to the seabed to harness tidal power.  While the technology is being developed and the engineering work is being done here, it is being tested off the Scottish coast.  That is a comment on us.  Scotland&rsquo;s potential for renewable energy drawn from waves, tides and wind is equal to ours but we should be trying to maximise the added value we obtain here.  Nevertheless, the company should be commended for exploiting the export potential of its technology.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this debate is to see how the follow-on survey from the national seabed survey will come into being, be properly resourced and determine what we intend to learn from it.  The INFOMAR study is integral to the national development plan.  In our present fiscal situation questions arise about devoting resources to anything or whether we need a timetable for the project.  This project needs a particular political action to ensure it receives maximum priority because it affects our long-term development.  It is a long-term plan.  A 20-year lifespan will perhaps see everybody in this Chamber out, in terms of their longevity and participation in political life.  If we have anything to offer the future development of the country, these are the projects we need to develop rather than think of the next election.</P>
        <P>The value of the INFOMAR programme is that it represents much of what recent Government policy has tried to promote through the smart economy document concerning the interdependence and inter-relationship between science, technology and innovation.  Resourcing it properly, recognising it and making it a main plank of Government policy are important aspects.  What needs to be done, arising from these statements, is to provide a clear sense of purpose from this House.  The contributions of Opposition Members follow through on this.  In this survey we will be doing the country a service.  If there are question marks where they are usually raised in the current fiscal climate, particularly in the Department of Finance, it is up to everybody in the political system to meet that challenge head-on because, although there may not be an immediate political impact, or one that individual politicians can latch onto and thereby achieve self-aggrandisement, this is something the country needs to do and is for its betterment.  On those grounds, the Minister, the Department and the placing of the project within the National Development Plan should be given every possible support.</P>

	<P>I do but only briefly.  Seo an c&eacute;ad l&aacute; dom a bheith ag caint tar &eacute;is bh&aacute;is an Seanad&oacute;ir Callanan agus ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a chur in i&uacute;l d&aacute; bhean ch&eacute;ile Sheila agus d&aacute; ph&aacute;ist&iacute; ar fad. </P><Col N="380"/>
        <P>I take this opportunity because I do not see the motion before the House as contentious in any way, shape or form.  Mapping of the seabed is obviously very important and will benefit many areas.  One matter on which I wish to focus is the dispute between the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and its relationship with the mapping of special areas of conservation, SACs, where shellfish farms are operating.  The situation is causing severe distress to over 300 applicants whose applications are ready to be renewed.  Some 80% of these farms have made investments and will not now achieve their 40% return from the European Union because by not mapping SACs the Government is in breach of the directive in place.  When money is available from the European Union under the programme for fisheries 2007-13 but cannot be accessed by the Department because of a lack of mapping, there are serious questions to be raised in this regard.  It is a scandal that money committed by the individuals concerned for these indigenous enterprises cannot be recouped because the Department has failed to carry out such mapping.  This must be rectified immediately.</P>
        <P>I am aware that in 2008 the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, announced &euro;4 million in grant aid for aquaculture and &euro;1.4 million to facilitate the mapping of SACs.  At face value, this seemed good but I am informed the downside was that the &euro;4 million needed to complete the project related to the previous grant applications from 2005 to 2006.  More important, the &euro;1.4 million allocated for the mapping of SACs was allocated for one year only, with the result that only 12 bays have been mapped in the south of Ireland and the money has been spent with nothing further forthcoming.</P>
        <P>The benefits of mapping have been outlined by different Senators today but there is an immediate problem, one that the Department should have known about since 2000 when Ireland implemented the Natura 2000 habitats directive that introduced SACs.  It is having a severe impact on indigenous enterprise.  To put the matter in context, the aquaculture industry is worth &euro;120 million per annum.  When we talk about the benefits of investing, we can see the return in this instance.  However, I understand there is a stand-off between the two Departments with consequential intransigence.  I am informed that it is a simple matter but because of the stand-off between the two Departments nothing is happening.  I am also informed that a mediation process has been established between the two Departments but this issue needs to be resolved immediately.  People are losing their jobs day in, day out.  Because the Government is responsible for the hold up, the matter must be sorted out.  I commend the Minister on the mapping project but this matter must be dealt with as a priority.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s return to the Seanad, or to me, on this matter.  I understand it does not fall directly within his remit or that of Department but it is connected to the overall debate we are having in the House today and, therefore, worth mentioning.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am very glad to be here to reply to the various contributions made and acknowledge the very good work done by our public servants in this area.  As Senator Mullen said, too often we concentrate on the negative and do not recognise the things we do that are innovative and progressive.  In this area what we are doing is world-class and worthy of recognition.  On 6 and 7 October at an international conference in Dublin Seabed 10, the programme of Irish seabed mapping begun in 1999, was reviewed, had its results showcased and achievements lauded.  Mapping of deeper waters was completed in 2005 under the direction of the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI.  Since 2006 an effective partnership between the GSI and the Marine Institute has been tackling the near-shore seabed under the INFOMAR project.  In speaking to Senators today I <Col N="381"/>am keen to outline the results of this effort to date and the benefits which have accrued, both in terms of the increased skills base and the added value for specific sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before examining the detail of how the project has operated and what it is delivering, it would be good to examine its fiscal costs and benefits.  An undertaking of this scale is not cheap.  Expenditure on the Irish national seabed survey totalled &euro;32 million, while the budget for the INFOMAR programme is &euro;4 million per annum.  It is imperative, therefore, that such a programme be examined to see if it represents value for money.  In 2008 an independent financial review of the programme was completed.  The review, carried out by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers, examined, under Department of Finance rules, the options and costs to completion of the current work.  The study calculated in a prudent way the estimated benefits accruing from the work across a range of sectors.  In the commercial sector the areas examined were fishing, aquaculture, biodiversity, renewable energy, energy exploration and aggregates, while impacts on the knowledge economy and research and legislative savings through the avoidance of non-compliance fines were also calculated.  The study examined four options, from the cessation of activity through to the acceleration of the programme.  A large number of non-quantifiable benefits were identified, particularly relating to the environment.  The study did not put a monetary value on some of the speculative benefits such as a hydrocarbon find, a major biotechnology discovery or the avoidance of major costs such as clean-up costs arising from an oil spill.  Although the study recommended a ramping-up of the programme, if possible, the option chosen was to continue the current level of funding with an estimated net present value of benefits of &euro;275 million and a benefit to cost ratio of 4.4.</P>
        <P>I wish to cover the mechanism for mapping Ireland&rsquo;s seabed in which we are engaged.  Ireland is a relatively small island on the west European seaboard and isolated on the Continental Shelf of the north-east Atlantic.  In order to define the limits of our underwater territory beyond the traditional territorial waters and understand what it may contain, the seabed must be mapped.  The first significant seabed surveys, part of the national preparation of a submission to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, took place in 1995 and 1996.  The results supported the extension of our seabed area to more than 1,000 km off the west coast.  This was a considerable resource in which the Government was prepared to invest.  Marine science and geo-science have since become priority themes in Ireland&rsquo;s science and technology landscape.</P>
        <P>The Irish national seabed survey, INSS, funded by the Government, was designed to produce comprehensive information on all aspects of the seabed as a basis for its sustainable management.  From 1999 to 2005 the survey successfully mapped all waters deeper than 200 m, in addition to considerable areas of shallow water.  The project completed not only the depth mapping or bathymetry but also provided a groundbreaking set of multibeam backscatter &mdash; used for resolving seabed type &mdash; magnetic, gravity and ancillary data.  Deep seismic surveys examined specific regions and video and physical samples provided ground truthing of interpretations.</P>
        <P>The Canadian Centre for Marine Communications was engaged from 1999 to 2000 to assist with project planning, design and specifications.  Stakeholder feedback has been involved in all aspects of managing the programme to ensure it meets the needs of society.  At an early stage changes were implemented to maximise the value, including a shift from paper-based to digital technologies, making mid-depth surveys with deep water surveys and concentrating on the needs of customers.</P>
        <P>Many ships have been used.  The Irish company Global Ocean Technology Limited, GOTECH, won a contract from 2000 to 2002 to undertake the deep water mapping and used the <i>SV Bligh</i> and the <i>SV Siren</i>, the former in deeper waters and the latter in relatively shallow <Col N="382"/>waters of 200 m to 1,000 m in depth off the south west.  The Marine Institute&rsquo;s <i>RV Celtic Voyager</i> and latterly <i>RV Celtic Explorer</i> have been the mainstay of the INFOMAR programme.  Additional work on the Rockall bank used the <i>Granuaile</i>, a vessel of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
        <P>The INFOMAR programme is being jointly undertaken by the GSI, under the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Marine Institute, now an agency of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Since 2006 INFOMAR has been dedicated to mapping the more challenging inshore and coastal waters.  The first phase focuses on 26 priority bays and three priority areas, the second on completing all remaining areas unmapped.  The initial approval for INFOMAR covered three years from 2006 to 2008 and, following a positive financial review in 2008, the project has been approved to at least the end of the current national development programme in 2013.</P>
        <P>The INFOMAR programme, focused as it is on shallow waters, has needed other platforms for acquiring data.  Following a successful trial in 2002, coastal airborne surveys using laser mapping have been a regular part of INFOMAR, particularly in the clearer waters off the west coast in waters up to 30 m deep.  The <i>Celtic Explorer</i> has worked in coastal and inlet waters as shallow as 50 m and the <i>Celtic Voyager</i> to 20 m.  Biological and geological sampling, as well as video surveys, are undertaken from these various ships, as well as from a small rigid inflatable boat.  The final most shallow area in the inshore is now being mapped using the most recent addition to the national fleet of research vessels, the <i>RV Keary</i>, a 15 m aluminium catamaran built and equipped specifically to carry out shallow water mapping.</P>
        <P>The INFOMAR project is carefully managed under a cross-departmental project board, reports to a technical advisory committee of stakeholders and undergoes detailed NDP monitoring.  I am delighted to advise that the project is on track, meeting both financial and technical targets.  To date, the priority area off the south west has been completed, with the priority bays of Galway, Bantry, Dunmanus, Tralee, Donegal and Sligo.  Dublin Bay will be completed this year and work has commenced on the rest.  Under the current Government decision, the project will again be reviewed in 2012.</P>
        <P>What has come from all this and what are the project outputs?  Data are processed, interpreted and customised to meet the needs of a wide range of customers and stakeholders.  Starting with energy, suitable anchoring sites must be identified for offshore renewable energy extraction from wind or wave energy projects and seabed classification maps provide accurate information on site conditions.  Similar information is required for site selection for drilling rigs for oil and gas exploration and production.  Exploration relies on the interpretation of seismic, magnetic, gravity and geological information.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers study valued the benefits to the energy exploration sector at over &euro;49 million, with a further &euro;40 million of benefits for the renewable energy sector.</P>
        <P>In terms of fisheries, marine life is not uniformly distributed throughout the oceans and the occurrence of many species is strongly influenced by the nature of the sea floor.  Some favour a rocky habitat, others a muddy one.  Reliable fish habitat maps are equally valuable to trawler owners as to national fishery regulators and environmental agencies.  Fish habitat maps will promote efficient harvesting while minimising the environmental damage caused to the sea floor by excessive trawling and contribute to national and EU fishery regulations and policies.  The study valued the benefits to this sector at some &euro;95 million.</P>
        <P>In terms of environmental protection, the Irish have traditionally associated coral reefs with the warmer climates of places such as Queensland in Australia.  In recent years they have become familiar with the wealth of similar reefs on the edge of our continental shelf.  In part<Col N="383"/>icular, cold water carbonate mounds extend from south of Ireland along the Atlantic fringes as far north as Norway.  They nurture juvenile fish, but equally they require satisfactory protection as valuable marine heritage.  In 2007 Ireland became one of the first countries worldwide to protect such environments with the designation of four special areas of conservation.  Benefits accruing from the legislative area were estimated at over &euro;7 million.</P>
        <P>In terms of aggregates, the vibrant economy of the past decade saw an unprecedented level of construction of national infrastructure.  The considerable resulting pressure on land-based aggregate resources means there is increasing interest in potential offshore resources.  Seabed surveys designed to test for offshore aggregates have recently been undertaken.  The mounds and ridges, often glacial, are valued both as fish breeding grounds and as sites for renewable energy installations.  The seabed surveys&rsquo; results can inform prudent decision making in dealing with such conflicting interests.  The benefits in this sector are estimated at some &euro;85 million.</P>
        <P>Regarding marine safety, hydrographic charts around the coastline have, until recently and apart from minor updates, dated from the late 19th century.  Some are now obsolete owing to shifting sediment patterns in the intervening period.  The changing demands of shipping have placed additional and different pressures on busy sea lanes.  Coastal seabed surveys have been undertaken to characterise modern shipping lanes, ensure safe passage to ports and provide modern charts.</P>
        <P>Heritage is an important aspect of seabed management.  Detailed mapping is essential to support the delineation of special areas of conservation.  Shipwrecks on the sea floor have been mapped with remarkable clarity, often illustrating the way the ships sank and came to rest on the seabed.  Many are national monuments and may represent heritage extending back as far as the Spanish Armada.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of marine research, a key use of the data produced is as an enabler for leading edge research.  More than 200 projects to date have benefited from data, advice or funding, including a project to deploy instruments that will monitor a range of environmental parameters in Galway Bay involving both Intel and IBM.  In another, NUI Galway, funded by the Griffith Geoscience Research Awards, will investigate groundwater-sea water interactions affecting drinking water supply on the Clare side of Galway Bay.  A conservative value of &euro;10 million has been estimated for benefits arising from research.</P>
        <P>In terms of delivering the data, early on it became clear that the programme would fail if it focused exclusively on data acquisition.  From interaction with stakeholders, a digital environment, including web delivery and geographic information systems, GIS, was seen to be the way forward.  Duplication and backup are employed for data security.  Web mapping allows users direct access to their target data sets using GIS.  The most recent interactive web data delivery system which allows users high speed web download is the first such fully interactive system of its kind in the northern hemisphere.  Every effort has been made to facilitate data usage.  A policy of free access to data sets for all users was introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>The results of seabed mapping have become a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging knowledge economy.  The mapping has been the foundation for a state-of-the-art information management system.  The level of activity sustains a significant skills base and will ensure Ireland has a healthy foundation in both geo-science and marine science in the future.  The seabed mapping has also built an unprecedented level of co-operation among agencies.</P>
        <P>Public awareness of seabed mapping has increased gradually in recent years.  Popular images like shipwrecks and coral reefs have delighted an audience that is increasingly attuned to the enterprise and career opportunities of science and technology.  These audiences, even those with limited formal scientific knowledge, visit the relevant websites with increasing frequency and download appreciable levels of information.  The policy of free access for all users has <Col N="384"/>encouraged this process and many commercial users regularly return to the websites for updates.</P>
        <P>At Government level, I am pleased that there is recognition that geo-science programmes such as seabed mapping can provide an accessible avenue for students who may eventually study varied aspects of science.  This helps Ireland to reach its science and technology targets in building its knowledge economies.  Collaborative seabed mapping has also advanced the co-operation between the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s continued investment in seabed mapping is essential to complete a task, started in deep waters in 1999, that will only be finished when all coastal waters have been surveyed.  Seabed mapping is set to deliver a remarkable range of data sets which will underpin Ireland&rsquo;s policies and regulation for many decades.  They will provide an excellent foundation for research and services and comprise a unique teaching and outreach resource.  Many industrial and research sectors have gained benefit according as the national pool of expertise has increased.  Ireland is establishing a marine data infrastructure consistent with state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies.  Seabed mapping has enhanced the international profile for Irish marine expertise.  It is a reflection of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to science and technology in general and specifically to geo-science and marine science and a statement that Ireland is a forward-looking nation which is science-friendly and eager to support enterprise based on world-class endeavour.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey.  I had the opportunity of speaking to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this matter when he was in the House.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to instruct the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to remove the necessity to purchase permits under the auspices of the midland fisheries group, for coarse and pike angling in respect of the Rivers Suck, Inny, Brosna, Little Brosna and Camlin.</P>
        <P>This is the only board to impose such charges and this has made it very difficult for people in our area.  I live in Castlecoote, County Roscommon.  An adult annual fishing permit costs &euro;37; a pensioner annual permit costs &euro;19; a juvenile annual permit costs &euro;13; an adult one-day permit costs &euro;11; a juvenile one-day permit costs &euro;2 and a 21-day permit costs &euro;19.  However, 12 km or more away from that area there is no charge.  This is an anomaly which I ask the Minister and the Government to examine.  I accept that as a result of amalgamation there will be just one fisheries board from next December but in the meantime we want to ensure the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board is directed to dispense with these charges which mean that visiting fishermen and anglers do not come to the rivers in our area.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the reason the chief executive of the board has introduced this permit system.  The Minister of State is aware of the difficulties we encountered with regard to the <Col N="385"/>trout fishing licence some years ago.  One member of the board was involved in an extensive campaign in the 1989 general election in opposition to that particular proposal.  This charge was nevertheless imposed on fishermen in our area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I come from Castlecoote, County Roscommon through which flows the River Suck.  The Derryhippo river flows through my family farm into an adjoining lake.  In order to fish on the waters flowing through our land we require a permit.  It is as bad as in the days of the landlords when permits and rights were needed to fish on the rivers.  All our rivers now run free but they certainly do not run free in Castlecoote and that area.  In the circumstances I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister our concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>Recently, my daughter, Councillor Orla Leyden, and committee members of the international fishing festival which also caters for people with disabilities, ran a fishing competition in Ballinapark on Stoneham&rsquo;s lake.  Some concessions were made but generally speaking, the journalists who came from the Netherlands and Germany noted that these charges were being imposed.  A level playing pitch is required so everyone is treated equally.  I question how one can fish in the River Shannon and not be charged for doing so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Mr. Geoff Cooper is a countryside journalist from Kilglass, County Roscommon and he has provided me with details in this regard.  People were stopped and licences and permits were demanded.  I know of instances where anglers have been forced to leave the River Suck and they left the country ahead of time because they were so dismayed with their treatment.  I realise that the rod licence covers more than 20 venues and that only five are open to coarse anglers.  My request of the Minister is straightforward.  I am unsure what powers there are to enforce this position but the Minister should call on the officials of the Department to issue a directive to have this charge removed in advance of the amalgamation of the fishing organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Primary responsibility for the management, conservation, protection and development of inland fisheries stocks rests with the central and regional fisheries boards in accordance with the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2007.  The Acts empower the regional fisheries boards to apply a permit charge for angling on fisheries under their control.  The application of such a permit charge is a day-to-day operational matter for the relevant board, in this instance the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.  Within its region, the Shannon board controls 27 fisheries which are collectively known as the midland fisheries group and these include the River Suck, River Inny, River Brosna, Little Brosna river and Camilin river.  While a number of these fisheries are better known as trout waters, others are renowned for the quality of the coarse and pike angling they offer.</P>
        <P>It is normal practice within Ireland and throughout Europe for fishery owners, angling clubs and fisheries boards to charge an angling permit fee on waters they control.  I am advised by the Shannon board that, as with its predecessor the Inland Fisheries Trust, it has imposed a permit charge for trout angling for more than 50 years on fisheries under its control.  I understand the board, in reviewing its management and the fees charged for its fisheries in 2002, decided to extend the permit charges to cover coarse angling on the board-controlled fisheries.  This was done on the basis that it was unfair to charge one angler to fish for one species while another angler fishing for a different species on the same water was not charged, yet all benefit from investment made in the fisheries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As can be appreciated, the cost of managing these fisheries has greatly increased over the years.  The board was of the view that coarse anglers who utilise the fisheries should contribute to the cost of conservation and protection of stocks as well as the upkeep of the coarse fisheries. <Col N="386"/> A permit entitles the holder to fish in any of the 27 fisheries.  The cost of an annual permit is &euro;39 while a tourist angler is required to pay &euro;20 for a 21-day permit.  Amounting to less than &euro;1 per day a tourist angler permit is clearly excellent value, especially when compared internationally, where a similar total price could be charged for a single day of fishing in Europe or the UK.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the board that the total revenue generated by the permit system, including revenue from coarse fishing permits, during the period 2005 to 2008 is in the region of &euro;317,146.  The board assures me that funds raised from the sale of permits are reinvested in the conservation and day-to-day management and development of these fisheries.  Therefore, it funds works ranging from habitat maintenance, fish stocking, pollution control and enforcement as well as tourism angling promotion activities.  It has been the board&rsquo;s experience that where tourist anglers are informed that funds raised through angling permits, which entitle them to fish on all 27 fisheries controlled by the board, are reinvested in the fishery, they are willing to contribute.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand the board continues to develop the angling product and, in partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Central Fisheries Board, actively promotes the Shannon region as a tourism angling destination.  This promotion work includes participation in trade shows.  The board also has a dedicated website which provides information on the fisheries.  A recent initiative has seen the board make provision for a dedicated angling officer from whom visiting anglers may seek advice.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources believes permits for coarse and pike angling at less than &euro;1 per day represent good value and play an important role in providing additional resources to help sustain the fishery in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The board members attempted to have discharge removed in recent days but were prevented by the management of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.  I am grateful for the Minister of State&rsquo;s appearance before the House but the reply does not refer to the fact that some 12 km or 13 km from the River Suck there is free fishing.  It is not a fair system.  I am totally opposed to it and I hope the new board, once established, will have a new system applicable throughout the country and there will be no such differentiation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Se&aacute;n Haughey.  T&aacute; m&eacute; iontach s&aacute;sta go bhfuil s&eacute; anseo &oacute;n Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta leis an cheist seo a phl&eacute;.  I am very pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, is here to discuss this very serious issue which affects many students in Donegal.  I am also aware that it affects students throughout the State.  Since I placed the motion on the agenda last weekend, the USI has stated this problem is experienced throughout the State.  I understand the issue in my home county of Donegal because I have been inundated with requests from mothers, fathers and students to try to deal with this issue and find some resolution.</P>
        <P>As I walked through the Chamber door I was on the telephone, as the Minister of State may have noticed.  I was taking another call from a distressed mother whose daughter applied for a maintenance grant before the deadline and in good time.  She is in college now but still has not received notification of whether the grant will be approved.  She is not currently registered with the college because she is not obliged to pay the &euro;1,500 registration fee if she is eligible for a maintenance grant.  She cannot access vital services within the college because she is not regis<Col N="387"/>tered and now there is a threat to the mid-term examinations.  This is the problem faced by one individual but hundreds of others face similar problems.</P>
        <P>This matter was foreseen and I have raised the issue many times.  There is a need for the Student Support Bill to be implemented as well as a need for resources to be put in place to deal with the backlog in applications that local authorities and VECs are experiencing.  However, given the difficult times in which we find ourselves there has been a significant increase in the number of applicants for maintenance grants.  It is estimated that applications have increased by 20% in Donegal and there is no doubt there were hundreds of additional applications to Donegal County Council and Donegal VEC in the final days before the deadline.</P>
        <P>Where does the problem arise?  The problem is that Donegal County Council and Donegal VEC do not have the personnel or resources to process these applications in time.  Part of the problem also arises from the fact that application forms were only made available four weeks before the deadline, although numerous requests have been submitted throughout the years for applications to be made available in good time.  The recruitment embargo, which bans local authorities and VECs from employing new and additional people to deal with this problem, the ban on overtime, which does not allow people to work in excess of the scheduled hours to deal with the backlog, and the fact that local authorities were of the view initially that they would not have to deal with this matter this year because the Student Support Bill would transfer the services to the VEC, have all caused problems this year.  The major problem, for which the Government is not directly responsible, is that so many new people are eligible for the maintenance grant because of the changed circumstances of their parents in the past year.</P>
        <P>What is the impact on students?  There are now hundreds of students in colleges throughout the State who have not paid the &euro;1,500 registration fee because they are not required to do so.  They will be entitled to the maintenance grant when the decision is made by the local authority or VEC.  Since they have not paid the &euro;1,500 fee, they are not registered with the college.  Since they are not registered with the college they do not receive a student number.  Since they do not have a student number they cannot access the computer suites, take books from the library and, most important, are not allowed to sit the mid-term exams which start next week.  This problem in terms of registration for students requires the direct involvement of the Minister.  The Minister must instruct the colleges that there is a backlog, that there is a major problem and that we must get over this hurdle immediately.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The bigger problem is that such students are awarded maintenance grants because they need them to survive in college.  We are all aware of the cost of going to college.  This small amount of money allows people from the working and lower middle classes to be able to send their children to college.  In that way, people can go through colleges independently, but without that support such people are in danger of dropping out.  That is the problem we are now faced with.  Students have told me that in the majority of cases it will be January 2010 until their applications for local authority grants will be assessed.  In the meantime, people are being told to apply for a loan.  However, they may have lost their jobs in the last year and are trying to pay mortgages and other debts that have accrued in recent years.  They are being turned down for loans by the banks we are bailing out and the students are being left high and dry as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must ensure these students can sit their exams and get access to all the services in their colleges.  Additional resources are also required by local authorities and vocational education committees.  It is not right to leave our students, who are the future of this country, in this position.  Months after they have applied and filled in their forms on time, State bodies cannot make the decision because they are being strangled by the Government&rsquo;s restrictions.  In the coming weeks, Donegal County Council alone will have lost 280 staff members.  One in five of <Col N="388"/>the council&rsquo;s workforce has disappeared in the past 18 months, yet they are still being asked to deliver more services with fewer resources, which is impossible.  We need to lift the embargo, at least on local authorities and VECs in order that additional people can be recruited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Minister&rsquo;s position concerning the processing of student grant applications by County Donegal VEC and Donegal County Council.</P>
        <P>The Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students.  These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities and the remaining schemes are administered by the vocational education committees, the VECs.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.  The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992 provide for the making of grants by local authorities to enable persons to attend approved courses of higher education.  The process whereby local authorities assess eligibility and make grant payments under the higher education grants scheme is provided for under these Acts.</P>
        <P>The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants and the organisation and management of student support scheme grants are matters for the relevant local authority or VEC.  These bodies seek to ensure students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.  It is essential that students return fully completed application forms and all necessary supporting documentation as early as possible to enable decisions to be made on entitlement.</P>
        <P>Delays can arise where the administering body is awaiting further information or documentation from applicants, or where applicants have failed to submit complete application forms.  In this regard County Donegal VEC has confirmed to officials of the Department that a significant number of the outstanding grant applications have not been processed in full owing to such delays.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator will appreciate that, in the context of the current economic circumstances, difficult choices had to be made by the Government to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In that regard, the Senator will be aware of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector.  In the VECs, positions other than teacher and special needs assistant posts in schools and teacher equivalents that are directly providing tuition for pupils in schools in special programmes or in adult and further education are comprehended by this decision.</P>
        <P>The Government also sought a reduction in pay in the public sector in 2009.  In that regard the VECs&rsquo; administrative pay funding allocations were reduced by 4% in 2009 and the Department is aware that certain VECs, including County Donegal VEC, have reduced overtime this year to remain within budget.  County Donegal VEC has confirmed to the Department that the processing of grants has been affected by the overtime reduction and by the non-replacement of staff on leave due to the moratorium.  On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science I acknowledge the difficulties this may be causing certain third level students.  However, as I have already explained, difficult choices were necessary to ensure sustainability.  Accordingly, <Col N="389"/>I can confirm that the Minister for Education and Science does not intend seeking a derogation from the recruitment and promotion moratorium or from the Government decision regarding pay funding to facilitate the processing of grants by County Donegal VEC.</P>
        <P>County Donegal VEC has assured the Department that the body of work associated with the processing of grants has been prioritised.  On behalf of the Minister, I acknowledge the efforts of the VEC in the difficult circumstances that apply at this time.  The Senator will appreciate it would not be appropriate for me to comment on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science on the consequences of the moratorium and overtime restrictions on the processing of grants by Donegal County Council as such issues in local authorities are a matter for his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I acknowledge the problems the Senator has raised and hope I have dealt with them in my response.  I thank the Senator again for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately, the Minister of State did not respond to the questions I raised.  I know his speech was drafted by departmental officials, but what does the Minister of State or the Department say to students who cannot sit their mid-term exams next week?  Students at third level colleges cannot get books out of the library or use college computers.  They may need to drop out of college because they have had no assistance from the State, from September to January, to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>There is a simple solution to this, which is why I want the Minister of State to work with me and be a bit imaginative.  The Department of Education and Science should issue an immediate instruction to universities and institutes of technology that all students should be temporarily registered in the meantime until local authorities and VECs have dealt with the backlog.  The education of these students is at stake because they cannot sit their exams.  I am not happy with the position on grant payments, but if they could sit exams and have access to the necessary educational materials, it would be a positive outcome.  Will the Minister of State raise with the Minister as soon as possible the idea of temporarily registering all students who have applied to VECs or local authorities for funding but who have not yet received a decision on their applications?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Minister for Transport to authorise Bus &Eacute;ireann to re-route a service to facilitate students attending Athlone Institute of Technology.  This bus service runs from Dublin to Galway and, until this year, it always stopped on the campus of Athlone Institute of Technology.  In early September, I wrote to Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s local area manager in Athlone requesting that the bus would stop on that campus to facilitate students travelling from Kinnegad, Milltownpass, Rochfortbridge, Tyrrellspass, Kilbeggan and Moate.  I received a reply from the local area manager stating that the matter did not come within his remit and that he would have to speak to the Department of Transport.  Why in God&rsquo;s name can a local area manager not re-route a service or ask a bus driver to stop at an institute of technology?  This typifies the way State-sponsored bodies are disconnected from their clients and customers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first year student intake in AIT increased by 24% this year and, as a mother, I have serious concerns about the safety and general well-being of these young people.  I was contacted by a mother from Rochfortbridge who articulated similar concerns about her youngster having <Col N="390"/>to walk 2.5 miles from the bus station to the college in the dark every morning and evening.  In recent years a predator has sexually assaulted a number of young people in the area.  Mothers from rural areas are concerned about the welfare of their children in large towns where drugs and anti-social behaviour are worries.</P>
        <P>I fail to understand the disconnect between the local area manager and the Department and why he cannot authorise a bus to stop at AIT.  It makes no sense given this was the case every other year.  Will the Minister to State give a reasonable reply in order that I can return to my constituents with a reasonable, honest response that is not a load of highfalutin r&aacute;im&eacute;is?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will be a little disappointed with this reply.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport.  It is open to Bus &Eacute;ireann and other bus operators to submit proposals to his Department in respect of new bus services for the area in question.  On 1 October 2009, Bus &Eacute;ireann submitted a notification to the Department seeking authorisation to re-route the 7 a.m. No. 20 Dublin-Galway service via AIT to facilitate students attending the college.  The application is being considered by the Department with reference to existing services in the area.  I regret I cannot provide the Senator with more information but the application is being examined.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his brief reply.  Is it possible that I could have an idea by tomorrow regarding how long the consideration will take?  Students returned to college at the beginning of September and it is almost Christmas now.  Perhaps the Minister of State could let me know tomorrow because I do not wish to put him on the spot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not give a commitment regarding how long the Department will take to consider this matter.  It is open to the Senator to nab the Minister in the D&aacute;il later, as I am sure he will be present for the division at 8.30 p.m., but I will bring it to his attention.</P>
