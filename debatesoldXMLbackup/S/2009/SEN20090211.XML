	<P>I have received notice from Senator Maurice Cummins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to intervene in the HSE&rsquo;s decision to close St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford; when it is proposed to build the new 50 bed unit for long-stay elderly patients at this location; and if she will request the HSE to defer the closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s until the new unit is in place.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to introduce legislation regarding the governing of exhibitions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to consider the need for repairs and refurbishment at Kildallon national school, Ballyconnell, County Cavan.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to meet a representative of the eel fishing industry to address the fact that as a result of the Government&rsquo;s decision to close commercial eel fishing in Ireland we are in a position in which the Government&rsquo;s proposal exceeds the targets set by the European directive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide an update on the provision of a CCTV scheme in the Sheriff Street area of Dublin 1; and if funding will be provided for this scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to outline when Project Kelvin, with a tender specification for Derry city, moved to Coleraine, County Derry, contradicting all previous Irish Government ministerial comment since 2007.</P><Col N="804"/>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the progress made to date on the establishment of a satellite radio therapy centre for the north west.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Eugene Regan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline his proposals for the rebuilding of Newpark comprehensive school, Blackrock, County Dublin, including the timescale for planning, final design and commencement of works.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline his response to requests for school extensions in a number of schools in the Lucan area, including St. Thomas&rsquo;s national school, Scoil Mhuire national school and Lucan community college.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that any well drilling in the Ashford area of Wicklow does not reduce the flow of water in the River Vartry to such an extent that it threatens the sustainability of Mount Usher gardens.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Cummins, Mullen and O&rsquo;Reilly as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Ross as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  Senators Norris, Donohoe, Keaveney, Doherty, Regan and Fitzgerald may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We thought we had heard everything there was to hear about the banking culture in this country.  Senators from all sides will be horrified at the most recent revelations regarding the bail-out, namely, the cooking of the books by which one bank lent to Anglo Irish Bank on the day before its results were to be announced last September.  The culture emerging from our banking system is extraordinarily disturbing.  We have seen another serious blow to our international reputation this morning with the news that is emerging.  I say that very regretfully because we all want to see the real economy working and credit being given to firms.</P>
        <P>We will put billions of euro into the banks but if there is not clearer regulation and control by Government, it will be hard to see how the taxpayer will get value for money and the real economy will start to work again.  It is absolutely disgraceful for the ordinary taxpayer to see the kind of insider culture that, apparently, has been operating for years with different rules applying to insider groups and with different credit arrangements, which are shocking.  I and <Col N="805"/>Fine Gael are very disturbed by it and we will make our own recommendations in regard to the banks recapitalisation.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to raise the following matter with the Minister for Education and Science.  In his speech in the House yesterday, I do not believe he said what he was going to do to special classes and children with disabilities.  A letter has been sent to more than 100 schools affecting hundreds of children with special needs stating that special needs classes in schools must be shut down by next September.  This means a loss of more than 128 special teaching posts and it will affect children in 119 schools.</P>
        <P>This morning the INTO said that this latest Government plan is an outrageous dismantling of the special education infrastructure.  The people will hear about the money going into the banks but they will also hear about the Government taking away these services from the most vulnerable in our society, those with special needs.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to account for what he is doing?  It was outrageous that when he came into the House yesterday this matter was not on the agenda and that no explanation was given to the Seanad.  If there are to be cuts to frontline services, at the very least we should have a discussion in the House.  It was a sham for the Minister to come into the House yesterday while at the same time send letters to schools cutting vital services and not even mention it to Senators.  It was a disgrace and I ask the Leader to approach the Minister for Education and Science to ask for information on what is happening in special education.</P>
        <P>We have seen the suspension of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which is completely against stated Government policy in the past few years.  This is a disgraceful measure.  It is outrageous that the most vulnerable people are being hit while we are putting billions of euro into banks which have not been accountable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes one feel a bit stupid and foolish, after all the effort we put into the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and our demands that it be commenced, that it is suspended.  Some of us travelled around the country to explain it to people.  Not only has the Act not been commenced but the Minister for Education and Science displayed a cowardly attitude in coming into the House yesterday, having cleared a press statement that would wreck the lives of 1,000 pupils, and not feeling it necessary to mention it.  The Government is stretching deep into the depths of depravity in its approach to this issue, beginning with the soft target of the public sector last week and continuing with threats to the minimum wage yesterday.  I hate to use the clich&eacute; but these people must be close to the most vulnerable in society.  However, they do not vote, they cannot speak back and some cannot even speak that well.  They are an easy target and we can simply trample all over them.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to re-establish to where it is going.  I do not believe anybody on this side of the House feels any worse about this than anybody on the other side.  Decisions need to be taken.  The attitude is that as long as you are one of the 35,000 millionaires or are earning more than &euro;100,000 per year, you will not be asked to pay anything extra to people earning below that.  The Leader asked us yesterday about the 1%, 2% and 3%.  Everybody in the public and private sectors is paying that.  That is not the issue about which we are talking.  We are talking about the need for progressive taxation.  Those who will be kept safe are those on high incomes and those with substantial assets.  Those who will suffer are those like the children with special needs.</P>
        <P>We will not have seen the backs of these children with special needs and I do not have to produce explanations, surveys or evidence.  These children will come back to us through the care system because they will need extra care further down the line.  They will come back to <Col N="806"/>us in the ranks of the unemployed when we will have to pay them.  They will come back to us when they need housing, when we will need to create sheltered housing.  They will come back to us in the crime and the prison populations.  That will be the result of the decision.</P>
        <P>I cannot believe that the Taoiseach, who I know for more than 20 years, would have consciously taken that decision.  I ask the Leader to ask him to reverse it immediately and make those of us who can afford it pay the price of this recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The news about Anglo Irish Bank is not only deeply disturbing but is unbelievable.  People have not questioned the role of Irish Life &amp; Permanent.  Why did it behave in this manner?  We have heard the phrase &ldquo;cosy arrangements&rdquo; before but if there was ever an example of it, this is it.  We know there will be investigations into this matter.  However, the Labour Party has advocated that a High Court inspector be appointed to investigate all this.  We have enough evidence to say this is fully justified.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We debated the credit institutions financial support scheme while this was going on.  The following morning the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank went on radio to say the bank was okay and that its loans versus assets ratio was fine.  The reality was the books were being cooked.  It is as simple as that.  Irish Life &amp; Permanent facilitated Anglo Irish Bank to ensure its books looked a certain way on the day its profits were announced.</P>
        <P>If an investigation is not initiated which has the full confidence of the people and is backed up by the Judiciary, how can people stand behind the decisions the Government is taking, such as cutting the cervical cancer vaccination programme for young girls and cutting teacher numbers?</P>
        <P>There was a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report into the reconfiguration of hospitals in the mid-west and we have been talking about pay, what people are paid and the sacrifices we are all being asked to make.  This report, which demonstrated that the Government would centralise all services, is being debated in the other House today, which I welcome.  The motion could be stronger, but I support it.  A number of consultants wearing gowns spoke on that programme in a very condescending way, yet the new pay system for these consultants will be announced later this month and many of them will receive large amounts in back pay.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to answer my questions because they have not been answered on previous occasions.  How much will be paid to these consultants in back pay dating back to last June?  Is it justifiable?  What is the range of pay?  Teachers, garda&iacute;, nurses etc. are making sacrifices, yet these people are on &euro;240,000 to &euro;260,000 and are now getting back pay.  Is that equitable?  I do not believe it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Nothing would surprise anybody about Anglo Irish Bank and the activity it has been up to.  There is probably a lot more to come from that particular source.  What was discovered by David Murphy of RTE last night was far more serious because I have never seen more obvious evidence of a cartel being run by the banks than this particular activity which has been revealed for everybody to see.  It is all very well for a cowboy bank like Anglo Irish Bank to carry on in this way &mdash; we got used to that &mdash; but Irish Life and Permanent is one of the pillars of the Irish banking, insurance, assurance world.  It issued a statement last night which was utterly ridiculous and comical.  To see it apparently bail out its friends in Anglo Irish Bank is clear evidence that something is going on which is not in the interests of the taxpayer.  If I were a shareholder in Irish Life &amp; Permanent I would go bananas to think that &euro;7 billion of my money was going to help a rival which was in danger.</P>
        <P>We must remember, because it does not seem to have been picked up, at the time the money was put in on 30 September, the guarantee was not in place.  That money was really at risk.  It <Col N="807"/>had been announced but it was not in place.  It had not passed through these Houses and there was always a danger it would not pass, not just because the Bill could have been defeated but because something could have happened in the meantime which would have altered the situation.</P>
        <P>This was grossly irresponsible.  However, what is even worse is that the statement from Irish Life &amp; Permanent last night gave the distinct impression that this was normal behaviour on behalf of the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That is desperately serious.  The question we must now ask is whether Irish Life &amp; Permanent is doing this for Anglo Irish Bank, and it is normal behaviour, who else is doing it for whomever else?  Is the Bank of Ireland doing it for AIB and <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
        <P>On a day when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will announce that he is putting &euro;7 billion from the pension fund into these banks, is he sure he knows the annual reports, balance sheets and accounts of these banks are in order or credible?  It seems to me that he may be buying a pig in a poke and that the annual reports now being issued by the banks are works of fiction and creative art.  A desperately serious situation has been unveiled and it no longer concerns just Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Life &amp; Permanent but also Bank of Ireland and AIB.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Leader will address this question.  How in the name of God did the auditors of Anglo Irish Bank apparently miss not only the transfer of Mr. FitzPatrick&rsquo;s loans, but an almost parallel activity by another bank where &euro;7 billion was transferred in and out at almost exactly the same time?  It is a desperately serious situation and I intend to raise it as a matter for an urgent debate later on.  I will read it out at the end of the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of issues to raise, with the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, because I did not speak yesterday.  The issue of the banks today does not inspire confidence when one considers that many people are losing their jobs and the public service has to deal with an extraordinary pension levy.</P>
        <P>Yesterday we discussed the antagonism that can arise between the public sector and the private sector.  It has been revealed today that Irish Life &amp; Permanent was involved in skullduggery and it is almost like the carry on of gangsters.  Words fail me and I do not understand how we can have faith in it.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan is today finalising ways in which he can recapitalise the banks using the pension fund, which is quite extraordinary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was at a meeting recently in a rural area in County Westmeath where farmers spoke about money they were promised and a commitment the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, gave to them on grants for slatted sheds to the tune of &euro;400 million.  These people have bridging loans and are under pressure to pay back these godforsaken banks when the Minister has reneged on the whole plan.  I call for his resignation for that reason.  One cannot promise something in good faith and then not give it.</P>
        <P>The farmers must abide by EU regulations in dealing with the nitrates directive.  They built their slatted sheds, borrowed from the banks and are now on bridging loans.  It is an absolute disgrace.  These farmers have lost all of their part-time work in the construction industry and are put to the pin of their collar to pay back loans.  The Minister does not need to come into the House.  I ask the Leader as a matter of urgency to ask the Minister to pay the money committed to the farmers he has promised to help.</P><Col N="808"/>
        <P Just="Left">Another issue I want to raise, which was raised by Senator Butler yesterday, concerns grants for the retrofitting of houses for insulation and heating.  I had a number of calls on Monday, as I am sure my colleagues had, about how one can apply for this money.  There was a great photocall with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the six o&rsquo;clock news on Sunday evening.  Lads were running in and out with radiators and it seemed as though it was happening all over the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have a debate on that if the Leader agrees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no information about the scheme on the SEI website or from local authorities.  In fact, older people are waiting for two years for heating and grants for essential repairs from local authorities.  Older people will be dead before they receive their grants, even for existing essential repairs, yet we have a big announcement about this scheme.  Senator Butler was correct to congratulate the Minister but where is the scheme or the money for it?</P>
        <P>Another matter, which is one I have been raising for a very long time, is the serious issue of head shops.  Are there any developments on this matter?  I raised this issue in the House over a year ago and there are still families and youngsters suffering as a result of this illegal practice.  These people are paying a lot of taxes to the Government because they are running very successful businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We cannot take money from them and condemn them in the same breath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Senators have rightly expressed shock and dismay at the news of the appalling practices between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent.  Who knows, as Senator Ross said, what other banks are engaged in the practice of propping up each other?  It begs the question, if the banks are busy bailing each other out, why on earth are we, as taxpayers, bailing them out?  Could it be that the bailing out has been going on for a long number of years among the banks and we did not know about it?  Our bail out was carried out in good faith &mdash; I voted against it but clearly a majority voted in favour of it &mdash; but we were unaware of the mutual bailing out going on between the banks at the time.  We need another debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business calling on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to come to the House and tell us what on earth is going on with the cutbacks for the education of children with special needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reminded of the phrase which got a British governmental adviser into such trouble some years ago.  It seems like today is a good day to bury bad news, given the major headlines on the loans between Irish Life &amp; Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank.  Clearly other bad news might well be buried on a day like today and this is why we need the Minister to come to the House and tell Members why he is cutting back on education for children with special needs and ending jobs for their teachers at a time when we need more jobs and unemployment is rising.  As Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Fitzgerald have said we will pay in the future for inadequate education for children with special needs.</P><Col N="809"/>
        <P>I remind the House that last night during the debate on education the Minister said, &ldquo;The Government is committed to providing targeted support for special needs and has allocated additional funding of &euro;20 million for 2009 to continue to enhance front-line services for these children&rdquo;, that is, for children with special needs.  How dare the Minister come to the House last night and tell us that, and then announce this morning that he will cut education for children with special needs.  We need to have him in the House.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business and have the Minister come in for half an hour simply to tell Members what on earth he is doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue raised previously by myself and my colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, regarding the legislation on party pills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Keaveney happy with the education cuts?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry Senator Keaveney, but if there are any more interruptions across the floor &mdash; a number of people who wish to contribute are not interrupting &mdash; I will suspend the sitting until Senators settle down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We should find out what the current position is regarding legislation on party pills.  We were trying to have them banned before Christmas.  They have to be banned under EU directives, so I just wonder what is the current position.  Is it planned to bring such legislation before the House in the near future?</P>
        <P>As regards yesterday&rsquo;s debate on education, I am quite surprised that at least two of the three Senators who were complaining about it today were not here yesterday to ask the Minister those questions.</P>

	<P>I am sorry disorder followed my indication that people who spoke earlier had the opportunity to ask questions of the Minister when he was here yesterday.  He spent half an hour responding to the issues raised yesterday evening.  In the context of the announcements with regard to special education, to which the Minister alluded yesterday, will the Leader ensure we are enabled to discuss the role of the National Council for Special Education?</P>
        <P>In my area, we have had an in-depth look at the supports that exist for special education, as most of our special needs assistants were removed by a particular special education needs organiser.  Many of those supports have now been returned.  Some classes needed to have six <Col N="810"/>special needs children to entitle them to special class status, but many only had three or four.  I ask that the National Council for Special Education be proactive in this area.  It should examine schools or clusters of schools to see what is going on nationally and provide support.  In my view the council should be the guardian angel of special needs children.</P>
        <P>Much of this debate was rehearsed yesterday, especially with regard to the fact there is a containment exercise in some respects.  There should instead be forward planning of the goals we want to attain for our special educational needs children.  I know the Minister has committed extra money to this area.  He announced last night that he has provided 50 extra psychologists.  There would be value in having a debate on special education, because I know the Minister will ensure no child is left without adequate supports, even in the context of today&rsquo;s announcements.</P>

	<P>These children are the lowest functioning children.  They have IQs from 50 to 70, when the average IQ is from 90 to 110.  These are cuts at the bottom.  These are the children who need the most help.  Schools get a special class when they have nine or more children with these severe needs in the school.  Now these teachers are being removed.  Some 900 children are being affected and 128 teacher posts lost.  Can the Leader bring the Minister back into the House today to address how he will now provide resources for these children?</P>
        <P>It took four months to get the Minister here in the first place.  It is obvious now that he came in last night because he did not want to answer this question today.</P>

	<P>I am horrified and shocked at the revelations regarding Irish Life &amp; Permanent.  Word came through on this last night during the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting.  People are shell-shocked at what is happening at present.  The Government has been misled with regard to the purchase of Anglo Irish Bank.  If this information had been available prior to it being nationalised, it would have changed the reaction and decision made.  Quite frankly, we bought a pig in a poke.  I am only a small shareholder in Irish Life &amp; Permanent and I believe the management has let down the staff.  I call for the resignation of the chairman, who receives &euro;250,000 a year by the way, and the chief executive of Irish Life &amp; Permanent.</P>

These people feel very let down today.  We do not know where we are going at this point in time.  People do not know the real story with regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  We must remember that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide collaborated on the Sean FitzPatrick loans.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;especially abroad and particularly following a Supreme Court decision on insider trading made in recent years.  Those I meet from outside Ireland cast serious doubts about the credibility of Irish institutions and Irish regulation.  It was very interesting to hear Commissioner Charlie McCreevy on Monday morning speaking about the need for regulation at European level because individual countries are not trusted with regard to their regulation.  Perhaps this is not something he would have suggested normally.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a point with regard to last night&rsquo;s decision to cut funding for special needs children.  I am very disappointed.  We had a very good debate yesterday with the Minister which those of us fortunate enough to be able to participate found interesting and constructive.  We had no idea that during the same afternoon the Minister was issuing a press release telling the world something he did not tell us.</P>

	<P>He came here yesterday and spoke about funding but did not tell us that at the same time he was cutting the special needs budget.  On this basis, I support Senators Bacik and Healy Eames in their call for a debate, even if it is for only half an hour and if all the Minister states is the reason he did not tell us yesterday.  I did not know what he would do.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Health and Children to the problem with two particular drugs which are sold freely in Ireland.  These drugs are involved in cough mixtures but apparently they are very dangerous.  One of them is methamphetamine and the other is pseudoephedrine.  Last year, I wrote to the Minister for Health and Children about this matter, and I understand she does not intend to withdraw them.  However, in the United States and elsewhere now they are not freely available.  They are only available from behind the counter or on prescription and this is a measure we should introduce.  I raised this matter last April and last July in County Offaly the Garda intercepted and arrested a number of people with a large quantity of these drugs which were clearly aimed at the Irish market.  I will write to the Minister again and I ask for the Leader&rsquo;s help to draw her attention to the fact that these are dangerous and they are not just cough mixtures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators McFadden and Keaveney in their call for an update from the Minister for Health and Children on the increase in the number of head shops in the country, in particular with regard to the drug known as BZP.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment last November.  The drug, commonly known as the &ldquo;party pill&rdquo; or &ldquo;legal E&rdquo;, is a synthetic stimulant with the chemical name benzylpiperazine.  It was originally used as a warming treatment for animals.  An EU decision last year made BZP subject to control measures.  A Council decision states quite clearly that, due to its stimulant properties, risk to health and the lack of medical benefits, and following the precautionary principle, there is a need to control BZP.  The EU Council of Ministers decided on 3 March 2008 that the drug should be regulated in accordance with the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971.  I understand EU member states have up to 12 months to introduce legislation to ban the drug.  As 3 March 2009 is fast approaching, I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to state the up-to-date position on introducing such legislation.  I do not believe legislation is necessary to ban the drug and that it could be banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by adding it to the relevant list of banned substances.  I ask the Leader to provide us with an update on this matter urgently because the drug is causing serious damage to the young and most vulnerable in every town.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on the revelations last night concerning the banking sector.  I was very struck by the phrase that our financial institutions need to look after each other during times like these.  Where is this solidarity when small and medium-sized businesses go to the banks looking for help?  They cannot get help at present.</P>
        <P>The reason the recapitalisation proposals that are likely to be discussed in the coming days are to come before the House is because Irish banks cannot obtain private capital from institutional investors abroad.  What institutional investor would, on the basis of the figures we heard last night, be willing to invest in the banks?  Is it not the case that the revelations could deal a hammer blow to the model that has been proposed for recapitalising Irish banks?  It is now even less likely that any international investor will want to invest in these businesses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making this point in a partisan sense but contending that it really goes to the heart of what we are discussing.  We are investing public money because the financial institutions cannot obtain private money.  Who will give private money now?</P>
        <P>I agree strongly with what Senator Leyden said.  What we have witnessed is an act of vandalism that will go to the core of our State.  Nothing less than the fraud squad appearing at the banks alleged to have been involved will give hope to the country and restore the confidence of investors abroad.  If any one of the institutions proposes to pay a bonus to the people sitting on their boards, the Government should impose a levy of 99%.  Every additional cent the board members are seeking should be levied in this manner.  Let us have a levy the entire country can get behind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, is very determined to ensure we have a good, healthy, functioning banking sector.  It is important to acknowledge that thousands of people who have invested in and are working for the financial institutions have done no wrong whatsoever.  They, too, need some encouragement.  While there are instances of concern, we should acknowledge clearly they are isolated in the overall context <Col N="814"/>of the turnover of billions upon billions of euro.  The Government will, with determination, address all the issues and ensure we have a healthy, working financial system that operates in the best interest of everybody required to use the financial institutions.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the responsible Minister to brief the House on the national insulation programme?  I welcome the investment of &euro;100 million in energy efficiency and insulation programmes.  I congratulate Senator Larry Butler, who has pursued this matter at parliamentary party level for some months.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government be invited to the House to brief us on the State housing stock, the local authority loans and sales schemes and, in particular, social and affordable housing options.  The president of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, Mr. Alan Redmond, has called for a review of the income limits for applicants for the new home choice loan scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I took part in yesterday&rsquo;s debate on education, which was good and vigorous.  I took certain electoral risks by supporting elements of Government policy but feel betrayed because the Minister clearly knew there would be cuts to special needs provision.  The people affected are vulnerable, yet every agency or organ of the State that speaks out on their behalf has been dismantled.  There are very few representatives left other than those in this House to speak out on their behalf.  This seems to be parallel to what is occurring with the financial institutions in that people in responsible positions have been concealing toxic elements from the public gaze.  The Minister is doing this and it is absolutely wrong.  I am sorry I did not walk out of the commemoration of the first sitting of the D&aacute;il in 1919 because Members are regurgitating all sorts of ideals but not acting on them.  The Minister should come to the House to explain this.</P>
        <P>I find what is occurring with the banks quite extraordinary.  It seems that it will never stop and there are revelations every day.  The continuous drip, as Senator Quinn referred to it, will certainly affect our international reputation.  It is quite astonishing.  What occurred constitutes deceit and the institutions were concealing things.  Banks were collaborating and there is no question or doubt about it.  Perhaps the fraud squad should become involved.</P>
        <P>What has occurred seems to have been widespread.  This morning on the radio I heard a State agency, Dublin Docklands Development Authority, is now refusing to pay interest to a bank that is owned by the taxpayers.  What is going on?  The same cast of characters continues to appear in regard to this issue.  Will the Leader allow the question to be asked whether, at this stage and in these circumstances, it is appropriate to hazard another &euro;7 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money in this financial maelstrom?</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Kelly, Ross, McFadden, Leyden, O&rsquo;Brien, Quinn, Donohoe, Callely and Norris expressed strong views on the latest announcements from banking circles and the allegations regarding the bank culture that has obtained in Ireland for some considerable time.  I acknowledge the views of Senator Quinn on the danger that private investment in the banks will not be forthcoming.  This is very serious.</P>
        <P>I expect legislation to be forthcoming for our consideration on the recapitalisation of the banks.  As soon as the information becomes available to me from Government I will liaise with the Cathaoirleach and the leaders of the various groups.  I put the House on notice that there may be a sitting or an extension of a sitting day in the very near future.  We will discuss and deliberate on the issue at length.  I have no difficulty in allocating whatever time is required by Senators to express their views in the House.  I refer in particular to those Senators who have expertise in the financial world that predates their becoming Members of the House.  They can make their views known on the floor of the House live on television with the Minister present to the benefit of the nation.</P>
        <P>It is a serious situation in which we find ourselves.  It is no pleasure for the Government to have to put &euro;7 billion into the two main banks at present, but it has to be done so that commerce can continue.  The lifeblood of business in Ireland is credit and it is not available to most operations currently.  The situation has improved slightly from what it was.</P>
        <P>We all know now why there was a delay in the Taoiseach and Government putting together a master plan.  We did not know the situation fully until we put directors into the banks.  I compliment the former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the former Minister for <Col N="816"/>Finance, who are directors at the present time, on their hard work and endeavour in Anglo Irish Bank.  Until we put directors into all of the banks we will not know the full extent of the problem.  One cannot implement the master plan until one knows at least 80% of the extent of the problem.</P>
        <P>The revelations emerged on a weekly basis but now they are coming out on an hourly basis and are shocking.  It has been said this morning that those of us who are here for the longest time have never seen anything like what is happening now.  It is unprecedented.  We need expertise, guidance, help and assistance from all parties, right across the political persuasion in both Houses to meet the challenges that are facing us.  At the end of the day it is people and jobs that really matter.  Everything must be focused around jobs.  It is a serious situation when 6.5% of the working public is paying 50% of our income tax.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science was very welcome to the House yesterday.  It was a stimulating debate and exchange of views.  Regarding the statement that emerged last night on learning support class size, I will request the Minister to come back to the House.  The allocation to schools typically increased or decreased according to pupil enrolments.  In the case of classes for mild general learning disability a minimum of nine pupils is required to retain a teaching post.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be related to disability not numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of 128 classes in 119 schools, the number of pupils dropped below the minimum.  Those schools therefore are no longer entitled to the teaching posts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for those classes.  On the other hand, of 80 schools, 17 will now be due an additional post when the pupils in question are divided among the mainstream classes.  Essentially, the loss of the teaching posts from the mild classes will be offset by the additional posts required to maintain the lower class sizes because of their disadvantaged categorisation.  I will endeavour to have the Minister come back to the House to explain the issue in minute detail to colleagues and for a debate to take place on the issue on which colleagues have strong views.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McFadden raised the worthwhile topic of a grant for slatted sheds.  As we all know, that has been the backbone responsible for keeping many people in the construction industry employed in the midlands area in particular in the past 18 months.  It was a wonderful idea to bring forward.  Those of us who are familiar with everyone involved in the construction industry, especially in my part of north Westmeath, will know that has been decimated.  The unemployment exchange in Castlepollard has the third highest number of people signing on in the country.  It is no pleasure for me to say that.  As the House is aware, in north Westmeath we are totally dependent on the motor industry and the construction industry, <Col N="817"/>whether it be gravel, sandpits or ready-mix concrete.  That grant has kept many people in employment.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, who comes from a neighbouring parish just down the road, across the bridge of Finnea in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, has been strong in his support for the grant but the huge amount of applicants availing of it has surprised everyone in the Department.  The amount of money that has been allocated is approximately &euro;400 million.  I am speaking from memory so I am open to correction on that figure.  We will do everything we possibly can, Senator McFadden and I as two Westmeath Senators, along with Senator Glynn, to see what we can do to ensure that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I wholeheartedly welcomed the national insulation programme yesterday that was announced last Sunday.  The sum of &euro;160 million is significant in these difficult times.  I welcome in particular the allocation of &euro;50 million for local authorities for roof and wall insulation and the replacement of high efficiency gas and oil fired boilers, heating control upgrades and the building energy rating.  All that is welcome.  I support all the calls that have been made in that regard.  I am sure the instruction and qualification leaflets will be available in the next day or two.

We have seen all-party concern about the matter.  It is almost a national emergency.  The cancer of this banking crisis has now spread outside the area of Anglo Irish Bank.

    <Title>Gas (Amendment) Bill 2008: Committee and Remaining Stages. </Title>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The section primarily provides for an increase in the borrowing allowance of Bord G&aacute;is from the current amount of &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  We understood from Second Stage that the &euro;1.7 billion would be reached in 2009.  We note that while that borrowing may take place in euro, foreign currency is also included.  Given the volatility we have seen in the currency markets in recent times, it begs the question as to the policy that will be pursued by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann with regard to hedging.  How will that currency risk be managed?  It is an important issue because obviously any revaluation of the currency in which it borrows would <Col N="820"/>have an adverse impact on the &euro;3 billion &mdash; it could limit it.  Obviously if the currency decreases the company would gain.  However, that is like betting on a currency.  Given that we are members of the euro, which is now probably one of the two or three strongest currencies on world market, why is it necessary to allow that foreign currency element within it?  Presumably all the borrowings will be for investment in our system here whether that is in the networks or in new generating capacity.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks we have heard much about the cost of our energy.  I know this is a matter in which the Minister of State has taken a keen interest.  I have heard him both in this House and at our parliamentary party meetings on a number of occasions deal with queries in that regard.  It has become a major issue for consumers and business.  Competitiveness in the economy is a very topical and important issue.  In recent days I read newspaper reports that the entry of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann into the electricity market will have a beneficial impact on prices.  I believe I read that it would result in a 10% reduction in the price of electricity.  If that is going to generate real competition in that sector, obviously that is a good thing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The purpose of increasing the borrowing allowance in this section is to allow for the large Bord G&aacute;is capital programme up to 2012.  That will be both on the procurement and supply side.  Of other countries with natural resources, one comes to mind.  Approximately 20 years ago people in Sweden, which one associates with considerable timber supplies, approached Ireland seeking wood trimmings.  I am familiar with it because it was exported to Sweden through the port of New Ross.  I remember asking representatives of the Swedish state company Dom&auml;nverket, the counterpart of Coillte here, what was the purpose, given the strong supply of forests in Sweden.  They told me it was to conserve their own supplies of wood.  I regard this as a very astute approach.  I wonder what we could be doing with regard to procurement of gas which is a finite natural resource although we were fortunate in finding more gas off the west coast.</P>
        <P>I note the intention to improve the network so that the supply of gas can be enhanced.  I refer to my area and the other seven counties out of the 32 which currently do not have a gas supply.  It is imperative to redress this situation as these counties would figure low on any scale of economic indicators.  As a consequence a natural gas supply to those counties would be a particular aid to attracting industry and improving competitiveness for existing industries in those counties.  I hope something can be done in that regard.  I acknowledge there are cost factors and that an evaluation has been carried out.  In the times in which we live, the remit of Bord G&aacute;is should be to ensure a 32-county supply of what is a natural resource.</P>
        <P>I note the borrowing will also enable them to invest in increased generating capacity, both conventional generation of electricity and renewables.  I have stated on other occasions in the House that gas is a primary fuel and it is a very clean fuel for the generation of electricity.  However, it seems to be somewhat wasteful of a primary fuel and a natural resource to use it for the generation of electricity, particularly given that it is a clean fuel.  Fossil fuels and oil form a major role in electricity generation.  While gas is playing its part we also have coal-fired generation but the nature of coal is adding to our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> problems.  There is an expectation that clean coals will become available and could be used.  In my view we should aim to preserve our gas supply.  I am not an energy economist but I question the use of such an important fuel which is within our jurisdiction for the generation of electricity.  The concentration on renewables should perhaps be the sole concentration of the investment in electricity generation.  A target of 30% by 2020 or 2025 for the use of renewable energy has been set.  We also need to have energy independence given the finite resource and the volatility of fossil fuels.  There are also issues regarding CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>, fuel and climate change but there will also be a significant price to pay.  It is predicted that the cost of oil, although currently depressed, will increase considerably <Col N="821"/>once there is a global economic upturn.  The Department has been pursuing a policy of renewable use.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The borrowing is for all of this purpose and this is the reason I am trying to deal with it in the absence of any amendments so we can get as much information as possible from the Minister of State who was very forthcoming on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill that the investment made by Bord G&aacute;is will be subject to prior approval of the Minister and the Department.  This is an important consideration when borrowings are being increased.  On a previous occasion I noted that while interest rates are currently low, there is a risk that when we eventually emerge from this deep recession we could end up with hyper-inflation, as is predicted by some economists.  One of the ways of controlling hyper-inflation will be to increase interest rates.  The prudential way in which companies approach their borrowing and the currency in which they borrow and the manner in which they are able to anticipate significant interest increases which may happen in the medium term, is an important issue also.</P>

	<P>&Aacute;r dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  As I said on Second Stage, I welcome this amending legislation and I accept the principle and the practice that Bord G&aacute;is should be fit to borrow more money, implement its corporate plan and expand its business.  Before I make my remarks about control, we have no reason but to have absolute confidence in the management and staff of Bord G&aacute;is and there is nothing to impugn their integrity or their actions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the fact the Minister and the Department will have ultimate control and sanction over the spending of the money.  I wish to make a broader point.  I refer to the early history of the State and this aspect might be worthy of study.  We are still quite a young State.  The first couple of Governments of this State had a very hands-on approach to the management of the public finances.  Every Minister was hands-on and implemented their executive authority.  They had a sense of their own executive authority, a sense they were to act in the public good and a sense they were there to control, structure and implement.  This is very visible in the history of both Administrations at the beginning, the initial Cumann na nGaedheal Administration followed by the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration.  This was a feature of the founding ages of our State.  I know government and society has become more complex but we are still fundamentally the same State and same people.  We now have a culture of no control and a culture where control has effectively gone outside the door.  The regulator took it very easy with the banking sector &mdash; far too easy.  I will make a political point.  The Government has not acted in a sufficiently executive manner and has not been sufficiently hands-on in its approach.  It is a Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to know where all the moneys are spent in the Department.  In a country of this size it should not be beyond the competence of an effective Minister and his junior Minister to have a handle on how moneys are spent, where they are going and where there is a wastage of money.  To this extent I am happy there is a system of control but it is important that this control is implemented across the board.  There is no more glaring omission of regulation in the State.  It is a huge indictment of the Government.  The Government must stand condemned in its failure to do anything effective to control energy costs.  If one was to chronicle the Government&rsquo;s failures, this would rank high on the list.  The price increases for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB were given at a time when oil cost &euro;140 a barrel.  Now oil prices are approximately &euro;40 a barrel.  It is untenable, unsupportable and unacceptable that energy prices have not fallen dramatically months ago.</P><Col N="822"/>
        <P>Yesterday, the managing director of a major chicken processing factory in Cavan told me his plant&rsquo;s annual energy bill is approximately &euro;1.25 million.  The regulator should have been insisting on the reduction of energy prices for some time.  I hope there will be a hands-on approach by the Government to this.  The country needs hands-on government.  What is the point of a democracy otherwise?  Will the Minister of State explain to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB that their prices are way out of line for consumers?</P>
        <P>I accept worthy corporate objectives have been set down but none of them justifies current energy prices.  The energy regulator introduced a red herring when he said the ESB purchased six months of oil supplies at high prices earlier last year, hence there could be no reduction.  That is a fallacy.  It has always had the policy to have a back stock of oil.  Surely when oil prices dropped, its next six-month supply came in at the same lower price.</P>
        <P>We need control of energy prices.  If we are to facilitate this amending legislation, we need to know the Minister&rsquo;s good faith in price control.  We could not, as a democratic assembly of the people, accept this amending legislation on any other terms.  Raging energy prices are a huge disincentive to business and industry and cause fuel poverty among our old people.  It is time for action on energy prices.</P>
        <P>I am enthusiastic about supporting the amending legislation because it will provide for committing Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to develop renewable energy sources.  It recently purchased a substantial wind farm for &euro;80 million and will continue to develop wind energy.  It is also good Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is entering the electricity generation market and will become a competitor of the ESB.  I take the point made by my friend, Senator Walsh, that it will help to bring down prices.  That, and timely and necessary Government intervention, will bring down prices.</P>
        <P>It is important Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann purchases more wind farms and links up with farmers who have developed co-operative wind farms.  The creamery co-operative model initiated by Horace Plunkett did wonders for Ireland.  I accept there are problems with current milk prices and our co-operatives have gone off the rails by becoming plcs.  That, however, is for a different debate.  The co-operative movement was excellent for Ireland and pulled us up by the shoe laces, making us what we are today.  The co-operative principle should be brought to alternative energy projects.  Farmers should be brought together to form wind farms as a mutual investment for a co-operative energy supply for the national grid.  We also have yet to exploit wave energy.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage I raised Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s investment in gas storage facilities.  This is important in ensuring security of supply, particularly when one observes what recently happened between the Ukraine and Russia.  Security of supply is no longer assured.  I accept the Russia-Ukraine stand-off does not directly affect Ireland&rsquo;s supply.  However, it was a timely warning and it is important we work on security of supply.  However, if we had a good and properly developed renewables sector, it would ensure an indigenous supply of domestic energy.  The commitment to storage is a welcome facet of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s corporate plan and a further reason to be confident about giving it the latitude to increase its borrowing limits to &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s track record to date has been good.  However, it is necessary for it to extend the network to the last remaining 12 counties.  This comes back to control and regulation.  There will have to be a hands-on approach to these matters.  The Minister of State should be knocking heads together, demanding the network is extended to the remaining 12 counties.  The Oireachtas has made recommendations and approved amendments to the gas Acts to allow extra borrowing.  This should, therefore, be linked to the importance of extending gas supply to the 12 countries that still do not have access to it.</P><Col N="823"/>
        <P>Prices must be slashed.  There is no reason there cannot be a 20% reduction for the consumer.  There is no reason the Minister cannot bring in the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to get results on this.  The House is giving unanimous support to the Bill.  The Minister of State must say, bona fide, he will act on energy prices.  We must also act on developing the renewable energy sector.  Renewables have merits in reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and saving us from Kyoto fines.  It would also help in boosting the construction industry.  Building wind turbines would constitute a large construction project which would provide much employment.  We must act on the green energy agenda now.  The time for platitudes and aspirations on this is over.</P>
        <P>Security of energy supply is important and we should reaffirm Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s commitment to invest in storage facilities.  Fine Gael will support this amending legislation, as it did in the D&aacute;il.  It gives an endorsement and latitude to a company to implement what I believe is a good corporate plan.  All we need are assurances from the Minister of State that he will be the people&rsquo;s champion in getting stuck into ensuring targeted price reductions are made.  These individuals are ultimately answerable to taxpayers and the Oireachtas.  We may have gone too far with deregulation, in that there is a lack of control, and with the <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to Government.  We must call a halt in this regard because matters have become too serious.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Gas (Amendment) Bill for Committee Stage consideration in the Seanad.  The Bill has one provision, namely, to increase the statutory borrowing limit that applies in respect of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann from the existing figure of &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  Its enactment will give the company the legal ability to access funds to develop the strategic direction set out in its five-year corporate plan up to 2012 and beyond.</P>
        <P>The Bill amends section 23 of the Gas Act 1976, which provides for borrowings by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann for capital purposes.  It is unusual that amendments have not been tabled in respect of the Bill.  I thank Members for their co-operation with the Bill to date.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with a number of the issues raised by Senators Walsh and O&rsquo;Reilly during their extremely constructive contributions.  As stated on previous occasions, the monopoly of wisdom does not lie solely on one side of the House and it is important to take on the views of all Members.</P>
        <P>The use of gas to produce electricity is the cleanest form of generation outside renewables.  Gas-fired plants will increasingly be used as back-up to wind-generated electricity.  The emphasis, however, will be firmly placed on developing renewables.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to the dangers attached to borrowing.  In the past, we used to refer to borrowing millions and people would become somewhat uncomfortable.  More recently, however, the talk has been of borrowing billions.  Most people might not even be sure of the number of zeroes in 1 billion.  We are discussing major amounts of money and increasing Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s abilities by expanding its borrowing capacity.  There is no doubt that the company is taking on a major responsibility.  However, it has been in existence for over 30 years, has proven itself to be an extremely capable performer and has played its part in developing the economy.</P>
        <P>The treasury department of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will seek the best value on offer in the markets at any particular time and the Bill gives it the necessary flexibility to do so.  In the past, the company has taken the steps required to minimise risk, which is a job in itself.  I am satisfied that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will proceed in a professional way and will minimise the risks involved to the best possible extent.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is examining the possibility of storing gas in salt mines.  It has made a provision of up to &euro;200 million in its capital plan in respect of such a project.</P><Col N="824"/>
        <P>The issue of pricing was discussed in some detail during last week&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; business in the D&aacute;il.  We have asked the regulator to examine the possibility of bringing forward a much earlier reduction in prices.  The costs relating to oil and gas have been low in recent months and we would like this to be reflected in the price consumers are obliged to pay for the energy they use.  In August of last year, enormous price increases were sought in respect of gas and electricity.  At that stage, the regulator decided to adopt a new approach by granting an increase of approximately 50% of the amounts sought.  The regulator then agreed to review the position later in the year.  This was done in December, by which time the position globally had changed dramatically.  As a result, the price of one form of energy remained the same and there was a slight decrease in respect of the other.</P>
        <P>There are a number of factors at play with regard to oil and gas.  However, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced last week that we could expect a further &mdash; possibly a double digit &mdash; reduction in energy prices in the near future.  We asked the regulator to meet the stakeholders and to return to us with a number of options within a matter of three to four weeks.  These will then be presented to Government.  I am satisfied that we will be in a position to reduce the price of energy further.  That price is a major factor, particularly in respect of the level of competitiveness to which everyone is referring at present in the context of the threat to jobs in different sectors.</P>
        <P>Over 50% of electricity produced in this country is generated through the use of gas.  As Senators are aware, gas was discovered in recent years off the west coast at Corrib.  The find in question will have a lifespan of approximately 15 years.  Unfortunately, we encountered a number of obstacles and difficulties in trying to bring the gas ashore but we are as committed as ever to doing so.  Recent events have clearly demonstrated the need to develop the project and ensure that the gas is brought ashore as quickly as possible.  This gas should provide up to 60% of the country&rsquo;s needs during the 15 year lifespan to which I refer.  It is a considerable resource.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the recent difficulties involving Russia and Ukraine.  These illustrated the need to ensure, to the greatest possible extent, that there is security of supply.  When one is depending on other countries which are dealing with their own problems, one realises the risks involved.  What happened in the case of Russia and Ukraine highlighted, in no uncertain terms, the need to develop our own sources of energy.  As an island nation, Ireland has resources which have remained underdeveloped for a long period.  We were probably slow to commence projects relating to wind and wave energy in particular.  However, much progress has been made in recent years and we will continue with our efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>The area of renewable energy has attracted much investment in recent times.  Various sectors are feeling the pinch as a result of the credit crunch and the difficulties being experienced in the global economy at present.  The energy sector, particularly as it relates to renewables, offers great hope for the future.  There has been a major increase in the amount of money invested in this sector.  When one considers the ambitious targets we have set in respect of renewables, it makes sense that people should engage in such investment.  The future is bright as regards the renewable energy sector.  The Government will continue its support for the sector.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to competitiveness and the importance of a further reduction in energy prices.  In recent years, we have imported over 90% of our energy needs, which makes us extremely vulnerable.  This illustrates the importance of developing alternative sources of energy.  We have focused our efforts on making progress in this regard and on reducing our <Col N="825"/>level of dependency in the coming years.   We have ambitious targets for renewable energy and I am sure we will be able to maintain the significant progress made in recent years.</P>
        <P>On comparisons between Irish energy prices and those of other European countries, while price is important, it is not the only factor one must consider.  In Spain, for example, consumers must still pay the outstanding cost of providing energy infrastructure.  The cheap energy Spanish people currently enjoy will not last forever and energy prices will increase substantially at some point.  Moreover, many Irish people would find it objectionable if the State were to adopt the nuclear option pursued by France.  Factors other than price are at work in many cases.</P>
        <P>Ireland was late in entering the race to develop renewable sources of energy and is probably paying the price for this failure.  Nevertheless, the Government is serious about tackling the cost of energy.  As the Minister indicated recently, a double-digit decrease in energy prices is anticipated in the near future.  I will be pleased to address any other issues Senators may wish to raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on the Bill, the purpose of which is to amend section 23 of the Gas Act 1976 to allow Bord G&aacute;is to complete its ambitious plans.  I will speak generally on the price of energy, particularly gas.  Gas bills for the most recent billing period, which includes Christmas, doubled for most people in my constituency.  Elderly people are now afraid to switch on their heating systems, which is a serious matter.  Small businesses such as hotels and the catering industry are also affected and I am aware of a number of businesses collapsing as a result of the excessive cost of energy.  While the Minister has given a commitment to take action, he must do so quickly because the increase in the cost of energy is a significant drain on many businesses.</P>
        <P>Consumers and business people are asking why gas and electricity prices are increasing at a time of falling oil prices.  This does not make sense but no one has explained the reason.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly noted, we must consider the use of alternative sources of energy.  Years ago, in many counties, notably Cavan and Monaghan, water provided the main source of energy for a large number of industries such as tanneries, factories and mills.  We must seriously consider harnessing water to generate energy, perhaps by reverting to the use of mill races.  Considerable research has been done in this area.  We must encourage and incentivise those with know-how who are willing to develop energy sources such as wave, wind and water.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s new initiative to provide grants for insulation works as it will create a significant number of jobs.  Clearly, given the large number of inquiries Members are receiving about the programme, take-up will be substantial.  The scheme is a good move for consumers as it will create employment and give people a lift in these recessionary times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the response of the Minister of State who consistently demonstrates a firm grasp of the issues in this complex field.  Both Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and I emphasised the importance of competitiveness.  The Minister of State echoed the Minister&rsquo;s comments in the other House about the likelihood of a double-digit reduction in energy prices.  Such a move would be welcome to consumers and businesses in the current climate.  It behoves us all to play our part in solving the current economic problems and Senators from all sides have articulated this need in a constructive manner.  While we are all loath to accept a decrease in our living standards, it will be inescapable in the current global recession.</P>
        <P>Recent increases in energy bills have caused angst among domestic and business users.  The Minister acknowledged the need to ensure we have a competitive climate in which businesses can operate and emphasised the importance of competitiveness in the areas for which his Department has responsibility.  The purpose of these efforts is to achieve efficiencies and retain the maximum possible number of jobs during a period when Ireland, Britain, the rest of Europe <Col N="826"/>and the United States are haemorrhaging jobs.  Unemployment is devastating families and is probably the greatest affliction a person can experience in an economic downturn.  I welcome efforts being made in this regard.</P>
        <P>The ESB competes with Bord G&aacute;is in the field of electricity generation.  Those who live in proximity to a generating station will be aware of the spending power exercised by ESB employees in their area.  I understand the average salary among the 6,000 ESB staff is in the order of &euro;76,000, a considerable sum.  I was astonished to learn the company increased pay in the current climate.  While people are entitled to pay increases in normal circumstances, everyone must be conscious of the impact of their actions on those whose wages are being substantially reduced &mdash; it is not uncommon to hear of private sector salaries being cut by 15% &mdash; and the large number of people who are losing their jobs.  The ESB&rsquo;s decision to hold wages to the current level for the next two years is a belated but necessary and welcome step.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State noted the Government&rsquo;s strong emphasis on renewable energy sources, and investment in wind energy and wind farms has been significant.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the co-operative society movement.  When I was chairman of a co-operative we used to hold meetings in Horace Plunkett&rsquo;s house.  Co-operatism and volunteerism will come back in vogue in the current climate and should be promoted.  We have learned of the excesses of some of those who control capitalist corporations and the manner in which they salted the books on their shareholders and others.  We must ensure these practices do not recur.  We should encourage the values which prevail in the co-operative movement.  Technology in the wave and tidal energy area is not as developed as it might be.  What emphasis, if any, is Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann putting on that area as distinct from wind energy?  This is an island country and if technology can be developed to extract energy efficiently from wave and tidal power, it would be a great advantage to us.  Obviously, it would be very clean energy.  Given the interconnectors we are building and on which so much emphasis is being placed by the Department and the Minister, it would perhaps open avenues to export energy.  Has Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann a remit and commitment in that area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his thorough replies and genuine effort to address the issues raised.  I was not entirely happy with his reply on energy prices.  I would like him to tell the House that there will be action on energy prices this month.  He mentioned double digit figures, as did the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  We should be talking about a 20% reduction.  Let us be radical about this.  Employment and many businesses depend on low energy prices as do old people who are in need and who are finding it difficult to live.  It has been a particularly difficult and long winter and those old people need that reduction in energy prices.</P>
        <P>It would be great if the Minister did something radical within the calendar month.  I do not see why the regulator could not talk to the interested parties and the Minister within three days and implement the reduction by the weekend.  If it will take the rest of this month, so be it but it should not go beyond the end of the month.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge a point made by Senator Martin Brady who hails from the beautiful drumlin county from which I hail.  He said that for generations, the traditional mills were powered by water, by the native streams and rivers of the area.  There were flax and corn mills all along the streams.  That was the case in Cavan and Monaghan and the traditional mills were very famous.  There was one close to where I live in Bailieborough.</P>
        <P>As Senator Martin Brady said, this water energy should again be harnessed and used to generate electricity for domestic supply at a minimum.  Why not have surplus supply sold to <Col N="827"/>the grid?  We must become imaginative about this.  I would like the Minister of State to address that.  As I said earlier and at length on Second Stage, wave energy is critical.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State tell the House that before 1 March, there will be a 20% reduction in energy prices across the board?  That would be an adequate response by Government to what is a very serious situation.  We cannot continue to be another report, study or meeting with the regulator away from action.  We need it now.  Again, I thank the Minister of State for his replies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their very positive contributions.  I very much appreciate their support in progressing the Bill through Committee Stage.  The Bill has been passed by the D&aacute;il and will make its way to the President for consideration and signature into law.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, we are attempting to increase the statutory borrowing limit of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann from its existing &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  This will provide the company with the legal ability to access funds to develop its strategic direction which it has outlined on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has been in operation for over 30 years and in that time, it has developed the gas network which runs to almost 12,500 km of pipeline serving over 600,000 customers.  The expansion of its natural gas network in the past 30 years has ensured that a clean, efficient and environmentally clean fuel is available to a considerable portion of the population.  Another portion of the population does not have the opportunity to avail of this fuel and I hope we can increase that service throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The board has made a critical contribution to the development of the economy in many ways.  Major infrastructure projects delivered by the board over the past 12 years have been on time and within budget.  They include the pipeline to the west, from Dublin to Galway and on to Limerick; the South-North pipeline, from Dublin to Belfast; the Mayo-Galway pipeline, which will facilitate the transportation of Corrib gas to the Irish market; the north-west pipeline from Belfast to Derry; and the second gas interconnector with Scotland, which has secured the supply of gas to Ireland since its completion in 2002.</P>
        <P>In that time, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has paid close to &euro;700 million to the Exchequer in dividends.  An increased ability to borrow funds will allow Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to develop the gas network further over the next five years and it is planned to extend the network by a further 1,500 km and to connect another 150,000 new customers during that period.  For safety reasons, all remaining cast iron pipelines will be replaced by polyethylene pipes.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will also invest in new systems and technology to improve its customer service further.</P>
        <P>Wave energy was mentioned and the possibility of further investment in that regard.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is actively involved in the development of renewable energy.  At present the focus is mainly on wind energy but it is also looking at various methods of generating electricity through renewable sources.  The technology in regard to wave energy is very much in its infancy and at an early stage of development.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is very keen to support the development of this technology through its strategic investment division with a view to securing a varied portfolio of renewable generation.</P>
        <P>The emphasis has been on the wind energy area and it is obvious technology in that area is much further advanced and developed.  One can see it working quite well around the country.  We are still very conscious of the resource we have off our shore and are very keen to develop that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly asked about energy prices.  A review of the price was not due for some time but we have asked for one to take place as a matter of urgency.  The regulator will meet <Col N="828"/>interested parties over the next few weeks and we expect he will come back and present options to us in three to four weeks when the matter will be brought before Government.  From our point of view, that cannot happen quickly enough.  As the Senator will be aware, the responsibility of setting prices is not something that rests on the Minister&rsquo;s shoulder but is the regulator&rsquo;s job.  We are anxious that the regulator does his job and that we get a decision on this as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>While Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s safety standards are of the highest quality, there is no room for complacency and there is always room for improvement.</P>
      
        <P>The board will continue its endeavours to further improve its emergency response standards and pipeline safety standards.  It is now taking a leading role in the energy sector generally as well as building a portfolio of electricity generating assets, including the 445 MW plant at Whitegate and other wind-based renewable projects it is seeking to develop.</P>
        <P>A retail domestic electricity business provides much needed competition in that sector.  We talked about reducing pricing, something on which we could all agree.  There is nothing better than competition to reduce prices.  We encourage it and it continues to be our policy.</P>
        <P>There have been many contributions today and last week, not only by Members of this House, but also by Members of the D&aacute;il on the provision of natural gas to various locations around the country, which to date have not yet been connected to the natural gas network.  As I said before, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is obliged to have regard for economic factors when assessing the potential for rolling out its gas network and in some cases it is just not economically feasible to bring gas to particular locations.</P>
        <P>I know Members on all sides are anxious and make the case that gas be provided to particular areas such as small villages.  We cannot ignore the economics of that.  If it is not viable to bring gas into one area, people who are receiving it pay more than they should for it.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has made some changes to the way it deals with areas.  Instead of dealing with an area on its own, it can now be dealt with as one of a cluster, which means more areas can receive gas.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has always tried to be as flexible and as innovative as possible when examining the economic feasibility of delivering gas to locations.  It proposed to the regulator that the economic criteria for assessing towns might be amended so that instead of looking at locations individually, towns could be grouped before the economic criteria are assessed.  This proposal was accepted by the regulator and it resulted in several towns being connected, whereas under the previous policy this would not have been possible.  Under its new towns analysis established in line with the new assessment criteria, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is close to completing phase 3.  Hopefully, several more towns will have been found to meet the required economic criteria for connection to the network.</P>
        <P>All these developments are in line with the Government&rsquo;s energy policy framework document up to 2020, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, which provides for the sustainable development of the State energy companies as well as ensuring environmental sustainability, security of supply and competition in the energy sector for the benefit of customers.</P>
        <P>There has been much discussion recently on gas prices.  As I mentioned before, the gas business section of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation, which allows it a regulated rate of return on its transportation business.  It can only recover costs on investments approved by the regulator.  In setting the rate of return, it applies the cost and level of borrowing of an efficiently operated and financed company with comparable systematic risks to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</P><Col N="829"/>
        <P>However, rising energy costs are a major concern.  The two-phase approach to tariff regulation adopted by the regulator last year resulted in price increases in the Irish market which were lower than those in some other markets, where increases in gas tariffs of over 40% were imposed.  The Irish gas tariff increase was 20%.  In taking this approach, it took account of the difficult economic situation and the impact of price increases on business and consumers.</P>
        <P>While the regulator is required to ensure that regulated tariffs are cost reflective, the Minister has asked it to look at the possibility of lowering energy costs to consumers in a non-distortionary fashion through an expedited review of tariffs.  If current trends in energy prices, particularly gas, continue, a double digit cut in gas prices might be feasible later this year.  Looking at the long-term pricing of gas, there is no reason that cannot be achieved and we are very confident it will be.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that swift action is taken in the interests of energy consumers.</P>
        <P>The part played by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in the development of the Irish economy for more than 30 years has been significant.  We have a robust gas supply network with a secure supply in the long term.  This security of supply of natural gas has also supported investment in electricity generation in Ireland in recent years.  I thank the Members of this House for their support for the proposed increase in the statutory borrowing limit for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to &euro;3 billion and for the passing of this Bill through all Stages in a very efficient manner.  I acknowledge the very constructive contributions from Members.</P>

	<P>I compliment the Minister of State.  Many Ministers come into the House, but he has shown himself to be very <i>au fait</i> with the issues that come before us.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly is involved with the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and knows it covers a wide, broad and complex range of activities.  It can be quite challenging to keep oneself briefed and up to speed on everything.  I commend the Minister of State in that regard.  I know he is well assisted by some very good civil servants who have been with him here.  There is a lot of debate on the public service and private sector at the moment.  We are fortunate that there are excellent people working within the public service who are indispensable to the services we provide.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment concerns the deletion of the reference to Bantry and the amalgamation with Cork.  In 2005, when Mr. Vivian O&rsquo;Callaghan was the chairman of Bantry harbour board, a senior official from the Department, who shall remain nameless, visited the harbour board by prior arrangement and had a meeting with the full board.  The official suggested that Bantry harbour authority should engage in a due diligence process with Cork Port.  A cast-iron guarantee was given to the full board &mdash; because they had concerns that I am aware of &mdash; that any proposed merger with Cork would not and could not happen until the due diligence process was completed and full and frank negotiations took place between Bantry and Cork.  Even at that stage, a clear assurance was given that such a merger would only take place after prior agreement by both boards.  This section flies in the face of that clearly pronounced policy commitment of the then Minister and his Department.</P>
        <P>The question of due diligence is critical in this respect.  I do not have the exact date but at that juncture proposals were put in letters from the Department.  It was quite open and fair, and there was not a knee-jerk reaction by the board on that date.  They considered the matter at length and said they were not going to shut out any possible change.  As a result of a meeting <i>in camera</i>, and following phone calls and possibly letters, the Department and Minister of the day were informed that if options were available, including a potential merger with Cork, they would enter into talks.  That meeting subsequently took place or was initiated.</P>
        <P>Why was the due diligence process put in place initially?  I do not want an immediate answer but we can perhaps consider it in the course of the evening or on the next occasion.  This due diligence was taken up as an option by Bantry in good faith.  Why was it initiated in 2005 at the request of the then Minister and his Department under Government policy?  Why was that process not completed before this Bill was published?  That is a matter of serious concern.  If negotiations are going on &mdash; like the peace process in the North &mdash; but there is no frankness and openness, then there is a lack of trust.  That lack of trust is now palpable at local level.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>By agreement with the Department, it was decided that Cork Port, at its expense and through its own experts, would go down the road of due diligence. A draft report was submitted by Cork Port to the Department some time ago, but Bantry Port did not receive a copy of that due diligence report.  I am amazed and astounded by this, especially in view of the talk of some kind of a merger.  This Bill is more like a shotgun wedding than a courtship and despite the fact consultation was promised, there has been none.  Although the report submitted by Cork Port was only a draft report, why was it not provided to Bantry Port?  I do not want a casual answer on this.  I am aware there were difficulties with regard to legal title, buying foreshore rights and the railway pier.  Dealing with these issues took longer than anticipated, but they have been sorted out.</P>
        <P>The due diligence report was initiated at the request of the Department and the then Minister but was never completed.  The burning question therefore is why the draft report was concealed from the Bantry authority.  It requested the report, but the Department wrote back saying it could not compel Cork Port to provide the report to Bantry Port because it was produced by Cork Port.  However, I contend it was initiated as part of Government policy and, from the point of view of where we are headed with this Bill, I find it disturbing that it was not sent to Bantry.  If the draft report was given to the Department, there was an onus on it or the Minister of the day to share its contents with the Bantry Port authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I, as a public representative, never saw the report because it was concealed.  What is the reason for the furtiveness and secrecy when there is talk about amalgamation and mergers?  Hundreds of people in the Bantry area want to know the reason the draft due diligence report was not submitted.  Why was the necessary time not allowed for the process to be completed so that a final due diligence report would be produced and shared?</P>
        <P>I am probably quite emotive because I feel strongly about this.  The due diligence process was to be the foundation stone for Bantry Harbour and its future.  Over the years, different options were put forward.  The preferred option was that Bantry would stand alone, as it is doing.  The attitude was not to touch it as it was making a few bob and was not costing the State much.  It was transparent and complied with corporate governance.</P>
        <P>I contend the due diligence report should have been completed.  It is dangerous to change horses midstream.  Why was there a change of heart on the part of the Department or the Minister?  Was it because of the delay?  The delay was not going to continue forever, although it was a problem with a legal issue that was delayed for some time.  I believe a query on it may have ended up in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the due diligence report was never completed.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a veil of secrecy over what is happening.  I do not blame the Minister of State for this because he is new to this area.  However, I am perturbed the draft report was never given to the Bantry Harbour board.  The chairman of the day, who agreed to initiate the report, was wronged and every member of the Bantry Port authority and the harbour master should have seen it.  It is very disturbing this did not happen.  People may say I am reading more into this than I should but if that is the case, the report should be put on the table, so to speak.  I ask the Minister of State to send the draft report to Bantry for examination.  I would like to see a copy of it and perhaps I will be pleasantly surprised by it.  There is no transparency or openness on the issue and, as a result, there is a nagging in my brain telling me there is something radically wrong or there is something in the draft report that Bantry will not like or may not want to share.</P>
        <P>I cannot emphasise enough that this Bill proposes that Bantry and its assets and liabilities, lock, stock and barrel, be taken over by Cork Port.  This begs the question why the due diligence report was not completed and the report published.  There is still time for the draft due diligence <Col N="832"/>report to be published.  The Minister of State has said the report is in the ownership of Cork Port authority, but Cork Port has sent a copy to the Department.  Why can the Minister not tell Cork Port authority, or the chairman of the executive there, to pass on the due diligence report to Bantry for the sake of clarity?  It should let the Bantry Harbour board members, while they are still in place, study that report.  I also urge that the due diligence report be completed and that this aspect of section 18 be parked in the meantime.</P>
        <P>There were grave reservations on the part of Bantry when this proposal was put forward by the senior official, a capable man whom I know well.  The people of Bantry were nervous about it because they had numerous meetings and had looked at the option of the local authority taking over the port.  I favoured that option because I saw it as the lesser of two evils.  We also looked at the options of corporatisation, of staying as we were and the Cork option.  There were people in favour of all options bar the Cork option.</P>
        <P>We took a leap of faith and the chairman of Bantry Port authority agreed  &mdash; by telephone to the official in question, followed by letter &mdash; to go down this road, but that it would be a partnership role in which we would walk, jump and, if it came to it, separate together.  However this never happened and it is a concern for me, the harbour board members and the public that there is something sinister in the proposals.</P>
        <P>I will probably be proven to be wrong in this regard, but must believe it until such time as we see the draft report.  I am sure Senator McCarthy and all the Opposition would love to see what is in the draft due diligence report.  If Cork Port states the report is its property and will not share it with Bantry but will give it to the Minister of State and his officials, that is wrong.  It is wrong that we have not seen the report.</P>
        <P>Another important issue is that I, the Bantry board and its chairman have received written confirmation from the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessors over the years that if anything were to happen that would affect the future of Bantry Port, as appears to happen in section 18, there would be prior consultation and negotiation.  We have debated the issue of consultation day in, day out.  With all due respect, I cannot buy the notion that the Bill should be put in place as enabling legislation and then consultation can take place.  This is like a shotgun marriage where if people cannot come together amicably and work things out, we put them in handcuffs and force them to come with us whether they like it or not.  There is a lack of trust in this.</P>
        <P>I am warning the Minister of State, in a political way, of this lack of trust or understanding.  This is a pity because there has been a very good working relationship, by and large, with Department officials over the years on the part of Bantry and Cork.  However, there is now a lack of trust.  Whether it is Cork Port or the Minister of State who is responsible, this must be rectified.  It would be very difficult for me to come in on Report or Final Stages and agree to vote for this when I must go back to Bantry to the board of which I was formerly a member and tell them I voted for this but do not know where it is going.  That is like taking a leap in the dark, without a match, torch or flashlight for vision.  Technically, it would be wrong to do this.</P>
        <P>Whatever about Government policy, the suggestion is that this is enabling legislation.  It has also been suggested that as it is such, it may not come into effect this year, next year or in five years&rsquo; time.  We do not know.  It is disabling as far as Bantry is concerned.  It cripples us.  Next year, people will wonder what is the point of being a member of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners because at some stage down the road, maybe not under the current Minister because we are in a very volatile situation politically and there might be a change of Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Not that I am advocating this.  I am relatively comfortable here despite the pressure I am under at the minute.</P>
        <P>However, in future members of Cork County Council or other bodies will ask what is the point of having a board in Dublin.  It is like a duck that is shot, still alive and limping and cannot fly.  It will do huge damage to the process in which we have engaged.  As well as this I can see a very difficult and tenuous situation in future where Cork Port at a distance &mdash; it is like being ruled from London and we spent 800 years trying to get free &mdash; will try to look after Bantry Bay 60 or 70 miles away.</P>
        <P>We cannot lose sight of the fact that it is not just about the little pier in Bantry and the inner harbour.  It also involves the Whiddy set up, tourist related issues and fishing in Bantry Bay.  The existing harbour board Act established that the harbour authority for Bantry Bay incorporates and encapsulates the entire bay of Bantry bar the inner harbour in Castletownbere.</P>
        <P>I wrote out a few notes to try to grapple with ideas prior to coming here.  I need to know why the Department, the Minister of State or his predecessors in title reneged &mdash; that is the word although it is strong &mdash; on a solemn written pledge to the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners on the issues of due diligence and prior consultation.  A pledge was given and it was clear and unequivocal.  If I am here until next Christmas Day on this issue, if the Whip and the House allow me, I can never accept the notion that the Bill can be put in place as enabling legislation.  While we may not put it into effect one will go along with one&rsquo;s hand tied behind one&rsquo;s back into any consultation that takes place after its introduction and already be a lame duck because the legislation is in place.  Instead of enabling legislation I call it disabling legislation.  I want to emphasise this.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State comment on the issue of due diligence?  I posed a number of questions and if the Minister of State can enlighten me and answer them I will give him the freedom to do so now.</P>

	<P>I would like to but I do not know if I can make Senator O&rsquo;Donovan happy.  I wish I could.  He has an extraordinarily innovative or suspicious mind.  I think he is wrong but I cannot state that authoritatively.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan started by speaking about the request made to Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners in 2005.  We suggested that Bantry should engage in a due diligence exercise with Cork Port.</P>
        <P>Yes, it was stated that amalgamation would not take place until the due diligence report and due process were completed.  Prior to this legislation there was a process and plenty of consultation.  We have accepted an amendment to the Bill to formalise this consultation process.  It would have taken place anyway but I agreed to formalise it in the legislation.  The commitment given four years ago still stands and we have not wavered one iota from it.</P>
        <P>The Senator knows and has stated that the due diligence exercise was not completed because of a problem with foreshore property and this is being resolved.  However, four years ago it would have been expected that matters would have moved much quicker and that by now the due diligence would have been completed.  Of course it will go to Bantry when it is completed but it is not done.  Bits of it might be done but the report does not exist and Cork cannot complete it until it receives the data from Bantry on the foreshore issue.  When the report exists and is complete it will go to Bantry, if not from Cork then from the Department.  There is no point in getting some pages of a novel or a report and not others.  This would end up confusing rather than clarifying issues.</P>
        <P>Nothing is being concealed or hidden.  The sequence of events has turned out to be different than what people might have presumed four years ago.</P>

	<P>The Bill follows on from the ports policy document of 2005.  As we all know, legislation comes along in its own way.  It is a slow process.  The Bill covers issues other than Bantry Bay.  It has been drafted in the three or four years since the ports policy document was put through.  It would have been expected that by now the due diligence report would have been done and a certain amount of consultation would have taken place.</P>
        <P>Really it is another option and that is all it is.  We are not changing anything midstream.  Bantry Bay could have been signed over years ago under the two options which exist, namely to a private company or the local authority.  The Bill provides another option if the due diligence report and the sides involved think it is a possibility and if the consultation process goes along with it.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raises many interesting matters.  The Department of Transport is coming at this from the point of view that the reason the ports were associated with the Department was because of the movement of goods and passengers, mainly goods.  It makes great sense to see the Department of Transport involved in ports in Dublin, Waterford and Cork.  I accept that when Senator O&rsquo;Donovan speaks about places such as Bantry it is a different linkage and does not seem to fit the same scenario.</P>
        <P>Although there was a long consultation process on the Government&rsquo;s port policy it may not seem to cover all the aspects for smaller places such as those discussed by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  However, there has been no concealment or reneging.  There is an ongoing process and when this legislation goes through &mdash; if we do the business here and if we ever get it done &mdash; it will give a third option for what could happen after the due diligence is completed, goes to Bantry and we have the formal statutory consultation which I agreed to include in the Bill.  We cannot have too many people with a veto but if, down the road, this all seems possible and feasible and everybody is reasonably happy, this could come about.  It is just that the sequence has come in a different way.</P>
        <P>There is no real change of tack or policy.  It is just that legislation takes a couple of years to be drafted and the Bill just happens to have come at this stage.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is suspicious and sees problems.  I do not know how I can assure him that I do not see it like that.</P>

It would just mean that we were back where we were last year or the year before, waiting for the due diligence process to be completed, the negotiations to take place with Bantry and local consultation.

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not address the Senator&rsquo;s problem.  It is not easy to introduce legislation and there is always a long queue.  One cannot just say one wants legislation next week or month; it is a long, slow process.  The maritime section of my Department, not to mention other Departments, is already working on three different Bills.  Legislation involves a long, slow process and it so happens that because the process of due diligence has slowed down so much, the Senator is suspicious of the way things have worked out.  That is how I see it and I do not know if it reassures the Senator in any way.  He is considering the matter from a particular point of view.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am a little amused by the Senator&rsquo;s comments over the Port of Cork and his references to London.  I can understand why there is such mistrust in GAA quarters in Cork if the Senator is so bloody suspicious and linking Cork city with London and our history over 800 years.  Obviously there is a parochial attitude in the county that I do not fully grasp, even though both my parents came from there.  I do not believe anyone is trying to pull wool over the Senator&rsquo;s eyes, as such.  There is a process in place and the sequence of events is not what would have been predicted, but any commitments that were made are still valid.  The process will take place and we are copper-fastening it by including it in legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, there is one way in which the Minister of State can reassure me, that is, by accepting my amendments, which he may do later this evening or on the next occasion.  He is coming around to my way of thinking.</P>
        <P>I refer to section 18 to which my amendment refers.  It is important for me to state my position and the difficulty I am in.  The section states:</P>
        <P LI="1">18.&mdash;(1) The Principal Act is amended by inserting the following section after section 87:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;87A.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">&lsquo;relevant harbour commissioners&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) in relation to the Port of Cork Company, Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) in relation to the Shannon Foynes Port Company, Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners;</P>
        <P LI="2">&lsquo;relevant port company&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) in relation to Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, the Port of Cork Company, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) in relation to Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners, the Shannon Foynes Port Company;</P>
        <P FLI="0">This, in itself, implies they are gone already.  The section also states: &ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&lsquo;transfer day&rsquo; means the day appointed by the Minister under paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is not one of these soccer transfers where clubs pay millions and there is much interest from Sky and CNN.  This provision will give effect to the merger.  My suspicion does not focus on the Minister personally.  Having studied law for some years, including Roman and other historic law, I can recall a Latin phrase that applies when a matter is not crystal clear in legislation or negotiations: <i>Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius</i>.  By including one provision, one is excluding the other.  If I were in a court of law defending somebody or arguing technical points, I would not allow a client to put trust in this section.</P><Col N="836"/>
        <P>The next paragraph of the proposed new section reads: &ldquo;(2) (<i>a</i>) The Minister may by order appoint a day as the transfer day for the purposes of this section in respect of Bantry Bay Harbour and, with effect from that day, the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners are dissolved.&rdquo;  This is stated in black and white, yet the Minister of State is asking me to trust&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator mentioned his legal experience.  That paragraph is just making legal provision for an eventuality that might happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is but it is putting it in such a way that it disables Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It does not, come on now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very clear in that it states &ldquo;the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners are dissolved&rdquo;.  A Minister, but perhaps not the Minister of State present, may say in three or five years, &ldquo;To hell with Bantry, we will just sign off.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The new section continues as follows:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) The Minister may by order appoint a day as the transfer day for the purposes of this section in respect of Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour and, with effect from that day, the Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners are dissolved [they are gone down the drain].</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) The making of an order under this subsection is in lieu of making an order under section 87(1) or 88(2) in respect of the harbour concerned.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) With effect from the transfer day concerned [there is nothing about consultation or due diligence], there is transferred&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) to the Port of Cork Company from Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) to Shannon Foynes Port Company from Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners,</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p11- ?><?oasys _ix ?>all property (real and personal) and rights held or enjoyed immediately before that day by the relevant harbour commissioners and all liabilities incurred before that day by them that had not been discharged before that day and, accordingly, without any further conveyance, transfer or assignment&mdash;</P>
        <P FLI="0">They do not have to talk to me, the harbour board or authorities in Cork.  This is like a last will and testament and it is what I am worried about in respect of my home town and area.  In the testament of a will, it is stated that one gives all one&rsquo;s property, both real and personal, of every nature and description.  The legislation reads like a final request.</P>
        <P>The proposed subparagraph (3)(<i>b</i>)(i) reads:</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) the property so held or enjoyed, both real and personal, vests on the transfer day in the Port of Cork Company [or Fenit, God bless it] or Shannon Foynes Port Company, as the case may be, for all the estate, term or interest for which, immediately before that day, it was vested in the relevant harbour commissioners, but subject to all trusts and equities affecting the property and capable of being performed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Could it be any clearer?  In spite of this, the Minister of State is demanding trust of me and the harbour board in Bantry, which was let down for 30 years by successive Governments.  Histori<Col N="837"/>cally, some Ministers from my party promised X, Y and Z but we did not get it.  Given the trauma and problems associated with the financial markets, a Minister, in three or five years, might say, &ldquo;To hell with it, we will sign this order.&rdquo;  As the song says, &ldquo;His breakfast milk is sour.&rdquo;  It is a <i>fait accompli</i> bar the pushing of the pen.</P>
        <P>I will read on because I am going off on a tangent.  The proposed subparagraph (3)(<i>b</i>)(i) states:</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) the rights so held or enjoyed, are as on and from the transfer day, held and enjoyed by the Port of Cork Company [or Fenit] or Shannon Foynes Port Company, as the case may be, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) the liabilities so incurred are, as on and from the transfer day, the liabilities of the Port of Cork Company or Shannon Foynes Port Company, as the case may be.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are fluid and in the black in Bantry and have been for many years.  If it were the case that we accumulated substantial debts, having borrowed &euro;10 million, for example&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;would the Port of Cork Company state Bantry Port is in debt in the order of &euro;10 million and Whiddy is closed and that it is inclined to enter a partnership or engage in a merger?  I believe not.  This is plain and stated in black and white.  I do not believe there will be any avenue of opportunity or hope in this regard once the Bill is passed.</P>
        <P>Proposed subsection 87A(4) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) All moneys, stocks, shares [they may not be performing well at present but we have money] and securities transferred to the relevant port company by this section that, immediately before the transfer day, are in the name of the relevant harbour commissioners, shall, at the request of the relevant port company, be transferred into that company&rsquo;s name.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In simple, plain language, this means the Port of Cork Company, on the day of the transfer, can sign the order and claim everything in Bantry.</P>
        <P>To give the Minister of State a flavour of what is happening, let me outline what would occur if this happened tomorrow morning.  We own the railway pier and bought it in good faith for approximately &euro;200,000 plus the legal costs.  We bought the foreshore rights from the Earl of Bantry in Bantry House estate.  We did not go up to Mr. Shelswell-White in Bantry House stating he had to give us the foreshore rights.  We negotiated and he agreed a price although we believed it was too dear.  I will not repeat what one member of the board said; suffice it to say that he said Mr. Shelswell-White should be dealt with in some other way. It was in the region of &euro;280,000 for approximately a mile of foreshore rights along the seafront in Bantry.  This is important currently because another Department is carrying out extensive sewerage works along the foreshore and putting a treatment plant in place.  That is another day&rsquo;s work.  In addition to that asset, a developer who has built an hotel close to the harbour has agreed, subject to a process that is set out clearly by the Department, to buy a small section &mdash; approximately the length of the Chamber &mdash; for approximately &euro;700,000.  That adds up to approximately &euro;1 million, and we are asked that all those assets would be handed over to the Port of Cork Company.  There is nothing at all in the Bill to say that in lieu of that, the Cork authority would dredge the harbour, which would cost &euro;10 million, extend the pier at a cost of &euro;3 million, and ensure a fair and equitable system for mussel farmers and local fishermen.</P>
        <P>When I walked down the pier last week I met a good friend of Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s, who is a union representative, who was going out to the island.  I spoke to him about issues.  I spoke <Col N="838"/>also to fishermen and fish farmers.  The pier was congested.  One could not drive down it for health and safety reasons.  Those people indicated that I am representing the area and they have had promises since 1968 that this and that would be done, but instead things have got worse.  Now they are expected to take a major leap of faith and accept the proposed legislative change.  It is as plain as the nose on my face that this is the last will and testament and the final nail in the coffin of Bantry.  It will take a lot of persuasion for me to support the Bill.  There is one way to do it.  If section 18 is scrapped, then the Bill can go ahead.</P>
        <P>There will be many legislative vehicles in future to address the issue.  The Bill is only enabling legislation and it is not urgent, which the Minister of State accepts.  We may not be here in the next three to five years.  My good friend across the floor, Senator Coffey, could be in the other House.  He could be in a ministerial car.  Some Minister could come along and put the tin hat on it.  There will be many opportunities to address the issue in terms of other Bills coming to the House.  I accept it takes a lot of preparation and much work goes on behind the scenes to publish a Bill.  We need to set our stall out fairly as regards what will happen to the assets in Bantry.  While I have not spoken to them all, I am certain that the Cork Port members I know, which include some elected representatives, are bemused by the Bill.  I will park that one for a moment as there are more sections I wish to address.</P>

        <P LI="1">I refer to the above mentioned Bill and particularly to section 18 of same, which provides amongst other things for the transfer of the functions, assets and liabilities of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners to the Port of Cork Company and from Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Company to Shannon-Foynes Port Company.  [The letter is from the Irish Ports Association, which is a valued organisation.]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My members in Bantry, Shannon-Foynes and Tralee and Fenit are totally opposed to the transfer proposals, which they see as being without merit.  In this opposition they have the full support of the association. Both Bantry and Tralee and Fenit are serving a local region and it is the view of the association that these interests are best served by a local board, democratically drawn from and concentrating on the needs and best interests of the local region, and that this principle should not be sacrificed to the perceived administrative convenience of the Department of central government.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">All three ports concerned are opposed to any transfer or merger and the association supports them in this stance.  We would ask that in the absence of agreement between the parties that no transfers should take place.  We would further urge that the offending section be withdrawn from the Bill at this stage.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a letter from the Irish Ports Association.  I do not see a date on it.  I want to include that letter in case the Minister of State or other people think I am going off on a tangent.  If a plebiscite were held in Fenit, which is historically known, in the Bantry area, or the local electoral area serving them, it would be far more emphatic than the referendum held recently.  It would be 99% in favour of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P><Col N="839"/>
        <P>I will continue with my last will and testament, if I can refer to section 18 as that, as it signals the final demise for both Bantry and Fenit.  Section 18(5) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Every right and liability transferred to the relevant port company by this section may, on and after the transfer day, be sued on, recovered or enforced by or against the relevant port company in its own name and it shall not be necessary for it to give notice of the transfer to the person whose right or liability is transferred by this section.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I could envisage a situation in Bantry where one of the mussel boats breaks down and is parked for two or three days.  The local harbour master will tell them they cannot stay there forever and to move on when the boat is fixed, but a person from Cork would not know what a mussel raft was and if he was out in a rowing boat, he would not know how to row it.  Common sense prevails when one has local autonomy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 18(6) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Every&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) bond, guarantee or other security of a continuing nature, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) contract or agreement,</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is1p8- ?><?oasys _ix ?>made or given by or on behalf of the relevant commissioners to any person or given by any person to and accepted by or on behalf of the relevant harbour commissioners&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) continues in force on and after the transfer day concerned,</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) shall be read and have effect as if the name of the relevant company were substituted in the contract or agreement for that of the relevant harbour commissioners concerned or, as the case may be, any trustee or agent acting on their behalf, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) is enforceable against the relevant company.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is emphatic, leaving no wriggle room for manoeuvre.  Tiny sea worms, which are sometimes found in shellfish, would have no wriggle room in the Bill.  The subsection is crystal clear.</P>
        <P>Strict procedures are in place to ensure corporate governance.  For example, when Bantry harbour board buys and sells anything, it must obtain prior consent.  The board made mistakes in the past but we all learn from our mistakes.  One of the issues that held up the due diligence related to the foreshore but that was totally outside the control of the board and its solicitors.  The Bill is so all embracing and powerful that if it is passed, I will have to return to the board, of which I am no longer a member, and say, &ldquo;I am sorry, I have let you down.  This is a <i>fait accompli</i> and it is a nail in your coffin&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said the Minister under existing legislation can by order have a port taken over by the local authority.  Baltimore is another port in west Cork dear to my heart and the harbour board there would love to have a home.  I attended a meeting five years ago between board members and the then county manager.  The facilities were examined and they said if the Department spent &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million on the port, the local authority would take it over but it would not do so now because it does not have the money to do it.  Kinsale is another example and, closer to the Minister of State&rsquo;s home, what became of Balbriggan?  I recall a furious debate on the issue of Balbriggan Port.  Is it better off now?  Did the local authority take it over?  Have improvements been made?</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the legislation, the asset base and the development of Bantry harbour will succumb to, and be taken over by, Cork Port at the stroke of a pen.  The Minister <Col N="840"/>of State has said on a number of occasions this is only enabling legislation and it will not be implemented tomorrow or the day after.  Why not let the damn thing be parked for four or five years?</P>
        <P>Section 18(7) states: &ldquo;If, immediately before the transfer day concerned, any legal proceedings to which the relevant harbour commissioners are a party are pending, the relevant port company&rsquo;s name shall be substituted in the proceedings for the name of the relevant harbour commissioners, and the proceedings shall not abate because of the substitution.&rdquo;  That is a powerful weapon.  If the harbour board in Bantry, for example, took legal proceedings against ConocoPhillips, the owners of Whiddy Island, over oil pollution, which has been threatened previously, the Bill provides that Cork Port would take over the running of the case.  It would have power under the legislation to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 18(8)(<i>a</i>) states, &ldquo;With effect from the transfer day concerned, the Port of Cork Company in respect of Bantry Bay Harbour and the Shannon Foynes Port Company in respect of Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour may make bye-laws under sections 42 and 71.&rdquo;  We have tried over the past 15 years at least to sort out by-laws for Bantry harbour.  They are still not copperfastened because the process is ongoing and it is difficult.  Various groups have to be dealt with such as inshore fishermen, shrimp fishermen, scallop dredgers, shellfish fisherman and those involved in &ldquo;brideoging&rdquo;, which is the old method of scooping up scallops in shallow water.  A &ldquo;brideog&rdquo; is a rod with a net on the end.  Licensing for aquaculture and mariculture throughout the bay also had be to considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This provision would be a major imposition on the Cork Port company and I do know whether its members have the necessary experience because they run a large commercial port.  What do they know about &ldquo;brideoging&rdquo; or aquaculture and mariculture licensing?  Are they aware that under an British by-law going back to the Spanish Armada and Wolfe Tone&rsquo;s arrival in Bantry in 1796, trawling between sunset and sunrise from Shot Head to Sheep&rsquo;s Head is prohibited?  I bet if any member of the Cork Port company was asked about this, they would not know about it.  I was once asked by local fishermen why that by-law was still in place because it had been breached repeatedly.  I fished for herring there as a young man and it was a problem when large trawlers scooped up the herrings and towed away our nets and so on because we were small operators.  We made a few bob at it and it was healthy and so on.</P>
        <P>Many different facets of harbour life will be affected in Bantry Bay.  It has the second deepest channel of water in the world and the largest oil tankers ever built have been tied up at Whiddy Island.  For example, the ceiling in the House is approximately 30 ft high.  When these tankers were unladen, some still had an 85 ft draft.  That illustrates how safe is Bantry Port.  That is why due diligence should have been completed and all these issues should have been ironed out in advance of the introduction of the legislation.  Locals are fearful because this has not happened.  I am not in the House for the good of my health or to use up time.  Politicians are tools of the public because we react to public opinion and worry and so on.  I am present because people I grew up with and worked with have these concerns.  All of them do not necessarily vote for me but I listen to everybody in my home town and region.</P>
        <P>Under the legislation, for example, Cork Port company will take control of the local mussel industry.  Perhaps the Minister and the Department have not looked beyond the pale and feel Bantry Bay is just about the inner harbour and the ConocoPhillips terminal on Whiddy Island but it is much larger.  How much of the national oil reserve is stored on Whiddy Island?  Is the Government aware of plans by ConocoPhillips to develop the terminal?   I would like to quote from an article concerning Bantry Bay and this Bill.  One might ask why I am so suspicious.  I have been told that Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan would like to make a contribution and when I read this into the record, I will give him some air.  This article was published on 1 February.  It has a <Col N="841"/>photograph of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  The sub-headline states: &ldquo;&euro;500 million needs to be spent to improve national supplies.&rdquo;  If I read this into the record one might understand why there is suspicion in my mind and among those on the Bantry board.  It is an interesting article that affects Whiddy and Bantry Bay.  Obviously it will affect Bantry Harbour Commissioners or the board in Cork, or whoever is in charge.  In <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 1 February, Stephen O&rsquo;Brien wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Irish government needs to spend at least &euro;500m improving its &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; oil infrastructure to avoid a fuel shortage in the event of disruption to world supplies, according to a new study.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is another new study.  Wait until they get hold of that.  It is important because the authority that is to be wound down has charge of the traffic into and out of Whiddy.  The article continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">The assessment of the security of the country&rsquo;s oil reserves, commissioned by Eamon Ryan, the energy minister, warns that Ireland has less than two thirds of the 90-day back-up supply recommended internationally.  [Oil security affects everyone.]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Purvin and Gertz, the international energy consultancy, and Byrne O Cleirigh, the Irish consultant engineer, say Ireland needs to spend &euro;250m to double its storage capacity at up to three locations in the south, midwest and east.  They recommend expanding storage at Whitegate refinery on Whiddy Island, in Bantry Bay, Co Cork; creating a facility in the Naas/Clane/Sallins area of Co Kildare; and possibly at a third location on the deepwater Shannon estuary, Co Limerick.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">They also urge that a further &euro;265m investment be considered in up to three strategic pipelines, from Cork to Kildare, Kildare to Dublin and Ireland to Britain.  The Department of Finance and Ryan&rsquo;s officials are discussing imposing a 1c levy on a litre of petrol to help pay for improvements.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The report warns that there are &ldquo;significant risks to Ireland&rsquo;s ability to access supplies&rdquo; during unusual disruptions to the international markets, because of the fragile nature of some of our infrastructure for importing, storing and distributing oil.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Ireland holds one of the lowest proportions of oil stocks of all International Energy Agency member states.  Only about 50 to 60 days of the 90-days net import obligation are held in the country.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While it may not be the brief of the Minister of State, where is the other 40 days&rsquo; storage?  Is it in Ireland, in Whiddy or elsewhere?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reading a very important article, which I want to complete.  It is a report from <i>The Sunday Times</i> that refers to another Minister.  It refers to our national oil reserves which are very important to the country.  In the event of an emergency or a war we would need to have a minimum of 90 days&rsquo; supply.  The only place for holding that supply is Whiddy which emphasises the importance of Bantry Harbour.  The article states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Ireland holds one of the lowest proportions of oil stocks of all International Energy Agency member states.  Only about 50 to 60 days of the 90-days net import obligation are held in the country.  [That is a worrying aspect.]</P><Col N="842"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Ireland also refines less imported oil than most other members of the agency, an intergovernmental energy policy organisation that includes America, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as most EU member states.  Ireland imports 75% of refined oil products and refines the remainder at Whitegate.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Whiddy Island was the scene of a disaster 30 years ago when an ageing and leaky 120,000-tonne oil tanker, the French-registered <i>Betelgeuse</i>, exploded during the offloading of crude oil at an offshore jetty.  Fifty people were killed, including 41 crew, eight terminal workers [most of whom I knew] and a ship&rsquo;s officer&rsquo;s wife.  The jetty was destroyed and the facility, now run by ConocoPhilips, has never operated on the same scale since.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0" Just="Left">The study commissioned by [the Minister, Deputy] Ryan describes the 40-year-old facility as &ldquo;a simple refinery&rdquo;, and the consultants say that there is a risk that it might cease to operate after 2016.  [That is not Whiddy, it is Whitegate.]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0" Just="Left">&ldquo;The availability of Whitegate enables Ireland&rsquo;s exposure to oil supplies to be spread between crude oil and refined products,&rdquo; the report said.  &ldquo;Long-term security of operations may require government intervention, and would need to be assessed with other priorities regarding social policy in the region, such as the impact on the local economy.&rdquo;  [Here is another report stating how important local economies like Bantry and Whiddy Island are to the State.]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Whitegate&rsquo;s remote location in the far southwest had hindered its potential to expand, the study found.  Improving its access to Dublin, in the form of a pipeline, would raise its competitiveness and expand its potential market.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is not the first time that was mooted.  It should have been done in the late 1960s.  The oil stored in Whiddy of international strategic importance should have been piped to Whitegate and to Dublin.  It is a long way to get crude oil by tanker into Dublin or wherever it needs to go.</P>
        <P LI="1">The risk-assessors weighed threats, ranging from strife in the Middle East to a crippling industrial action or even a terrorist incident affecting Dublin Port.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">&ldquo;In terms of minimising the risk to the Irish economy from disruption in oil supplies it would be prudent to develop at least one of their proposed strategic stores from where, in an emergency scenario involving the closure of Dublin Port, oil could readily be distributed to the region which relies on this port,&rdquo; they said.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This facility would have a capacity of at least 200,000 tonnes and be located in the Naas area with a pipeline connection to Dublin &ldquo;using the Grand Canal as a possible pipeline route&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The consultants estimated that the pipeline from Whiddy Island to Naas might cost &euro;165 million.  It could not be justified on commercial grounds, but could be defended if strategic fuel security factors were taken into consideration.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Oil is Ireland&rsquo;s dominant energy source and has risen from meeting 46% of the country&rsquo;s energy needs in 1990 to 53% in 2006.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">A White Paper in 2007 committed Ireland to producing one third of its energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, but oil is still expected to make up 52% of the energy mix at this time.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The report will be published by Ryan in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister of State may ask the reason I read this report from <i>The Sunday Times</i> into the record of the House.  I have a dream that the potential of Bantry Bay and the possibilities on Whiddy Island can benefit the local economy.</P><Col N="843"/>
        <P>I ask the House to consider the strategic benefit to the country.  If the greater Dublin area and the east coast were to be without fuel for 100 days, people would be without fuel for their central heating.  Fuel security is very important.  It is sometimes good to dream and to think positively in these bad times.  If there were to be a huge gas or oil find off Mizen Head or out towards the famous Rockall Island, the obvious place to bring such ashore, whether it be gas or oil, would be Bantry Bay as it has the structures and the capacity for storage.  It should also be recognised that ConocoPhillips and its predecessors in the past 12 years or thereabouts have spent well over &euro;150 million on upgrading the storage at Whiddy Island.  With all due respect to my colleague, Senator Buttimer, Whitegate is obsolete.  I believe it would cost &euro;1.2 billion to replace Whitegate whereas constructing an oil pipeline from Whiddy Island to Dublin would have huge potential.  I may have a suspicious mind but I wonder if this is already in train at Cabinet and departmental level.  There may be consideration to get rid of Bantry and the harbour authority because they would have less hassle.</P>
        <P>I have an obligation as a Member of this House to put on the record all these proposals and suggestions on future viability.  I may have gone off on a tangent but it is important because it is all to do with Bantry Bay and the harbour authority and the future and potential of the harbour.</P>

        <P>I refer to section 18(9)(<i>a</i>): &ldquo;As soon as practicable after the transfer day, the relevant port company shall prepare, in such form as may be approved by the Minister, all proper and usual accounts of money received or expended by the relevant harbour commissioners in the <Col N="844"/>accounting year, or the part of an accounting year, of those commissioners ending immediately before the transfer day.&rdquo;  That is being done. Section 18(9)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;The relevant port company shall submit accounts prepared under this subsection to an auditor for audit under subsection (2) of section 27 as if they were accounts kept for the purposes of that section and the other provisions of the said subsection (2) shall apply to those accounts.&rdquo;  Section 18(10) states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the repeal of the Harbours Act 1976 under section 19 of the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2008, the functions, duties an powers in relation to Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centres conferred on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 continue to be exercised by that Minister of the Government.&rdquo;  At least Castletownbere will be left on its own.</P>
        <P>Section 18(2) states:</P>

	<P>As the Acting Chairman pointed out, other Members want to contribute so I will give way to Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan.  I will, however, be referring to this report, the cornerstone of the legislation, when I resume.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his patience and forbearance in this long drawn-out debate on this amendment.  I also thank him for his understanding of the positions taken both inside and outside the Chamber by Members.  I fully endorse the position Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has taken over the past several days and congratulate him on his tenacity and commitment in handling the debate.  It proves an individual Senator can make a difference.  The US President, Mr. Obama, says one can make a difference, and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has shown that by knowing one&rsquo;s brief and being committed to it.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to him for giving way to allow me to bring the Kerry perspective to the debate.  While the amendments concern the Bantry Bay position, they have clear repercussions for the proposed association of the Shannon Foynes Port Company and the Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners.  Whereas Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has pioneered the case for Bantry, I am expecting, when the Bill finally reaches the other House, much will be said by all Deputies from County Kerry on the Fenit position.</P>
        <P>I have much experience with harbour boards, having been a director on various port companies from 1991 to 2007 when I was elevated to this House.  I was a member of the old Limerick Harbour Commissioners which was replaced by the Shannon Port Company and was subsequently transmogrified into the Shannon Foynes Port Company.  The Department knew fully the historical difficulties of bringing together into one cohesive unit these two old rival ports.  Many Ministers and Administrations countenanced doing it but walked away from it in the end.  To his eternal credit, Deputy Fahey, the then Minister responsible for port authorities, seized the bull by the horns by bringing the two harbour companies together.  It made much sense.  With a stretch of only 50 miles of water in the estuary, it was ridiculous to have two <Col N="845"/>competing authorities vying with each other for business and jealously guarding each other&rsquo;s secrets.</P>
        <P>With that in mind, I would have thought the Department would leave the port authority structures on the Shannon Estuary alone for at least a generation to allow matters to settle.  However, it has proposed that the Shannon Foynes Port Company should assimilate the Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners.  When I left the board of the Shannon Foynes Port Company, such a prospect was viewed with horror by the chairman, chief executive and directors.  The feeling was that the company had enough on its plate.</P>
        <P>It is one of the State&rsquo;s largest commercial ports and the best natural deepwater port in western Europe, outside of Rotterdam.  It has much potential, some of which is being realised.  The last the company needs is the singular focus it has on heavy commercial activity to be removed.  It is the second largest bulkhandler and must manage freight in and out of Foynes.  The company has responsibility for the movement of materials in and out of Aughinish Alumina, one of the most important industries to the economy.  It is also responsible for freight and traffic in and out of Moneypoint and Tarbert power stations, as well as running the oil depot at Dernish Island for Shannon Airport.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The company&rsquo;s most recent project was to divest itself of non-core assets, many of which were located in the old Limerick docks.  The Limerick Docklands Initiative was established, of which I was a strong supporter with the former chief executive, Brian Byrne, to release capital from non-effective properties which would be reinvested in Foynes and the outer estuary at Ballylongford, County Kerry.  Plans are in place to build a major transshipment hub at the site.  The Acting Chairman, Senator Coghlan, will also be aware of the exciting new LNG project at Ballylongford.  Although An Bord Plean&aacute;la has found in favour of the project, there have been, unfortunately, some recent planning objections which, hopefully, will be dealt with.  This project will be extremely important for the nation, will underpin and guarantee our energy requirements in the context of gas, will free us from our dependence on that infamous gas pipeline from Russia, will lead to the creation of quite a number of jobs and will provide a major boost for a population which historically has been in decline and which has again been affected following the downturn in the economy.</P>
        <P>The Shannon-Foynes Port Company has more than enough to do, without being asked to take Fenit as a partner or to assimilate it.  This is a bad match and it will make for a very bad marriage if it proceeds.</P>

Other than that, however, the main activities carried out there are by those who fish for a living and those involved in tourism angling.  In recent years, Fenit has become an important tourism centre.  Activity relating to the latter has centred on the town&rsquo;s marina on which &euro;4 million was expended in the past five or six years.  I spoke to the chairman of the Fenit Harbour board, Councillor Johnny Wall, this morning and he indicated that the board has put together a submission in respect of the further development of activities at the marina.  Overall, there will be a need for an investment of an additional &euro;8 million in Fenit.</P><Col N="846"/>
        <P>The review of State regional ports and harbours indicates that there is a great future for the marine tourism industry in this country.  It points out that Fenit has a 100-berth marina at present and that this is capable of accommodating boats of sizes ranging from six to 15 metres.  The review also points out that there is one berth capable of catering for vessels of 30 metres and over.  It further states that the harbour attracted 123 visiting yachts, mainly from Britain, France and the domestic market, in 1998, that the potential for marine tourism and leisure development at Fenit is medium to high and that its principle attraction &mdash; the marina &mdash; is running at a very high level of demand at present.  It goes on to point out that there is definite demand for additional berthing space.  The review to which I refer also indicates that proposed project would include a hotel, apartments, a leisure centre, conference facilities, language laboratories and computer workshops.  There is already a marine centre located at Fenit and this attracts interest from schools tours, etc.</P>
        <P>We are, therefore, discussing two completely different operations.  There is no way a commercial port could do anything but suffer if it were obliged to take responsibility for a tourism port such as Fenit.</P>
        <P>The one major industry which operates at Fenit, namely, Liebherr Cranes, has been an extremely important contributor to the economy of Kerry.  The Acting Chairman, who lives in Killarney, will be aware of that fact.  This company&rsquo;s balance sheet is in good order and, despite the recession, its order book for the next five years would be the envy of many others.  Liebherr Cranes is committed to Fenit and will be able to use additional storage space there if the harbour board is able to acquire same, which it is attempting to do at present.  This is an extremely strong company with a bright future and it will, in effect, pay the bills of the harbour board and allow it to develop the type of facilities to which I referred earlier.</P>
        <P>Why stymie something that is a success?  Why try to fix something that is not broken?  Having listened to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan during the hours, days and weeks over which this debate has taken place, I am of the view that the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Bantry and Cork is identical.  The Minister of State has a difficult job to do and the debate on the Bill is taking up much more of his time than he would have anticipated.  However, it is important to get matters right.  Given that the Bill was introduced in the Seanad, it is only proper that we should get it right before it is sent to the Lower House where someone might engage in an even more concentrated and forensic attack on it than has Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill and the amendment with which we are dealing have serious implications for the port of Cork.  I wish to deal specifically with the proposed move out of Cork city.  As the Minister of State is aware, delays in this regard are having major implications for the proposed Cork docklands development.  Perhaps he might ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish the Cork docklands forum report which is long overdue and which has been with the Government since last June.  This pivotal report relates to the development of the port of Cork and to the docklands authority there.  I am aware, as a result of leaked information, that the report calls for the establishment of a Cork docklands authority.  In light of yesterday&rsquo;s revelations regarding the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, I wonder if Cork should not go down this particular route.</P>
        <P>It is important that the role of Cork City Council should be accentuated and that the council should remain the lead agency in respect of this matter.  There should be consultation with other stakeholders to drive the project forward.  Did consultation take place with the authorities in Bantry and those in Cork?  Why is the Minister of State proposing to remove councillors from the board?  These people are elected representatives, they are the voice of the people and the local authorities and they bring with them a wealth of experience, knowledge and intelli<Col N="847"/>gence.  Under the provisions of the Bill, however, they will be cast to one side.  In a spirit of bipartisanship, I wish to state that councillors from all political parties have served Cork city and county well while acting as members of the board.  Suddenly, these people are to be removed from their positions.</P>
        <P>The port of Cork is extremely important to Cork city and to the Cork area strategic plan, CASP.  In addition, it is vital to the creation of a new mini-city in the Cork docklands.  I have a number of questions with regard to what is being done in this legislation, especially in respect of the relocation of the port of Cork.  Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to this matter earlier.  Does the Port of Cork Company want the power that is to be bestowed upon it?  It is important a properly functioning and viable port of Cork should be developed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay tribute to Mr. Brendan Keating, Mr. Michael McCarthy and Mr. Denis Healy who, on behalf of the Port of Cork Company, have provided strong leadership and great direction.  I hope that as a consequence of their work, there will be a Cork-Swansea ferry this year because such a service is badly needed.  It would be of immense benefit to the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s home town of Killarney to have tourists coming in to Cork by ferry.  I hope the Government recognises that we need vibrant ferry services between Ireland and Britain.  I am sure Senator O&rsquo;Donovan agrees with me in respect of that matter.  Such services are critical to the development of the port, to west Cork and to the people of the kingdom of Kerry.  Under this section, will the Port of Cork Company be facilitated in taking its eye off the ball in terms of its strategic plan and developing the port for the betterment of the region?</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan spoke about a bad marriage.  The proposals amount to a mixed marriage which nobody wants.  I have not heard anything concrete from the port of Cork to suggest it endorses the proposals.</P>
        <P>The issue of oil security raised by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan impacts on all of us.  In this connection, what are the plans for Whitegate?  I am disturbed by the report in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 1 February to which Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan referred which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland holds one of the lowest proportions of oil stocks of all International Energy Agency member states.  Only about 50 to 60 days of the 90-days net import obligation are held in the country.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What will happen in the case of Bantry, Whiddy Island and Whitegate in the event of an oil crisis?  The Whitegate refinery has played a major role in Cork over the decades.  I remember as a child that one could set one&rsquo;s clock by Mr. May who lived behind my family and caught the bus outside the entrance of the estate where he was dropped off again in the evening on his return from the refinery.</P>
        <P>What plans are in place for Whiddy Island?  It is extraordinary that a recent remembrance service commemorated the 30th anniversary of the tragic fire on the island caused by the explosion of the <i>Betelgeuse</i>.  I remember as a child watching Tom McSweeney reporting on the incident on RTE and recall a photograph of the area engulfed in huge flames carried in the then <i>Cork Examiner</i>.  I am sure the owners of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> regret changing the newspaper&rsquo;s name from the <i>Cork Examiner</i>.  I apologise for digressing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What will be the role of Whitegate <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Whiddy Island?  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to a pipeline.  What plans are in place to engage with stakeholders in Cork?  It is extraordinary that this issue has developed into one of Cork city versus the county when we should have an all-embracing strategic plan which allows the ports to develop.  Our ports are entry and exit points for goods and equipment and focal points for tourism and leisure.  What do we want to achieve?</P><Col N="848"/>
        <P>Mr. Ger Lyons of Deloitte &amp; Touche indicated at the oral hearing on the port of Cork that the city quays and Ford&rsquo;s Wharf had generated more than &euro;9.26 million in income, which was 40% of the company&rsquo;s profits last year.  Why would a port authority with assets of more than &euro;113 million want to become an all-embracing authority when its mission and rationale are to relocate and develop a strong Cork Port?  While I welcome this objective on which the company has presented excellent reports and plans, I am concerned at the absence of joined-up thinking.  For example, a major flaw in the proposal to move the port to Ringaskiddy was the absence of a rail link</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the amalgamation of the various ports in the county.  I love the term &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;.  The Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong but it appears the proposal would create competition between the harbours of Cork, Bantry, Shannon-Foynes, Tralee and Fenit.  Are we pursuing a similar policy to that chosen regarding the State airports when Dublin Airport Authority was made the umbrella body for Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports?  I understand the Minister of State was a Minister in the Department of Transport for a period.  We now have a state of stasis with no progress made on addressing the debt of Cork Airport or establishing it as an independent entity.  Will the ports be subject to the same competitive pressures?</P>
        <P>Will the profits generated in the Cork docklands be distributed among the various stakeholders or will they be used to develop Cork?  If Bantry, Fenit or Shannon-Foynes port makes profits, will they be retained in the port in question?  The relevant section refers to the transfer of accounts and assets.  What will be done with the assets?</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that Cork Port has not been moved.  However, I also understand the frustration felt by the residents of Ringaskiddy and Carrigaline regarding the proposal to move the port further down the N28.  The infrastructure in the proposed new site is not suitable and the move would be a major imposition on the residents of both towns.  This returns us to the fundamental point, namely, the absence of consultation.  Why are councillors being removed from the board?  I praised the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, for agreeing to include elected representatives in the new regulatory authority established under the legislation.  All sides agreed on that issue.  I cannot understand the Government&rsquo;s mania for precluding local representatives from becoming members of State boards.  Politicians have been excluded from almost all State boards.  I ask for clarity on the composition of the new board.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed at the failure to develop the Cork docklands.  We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to develop the city and create a new quarter to encompass residential areas, educational facilities, including a UCC campus, health care institutions arising from the amalgamation of the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital or the establishment of a new hospital, leisure facilities and a conference centre.  Cork needs a conference centre and is losing out to Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s home town of Killarney.  Dublin has a fine conference centre, the O2, which is worth visiting.  Cork needs a convention centre to increase footfall in the city.  The port of Cork has succeeded in attracting cruise liners to Cobh, creating and sustaining jobs and boosting tourism.</P>
        <P>The decision to put on hold the relocation of the port of Cork and the lack of Government support for the plans have frozen and paralysed the Cork docklands project.  While it is legitimate to argue that the budget provided a tax break for the Seveso sites, not one Finance Bill has provided support for the proposed eastern gateway bridge or to Cork City Council to develop the docklands.  This is a matter of concern.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes to create a harbours &ldquo;superpower&rdquo; at a time when the Port of Cork Company should be exclusively engaged in developing the port.  In recessionary times it <Col N="849"/>is not a case of any port will do but one of being able to draw up plans and invest resources in developing Cork Port.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that if this Bill is passed, we will see a dilution of policy and procedures in the Port of Cork, and I do not want that to happen.  I cannot speak as someone from west Cork, although I have relations in Kilmichael, but, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan knows well, my loyalty is to the Port of Cork.  However, I do not want to see anything happening which will dilute the economic importance of Cork, whether west Cork or elsewhere.  It is the rebel county and, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan knows well, we will stick together.  It is important to put people first.</P>
        <P>There is a common theme here, which is the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  He started off with the airports and now he is back with the ports.  What does he want to achieve?  According to the Explanatory Memorandum, he proposes to reduce the number of directors and the number of ports.  What is the reason behind that?  Has it not been proved that we should not reduce, that we should keep what we have and accentuate the growth of each port?</P>
        <P>It is important we put on record the fact that Cork city requires the docklands project to be moved forward.  It will provide the economic stimulus Cork needs.  It is dependent on the Port of Cork, Cork City Council and Government and the private stakeholders working together to progress the Cork docklands.  That is what we need to do because if we do not do so, we will have the biggest white elephant ever.  If that is what the Government wants, it will be on its head.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about the development of Cork city and, in particular, the move of the Port of Cork, assistance should be provided.  Likewise the development of the Cork docklands should be prioritised by Government.  We should stand behind Cork City Council and let it become the lead agency.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State explain why we are taking councillors off the board?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to Senator Buttimer and concur with much of what he said.  As someone who goes in and out of the Cork port area on a regular basis, I congratulate the Port of Cork on its endeavours.  As Senator Buttimer indicated, it has much on its agenda and it is developing well.  There is huge potential and much work to be done in Cork port and I wish it well in its endeavours in that regard.</P>
        <P>I indicate to the House and the Department my support for Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  My mother is from the same town as the Minister of State&rsquo;s and I have been visiting it for a long time.  I was born in May and visited the town in July.  The town is close to my heart.  I was there last weekend and will be there again this weekend.</P>
        <P>What I have heard locally, which may be somewhat helpful to the Minister of State and the officials, is that locals are 110% plus behind Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and his endeavours.  Much of what he put on record was covered on local radio or in local print in recent weeks.  It is important we recognise that he is a dedicated, committed and passionate public representative, representing the views of the local community and the people who have done well with Bantry harbour and outlining the importance of the harbour and the bay to his community.  His request for the Department and the Minister to review what we ask is not unreasonable.</P>
        <P>This is enabling legislation and if it is passed in its present form, the people who are so committed and dedicated to the Bantry region will no longer have the upper hand.  It is not fair to put those people, including my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, in that position.</P>
        <P>I also know a number of other people in the Bantry area, including the chair of Bantry Harbour Commissioners, Councillor Aiden McCarthy, who is a committed individual and a <Col N="850"/>successful businessman.  One might question why he devotes such an enormous amount of time to his community.  The reason is he is committed to, and passionate about, the Bantry region.</P>
        <P>Bantry Harbour Commissioners is made up of two local county councillors, two Bantry town councillors, two local people nominated by the chamber, two local people nominated by the port users association and three ministerial appointees.  Often a journalist will delve into the three ministerial appointees and ask what Minister made the appointments and who were his or her friends.  One of the appointees is a union representative while the two other appointees are very committed local individuals, one of whom is a councillor, Letty Baker, a well known name in the Bantry area, and is very committed to the development of the town.  The other ministerial appointee is Kathleen Tessyman who has knowledge of the bay and who might have spent a number of years commuting on it to and from work.  I do not believe one could get a better mix of people representing Bantry harbour.</P>
        <P>I have spent much time in the region and enjoy the sea and water sports.  I have probably done everything in Bantry Bay.  I have also travelled from Dublin to Bantry Bay on a boat.  One of the last ports of call for a proper marina located in a decent town where there are appropriate support facilities is Kinsale.  After that, one has a long haul.  While there are good facilities along the way, there are no proper marina facilities.  We all know what it is like to get around Mizen Head.  There is a long haul from Kinsale, getting around Mizen Head and going north.  There is a small private marina in Bantry Bay, which is great, on Bere Island which is not really able to accommodate a large number of boats and is full most of the time.</P>
        <P>If anyone were to ask me &mdash; not because of my connection with Bantry Bay &mdash; where I would locate a marina in that general vicinity I would have to say it should be in Dunmanus Bay or Bantry Bay.  I understand Bantry Bay is one of the deepest harbours in Europe so it would probably be appropriate to accommodate various sizes of boats and yachts.  Either one of them would be appropriate.  One would question why it is not there already or if work is already being done there.  Why would there be a commitment or who would have a commitment to have that type of facility?  One would have to accept no one would be better than the local community, given the benefits that would accrue.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to put on record my understanding that Senator O&rsquo;Donovan secured in excess of &euro;3 million for the dredging of Bantry Bay around the harbour area, which is very necessary.  If it took place other developments could proceed.  One could then, at that stage, accommodate and incorporate a marina, which would be a great development for the town of Bantry.</P>
        <P>It has been brought to my attention that Murnane and O&rsquo;Shea limited &mdash; Mr. Bob Murnane has been a great man for the Bantry town area and is an innovator, an entrepreneur and a man with great vision who has certainly done a major amount of work &mdash; did some work on the development of the inner harbour in June 2006.  It has prepared a report indicating what could be accommodated by way of a marina in the inner harbour.  I am not sure if one will have the same commitment to the project if there is enabling legislation stating, &ldquo;We have pulled the rug.  We now have the upper hand and can hand this to Cork Port and thanks for the work in the past&rdquo;.  I am not sure if that is the correct way to go about business.</P>
        <P>In the current climate, everything has changed dramatically and quickly.  We are not talking about the economy of Ireland but about what is happening on the world stage.  We in Ireland are not cushioned in any form or fashion from the economic and financial difficulties and the current situation has serious implications for us.  When this type of thing happens and one is in conversation with others, someone often says at a time like this, we need to get back to basics, see what was done in years gone by and do it again.  We need to start from scratch and go back.</P><Col N="851"/>
        <P>It is interesting to note what President Barack Obama is doing in America, such as having house meetings, bringing Americans together, addressing their difficulties, uniting them and opting for change.  It is being done through an address on the economic recovery plan.  In doing so he is going back to the 50 states and asking people to meet, make decisions, identify issues and work locally.</P>
        <P>The distance from Cork Port to Bantry is probably one of the greatest distances one could take in the geographic map of Ireland.  I am not sure how long the journey would take by boat; it would probably depend on the type of boat one was on.  The car journey is in the region of a two hour run.  We are not talking about those at Cork Port being able to run down the road and see what is happening or having their finger on the pulse.</P>
        <P>It is a unique situation.  The local community is very committed and has very dedicated people who have done well.  If Bantry Port was suffering, had failed in its duties, was in financial difficulties, had people who were not committed sitting or participating on a board, or people who were not even involved, such as those mentioned in the Murnane and O&rsquo;Shea limited proposal, and was looking for someone to come and take over the unique situation prevailing in Bantry, perhaps at that stage we should look at Cork, if there was not going to be a commitment from anyone else.  This was mentioned in the Murnane and O&rsquo;Shea limited proposal.</P>
        <P>I understand there is a high level review document, which is just short of 200 pages, and have no doubt there are lines in it indicating the reasons why the situation in Bantry Port should be changed, allowing for section 18 of the Bill which allows for the transfer of certain harbours under the Harbours Act.  Equally, having been given the opportunity to study the review in a balanced fashion, and after hearing what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said over the last number of weeks on this issue, on reading his eight amendments in this section all I can say is I wholeheartedly support my colleague.</P>
        <P>I want to give a clear message to the Minister of State and Department officials.  I have not met one person in my visits to Bantry who said the Senator is wrong.  I have not met one person who does not support the dredging of the inner harbour and the proposal for a marina development.  I have not met one person who said there was no need for an extension of the pier.  These are some of the principal issues the Senator and Bantry Port are seeking to resolve.  People will say that Cork will go ahead and do those things anyway, and will work with local people and everybody will be happy.</P>
        <P>Returning to the economic and financial position we find ourselves in, the first thing any logical person who lives a couple of hours drive from a place where one could sail a pleasure or sailing boat would ask is what is in it for us, whether there is money upfront or whether we will have to carry a burden.  Those are reasonable questions for any authority to ask.  If Bantry Port is seen as a profitable organisation, people probably would not have a great level of objection if a few bob came with the onerous task of taking on the challenge.  They would look at the two main areas, Whiddy and the stone quarry.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if Cork Port would have the same in-depth commitment to other aspects of the development of Bantry Bay, which I have already mentioned and will not go over again, such as the marina, dredging, the pier extension, leisure facilities and many other activities that happen in the bay area.  Owing to the unique situation that prevails in Bantry, I ask the Minister of State to be reasonable and let us reach some level of compromise rather than putting this issue to the House for a decision, which would cause difficulty for some Members.  I know what must be done, but it is not unreasonable to ask for a level of detailed negotiation to commence and be concluded with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan before this matter is put to the House.  Some of his worthy convictions and commitments, as contained in the amendments, should be accommodated in some form.  That is the way the world is working today.  We talk about openness, <Col N="852"/>transparency and reaching consensus through social partnership, so we should act thus on this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I have said it before, may I remind Members of what we are doing here and the history of this matter?  Five or six years ago, a high level review of the State&rsquo;s commercial sea ports recommended the amalgamation of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners with the Port of Cork Company.  Those recommendations and the consultation process that informed them fed into the ports policy statement which is now Government policy.  That statement was published and extensively discussed three or four years ago.  It was subject to an intensive consultation process before and after publication.  The process has continued in respect of the harbours we are discussing and, as mentioned earlier, we are talking about the due diligence report.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement clearly indicated that the continued operation of the country&rsquo;s regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 was unsustainable.  The statement recommended the transfer of those harbours to relevant local authority control or, in cases where significant commercial traffic still existed, that consideration should be given to placing the harbours under relevant port company control.  It is because of the quantity of commercial traffic in Bantry and Fenit that the proposal has come about to link them to existing ports.  If Bantry did not have the oil terminal it would already have been transferred, or would be in the process of being transferred, to Cork County Council.  Were it not for the commercial traffic and the need for commercial expertise, were it not for Liebherr in Fenit, for example, there would be no need to put Fenit into the Shannon-Foynes Port Company.  It would not be necessary from the point of view of fishing or the marina, but it is because of the commercial traffic.  It is a case of how one handles commercial traffic and it is Government policy to try to link them to a commercial port that has the professional expertise.</P>
        <P>I answered Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s earlier questions about the due diligence report and other issues.  The Senator then talked about the transfer date and what could happen.  He is a solicitor, unlike myself, and he read out the legal jargon contained in the Bill with great passion.  All the details concerning the transfer date refer to what would legally happen if everything else occurred, including the consultation process and legal paperwork.  The material the Senator read out is probably a direct copy from other Bills which contain such legal phraseology.  The same provision already exists, almost word for word, in the 1996 Act to allow for a transfer to local authorities.  The same legal wording applies to anyone who is signing a will and while the Senator made it sound very dramatic, it is nearly a standard provision.  It already applies, almost word for word, so it does not have the great significance the Senator implied.  However, if the consultation and due diligence go ahead and if it is all agreed at local level, works out and is transferred, then the legal process to which the Senator referred eventually would take place.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the letter the Senator read out from the Irish Ports Association, but I am surprised by the way in which he spoke about Bantry Harbour board.  He said that if this legislation goes through, the board would almost throw in the towel and it would be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  I am horrified by that but I do not believe the Senator meant it.  I do not believe that would be the attitude locally.  If the Bantry Harbour board has such deeply held views on this matter, it would be taking a firm part in the consultations and negotiations that must go on.  It would do its best so that its aspirations and dreams would be copperfastened in whatever structure emerges, be it with the port of Cork, the county council or whatever.  The Senator is not doing his own people any justice by pretending that everything would be signed, sealed and delivered once this Bill goes through.  This is enabling legislation and, as I have explained <Col N="853"/>before, it will not take effect immediately.  If it takes effect at all, it will be after due diligence, due process and consultation have been undertaken.</P>
        <P>The national oil reserve is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I cannot speak or act with authority on the state of the national oil reserve, including how many days&rsquo; oil reserves are in Bantry terminal or elsewhere.  I do not want to get into that.  It is because of the commercial expertise of the port of Cork that any potential merger is viewed as being appropriate to Bantry.  There is linkage already, including an arrangement between Bantry and the port of Cork on professional expertise for the handling and management of the oil terminal.  That is what we are trying to do by developing best practice to use expertise and have linkages to big ports for smaller locations such as Bantry and Fenit which have commercial traffic.</P>
        <P>The Senator said that at one stage it looked as if Bantry was going to be designated as a port.  While the Senator may have a different view as of now, it is my view and that of the Department that based on the level of business activity in Bantry at present &mdash; and I accept that it is doing all right &mdash; including turnover, profitability and throughput, the scale of business in Bantry or Fenit is not really sufficient for them to be turned into ports.  Corporatisation as a commercial port company confers major financial and corporate governance responsibilities.  It is not just the case that one would be boss in one&rsquo;s own domain.  The control of Bantry Port would still be in Bantry, but that would bring responsibilities.  That is the reason a merger between a port company with significant commercial trade and a smaller regional port offers economies of scale.</P>
        <P>If all the things read out by the Senator with regard to the expansion of Whiddy Island and Bantry Bay etc. happened, the port might be big enough to stand alone.  However, that is just one consultant&rsquo;s report and I do not know how real its proposals are or whether they will be implemented.  If Bantry developed significantly and there was more commercial traffic, it could, perhaps, be considered for corporatisation again.  However, that is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo; and is too far ahead.  We can only deal with the situation as it is today, we cannot look around corners or predict what will happen.</P>
        <P>There are already professional links between Bantry and Cork in the area of harbour master duties etc.  This is only right as there is much professionalism in Cork.  Under the Harbours Act, it is Government policy that port companies must be self-financing and not reliant on Government funding.  This is the fundamental issue.  If there was enough traffic in either Fenit or Bantry to allow them to stand alone, they would have to be able to survive without funding.  They could not be designated ports like Dublin or Waterford and still receive Government funding.  They must be one or the other.</P>
        <P>We have had a good discussion of the issues and have gone through the history of the situation.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan provided good detail of what is happening in the Shannon Estuary area and I hope the liquid gas plant at Ballylongford goes ahead and gets over its problems, be they related to planning or foreshore issues.  Senator Buttimer came at the issues from a different perspective.  He sees Cork Port getting involved in Bantry as something that pulls Cork down.  That will not happen.  However, it is to cater for these views that these discussions take place.</P>
        <P>This Bill just provides another option, but it is subject to the due diligence report and the detailed consultation we have agreed to, which would have happened anyway but has been formalised by being included in the Bill.  If in one, two or three years&rsquo; time it seems to be the majority view that a merger takes place, which was the recommendation of experts previously, Government policy will be to try to make that happen.  However, there will be plenty of local consultation on the due diligence report, which will be given to Bantry for discussion there. <Col N="854"/> Everything can and will be done to facilitate that.  It would be rather foolish to think that everybody will come on board.</P>
        <P>Dublin Port is a big port, yet other activities take place there, including sailing and yacht club activities.  It is possible to have an arrangement whereby the other uses of the port can be taken on board to some extent, although the good people of Clontarf might not fully agree on that.  While it is a struggle, it is possible to have different uses catered for in a port.  It is Government policy to try to achieve this and we are trying to do that in this Bill.</P>
        <P>If the main players on the ground, namely, Cork Port and the Bantry Harbour Commissioners, cannot come together in a sensible way, other options, such as the local authority or a private company, must be possible.  It is, however, policy not to leave smaller harbour commissions on their own and to try to link them with a bigger port if they have significant traffic, as Bantry has, or with the local authority.  Local authorities around the country have already taken over a number of them.</P>
        <P>I have heard the concerns of Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, but I hope we can move on, let the negotiations take place at local level and see what comes out in a year or two, or whatever length of time it takes, from the discussions between Cork Port, Bantry Harbour Commissioners and everybody else from the Bantry area with a point of view to express on the issue.</P>

	<P>I have listened to the Minister of State, but he is missing my concern.  I do not wish to go around in circles, but Government policy is highlighted in the major report or high level review of commercial State ports.  I have been saying <i>ad nauseam</i> that the report &mdash; I will read into the record the next day the parts of the report that concern Bantry and my amendments &mdash; takes no account of anything except commercial activity.  There is no mention of the importance of Bantry from the tourism perspective of marine and leisure activities etc. </P>
        <P>I attended a meeting in Bantry last Monday, chaired by people from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, with regard to Bantry&rsquo;s designation, with Killarney, as a tourist hub for south and west Munster.  We were told at the meeting what could and should be done for the area.  Like reports from many Departments, this report on the ports was drawn up with tunnel vision that never looked left or right and involved no cross-departmental discussion or engagement.  We can leave Whiddy Island refinery out of the discussion as it might close.  The stone quarry in Adrigole, which exports its stone from Leighhill pier, may also close, but one sure thing is that people will still live on Whiddy Island, and I must represent them.</P>
        <P>Bantry is a tourist hub and part of our main tourism industry.  A new hotel opened there that cost over &euro;40 million.  I could argue that on strict commercial lines there is merit for a merger between Cork and Bantry ports, based on commercial traffic.  However, that negates my duty to the fishermen, fish farmers etc.  There is nothing in this Bill for them although they have a role to play.  They are the stakeholders and must be protected and consulted.  That is the reason I find it impossible to support the Bill in its current form before the due diligence report is completed and before full consultation with all stakeholders.  This has not happened.</P>
        <P>After the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster, there was a major commitment from the then coalition, led by Dick Spring, that money would be spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Subsequently, in the watch of a Government of which I was a member, there was a sale of the facilities on Whiddy Island.  Over the past 30 or 40 years, irrespective of what Government was in power, the needs have remained the same.  The island <Col N="855"/>needs a decent pier that is accessible at low tide.  The Minister of State has historical connections with Whiddy Island.  Some years ago an elderly lady on the island broke her leg and was brought in by boat, but because the tide was out she had to be lifted over different boats to reach the pier and the ambulance.  It is only now, when the slipway is almost complete, that an ambulance will be able to pick up patients directly.  It is difficult to believe this is only now possible.  We cannot forget the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster, the Whiddy Island disaster or the possible need for a fire tender to go to the island and the need for proper slipways.  </P>
        <P>I concede there is some merit in a merger on a strict commercial understanding, but the bigger picture is being missed.  We cannot follow the tunnel vision of Departments as that is crazy.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness.  One of the missed opportunities of the past decade was the failure of the Government to address the high levels of child poverty.  Figures for 2007 show that 80,000 children live in families which cannot afford basic necessities such as healthy food, warm clothing or heating.  With the recent downturn in the economic climate and the surge in unemployment it is probable that greater numbers of children now live in poverty.  Leaving these statistics aside, child poverty means many children went to school today with empty bellies.  Many parents are unable to buy warm clothes for their children during this very cold weather spell.  Children live in overcrowded and, in some cases, unhealthy accommodation.</P>
        <P>We have many celebrated cases of children growing up in poor backgrounds and making it rich.  We are all aware of the classic rags to riches story, &ldquo;Slumdog Millionaire&rdquo;.  However, <Col N="856"/>while we salute everybody who can make it through such difficult circumstances in this world, the idea of vast numbers of children growing up in poverty and using this experience to become wealthy is just the stuff of Hollywood, Bollywood and Pinewood.</P>
        <P>Of course there are exceptions to the rule but the generality is that most Irish children who grow up in poverty are less likely to complete their education and earn average wages and they are more likely to be unemployed as adults, endure poor health and die younger.  Let us not forget that the Ireland of today is still a very wealthy country so our record on child poverty is unacceptable.  A recent OECD report on the matter found that Ireland ranks 25th out of 30 OECD countries.</P>
        <P>Instead of these appalling figures jolting the Government into action it appears we are going backwards.  In 2002, the Government promised in the programme for Government that the effort to end child poverty would be a core element of its work.  In 2003, the Government published the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion.  This contained a clear commitment to reduce child poverty to just 2% by 2007.  However, in 2007 the rate of child poverty stood at more than 7% and it appeared that any commitment made a few years previously had gone out the window.  The current programme for Government agreed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party makes no mention of child poverty.  Perhaps they are of the view that it has been eliminated: I do not know.</P>
        <P>Recently, the UK Government proposed legislation which will enshrine its commitment to ending child poverty in the UK by 2020.  The UK Government seems to accept that it takes time to tackle and eliminate child poverty and that it does not happen overnight.  It has targets towards which all Departments and agencies can work.  Here, the Government had a target, it failed miserably to meet it and it now wants to avoid making any commitment to address the issue.  This is not good enough.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party believes the reduction and eventual elimination of child poverty is vital.  We believe significant progress can be made but reducing child poverty requires concerted action and measures across a range of areas.  This has long been recognised by non-governmental organisations.  This recognition led to the establishment in 2002 of the End Child Poverty Coalition, ECPC, which is made up of seven organisations, namely, the National Youth Council of Ireland, Barnardos, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Pavee Point, Focus Ireland, One-Parent Exchange and Network, OPEN, and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  This coalition of seven deals with the consequences of child poverty on a daily basis.  They run breakfast clubs so children do not start their lessons hungry.  They provide direct supports so parents can meet the cost of food, clothes and school books.  They run programmes to prevent children leaving school early and support families to get decent and affordable accommodation.</P>
        <P>Since they work at the coal face of the problem they are well placed to advise us on what we need to do to address the issues and I commend the work that these organisations, their staff and volunteers do on a daily basis.  However the members of the coalition do not want to deal solely with the consequences of child poverty, they want to deal with the causes as well.  They put forward a very coherent policy approach to dealing with the issue.  They propose Government action across a range of Departments and agencies in areas such as income and employment supports, early childhood education and care, education, housing and health.</P>
        <P>Other countries which have much lower levels of child poverty have targeted income supports at the poorest families.  They have invested heavily in public services.  They have flexible employment policies to support parents who are working.</P>
        <P>Decent work with a wage on which one can live obviously comprises one of the best routes out of poverty for many families.  We must encourage and support parents to take up work and <Col N="857"/>avail of job opportunities. However, for some parents, working outside the home is very difficult or, in some cases, impossible.  Many children live in households in which the parents cannot work owing to illness or disability.</P>
        <P>Many lone parents who would love to work outside the home cannot do so because of their caring responsibilities or because they would only obtain low-paid work that would leave them less well off after paying tax and meeting child care costs.  These families are especially at risk of poverty and the only recognition of this by the State is the child dependant allowance<b>.</b>  This is just &euro;26 per week per child and in no way meets the necessary costs associated with rearing a child which the families in question face every day.</P>
        <P>The other key issue the End Child Poverty Coalition has highlighted is the need to keep people who can work in work and to provide supports to families where parents are in low-paid employment.  The Family Income Supplement, FIS, was introduced to increase the reward from work by providing low-paid households with additional income.  In the current environment, in which prices are going through the roof while jobs are flying out the door, many families will be in greater need of the FIS.  It is vital that we keep as many people in work as possible.  Therefore, the proposal of the End Child Poverty Coalition to increase the income thresholds for the FIS makes perfect sense and is valid and necessary in the short term.</P>
        <P>We must consider how the scheme is administered.  Some of the conditions of the scheme and the bureaucracy surrounding it are such that only three out of ten families entitled to a FIS payment actually receive it.  A similar benefit in New Zealand has a take-up rate of nine out of ten families.  Once again, the organs of the Irish State are failing families, including children.  Will the Minister of State reconsider how FIS is administered so the people entitled to it can obtain it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Eliminating child poverty needs to be returned to the agenda because a childhood blighted by poverty, want and hardship impairs not only the affected child but society as a whole.  This is why the Labour group has put forward this motion.  We want the Government to take this issue seriously again.  We want it to outline a clear plan of action with timelines, deadlines and targets to reduce and eliminate child poverty.  We want the Government to vindicate the wishes of our founding fathers in 1916 that every child of the nation would be cherished equally.  We want the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, to fulfil the promise he made on the day he was elected Taoiseach to the effect that the needs of young people would be a particular priority for his Government.  We want the Government to uphold Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which calls on states to ensure children have an adequate standard of living.  Most important, we want Ireland to be one of the best places in the world for children to grow up in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I second this important motion on child poverty.  It is shocking and unacceptable that 76,000 children in this State live in poverty and that a further 205,000 live in households where the income is such that they are at risk of poverty.  This figure is rising all the time given the present economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>I commend the work of the End Child Poverty Coalition on keeping this issue on the agenda.  Senator Hannigan has spoken about income and employment supports, but I would like to focus on public services such as child care, education, health and housing.  I will focus on child care first.</P>
        <P>The first few years in any child&rsquo;s life are critical in terms of learning and development.  For children living in poverty, preschool could be the first step on a path out of poverty.  The current lack of affordable, flexible and quality early childhood care and education and afterschool care <Col N="858"/>prevents parents from taking up employment and availing of job opportunities, which only serves to keep the family stuck in a cycle of poverty.</P>
        <P>The Government claims to be committed to providing families with access to child care services appropriate to the circumstances and needs of the child.  In particular, it claims to be concerned about families living in poverty.  However, its record speaks for itself.  In the budget, the Government shut down the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, which was about to roll out a plan, costed at &euro;700,000, to address the early education needs of children in the most disadvantaged communities, aged from three up to the age of school enrolment.  That programme was ready to run in September 2008 but, at the last moment, the plug was pulled.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the programme has now been transferred to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I would welcome clarification from the Minister of State as to when that programme will be implemented.  Many groups fear it has in fact been abandoned.  If so, it would demonstrate this Government&rsquo;s penny-wise and pound-foolish approach.  The National Economic and Social Forum report of 2005 found that, for every &euro;1 invested in early childhood education and care, a return of up to &euro;7.10 could be expected.</P>
        <P>I support the proposal from the End Child Poverty Coalition that we should provide universal, free, quality preschool places for all children aged from three to four years by implementing the National Economic and Social Forum&rsquo;s blueprint for universal access to early childhood education and care.  The roll-out of these places should begin with children who are disadvantaged, including those in RAPID and DEIS-designated areas.  Likewise, in the formal education system we need to invest to ensure children living in poverty get a fair chance and the opportunity to achieve their full potential.  The announcement today that children availing of special needs teachers are to lose them is a retrograde step that will have long-term consequences and will not lead to cost savings.</P>
        <P>We all know free education at primary and secondary levels is a myth.  The cost of schooling places a terrible burden on families living in poverty who must meet the costs of books, uniforms and a range of other necessities associated with keeping children in the school system.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has stated very clearly that the back-to-school grant paid out in August each year is way below what is required.  This is evident from the attendance rate at my clinics and the genuine hardship people experience and which they experienced during the so-called boom.  Even in the latter period, the clinics were still busy owing to there being people with unmet needs.  Organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul support families on a weekly basis to meet the costs of keeping children in school.</P>
        <P>We have discussed in this House the issue of the very large class sizes.  At present, Ireland has the second largest pupil-teacher ratio in the European Union.  There are 100,000 children in primary schools and 35,000 young people in secondary schools being taught in classes of 30 or more.  Large class sizes have an impact on all children but because of the deficiencies in the system, many parents must pay to ensure their children get extra support or tuition.  That option is not open to parents who struggle to make ends meet and, therefore, children living in poor households will fall further behind.</P>
        <P>Child poverty contributes to early school leaving.  Parents who struggle to keep their child in school may be less likely to object when their 15 or 16 year old gets a job rather than staying in school to obtain a leaving certificate because doing so brings necessary extra money into the household.  As my colleague Senator Hannigan pointed out, it is the voluntary organisations represented by the End Child Poverty Coalition that must deal with the consequences.</P><Col N="859"/>
        <P>The member organisations of the National Youth Council of Ireland are working on projects with young people to prevent and stem early school leaving.  Despite all the evidence and every report known indicating that supporting young people so they can stay in school and gain some recognised qualifications is in their best interest and that of society&rsquo;s, the Government in the budget cut the funding by 10% to youth organisations running early school leaving projects.  This is a retrograde step that will not have a positive outcome for anybody.  It defies logic.</P>
        <P>We still have a very high rate of early school leaving.  Up to 15% of children leave school with little or no formal qualifications.  This is particularly a problem among children who grow up in poverty and unless we invest in them and target resources at them, we will perpetuate the cycle of poverty and deprivation.</P>
        <P>I will turn briefly to the issue of health.  No parent would think twice about going to the doctor when his or her child is sick.  However, because the costs of health care are so high and the medical card limits are so low, parents with limited incomes who bring their children to the doctor must either forgo other basic needs or go into debt.  It is unacceptable that the health of our children is so far down the list of priorities that parents are placed in such a terrible position.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment in the programme for Government to double the income threshold limits for families with children under six.  That is to be welcomed.  However, almost two years on there is no sign of the commitment being implemented by Government.  We need answers as to why that is so and perhaps an update on a revision of the proposal.  In real terms the cost of implementing the measure would be far outweighed by the benefits it would bring to the health and well-being of the most vulnerable children in the State.  Likewise, it would alleviate the awful cost and burden of health care on families who just cannot afford it.</P>
        <P>Finally, I wish to mention housing.  The housing waiting list figures announced in December showed an increase of 30% since 2005.  Many of those on the waiting lists are low-income families who are currently in costly, unhealthy, overcrowded and inappropriate housing and accommodation.  Insecurity is another issue for families that have to move regularly and that can interrupt a child&rsquo;s education and well-being.  I strongly support the call by the ECPC that the Government meets its commitment to build 10,000 social housing units over the next three years.</P>
        <P>We have heard much about the need to invest &euro;7 billion in the banking system for the future of the country and that may be so.  I urge the Government to give more attention to and invest a fraction of that money in the reduction and ultimately elimination of child poverty in this country.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in the debate and to propose the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.  While I do not agree with the content of the motion tabled by Senators Hannigan and Prendergast I thank them for providing us with an opportunity to focus on this important area.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment is lengthy.  Therefore, I propose to focus specifically on aspects of poverty and social inclusion.  I am proud of this and previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments&rsquo; record of delivery in terms of reducing child poverty and promoting social inclusion.  Many barriers to social inclusion exist and whether they are economic or environmental they can greatly affect the development of children.</P>
        <P>Social inclusion is defined as, &ldquo;The position from where someone can access and benefit from the full range of opportunities available to members of society&rdquo;.  It aims to remove barriers for people who experience a combination of linked problems such as unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime environments, bad health and family breakdown.  One product of difficulties such as those in most cases is poverty.  Child poverty in particular is a considerable cause of distress to children and society and is a real barrier to social inclusion for children.</P>
        <P>Our commitment to dealing with child poverty is manifested in two major ways.  First, we have consistently increased funding and provided extra resources to combat the scourge that is child poverty.  Second, we have developed national policies and systems to end the cycle of child poverty that has affected the State since its foundation.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to tackling child poverty.  The national action plan for social inclusion, NAP Inclusion, is to reduce the numbers of those experiencing consistent poverty, including children, to between 2% and 4% by 2012 with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty completely by 2016.  That aim is realistic and is being followed through by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to look at the facts and I hope the Opposition will give credit where it is due.  Since coming into office in 1997, Fianna F&aacute;il has lifted 100,000 children out of hardship and deprivation.  In 2007, the Central Statistics Office noted that consistent poverty fell from 6.5% to 5.1%.  The rate of consistent poverty in the case of children from birth to 17 years reduced <Col N="861"/>from 10.3% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2007.  That reduction, while welcome, is only one step along the way to eliminating child poverty.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, for many years lone parents and their children suffered the most from poverty.  It is pleasing to note there was a significant reduction in consistent poverty rates for lone parents in 2007 from 33.9% to 20.1%.  The results also revealed that the average disposable income in respect of children increased by 16.2% between 2006 and 2007.  The significant reduction in consistent poverty among children in 2007 shows us that the combination of policies being pursued is working.  We are now in challenging economic times.  We will experience disappointments along the way if we are not making progress as quickly as we would like but even in these times the Government&rsquo;s priority remains to maintain and build on our progress.  Its determination to do so is demonstrated in the recent budget measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I intend to consider three major themes, namely, direct funding for families and children and strategies and services.  Three specific payments are made to families to provide financial support to combat child poverty.  They demonstrate our ongoing commitment.  Child benefit is the major source of funding for families provided by the State.  All children under the age of 16, or under 19 if attending third level education, are entitled to it.  At present the rate for one child under 18 is &euro;166.  For the record, in 1997, it was &euro;38.10, representing a fourfold increase in the past 12 years.</P>
        <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is a HSE payment payable to low income families designed to help meet some of the costs associated with children returning to school.  The early child care supplement is another State payment to families with children under the age of five.  Its purpose is to financially assist families with the cost of raising children.  Since its introduction in budget 2006, it has gone some way towards reducing the financial burden on young families, thus I believe helping to create a better standard of living for the nation&rsquo;s children.  We are all aware of the recent changes announced by the Minister for Finance last week regarding this payment and while a reduction in the rate is not desirable, the continuation of the payment represents the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to providing resources.</P>
        <P>Budget 2009 provided for a range of measures costing more than &euro;56 million to benefit children and families.  Those increases will mean that the high level goal of maintaining the combined value of child income support measures at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate will continue to be met next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to turn to services and systems the Government has developed in recent years.  Without a doubt, an outstanding example of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government&rsquo;s commitment to children has been the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Since its inception, first as the Office of the Minister for Children and now as the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the office has been a key sponsor of child-centred policies and initiatives from central Government.  The present Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is charged with implementing the national children&rsquo;s strategy, the national child care investment programme, the Childcare Act, implementing Towards 2016 commitments on children&rsquo;s services and developing policy and legislation on child welfare.  That leaves children in Ireland with an even stronger voice at the heart of Government decision making.</P>
        <P>The surest way to reduce childhood poverty is by providing a hand up rather than a hand out.  The development of employment options for parents is the most progressive way to improve a childhood.  One thing always struck me from my experiences of dealing with people at risk of poverty, they want to move beyond their current status.  They want the best for their children and they are willing to work with the State to do so.</P>
        <P>I would like to think we could eliminate child poverty and that we would ensure there would be real social inclusion but I would like to add a word of caution.  While economic factors play <Col N="862"/>a part, so do environmental and societal factors, which can be more complex to address.  We must accept there will always be an element of personal responsibility involved.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer briefly to health.  I welcome the increase in income levels for medical cards and the provision of GP cards.  I wish to refer to a particular project of mine.  We have made available an immunisation programme for infants.  That is one sure way to ensure we take a proactive step to protect children&rsquo;s health.  Failure to do so can result in the acquisition of a disability by children, which is something that is entirely preventable.  I urge the Minister to bring back a message to Government that we undertake an awareness campaign again.  I understand there are genuine fears on the part of parents that such vaccinations may be linked to disorders.  We have no scientific evidence for that but we do have scientific evidence to show that failure to immunise leaves children at greater risk of acquiring the disease and subsequently an avoidable disability.  Disability is a real barrier to social inclusion for children.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State but I regret that the Minister of State with responsibility for children could not find the time to attend.  I commend the Labour Party on a fine, detailed motion in which it calls on the Government to &ldquo;develop a clear strategy to address child poverty and to set a date in law by which child poverty will be eliminated in Ireland&rdquo;.  As natural as this request sounds, the reality is that the Government no longer believes in strategies when it involves tackling any kind of poverty.  This is no more evident than in the way the Government has shamelessly cut funds and merged the Combat Poverty Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion, thereby removing a vital independent voice.  We have also witnessed the effects that cuts in funding have had on the Equality Authority and other agencies.  Perhaps the Government may retort that a strategy is in place and Senator Corrigan mentioned this, but there is a gross difference between having a strategy and providing resources for its implementation and achieving the aims set out in it.  I am sorry that the Government&rsquo;s record of implementing findings from its strategies is poor.</P>
        <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, was set up in 1997 with specific targets for reducing poverty.  Unfortunately, they were aspirational but a multi-departmental and agency approach was taken.  Among the strategy&rsquo;s aims was the Government target to reduce consistent child poverty to 2% by 2007.  In 2002, a revised strategy was launched in the form of another glossy brochure by the Government with the social partners but these strategies have not been delivered.</P>
        <P>As Senator Hannigan stated, Ireland ranks 21st out of the 27 EU member states in tackling child poverty, and one in nine of our children live in consistent poverty.  Shame on the Minister of State because this is an outrage.  All this proves is that the Government does not take strategies seriously.  I call for a strategy to be put in place and for a date for its implementation to be set out in law.</P>
        <P>The causes of child poverty in Ireland are multifaceted and I will not attempt to outline all of them.  There is, however, an onus on us all in this House to provide assistance to little children, who are our most valuable asset.  The recent ISPCC television advertisement highlighted that the organisation only has sufficient money to answer half the calls it receives.  The money set aside for the scrapping of e-voting machines should be diverted to the society.  It is serious that suicidal children may not have their call answered because this organisation does not have sufficient money.  Money is available for the banks and to address other issues, but our children are our most valuable asset.</P>
        <P>The Government is out of ideas and it is not interested in helping the less well-off.  It has demonstrated no foresight and no opportunities have been created for children living in poverty.  As Senator Prendergast said, lone parents are most affected by this issue.  Child poverty <Col N="863"/>does not exist in isolation and the issue centres on households.  This cycle needs to be broken.  According to an EU survey conducted in 2006, lone parents are the most likely social group to be living in poverty.  According to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, 45% of calls for help in Dublin in 2008 were made by lone parents.  For example, the society referred to Anne, a lone parent with a 12 year old son.  She is struggling to get by and pay her ESB and gas bills on an income of &euro;180 a week.  She could not afford them and, therefore, she swallowed her pride and called the society for help.  Her main concern was protecting her son so that he did not realise she must do this because she has no other recourse.  This is a terrible indictment of our society.  We have emerged from the Celtic tiger era when we never had as much money, yet the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has never received as many calls, especially from lone parents.</P>
        <P>I wonder how the cycle will be broken.  I am concerned that, because of the economic downturn, the Government is more likely not to respect the voiceless and these poor, unfortunate children, which is worrying as they do not have anybody to shout loudly on their behalf.  However, as public representatives, that is what we are in the House to do.</P>
        <P>The final issue I would like to raise is educational attainment.  In 2006, according to the CSO, 47% of lone parents under 35 years were educated to junior certificate level only.  The Minister for Education and Science cut the funding for children with learning disabilities, which will lead to a further deterioration in consistent poverty because education is the only route to empower people to get out of poverty and to make them self-reliant to cope independently in our society.  All these figures would be much worse if a survey gauged the position today.  Something must be done to help young lone parent families to get out of the poverty trap.  Some lone parents feel they are better off on social welfare payments because they can make ends meet.  They will never get out of poverty but what example is that to give children?</P>
        <P>I completely and utterly agree with Senator Corrigan regarding vaccinations.  It is an absolute shame that the Government did not consider it worthwhile to implement the cervical cancer vaccination programme for teenagers, given it would cost very little.</P>

	<P>If one life was saved, it would be worth spending this money.  Will the Minister of State reconsider that decision?</P>
        <P>Last week the Independent Senators tabled a motion on human rights and I referred to mental health issues for children.  All the children in one institution were surveyed and three different mental health illnesses were found to be present in some of them but none was being treated for them.  A youngster from Athlone has been incarcerated many times in an adult institution because there is nowhere for him to go even though he has mental health issues.  That is not right.  That youngster has no voice but the State has completely ignored him and hopes he will go away.  He will end up in a vacuum until he dies because nobody cares.  I care and I hope the Minister of State has listened to my contribution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>My background, both professionally and voluntarily, is in community youth work and I disagree with little in the intent and aspirations of the motion.  Part of my voluntary career was spent with the National Youth Council of Ireland, which is part of the child poverty coalition, and I am glad a number of my former colleagues are present to monitor the debate.  No Member is uncommitted to the notion of reducing and ending child poverty in our society.  It must also be accepted that considerable improvements have been made through the provision of additional resources in recent years.  There should be legitimate political debate about whether all the resources have been used effectively.  We have entered a new era in the current economic downturn in which existing resources and the availability of future resources are very much in question.  As decisions are made, legitimate political debate needs to take <Col N="864"/>place regarding whether their effect is being felt in a just and proper manner, particularly by children, who need the most protection and care in their development.</P>
        <P>I have fears that when making across-the-board cuts, decisions are made that have a disproportionate effect on the provision of children&rsquo;s services.  We need to accept that even before the economic downturn of 2008 and its exacerbating effects as we are feeling them now and as they are likely to develop in the year ahead, there existed an unacceptable level of child poverty in this country, much of it in the families of the working poor.  Now that we have increasing unemployment, that problem is likely to deteriorate.  There is an onus on Government to put in place programmes that meet the effect of such poverty.</P>
        <P>There are legitimate political questions as to how that can be done and whether it is being done.  Legitimate questions are being asked as to the effects of decisions made in recent days.  As a member of a party in Government I also would like to know the effects of such decisions.  Across the board decisions are indiscriminate in their effects and need to be targeted.  As fewer resources are available, how do we ensure those resources are used to best effect?  We can all wish that things were different and that all the problems could be solved at once.  However, in reality we are lacking resources and those resources in sufficient quantities are unlikely to be available for a considerable time.  We need to ask how that can be done in the fairest way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had a discussion today with a chief executive of a youth organisation.  He put to me bluntly the effect of an across-the-board cut in his organisation.  He made proposals as to how the same monetary value could be achieved by making cuts within the system that would not affect face-to-face services.  The real challenge for the Government and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is to ensure the last area affected is the area of face-to-face services, especially in youth work.  We are entering a period with which those of my generation who grew up in the 1980s will be all too familiar.  When I started working as a paid professional youth worker, the resources provided by the Government to pay my wage, such as it was, through what was then an AnCo team workers&rsquo; scheme, was I believe &pound;40 per week.  I do not want to see us going back to that.  Tremendous advances have been made in the resources we are putting into the services.  Following that incremental growth over the past ten years the sudden jolt of a large decrease could have a disproportionate effect on the services.  Unless we are prepared to acknowledge and address that, there are dangers.</P>
        <P>It may be ironic to mention this.  Prior to getting involved in youth work on a large scale, IDA Ireland had a campaign about the viability of Ireland as a destination for investors.  It encouraged people to come to Ireland with the tag line: &ldquo;We are the young Europeans.&rdquo;  At the time the average age of Irish people was approximately 25.  I believe it has now increased to approximately 35.  However, in European terms we are still a very young country.  Ireland is one of only two European countries that is able to replace its population through its birth rate.  That indicates we have a large number of young people and will continue to do so.  How we cater for their education, health and social justice is the mark of any Government.</P>
        <P>Despite what was said about not mentioning the term &ldquo;child poverty&rdquo; within the programme for Government, as a negotiator of that document, I am pleased from my party&rsquo;s point of view with what we included because they were included on the basis of addressing issues of child poverty, especially increasing the provision of medical cards for children under six.  In the current climate and availability of resources, I must accept how, when and even if those issues will be addressed are a challenge.  However, I still believe it is an important social goal.  As Senator Corrigan has said, if we do not have access to primary health care services for the very young in our society, we are creating a series of false economies that whoever subsequently ends up in government will need to address by allocating more unnecessary resources.</P><Col N="865"/>
        <P>I hope this debate is conducted in those terms.  I accept we have a difficulty in terms of relative, consistent, persistent and even absolute child poverty.  How we address it depends not so much on decrying its existence as on acknowledging that the resources available to address it in the first instance are not what they were and that those resources need to be used as cost effectively as possible.  As someone who has worked voluntarily and professionally in the area, I am confident that can be done.  However, it will not be done without a period of readjustment.  Much of that needs to happen not only within the voluntary sector but also most markedly in the mindset of the political system and how resources are originally made available through offices such as the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It is important that such an office exists.  To show its effectiveness, as with all areas of government, it is not a case of doing it when the resources are freely available and Governments can be most flaithi&uacute;lach with public money.  The real test of any Government is to show how we can tackle issues such as this when resources are least.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which tackles the very important issue of child poverty.  I agree with Senator Boyle entirely that one should measure a Government by its commitment to social justice and by its ability to do the most with the least resources.  However, I am disturbed to hear him speak about the need for readjustment.  Given that the Minister for Education and Science today announced what amounts to a severe cutback in the allocation for children with special educational needs, we must question the Government&rsquo;s commitment to social justice.</P>
        <P>We need to ask ourselves what readjustment really means.  Clearly, the Government is proposing readjusting those who are most vulnerable in our system.  In answer to my proposed amendment to the Order of Business calling for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to explain why he had made this cutback, the Leader said it was not a cutback and proceeded to explain that it was a change in the numbers qualifying for special needs teachers.  I am sorry, but it is a cutback by any other name.  The upshot will be that more than 100 teachers will lose their jobs and it has been reported at least 900 children will lose the learning support they require.  We need to question the Government&rsquo;s commitment to social justice and its commitment to ending child poverty.</P>
        <P>The motion mentioned some very disturbing figures.  Some 76,000 children still live in poverty in this country and 20% of children live in households with incomes so low that they are at risk of poverty.  I recognise the Government&rsquo;s commitments stated in its amendment to &ldquo;reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty... with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016&rdquo;.  Clearly that is an important and laudable goal.  However, I take issue with the Government amendment when it notes &ldquo;the significant progress made on the implementation of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, which represents an integrated, strategic approach to addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities&rdquo;.  Members on the Government side should try telling that to the parents and children affected by today&rsquo;s mean-minded announcement by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The previous budget also targeted children and young people from disadvantaged communities despite the Government&rsquo;s stated commitment to improving the quality of services for them.  I have spoken on this matter before.  The implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the Disability Act has been deferred to beyond 2010.  Class sizes have been increased despite a stated commitment in the programme for Government to reduce them.  Even before today&rsquo;s announcement there have been severe cutbacks impacting, for example, on Traveller children whose special supports will be cut.  Class sizes are set to rocket beyond the OECD average despite the commitment in the programme for Government. <Col N="866"/> It is really an empty rhetoric that is addressed at helping and supporting children and it is an empty rhetoric exposed by the reality of this recession and the prioritising by the Government of baling out bankers at the expense of children in need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am grateful to the End Child Poverty Coalition, which is a coalition of seven NGOs, including Barnardos, Focus Ireland and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, all of whom have come together to make six key recommendations to Government with the aim of ending child poverty.  These are very important recommendations.  I call into question the Government&rsquo;s commitment to these recommendations.  The very simple recommendations made by the coalition are, first, to increase basic social welfare payments for families; second, to provide access to quality, affordable and flexible early childhood care and education; third, to tackle educational disadvantage; and fourth, medical card eligibility, homes and support for families in low paid work while enhancing family income supplements.  These are important and very sensible recommendations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Again we are seeing a lack of commitment by the Government to implement these recommendations.  In particular, I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to the second recommendation related to early childhood care and education.  This has been spoken about in this House and I and many others spoke on the need to support early childhood care and education places.  There is a stated commitment in the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion and in the Government&rsquo;s policies to date to provide such care and education, although these are two separate things, childhood care and education and preschool.  What we have seen has been a failure to sign up to the stated commitment; a lack of implementation of the impressive rhetoric.  As the End Child Poverty Coalition points out, the current lack of affordable, flexible and quality early childhood care and education and after-school care restricts parental employment options and keeps families locked into a cycle of poverty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a time when the cutbacks and the measures proposed by Government are really going to impact on people in employment and when they will reduce people&rsquo;s chances of employment and ensure we will see more families locked into poverty, this is the time when we need to see the Government committing to providing universal free quality preschool places for all children.  It makes sense in terms of saving money for the Government from a very practical point of view because we have seen all the research that says if quality early childhood support is provided, such as preschool places and early childhood care and education, there will be long-term savings because children will require fewer supports at school and they will be less likely to engage in anti-social behaviour and young adults are less likely to engage in behaviour that brings them into the criminal justice system.  There is a significant practical saving from a financial point of view and a significant benefit to the community and to society from a social point of view if we look at providing quality preschool education and care for children.  At this time it is one of the important measures the Government could take.</P>
        <P>I draw an analogy with the welcome Government proposals for conservation projects by giving householders grants to insulate their homes.  This is very important because it will have a lot of knock-on benefits such as employing people in the construction sector who are in difficulties and it will have the benefit of reducing carbon emissions and will contribute to Ireland being a better place from an environmental perspective.  However, it will cost money, but that money is being spent with an important and practical and ultimately a money-saving objective.  We can draw the same analogy with early childhood care and education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to a very interesting model in Australia where a government came to power promising early childhood care and education and free preschool places.  I have heard the relevant Australian Minister speak about the policy.  It became so popular that it was one programme <Col N="867"/>that could not be dismantled even by subsequent governments which did not have the same ideological commitment to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Party motion is very significant because it expresses very clearly all the different recommendations which the Government should adopt to address child poverty.  I will single out perhaps the two recommendations that the Government should ensure access to quality, affordable and flexible early childhood education and care because this has been immensely popular when rolled out in other countries and has had immense social and economic benefits.  I also ask the Minister of State to consider implementing the fourth recommendation, tackling educational disadvantage by fully resourcing and implementing the DEIS strategy.  Unfortunately, that has been severely undermined by today&rsquo;s announcement and I question the commitment of the Government to ending childhood poverty, given what we have seen in recent announcements and in the recent budget.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to answer why this announcement has been made today.  It is a good day to bury bad news, given the announcements about the banks.  Why was this announcement made today when the Minister was in this House last night?  I read what he said last night and he did not refer to this change which was introduced today and which targets so severely children with special needs.  I welcome the opportunity to make this contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the House on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, who is unavailable because she is attending a Cabinet meeting.  </P>
        <P>I thank Senators for the opportunity to outline to the House what the Government is doing with respect to child poverty, early education, access to medical cards and meeting the housing needs of our population.  The Government has tabled a counter motion which sets out the progress that is being made in these areas.</P>
        <P>The diversity of State support for children highlighted in the motion is reflected in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, which aims to promote a more integrated approach to policies and their implementation through the lifecycle approach, which includes children as a specific group.  The overall goal of the action plan is to reduce to between 2% and 4% by 2012 the number of those experiencing consistent poverty, including children, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.</P>
        <P>One of the 12  high level goals set out in the plan focuses on achieving significant real increases in income supports for children; three other goals address education initiatives.  In addition, 42 of the 150 detailed targets in the plan cover services such as health, education, income support and early childhood development and care to tackle poverty in families and ensure that children reach their true potential.</P>
        <P>The latest poverty statistics released in December 2008 by the CSO in its annual EU survey on income and living conditions showed that the overall consistent poverty rate in the population reduced from 6.5% in 2006 to 5.1% in 2007.  The rate of consistent poverty in the case of children aged nought to 17 reduced from 10.3% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2007.  Among lone parent households there was a significant reduction in consistent poverty rates from 33.9% in 2006 to 20.1% in 2007.  The results also revealed that the average disposable income in respect of children increased by 16.2% between 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The survey covers the period during which the provisions of budget 2007, which introduced a range of measures costing over &euro;240 million aimed at alleviating child poverty, came into effect.  These included combining the three rates of child dependant allowance payments into a new single high rate qualified child allowance of &euro;22 per week; increasing the rate of child benefit by &euro;10 per week; increasing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by &euro;60 <Col N="868"/>for children aged two to 11, and by &euro;95 for children aged 12 to 22, to bring the rates of payment to &euro;180 and &euro;285 respectively; and providing additional funding of &euro;3 million to extend the school meals programme.</P>
        <P>Other budgetary measures which came into effect during 2007, such as the &euro;20 per week increase in the lowest social welfare rate to &euro;185.80 and increases in the earnings thresholds for one parent family payment and family income supplement, also benefited children living in poorer households.  This package of measures was in addition to initiatives such as the &euro;1,000 a year early child care supplement, which was introduced in 2006.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>While the improvements in the poverty statistics between 2006 and 2007 are positive, I am concerned about the impact of the current economic downturn on low income families.  Despite the limited resources available, budget 2009 prioritised delivering real increases in social welfare payments to ensure that, in line with the NAP inclusion, the most vulnerable groups in our society are protected.  Increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates have been provided for this year, ahead of the projected rate of inflation.  Provision was made for a range of measures costing over &euro;56 million to benefit children and families.  These include an increase of &euro;2 in the qualified child increase payable with social welfare payments, bringing the rate up to &euro;26 per week from January 2009; an increase of &euro;10 per week per child in all family income supplement income thresholds giving an increase of up to &euro;6 per child per week from January 2009; and an increase of &euro;50 per week in the income threshold for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme to enable more families to qualify.  These increases will mean the high level goal of maintaining the combined value of child income support measures at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate will continue to be met this year.</P>
        <P>Children do not experience disadvantage on their own but in the context of their family.  Income support ensures households have an income to provide a basic standard of living.  Employment, however, has a pivotal role in providing an adequate income.  In recent decades it has been demonstrated one effective route out of poverty for parents in the active age groups is through paid employment.  Now, more than ever, we have to give priority to supporting people both into and in employment.</P>
        <P>A key objective is to make employment pay.  People with families who are in lower paid employment are eligible to receive the family income supplement.  This increases household income while enabling recipients to remain in or take up employment.  The weekly average payment for a one child family on family income supplement is approximately &euro;99.  Child benefit and the child care supplement also help to make employment pay because they are paid without means testing people returning to work or already in employment.</P>
        <P>Employment participation is further facilitated and incentivised by a range of education and employment supports made available by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to people in receipt of welfare payments, especially the long-term unemployed, lone parents and sickness related welfare recipients.  These include the back to education and back to work allowance schemes.</P>
        <P>The activation and family support programme and the second chance education opportunities scheme offer supports to people on social welfare and others in improving their employability and personal and family situations.  Policies that strongly support parents into employment have a major impact on child poverty.  The current economic circumstances, with 1,000 people on average losing their jobs each day last month, are making life difficult for many families.  The Government&rsquo;s priority must be to keep as many people as possible in employment while assist<Col N="869"/>ing those who lose their jobs as much as possible.  The Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are working closely together to this end.</P>
        <P>Education is a major factor in children&rsquo;s development for their future economic independence, standard of living and overall well-being.  Missing out on education at any stage of a child&rsquo;s upbringing can have consequences for both immediate well-being and in adulthood.  Since 2000, significant progress has been made towards the establishment of high quality early childhood care and education provision.  Unlike other European countries, Ireland does not have a long tradition of young children attending preschool services.  This presented several challenges, including creating sufficient places, encouraging participation and ensuring services are of a high quality.</P>
        <P>The provision of extra places has been supported through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010.  These programmes, with a combined budget of almost &euro;1.1 billion, are projected to create more than 90,000 child care places.</P>
        <P>A two-pronged approach has been taken to promoting participation and supporting affordability.  Ireland has a long and cherished tradition of supporting parents and families to make informed but independent choices regarding the care and education of their young children.  This is a core principle of the Constitution and the Government has supported this over the past two decades by increasing the value of universal supports to all qualifying parents.  Child benefit is &euro;166 per month for the first child and &euro;203 per month for the third and subsequent children while parents of preschool children also receive the early child care supplement.</P>
        <P>According to national and international research, participation in high quality early education and care services is of particular benefit to children at risk of educational disadvantage.  The community child care subvention scheme, introduced in January 2008, subsidises community-based, not-for-profit child care facilities to enable them to provide quality child care services at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low-income parents.  Average prices charged in these services per full-time equivalent place range from &euro;40 for disadvantaged parents, &euro;95 for low income working families and &euro;140 for middle and upper income families.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, the Government has provided the infrastructure necessary to support quality preschool places.  These initiatives include the publication and commencement of revised preschool regulations; the development of S&iacute;olta, the national quality framework for early childhood education, and a framework for early learning by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment; and the development of a national child care training strategy.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate, it will undoubtedly be much more difficult to achieve the ambitious national policy commitments regarding early childhood education and care.  However, the Government is determined at least to consolidate progress to date and ensure the necessary research and development work required to build capacity for future progress continues.  Targeting of limited resources to those most in need will be a priority.</P>
        <P>In making difficult decisions for 2009, the focus of the Minister for Education and Science has been to continue to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.  Up to 673 primary schools and 203 post-primary schools are included in the schools support programme established under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools initiative.  The plan brings together and builds upon a range of existing programmes and supports in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Measures under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools initiative action plan continued to be rolled out over 2008 and will be extended further in 2009.  These include the further expansion of the mathematics recovery and reading recovery programmes; the first <Col N="870"/>steps programme for primary schools in the urban primary strand; the demonstration library project; the junior certificate schools programme as well as literacy and numeracy initiatives at second level; and the continuation of the family literacy project in 12 locations.</P>
        <P>Evaluation of measures under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools initiative action plan also continued through 2008, with the collection of baseline data on literacy and numeracy in urban and rural primary schools.  The monitoring and evaluation of measures under the action plan is crucial in informing policy on the role such initiatives can play in promoting social inclusion and in identifying models of good practice.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious that access to good quality health care is essential for the well-being and future development of children.  Since the beginning of 2005, the number of persons with a medical card has increased by more than 200,000.  This follows changes introduced by the Minister for Health and Children which resulted in mortgage and rent, child care and travel to work expenses being taken into account in the assessment process for a medical card.</P>
        <P>The general practitioner visit card was introduced in 2005 to assist people, in particular families with children on low incomes, in overcoming barriers to accessing GP services.  The qualification threshold for the GP visit card is 50% above that for a medical card and to date more than 85,000 persons have availed of the card.</P>
        <P>In excess of 32% of the population has free access to a GP through the General Medical Services scheme.  In assessing a person and their dependants for a medical card, the Health Service Executive uses income guidelines while taking into account issues such as medical and social need.</P>
        <P>A steering group has been established in the Department of Health and Children to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of financial, medical and social need in line with the commitment in Towards 2016 to clarify entitlement to a medical card.  The  Department of Social and Family Affairs is represented on this group.  The review will inform the decision-making process on medical card eligibility and is expected to report to the Minister for Health and Children in the next few months.  The Government&rsquo;s policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, sets out a vision to guide the transformation of the housing sector over the medium term by delivering more and better quality housing responses and by doing this in a more strategic way, focused on the building of sustainable communities.  We are now working on the implementation issues which need to be addressed to transform the Irish housing environment to meet the challenges arising, many of which are identified in the policy statement.  I am pleased that substantial strides forward have already been made.  In 2007 alone, over 13,000 social and affordable housing units were delivered and, overall, the needs of almost 18,300 households were met across the housing spectrum.  This represents a significant increase of 24% on the level of needs met in 2006 and is a significant step towards assisting an average of 20,000 households per annum over the seven years of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>The commitment entered into by the Government under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, was to achieve 27,000 social housing starts during the three-year period 2007 to 2009.  In terms of delivery, we set out to achieve the first one third of this 27,000 unit target, or 9,000 starts, in 2007, the first of the three years in the target period.  By the end of 2007 we had exceeded this target, with a total of 9,061 starts achieved across the local authority and voluntary and co-operative housing programmes and the rental accommodation scheme.</P>
        <P>Despite the scale of the pressures on our public finances, the Government is providing significant levels of funding for housing in 2009.  In light of increased numbers of households in need of housing supports, we must make every effort to optimise the use of available resources.  One <Col N="871"/>way or the other, the extent of current housing need demands a flexible and imaginative response to the structuring of our investment programme.</P>
        <P>In the context of budget 2009, the Government announced a new initiative to provide a more cost-effective, targeted approach to meeting housing need through the use of long-term lease arrangements for social housing purposes.  While traditional build-buy approaches have been expanded in recent years, with the introduction of the Part V agreements and the rental accommodation scheme, the use of long-term leasing will allow for a more efficient and effective use of available public resources in meeting housing output targets.</P>
        <P>Essentially, the initiative means unsold housing units available on the market can be deployed to meet social housing needs and clearly demonstrates how our social housing investment programme can assist our social and economic objectives at a particularly difficult time for our country.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing has set aside funding of &euro;20 million for the initial roll-out of the scheme this year.  This is separate and additional to the general housing allocations provided to local authorities under the social housing investment programme.  The range of initiatives in place and the significant levels of funding being invested in housing despite the difficult environment in which we find ourselves will allow us to maintain strong momentum towards meeting our commitments.</P>
        <P>Research and evaluation of progress are central to ensuring our goals are met.  The new, strengthened division, incorporating the Combat Poverty Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion, will be promoting a more integrated approach to social inclusion and child support policies and their implementation across Departments.  The new division will regularly report on progress to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the senior officials group representing the relevant Departments and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Combating poverty, building an inclusive society and the eradication of child poverty remain major priorities for the Government.  I have outlined the strategies and measures being pursued by Government across all policy areas to achieve these aims.</P>
        <P>All children are entitled to a happy and fulfilling life and we must, as a society, strive to achieve that for them.  Children are our future and we must seek to ensure they go into adulthood with the capacity to become mature and productive citizens of a socially cohesive and inclusive society.  I am satisfied that the policies we have in place, which are regularly monitored and evaluated, are having a positive impact.  Although the environment may be more challenging, I assure Senators the Government will continue to work hard to reduce poverty in our society in general but in particular among children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for moving the motion.  I also thank the Minister of State for his contribution.</P>
        <P>When discussing such a difficult and at times sad subject, it is important to place the huge number of statistics and facts to which people refer in the context of the individual experiences we, as public representatives, have had with people who have been touched by the blight of child poverty.  I wish to refer to three types of experience I have had on a regular basis within my constituency.  I am absolutely furious that there are people in my constituency, where I make my home, who have been affected by the matters to which I am about to refer.</P>
        <P>The first of these experiences relates in particular to some of the inner city areas of my constituency.  I live, work, shop and spend time in my constituency and I sometimes come across people who are clearly incapacitated as a result of taking drugs or alcohol and who are wheeling children in buggies.  These individuals are wheeling their poor children around areas of my city, near my home, at a time when they are in no position to take care of themselves never mind their offspring.</P><Col N="872"/>
        <P>The second experience to which I wish to refer relates to young children who, when I ask them where they reside, state they live in bed and breakfast establishments or hostels.  I often ask them how long they have lived in these places and they indicate that they have done so for a couple of months.  They sometimes say they were obliged to move there because they did not feel safe or were of the view that they would not be cared for or respected in the establishment in which they previously resided.  I am aware of the establishments to which they refer.  These children are 14, 15 or 16 years of age.  Their peers live in the kind of conditions in which I hope to raise my children and their main concerns relate to whether they will have enough money to allow them to go out with their friends or to the kind of comments being made about them by those friends on the Bebo website.</P>
        <P>The final experience I wish to outline is one which, thank God, I come across less frequently.  I refer to children I have met who are in care.  The vast majority of the people who provide such care have nothing but the best of intentions.  Nonetheless, I meet children who have been taken from family circumstances that are extremely difficult and who, in their own best interests, have been placed in care.  At times, such care is delivered in institutions and some of the children involved flee from them.  They are what we euphemistically refer to as &ldquo;missing&rdquo; children.  I have met some of these individuals and the statistics so often put forward in respect of this do not capture the essence of their tragic plight or give testimony to the lives they lead.</P>
        <P>I am deeply aware of the economic difficulties we face and have spent a great deal of time discussing them in the House.  I have also spent a great deal of time trying to be reasonable with regard to these difficulties, trying to understand what caused them and trying to make constructive proposals in respect of what should be done differently.  This is one matter about which we should be unreasonable.  We should not state that we are cognisant of the economic difficulties that exist and that, therefore, we should not make particular demands.  We should be unreasonable and state that further action must be taken.</P>
        <P>Before becoming a Senator, I worked in business.  If I had approached a manager and referred to the amount of money I had spent and the increased budgets at my disposal, he or she would have looked at me as if I were mad.  People are only interested in the results one can deliver.  If one is operating in an environment where budgets have been reduced, one must make the money that is available work harder.  One must also be willing to ask difficult questions about those who are spending that money and the effect it is having in the areas at which it is targeted.</P>
        <P>I wish to offer four examples with regard to what we should be doing differently.  The first of these, of which I had first-hand experience approximately one year ago, relates to children leaving primary school and moving to secondary school. I am not aware of any system in place to ascertain whether a child who leaves a school in Phibsborough, for instance, starts a secondary school in locality.  Under such a system a warning bell would ring if a child did not start one of the local secondary schools causing someone in authority to ask where the child in question had gone.  Would such a system be complicated or costly?  It is not a question of money but of will.  We should take this issue more seriously and act to address it.</P>
        <P>I am convinced the money spent on care for vulnerable children could be better spent.  The expenditure of such funds should be subject to an audit, especially in the current circumstances, to ascertain whether they are being well spent and whether they could be spent more creatively to deliver similar or better results.</P>
        <P>I will focus my remarks on the issue of parental leave for fathers.  Some fathers in some of the families under discussion could and should do more for their children.  Before criticising these fathers, however, we must first give them an opportunity to give more time and love to <Col N="873"/>their children.  We need to increase the time available to fathers to spend with their children in early childhood.  When my children were born, I had one week of additional leave.  If parental leave for fathers were increased by a few weeks or perhaps one month, it would make a major difference in this area.</P>
        <P>In the short time remaining to me, I propose to make a number of suggestions regarding the Health Service Executive.  I am sick of the HSE being blamed for all the ills and woes of this country.  The organisation was created by and is accountable to politicians.  We must face up to the fact that we have asked it to do too much.  It must run hospitals, work with doctors, operate the social care system, provide child care services and perform 1,000 other functions.  I am not aware of a single company worldwide, not to speak of a public sector organisation, which has been asked to do so much.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is not designed to deal with the issue of vulnerable and impoverished children.  It is not up to the job because it is being asked to do too much.  The services the HSE provides for children with special needs should be transferred to another body charged with prevention.  This would ensure the services provided by the HSE are not required in the first instance.  These are the types of issues we need to address and I hope to hear further suggestions and examples of similar thinking in this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak to this motion.  Last night, I spoke about many aspects of education, while this evening I propose to speak specifically on the issue of equality of opportunity for disadvantaged students.  I will do so because I dealt with disadvantage and the problems to which Senator Donohoe referred for ten years before entering the House.  At that time, I worked in the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee in the Cabra west area, which includes the area from which the Senator comes.  I am familiar with the problems he raises, having dealt with Christ the King national school and another school further up the same road.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe stated that some students, particularly children from disadvantaged areas, slip through the net when making the transition from primary to secondary level.  The number of children who slip through the net is small.  I know this because I dealt with the issue in a most deprived area.  My responsibility was to ensure children did not slip through the net and structures were in place to ensure children who had reading ages well below the norm for 12 year olds were captured in time.  The psychological service of the City of Dublin VEC was ready to intervene to provide services for such students.  I would be the first to agree with the Senator if the circumstances he describes applied.  I did not encounter them when I worked in this area.  For this reason, I am obliged to nail his argument.</P>
        <P>Naturally, one or two of the children with whom one dealt slipped away because, by their nature, the structures in place were not able to capture home-school links.  I am glad we introduced an action plan.  We addressed the pupil-teacher ratio and ways in which to reach out to parents.  We also brought in the psychological service at all stages of second level education from first year onwards and did case studies.  Considerable work was done on disadvantage between 1987 and 1997, the year in which I entered the Seanad.  I will not speak for the subsequent period as services may have deteriorated since then.</P>
        <P>This brings me to the issue of special education classes.  While doing research on this issue this afternoon, I spoke to a school principal who informed me that the stipulation from the Department is that a class for children with special educational needs must have nine or more pupils to receive full support services.  Since 2005, the size of many of these classes has decreased and they often number only four or five pupils because many of the students have since moved into mainstream education.  The principal in question also stated that students who required extra tuition and assessment were not neglected because she has at her discretion <Col N="874"/>an additional funding allocation.  She also has a link with a special education needs organiser, parents and the psychological service to ensure no child who requires special care is abandoned.</P>
        <P>I say this because I did not have an opportunity to do so this morning when Senators stated the Government is abandoning the children who are most in need.  It is not the policy of the Government or educational system to go down that road.  Perhaps there was a communications error this morning.  However, as I have outlined, special educational needs organisers are in place, the number of psychologists dealing with special needs has increased and special assessments are made to determine whether children with special needs are ready for mainstream education.  If classes have been abandoned, decisions must be made on how to cater for the students in question.  These classes are usually organised on an area rather than school basis.</P>
        <P>I would not stand over the position described by Senators if it were true.  However, major work is being done in the DEIS programme and area action plans.  I want this work to continue with the full support infrastructure, including home-school links, remedial teachers, careers guidance teachers, the psychological service and internal school administrators.  We must all take some pain as we go about our work.  I compliment all the excellent professionals and teachers working in the DEIS programmes who will rise to the challenge and ensure no one will be neglected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris has eight minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just come from a long meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which did some constructive and positive work and passed unanimously an agreed statement on Gaza.  In circumstances such as these, I always begin my contribution by saying I will probably not need eight minutes and then find eight minutes is not enough.  On this occasion, I probably have more time than is necessary.</P>
        <P>I heard the end of the contribution made by my good friend, Senator Ormonde.  I agree with much of what has been said by Senators on the Government side and understand the constrictions of their position.  The Senator spoke passionately about remedial teachers.  While she may not be able to vote in certain ways, she has an influence through her party&rsquo;s parliamentary committee meetings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One aspect of child poverty is the impoverishment of children through the removal of the kind of educational supports which are necessary.  This country always had such an extraordinary reputation.  If one goes back to the 19th century and the hedge schools, people were prepared to sit in the ditch.  The hedge schools gave a damned good education in the classics to untutored, deprived people from an impoverished background.  I am proud of that.  If we could do it then, surely we ought to be able to do it now in terms of removing the limitations announced this morning on the most disadvantaged children, children with mental handicap or whatever the current phrase is.  I am sorry if that is politically incorrect but old people like me use these phrases.  I urge decent people on the other side of the House not to be misled by an apparently confrontational tone, which always happens on Wednesday evenings, but to go back, informed by this debate, and put as much pressure as possible on the Government.</P>
        <P>As I was involved in committees, I am not sure how much has been put on the record.  We probably all received briefings from various groups.  What impresses me about the briefing from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the End Poverty Coalition, in particular, is that it chimes so exactly with my experience as a practising politician.  Last week, without divulging the identity of the person, I put on the record the gist of a communication I received from an admirable young man living in provincial Ireland.  He had worked for a construction company for a number of years and had saved, scrimped and managed so that he could acquire his own <Col N="875"/>company.  He got his own company but was blasted by the economic downturn.  Calamitously, he had other personal debts so he is in an extremely difficult position.  The most heartbreaking thing of all was that he had to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at Christmas so that his children would have some kind of Christmas.  Perhaps some of my colleagues have put some of these stories on the record.</P>
        <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul gave examples which are probably from a variety of sources and combined together.  One of the saddest was the story about the single mother whose husband died just before Christmas.  She experienced devastating grief right in the middle of the holiday season.  She had no money and the funeral expenses etc. overwhelmed her.  She had no spare cash and yet she had small children.  Her 17 year old son begged her, out of pride, not to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul but she did.  She had to do so and overcome not only her pride but her son&rsquo;s.  There is also a poverty in terms of psychological diminishment.</P>
        <P>Poverty is not only a financial matter but it is also a grievous state of mind where things can get really out of kilter.  We spoke the other evening about suicide.  People can be driven to suicide by financial pressure.  I would say to them it is not worth it; it is only bloody money.  They will get out of their difficulties.  I congratulate the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which does fantastic work.  I hope it never catches the Government&rsquo;s eye and gets abolished.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2003 the Government gave a commitment to reduce poverty to 2% by 2007 and, where possible, to eliminate poverty altogether.  I do not believe it is possible to eliminate poverty because it is a human phenomenon.  It can occur not only through accident or economic turbulence outside the individual&rsquo;s control but because of a person&rsquo;s personality.  Some people just cannot manage money.  Some people are manic depressive, they are wonderful people but they go off on a skite and spend every penny they have and reach the limit on their credit cards.  I do not believe we will ever eliminate child or adult poverty.</P>
        <P>If one looks at the figures which lie behind this laudable aim, child poverty was estimated at 6.5% in 2001 but the latest figures for 2007 show it at 7.4%.  It went up by over 1% so instead of a decrease, there has been an increase.  Some 76,000 children live in poverty and a further 205,000 live in households at risk of poverty.  That perilous condition of being at risk of poverty, where one must be penurious about everything, including school books, trips, clothes and keeping up with the other children, is also a fairly crushing kind of poverty.  Children also go to school hungry.</P>
        <P>Poverty and deprivation also have an impact on the further development of children.  The Labour Party motion lists these various things, including the number of children living in poverty and the commitment to eliminate child poverty, so at least I am on target.  It also mentions the necessity to develop a clear strategy on child poverty, which does not seem to exist.  There does not seem to be a clear and coherent policy.</P>
        <P>It is very worthwhile looking at the Society of St. Vincent de Paul figures.  The society states that living in poverty impacts on every area of a child&rsquo;s life.  There is no escape from poverty just as there was no escape from the Israeli shells for the unfortunate civilians in Palestine.  Some 62% of the requests for help received in 2008 by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul Dublin office, which is the largest in the country, came from families with children.  As in the example I put on the record, there was a bulge just before Christmas.  Christmas creates this kind of social and financial pressure.</P>
        <P>Very often the Society of St. Vincent de Paul notices that financial problems are compounded because of the restricted access to social welfare payments and the fact that many people are in enormous debt.  It gives a couple of examples which I hope others have not put on the record.  It is worth putting a human face on this.  This is a real example, although names etc. have been changed.  A man called the Society of St. Vincent de Paul before Christmas and said <Col N="876"/>his gas had been cut off.  That is a practical thing.  If one has no money, what does one do?  The ESB then called, because things never happen singularly, to say it was going to cut off the electricity.  Thank God for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It is a criticism of this State and its policies that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul had to be called in.  The State should be there, especially in the light of the things repeated from 1919 in the Mansion House last month.</P>
        <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul also helps people to manage debt and it helps lone parents.  I instanced the case of one woman whose husband died suddenly and tragically.  However, there are parents who are parenting on their own all the time.  Some 45% of calls for help in the Dublin region in 2008 came from lone parents.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul gave the example of a woman with a 12 year old son struggling to get by.  Her most recent electricity and gas bills were approximately &euro;180 but she could not afford to pay them.  She called the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for the first time in December 2008 requesting assistance.  Her main concern was protecting her son from the situation in which they found themselves.  Again, there is this kind of pride of not wishing to accept poverty.</P>
        <P>Poverty is seen as demeaning.  It is an inheritance from the past.  Nobody wants to be detected in poverty by the neighbours.  How cruel that can be for children.  I know how cruel it can be because I remember how cruel I and all the other little brats were.  A little sign of poverty, whether a child turning up in school with a broken strap on a rucksack, a battered thermos flask, a hole in a shoe or a sock, or long hair which obviously should have been cut, marks the child out as different and he or she will be the target of bullying.</P>
        <P>We should honour the Labour Party for tabling this important motion, thank our friends in Fianna F&aacute;il for listening and ask them to go back to see if they can strengthen the Government&rsquo;s position in this area even in a time of financial hardship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Labour Party motion and the debate, and I support the Government amendment to the motion.  We have had a very good, informed debate, which, I am glad to say, is the way we should go forward in this House.  We all listened to what each other had to say.  The Government&rsquo;s current programme for child care and child welfare is a good one.  </P>
        <P>I spent ten or 12 years on health boards and remember during that time there was no child care policy.  A Minister was then appointed to look after children, which shows how important children are to the party and the country.  We have a long way to go to deal with poverty.  I agree with Senator Norris, it is almost impossible to totally eradicate poverty because one might think poverty, homelessness or various other problems have been solved, but they are not.  I remember 50 people were living on the streets of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and we eventually got accommodation for them.  A new centre was built for them but it did not cure the problem.  There were still people sleeping on the street who would not come into the hostel, which is amazing.  The accommodation is beautiful.</P>
        <P>Poverty and child care is somewhat like that.  Family responsibility plays a major role in ensuring the child comes first.  One will find that a mother, a single parent or a father will always do their best.  However, an addiction to drink or various other things can take over and ruin a child&rsquo;s life.  This is where the State must act responsibly and quickly.  We have reduced levels of finance and the Government is trying to do the best it can, but this is one area we should not cut back on.  We have to ensure that child poverty, to the best of our ability, is eliminated.  That is very important.</P>
        <P>Children have social needs, whether in education or whatever.  The Minister should rethink his decision on the cuts in education.  It is the one thing with which I have difficulty.  In delivering education to younger children we have put in place a major programme and it is a <Col N="877"/>retrograde step to go back on it now.  I understand approximately 500 children, a significant number, are involved who will not receive sufficient educational attention in school.  The matter must be addressed and I will take it up with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Our record in education shows there are 19,000 adults working in education solely representing and looking after children, which has been a huge plus.  There are 10,000 special needs assistants &mdash; there were only 300 in 1997 &mdash; which is a fantastic achievement in ensuring we are getting the best quality education for our children.  There are 7,800 resource and learning support teachers, compared with 2,000 in 1998.  The Government has done very well in ensuring we have put resources in place.</P>
        <P>People will say, &ldquo;What did they do with the money?&rdquo;  There are significant resources.  There are 1,100 other teacher support staff for children in special schools.  There are hundreds more workers and special classes in the establishment since 2003.  In 2007 there were 15,000 teachers.  In 2008 &euro;5.5 million was spent to provide support for professional training.  It would be wrong to say we have not put significant resources into the teaching and welfare of our children.  In 2007 &euro;10 million extra was provided in the budget for children with special educational needs, which provided for a 33% increase in the Department&rsquo;s funding for psychological services.  Regarding the full implementation of education for persons with special educational needs, excellent services continue to be provided.</P>
        <P>The motion this evening raises a very important point.  We must try harder and get better value for the money we are putting into education and see if we are spending it correctly.  We need to ask if the organisations running the services for children are up to the job.  This is what we have to look at.  If the services are not up to the job, perhaps we should look at ways of delivering the service more efficiently and ensure they are more beneficial to the people we are trying to get them to.  I commend to the House the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is a very sad debate because we have heard so many sad stories.  Figures are interesting but they do not touch, to any extent, on the significant poverty there is out there.  We recognise that.  I have many figures I was going to talk about, but we have had so many figures already I would prefer not to do so.  I would like to talk about the opportunity for us, as individual citizens, to do something ourselves, rather than relying on the Government to do it.  There are things we can do ourselves and there is enough evidence that there is a major demand for it.  </P>
        <P>I remember when I first started in my business we had a small space given over to pet food and over the years the space for pet food on the supermarket shelves increased.  There is a significant number of people in our society who do not realise there are children who are very hungry and are in great need of a huge amount of help.  Yet, we concentrate, to a very large extent, on looking after our pets rather than our children.</P>
        <P>I would like to spend a couple of moments talking about what each of us can do individually.  I have had some experience of seeing the joy one can bring to somebody who is lonely.  There is a term I came up with many years ago called &ldquo;STAR&rdquo;.  We can give people a STAR.  It stands for four different words.  The first word is something we can give even if we have no money, the &ldquo;S&rdquo; of star, that is, &ldquo;smile&rdquo;.  We can give somebody who is poor, lonely and desolate a smile on the road when we meet them.  The effect that can have on children is amazing, particularly on those who feel lonely, bullied or left out of society.  The second letter is &ldquo;T&rdquo;  and it stands for &ldquo;time&rdquo;.  The effect of us being willing to give a little bit of time to somebody who needs help is amazing.  It could be a neighbour and or somebody whom we do not even notice because we do not pay attention to them.  The third letter is not that far removed and is the &ldquo;A&rdquo; of star, for which I use the term &ldquo;approachable&rdquo;.  We can make ourselves approachable.  It is really interesting to see, when one makes oneself approachable, how willing people <Col N="878"/>are to approach, people who would otherwise feel shy about doing so.  The last letter stands for &ldquo;recognition&rdquo;, being able to find and ask somebody &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;, and calling them by their name.</P>
        <P>These are little things but I am using them as examples because it seems that almost all of tonight&rsquo;s debate is saying what the Government should do or what it is not doing.  One may ask why the Government does not do more, but each of us can do a huge amount individually to help in this area.  I have some difficulty with those who say that we have gone a long way towards solving child poverty and therefore we should relax.  I know that no speakers here have said that and we recognise there is a lot to do, but there are things that we can do individually.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, I was asked to go on a partnership programme about jobs.  I went there with a lot of ideas but discovered that everybody else was saying &ldquo;We must call in F&Aacute;S, the Government and Forf&aacute;s to do it.&rdquo;  However, we can do things ourselves on an individual basis.  In the few minutes available I want to encourage us to remember that we can do something about child poverty.  Bringing a little bit of joy to somebody through our efforts can alleviate their suffering in some small way.  In addition, as Senator Norris said, we can support the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.</P>
        <P>For many years I was involved in the Christmas day dinner that used to take place in the Mansion House, but is now held in the Royal Dublin Society.  It was run by the Knights of St. Columbanus and as many as a thousand adults attended.  In the past 20 years, however, a large number of children have been going there.  They would not have had any Christmas dinner if it was not laid on by a charitable organisation.  There are things we can do, therefore, and we should do them.</P>
        <P>Just before Christmas, UNESCO published its report card on how children are faring in developed OECD countries.  Most of those countries met at least half the benchmarks.  One of them, Sweden, met all ten benchmarks, while France, Finland and Norway met eight.  A number of countries that are significantly poorer than Ireland, including Hungary, Slovenia and Portugal, met at least four.  Even Mexico, whose GDP <i>per capita</i> is just over a quarter of ours, managed to meet three of the benchmarks.  Ireland met precisely one, that of having 50% of staff in early childhood education with relevant third level qualifications.  As a result, Ireland is at the bottom of UNICEF&rsquo;s league for looking after our children.</P>
        <P>The Government is trying to do something and is defending itself, but I congratulate the Labour Party on tabling this motion, which gives us a chance to debate the matter.  I recognise the Government&rsquo;s commitment towards achieving progress.  The debate has been useful, but let us not ask the Government to do everything in this regard &mdash; let us do something ourselves also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Labour Party for putting this important issue on the agenda.  Investment in our children is an investment in the economy, as well as forming young people&rsquo;s social behaviour and removing them from the cycle of unemployment and crime.  As a result of such an investment, they will hopefully be able to fulfil their own needs and abilities.  </P>
        <P>As time is limited, I wish to hone in on a couple of points.  It has been stated that children from one-parent, low-income families are more inclined to fall into the poverty trap than others.  Fathers need to play a bigger role in their children&rsquo;s lives.  Under the Constitution, children who are not in a married family system do not count, which is a disgrace.  We are unfairly discriminating against such children so the relevant constitutional amendment should be put to the people.  If that referendum is passed, we will in future not have the stark statistics that were mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Someone will bring a test against the State on the basis that <Col N="879"/>they were not served correctly concerning abuse or did not receive help or whatever intervention is required for a child.  That is a quantum leap we need to take as a society, a Government and a people.</P>
        <P>We must accept that a child is not a commodity that can be thrown from Billy to Jack by parents who sometimes do not care about them.  Children in the poverty cycle are less likely to complete their education and more likely to be unemployed as adults.  I acknowledge that we have done a lot in this regard, including the stated goals in Towards 2016.  An unprecedented level of investment has been made but I am not here to reflect on past glories, I want to examine the improvements we can make in future.  If we are not willing to go forward there is not much point in us being here at all.</P>
        <P>We should examine how the courts can deal effectively with domestic violence, a problem that is not taken seriously at present.  While some fathers want to be responsible for their children, others do not and are unwilling to pay maintenance.  We are talking about increasing child income supports to 33% of the minimum adult&rsquo;s social welfare payment, but many children do not receive the benefit of such payments.  I have seen numerous examples where people put that money towards paying off a mortgage.  That may help them to keep a roof over their heads, but too often parents see the children&rsquo;s allowance as a payment for themselves and not for the child.  We need to look at other ways of intervening to ensure that children benefit from such payments.</P>
        <P>In my area, HSE employees who work in child support services are excellent and have the best intentions.  However, we need a separate agency to deal with child poverty and such an agency should have full funding under the aegis of a Minister.  We should appoint a senior Minister to deal with this area, thus avoiding departmental overlaps which currently mean that children fall between two stools.  As we reach our goal in Towards 2016, now is the time to prioritise investment in this matter.  We have had enough inquiries and reports about abuse of children.  There is a well established link between poverty and child abuse.  We know the answers to many of the questions so we need to move forward now and act.  Children who fall into the justice system or health board care will reoffend in future because they are trapped in a poverty cycle.  We have done a lot in the education sector but we need to examine other areas, including family law, to bring a holistic approach to bear in solving this problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very decent.  I welcome the Minister of State.  Wakey, wakey &mdash; t&aacute; s&eacute; tuirseach inni&uacute;.  I thank the Labour Party for bringing this welcome motion before the House.  The figure of 76,000 children living in poverty is a scary statistic.  We must examine how we can help those living in poverty and I want to focus on education in this regard.  Despite the fact that education is the proven route out of poverty, we still see swingeing cuts in that sector which largely hit children from poor backgrounds living in socio-economically disadvantaged environments.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy warned that appalling budget cuts, like those imposed on school book grants for the poorest children, were an indication the Government&rsquo;s thinking on education is badly skewed.  She warned such cuts would sadly result in a less literate and less capable emerging workforce and a reduced commitment to equality of opportunity.  If we continue in this vein, continue to cut out children with mild learning difficulties, so many of whom are in disadvantaged settings &mdash; as with today&rsquo;s announcement of the loss of 128 posts &mdash; the Government will become known as one of social exclusion that has further advanced the cycle of poverty.</P><Col N="880"/>
        <P>The same applies with regard to cutting out home-school liaison teachers in non-DEIS schools.  Many pupils in these schools are poor but their school does not qualify for disadvantaged status.  Our most vulnerable children, including those from poor, Traveller and immigrant families need access to books.  They need special support and small classes, whether they live in officially designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Labour Party on bringing this motion to the House.  I would like the Government&rsquo;s policies and practices to be poverty proofed.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said in the House, we will pay the price for these bad moves.  It is not fair to make the disadvantaged pay the price for the economic downturn, to which they in no way contributed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies McGuinness, Se&aacute;n Power, Devins and Noel Ahern who attended this debate.  At one stage I thought all the junior Ministers would attend.  As welcome as they all are, we had hoped the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, would be able to attend.  It is a pity he was not here, but we are glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, here.</P>
        <P>I also thank Senator Prendergast for seconding the motion and other Senators for contributing to the discussion, including Senators Corrigan, McFadden, Boyle, Bacik, Donohoe, Ormonde, Norris, Butler, Quinn, McDonald and Healy Eames.  Their contributions were all worthwhile.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast and I, and the Labour Party, tabled this motion because we want to highlight the ongoing scandal of the high level of child poverty in Ireland and, more importantly, the apparent indifference of the Government to the problem.  We accept measures and initiatives are being implemented in different Departments, but they lack an overall strategy and vision and the results speak for themselves.  As we pointed out, in 2007 the percentage of children living in poverty was higher than in 2001.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan made some interesting points with her amendment and mentioned some figures.  We could trade statistics all evening.  The Minister of State also trotted out figures pointing out how good the situation is.  Perhaps the situation is better than in the 1990s, but it is not yet a  record of which we should be proud.</P>
        <P>We had a long and interesting debate about consistent and relative poverty.  One thing that jumped out from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was the figure for consistent poverty.  In 2007, 20% of lone parent households were in consistent poverty.  Senator Norris raised the point about the lady who lost her husband before Christmas.  One in five lone parent families in consistent poverty is not a record of which we can be proud.  Even if we agree to leave the statistics aside, the reality is that tens of thousands of children are living in poverty and being denied basic support services.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden talked about the difficulties many children face in getting through to the ISPCC.  Senators Bacik and Healy Eames mentioned the impact on children of the latest education cuts.  Senator Donohoe mentioned some harrowing tales of young people in his constituency and the lack of facilities.  He suggested some worthwhile improvements.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State does not believe us about the situation, he should talk to organisations involved in the End Child Poverty coalition.  They deal with these issues on a daily basis.  Voluntary organisations are filling the gaps left by the Government&rsquo;s inaction.  Senator Quinn mentioned organising Christmas dinners in the past.  I remember reading Christina Noble&rsquo;s autobiography and about her experience organising Christmas dinners in Vietnam.  We need to help organisations like the Christina Noble Foundation, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the ISPCC in their work.</P><Col N="881"/>
        <P>Senator Boyle will know well from a previous existence the complexity of the issues.  He mentioned this, as did Senator Ormonde who has tremendous experience in the area of disadvantage and education.  We are lucky to have these people in the House.  We too recognise the complexity of the issue of child poverty.  However, it is an issue we hope Senators Boyle and Ormonde will take to Government and champion.  Senators McDonald and Butler indicated they would be willing to do that and I would appreciate their doing so.</P>
        <P>The End Child Poverty coalition set out a clear, consistent strategy and agenda for the reduction and ultimate elimination of child poverty.  I urge the Government to engage directly with the coalition and discuss its proposals with the proposals presented here tonight and come up with a plan of action.</P>
        <P>I thank all the Ministers of State and Senators who attended this debate for their valuable and worthwhile contributions.  It should be the role of the Government to create an environment where children can grow up free of poverty and achieve their full potential.  We will all &mdash; children, society and everyone here &mdash; be losers if we condemn thousands of children to poverty.  As a nation, we should aspire to be the best.  Therefore, we should work to eliminate child poverty and to make Ireland the best place in the world for children to grow up in.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s geriatric hospital is much loved by the people of Waterford.  The standard of care and attention given to its patients is second to none.  The Friends of St. Patrick&rsquo;s, a group of voluntary workers, has raised funds over the years to provide additional comforts to the patients and to fund structural and other works which should have been provided by the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the past year, more than &euro;150,000 has been spent on St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward which has 19 patients who are all high maintenance and high dependence.  Much of this was provided by the Friends of St. Patrick&rsquo;s.  It came as a complete bombshell to staff, patients and their relations and the people of Waterford when it was announced that St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward was to close as part of the HSE service plan for the HSE south region.  Health and safety concerns were cited as the reason for the closure.  However, no report or evidence has been provided to support this assertion.</P>
        <P>Mr. Pat Healy of the HSE south stated a new 50 bed unit hospital will replace St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward within 18 months.  However, no site has been finalised and no planning is in place.  He stated categorically to Oireachtas Members present, namely, Senator Coffey, myself and Deputy O&rsquo;Shea, that the future of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital was safe.  Only days later on KCLR local radio his boss, Professor Drumm, described the hospital as a workhouse and stated that <Col N="882"/>the sooner it was closed the better and that plans were in place to replace the hospital with a 50 bed unit.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm&rsquo;s comments were an insult to all associated with this wonderful hospital, especially the staff who are rightly and deeply offended by his comments.  The comments were strange coming from a man in the company of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who only two years ago praised the condition of the hospital, the staff and the care and attention given to patients.  It is no wonder the people are critical of the HSE and the Government when we see such U-turns and, may I suggest, stupidity.</P>
        <P>The bottom line in this regard is that no section of this hospital should close until the 50 bed unit is in place.  This is the situation as the people in Waterford see it.  They will go on the streets to prevent this ward closure.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The people of Waterford and south Kilkenny in particular, which is where many of the patients are from, are absolutely disgusted with what has been suggested in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for providing me with speaking time.  As he stated, many of the patients in St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward are from south County Kilkenny where I am from myself.  The patients and their families are very upset at the prospect of the closure of the ward.  I raised a matter on the Adjournment ten days ago on the closure of a nursing facility in Carlow, namely, Bethany House.  The two situations seem to be remarkably similar.  In fact, they are almost identical.</P>
        <P>The HSE is discussing closing St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward before new beds have been provided.  This is unacceptable.  To be badgering, hounding and harassing elderly people in the twilight years of their lives in such a fashion is disgraceful to be perfectly honest.  The HSE has become a monster.  It does not seem to be answerable to public representatives or to any democratic influence.  Sooner rather than later we, as an Oireachtas, will have to do something to take the situation in hand.  The proposed closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital and Bethany House, which are in my area, are two instances where people will take the situation into their own hands.  We cannot have this type of dictatorship over very vulnerable people.</P>
        <P>The people of Ireland have a very particular attachment to the place they call home.  Let us be honest, St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Waterford is home to the people who reside there.  It is not good enough for the HSE to suggest it will close it down and state that within 18 months it will build a new 50 bed facility.  This is completely unacceptable.  I call on the Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children to intervene and ensure this ward is not closed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I received many phone calls from constituents about the comments Professor Drumm made on my local radio station calling this institution a workhouse.  It is a fantastic facility that many people in Waterford and south Kilkenny have used over the years and where their loved ones have been looked after fantastically well in the final years of their lives.  For them to be so abused by the man who is supposedly the head of the HSE is an absolutely shock.  I hope that in his comments the Minister of State will have good news on this issue for us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank the Senators for raising this issue.  It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter and to outline the background to the current situation and the action taken by the Health Service Executive.  I also want to reassure the older people concerned, and their families, about the future.</P><Col N="883"/>
        <P>As Senators are aware, Government policy on older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate and we continue to develop and improve health services in all regions of the country and to ensure quality and patient safety.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at facilities such as St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford.  The executive is working on an action plan to prioritise a phased programme of refurbishment and replacement of existing public nursing homes, where necessary, to meet the proposed new national standards for residential care facilities for older people.  The House will appreciate that ongoing reviews are essential to ensure resources are properly channelled, and that the changing needs of older people are suitably addressed.</P>
        <P>St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward is the last remaining ward on an upper floor of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital.  Concerns have been expressed about the ward with regard to health and safety and fire issues.  The difficulty of evacuating high dependency patients from St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward in the event of an emergency has been highlighted by the fire safety officer.  With this in mind, the Health Service Executive has decided it is no longer viable to continue to accommodate patients in St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward.</P>
        <P>Patients currently accommodated in the ward will not be moved out of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital.  They will continue to receive their ongoing care within the complex.  As vacancies arise on the ground floor, in consultation with patients themselves and their families, patients will be relocated from St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward to other wards within the hospital.  St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward will no longer accept admissions.  The HSE has confirmed it is taking steps to ensure the closure of this ward will not result in a reduction in the number of beds available in Waterford city.</P>
        <P>The safety of the residents is our first concern.  We owe them a duty of care.  Most importantly, we must consider what is in their best interests.  Each hospital, local health office, managers, clinicians and others working in the health services have a responsibility to ensure they strive to provide the best possible service to patients and other clients of our health services.  I am sure the House will agree that the safety and well-being of older people is of critical concern.  Quality care and patient safety comes first and all patients should receive the same high standard of quality-assured care.  It is a matter for the HSE to deliver services both nationally and locally within its budget and overall health policy priorities in line with the overall resources available to it.</P>
        <P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital will remain at the centre of public residential care for older people in Waterford city.  The executive has a proposal for a new 50 bed community nursing unit on the grounds of the hospital.  It is proposed that the planned 50 bed nursing unit will provide therapy, rehabilitation and medical care to older people who no longer need acute hospital care or who can no longer be maintained in their own homes.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that the management of resources and service planning is now a matter for the HSE in the first instance.  However, the House will understand that any new capital development, such as the proposed community nursing unit at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, will need to be considered in the context of the overall HSE capital plan for 2009 and beyond.  Patient safety is everyone&rsquo;s concern.  I reassure the House that the decision to close St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward was taken with the primary focus on the care and welfare of each patient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, he is only delivering the speech on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harney.  Much of the speech is typical HSE gobbledegook.  The health representatives are even contradicting themselves.  Pat <Col N="884"/>Healy is saying one thing while Professor Drumm or the Minister is saying another.  It is no wonder that the health system is as it is when two or three versions of events are being circulated.</P>
        <P>There is no question that beds will be lost in Waterford.  They are high-dependency beds for elderly people who need attention and care.  Some of the patients in St. Patrick&rsquo;s will now be turfed into nursing homes where they will not receive the same care and attention.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the reply; it is just not good enough that such rubbish is being spoken in the House.  I am not in any way casting aspersions on the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, but I am angry over the closure of the ward.  Many people in Waterford are very angry because their parents and relations were treated so well in the hospital.  To have this type of tripe being put to us at this stage is not good enough.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to the Bodies exhibition currently taking place in Dublin of which, no doubt, the Minister of State is aware.  I want the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to outline the rules, regulations and guidelines in place governing exhibitions that take place in Ireland, indicate whether such rules have been breached by the Bodies exhibition, indicate whether such an exhibition involving the display of human bodies requires permission to be granted and, in the absence of such requirements, whether the Government intends to establish requirements to govern such exhibitions.  I do not know whether every aspect of the matter I raise is capable of being addressed by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>The question of which authority, if any, approved the exhibition in Ireland is key and needs to be considered in the following comparative context.  Dr. Roy Glover, the medical director of the exhibition and associate professor emeritus of anatomy at the University of Michigan, claims it is common practice that unclaimed corpses are donated for education and research.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the Bodies exhibition features corpses of humans of Chinese origin.  The Irish position is very stringent in this regard and unclaimed corpses in Ireland do not end up in medical schools.  Only those who express interest in donating their bodies to science and who give explicit consent may be accepted for research purposes to anatomy departments.  This was verified for me recently by the anatomy department of Trinity College.</P>
        <P>In light of our context of respect for the human body and our standards, which obviously differ from those Dr. Glover would espouse, who examined on our behalf the origin of the bodies being used?  Who examined the manner in which they were to be displayed in what is a commercial exhibition?  Who approved this process?  What was done to establish the provenance of the persons involved and what assurances, if any, were sought in regard to the propriety of their being obtained in the first place?</P>
        <P>The exhibition is run by an Atlanta-based company called Premier Exhibitions and it was opened originally in Tampa, Florida, in 2005.  The website of the exhibition states the bodies are &ldquo;persons who lived in China and died from natural causes&rdquo;.  It states these bodies were unclaimed after death and, under Chinese law, were then delivered to a medical school for education purposes.  In this case, it was the Dalian Medical University of Plastination Laboratories in the Republic of China.  The website claims the persons on display died of natural causes, yet in May of last year, on foot of an investigation initiated by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, the organisers admitted they could not prove the bodies were not those of tortured prisoners, stating:</P><Col N="885"/>
        <P LI="1">There is no written record that any of those persons consented to the plastination and exhibition of their bodies prior to their deaths.  Rather, these bodies were unclaimed at death, collected by the Chinese Bureau of Police, and delivered to the Dalian Medical University.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Irish Museum Association confirms it does not have any relevant material concerning this exhibition on its website or in its biannual newsletter.  It confirmed also that it had not been notified by the exhibitors.  We should not ignore the fact that the commercial nature of this exhibition is evident through its promotion of the purchasing of merchandise and catalogues related to the exhibition.  The exhibitors have a hell of an advertising budget, judging by the posters advertising the event all over the place.</P>
        <P>If there are no guidelines governing an anatomical exhibition of this kind, the matter needs to be addressed urgently.  This display of persons unknown is being presented in a very commercial manner with a distinct entertainment edge.  This has the potential to devalue and disrespect the human body, especially if it cannot be established that the exhibited bodies did not come to be dead by foul means.</P>
        <P>Bodies involved in dissection research in Ireland are used for educational purposes for a given period and are buried about two years after donation.  However, there appears to be no time limit to the display of the bodies in question and the continuation of this exhibition.</P>
        <P>Our museums have displayed the remains of deceased persons and sometimes murdered persons.  They date from a long time ago and nobody can establish the exact means of death.  The concern regarding the Bodies exhibition is that the bodies could be of recent provenance.  It is clear from what we know that those who obtained them did not adhere to the stringent standards that apply in Ireland regarding the use of bodies of deceased persons for any kind of event, be it educational or related to entertainment.  What has the Government done to establish the provenance of the bodies and whether any issue of propriety arose?  Is there relevant legislation to guide us in this area?  If not, does the Government intend to introduce appropriate legislation so such an exhibition cannot take place in the future without being vetted properly in advance by an appropriate authority?</P>

	<P>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen.  I have listened to the Senator with great interest and must apologise in advance because I have a very brief reply to his many questions.</P>
        <P>All exhibitions are subject to the regulations on the licensing of indoor events, which process is under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Licences must be sought from the local fire authority and are subject to safety and security considerations, such as considerations concerning the number in attendance and their supervision.</P>
        <P>The national cultural institutions come under the aegis of the Department and the board of each institution has responsibility for decisions concerning the display of artworks and artefacts.  The boards have a more hands-on role than the Minister and are in a position to make decisions regarding each individual exhibition.  The National Museum of Ireland has a specific policy on human remains and this informed its display of human remains in its current &ldquo;Kingship and Sacrifice&rdquo; exhibition of the Iron Age bog bodies and related finds.</P>
        <P>Exhibitions, particularly art exhibitions, often provoke debate and this has been the case over many centuries.  Legislation governing exhibitions could be viewed as a form of censorship.  It would involve setting out in advance, at a particular point in time, statutorily binding rules on exhibitions which could well be found to be inappropriate and not stand the test of time.  It is difficult to foresee in advance and legislate for future forms of exhibitions.  The Minister has no plans to introduce legislation governing exhibitions.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for, as he predicted, his brief response.  I do not hold it against him that the response is so brief and unsatisfactory but I would be grateful if he would take this message back to the Minister.  That is a philistine response.  It shows absolutely no imagination and it shows even less respect for the process of raising matters on the Adjournment.  The Department insults our intelligence by getting into a whole lot of waffle that is entirely irrelevant in its references to national cultural institutions given that this exhibition is not taking place in a national cultural institution.  It then goes on to give the utterly spurious argument that, &ldquo;Legislation governing exhibitions could be viewed as a form of censorship&rdquo;.  It is a spurious argument based on a spurious comparison between this exhibition of human remains and other art exhibitions, which might raise issues of taste.</P>

    <Title>School Accommodation. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Kildallon national school is 108 years old.  The building has walls 12 ft. high.  The rooms are very cold and the building is not insulated.  It has been heated by storage heaters for most of this awful winter.  The ceilings are so high that it is impossible to heat the building.  The windows are wooden and single glazed.  The classroom is an old, long and narrow room that contains 25 children across four different classes.</P>
        <P>The secretary works in cramped conditions in that building.  She has given me permission to make the following point and she was anxious that it would be made.  She suffers from cystic fibrosis and the awful conditions in which she works have an even worse effect on her.</P>
        <P>In addition to the permanent classroom the school has a prefab, which celebrated its 19th birthday last year and is approaching its 20th birthday.  The prefab is in a very run-down and damp state.  The exit door is held together by paint.  It is hard to imagine that is the case but it is true.  It is impossible to drive a nail through it.  Some of the windows close and others do not open.  The timber in the prefab is rotten.  Infants and first class numbering 22 children occupy the prefab.  I observed all of that personally, in addition to meeting the teaching and support staff.</P>
        <P>The school would have had the numbers for three teachers this year but with the new arrangements it was not in a position to avail of a third teacher.  It will get three teachers in September 2009.  I pray the Minister will inform me the situation will be altered by then but assuming the situation does not alter, in a doomsday scenario the prefab will have disintegrated around the pupils and they will have climbed out, which means there would be a need for two classrooms in the school.</P>
        <P>The school is currently applying to the Department for funding under the emergency works scheme of &euro;42,000.  It has obviously been to the banks at various stages through the years and <Col N="887"/>this is the current application which it hopes will succeed.  Even if the &euro;42,000 is approved and spent there will ultimately be a need for two new classrooms.</P>
        <P>The teaching and support staff are excellent, led by Ms Teresa McCaffrey, principal.  She is exceptionally good and the school is exceptionally good.  The parents have a great pride and interest in the school and there is a great whole school community in place.  It is clearly unacceptable for the children to be in those conditions but the working conditions for the teachers and support staff are Dickensian.  That is no exaggeration.  The situation is really bad and cannot be sustained.  I appeal to the Minister to act on this matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, and I were colleagues in the Seanad previously and he knows I would not exaggerate but if the Minister does for a moment think I exaggerate I invite him to visit the school.  He would come back from it astounded.</P>
        <P>This last global point hardly needs making, but surely with present contract prices and VAT returns saving people from being on the dole there is a merit in putting construction people to work on this job purely in the national interest.  This school is suffering hugely and I appeal to the Minister to take action.  I look forward with interest to his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science thanks the Senator for raising this matter as it gives him an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position regarding the application from Kildallon national school for funding under the summer works scheme to carry out work to the school building.  The school applied for funding in September 2007 under the then proposed 2008 scheme to replace windows and doors and the central heating system, to provide insulation and to upgrade the electrical installation.</P>
        <P>In 2003 to 2004, the Department moved towards a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority for building projects directly to school management authorities.  The intention was to improve the quality of the school building infrastructure in a structured and prioritised manner, to improve efficiency in the use of resources and to achieve value for money.  The summer works scheme introduced in 2004 was one such solution.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the summer works scheme was to ensure precise targeting of funding for smaller scale works by using a time-bound process, from application to implementation, which would be open to all recognised schools.  The works would be carried out in the summer months to prevent disruption to schools.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the scheme, school authorities are empowered to manage those works with guidance from, and minimal interaction with, the Department.  The scheme has enabled the Department and school authorities to address deficiencies arising from the historic wider investment in school infrastructure over the years.  This is particularly the case in regard to upgrading of gas, mechanics and electrics and addressing structural defects.  Projects to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils are also a feature of the scheme.  Since its inception, the scheme has been refined annually to incorporate feedback both from school authorities and from staff administering the scheme.  It has also been amended, where necessary, to reflect any changes in public procurement procedures and health and safety regulations.</P>
        <P>Under the summer works scheme more than 3,000 projects, costing in excess of &euro;300 million, have been completed since 2003 to 2004.  With so many smaller projects having been completed in recent years, the particular emphasis in 2008 was on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Accordingly, the Department focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made <Col N="888"/>available for a summer works scheme last year.  This concentration on major projects enabled the Department to complete 48 new primary schools in 2008.  This is an unprecedented number of new school buildings in any one year and includes 27 schools delivered under the fast-track off-site construction programme in rapidly developing areas.  In addition, a total of 29 major extension-refurbishment projects at primary level were completed.  The programme also resulted in the completion of three new post-primary schools and 15 major extension and refurbishment projects in existing post-primary schools in 2008.</P>
        <P>However, the Department recognises the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of schools and the intention is to have a scheme this year.  The details of the operation of the scheme and the funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are being considered and the Minister will make an announcement on the matter shortly.  The professional and technical reports provided by schools for 2008, including Kildallon national school, can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</P>
        <P>The Minister wishes to thank the Senator again for giving him the opportunity to outline the current position to the Seanad and to assure the Senator that the application from Kildallon school will be fully considered in the context of the 2009 programme.  The Senator also mentioned an application under the emergency works scheme.  I do not have an update but I will look into that before reverting to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and for his latter remark that he will examine the application made under the emergency works scheme.  A total of 25 children are in the four classes in the old building and 22 junior and senior infants are in the prefab.  The position is desperate.  The principal and staff are not professional agitators and they made the application under the emergency works scheme to increase their chances of securing funding.  I am not bothered whether the funding is delivered under the summer works scheme or the emergency scheme because we will be happy once it is delivered.  I look forward to the Minister of State reverting to me on the application under the emergency works scheme.</P>
