      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, Orla Tinsley, who has fought so hard for services for cystic fibrosis, was asked if she believed and trusted the latest proposal from Government to provide a cystic fibrosis unit.  She said &ldquo;We have had promises made before, I am not sure that I can &mdash; but I hope that I can.&rdquo;  She and cystic fibrosis sufferers have had many promises made to them that have not been fulfilled.  The Minister has now suggested a scheme whereby some builder will lend money to fund that unit and be paid back by the Health Service Executive.  That sounds vague and unreliable.  It does not sound as if it will produce the unit that is needed.</P>
        <P>People watching the budget today will be a little like Orla, they will be asking whether we can trust a Government that has let us down so often in recent years.  Can we trust a Government that has wasted so much of our money?  What is the Government going to do today?  There is a lot of fear, anger and upset in people for themselves, their families and their future, especially among the tens of thousands of people who have lost their job in recent weeks and months with hundreds more losing them every day.  Today, we in Fine Gael will be looking at the budget to see whether it will protect and hold the jobs we have, create jobs and deal with the competitiveness issues that are essential if we are to keep our jobs.  We will also be looking for fairness.  We will further be saying that the Taoiseach is codding the public if he thinks he can tax his way back to recovery.  We will be looking for reform and savings.  We want serious reform so the country will be competitive again and people can plan for their families and themselves with some hope for the future.  We will have further debate on the budget tomorrow but, as I stated, we will be watching very carefully.  We will be supportive where the budget deserves support but we will certainly be critical where it fails to meet criteria we have set, published and made very clear in recent weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much agree with Senator Fitzgerald and applaud her judicious approach in stating this side of the House, including both the Opposition and Independents, will support the Government on necessary measures that are prudent and in the interest of the people.</P>
        <P>Everybody&rsquo;s attention is focused on the economy.  It did not give me any pleasure to hear an international correspondent on the radio this morning describe Ireland as one of the most troubled economies in Europe.  However, it is a fact and we must find our way out.  It is not just a question of economics and of impressing our European allies or those discredited agencies such Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, or of rescuing our own blackguardly banks.  There must be a commitment to fairness.  The Government has, above all else, a duty of care to its citizens and to provide and underpin health, welfare and safety.  It has not done so satisfactorily to date.  The abolition of agencies such the Equality Authority, and the Combat Poverty Agency in particular, was disastrous as we sail into this financial maelstrom.</P>
        <P>Fairness is what we will be looking for in this budget, in addition to the protection of ordinary citizens.  Senator Fitzgerald mentioned cystic fibrosis.  I listened to the developments in this regard and am delighted.  Ms Orla Tinsley, that courageous, wonderful young woman, said she was glad of the progress made but it is still pie in the sky.  We want that pie landed for the people with cystic fibrosis.  I find it difficult to believe at this critical time the talk of builders being in a position to build now and get paid later.  Will the Leader ensure the Minister for Health and Children comes to the House to give us solid, cast-iron guarantees that can be cashed at the end of the day to ensure this gets done?</P>
        <P>Social welfare is an important element.  I sometimes wonder whether this House is listened to because it is three to five months since I raised the question of people who are not citizens of this country collecting social welfare.  I asked the Minister whether such people were asked to provide identification.  I was told people were having their welfare collected and sent back <Col N="955"/>to eastern Europe for them.  That is a scandal in these times when everybody who is deservedly on social welfare needs to be protected from cuts.</P>
        <P>I was horrified when I heard this morning of the cuts of &euro;30 million that are to affect Dublin City Council.  Reference is being made to cutbacks that are to affect the fire brigade and overtime payments.  Fires do not occur within office hours and we must ensure therefore the cutbacks do not expose people to danger.</P>
        <P>With regard to road repairs, every aspect of transport must be examined in terms of infrastructure, even my own beloved metro.  I believe the metro will withstand the test and I am glad the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is holding out in this regard.  On the question of cutting back on road repairs, has any Member of the House recently been on the campshires along Dublin&rsquo;s north quays?  There is a catastrophic hole outside the main conference centre that would be break one&rsquo;s axle.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Order of Business on the last day we were sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had my three minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;three minutes are allowed for main speakers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for drawing my attention to that and I am happy to sit down.  I look forward to the budget debate and I ask the Leader to ensure the Minister will be invited to the House to answer my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed by the moratorium on recruitment in the Health Service Executive which was announced last week.  It was decided without any consultation with the HSE or any of the unions and represents a fundamental breach of faith in terms of industrial relations and governance.  A directive from the Department of Finance to the Department of Health and Children stated that, for the next 18 months, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will decide who is to be recruited to our health service and who is to be made redundant.  That is extraordinarily arrogant.  How can the Minister can make such decisions given he has difficulty running his own Department?</P>
        <P>The decision to target fixed-term workers is overt discrimination against a category of employee.  The Minister should have read the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act.  His decision to implement this embargo without consultation is a blatant affront to social partnership and he should have read the industrial relations Acts.  He thinks he might save money through these measures but he is wasting money because an understaffed service is an underperforming service.</P>
        <P>One quarter of all departments and wards in Beaumont Hospital will have to close by the end of this year because of the embargo on recruitment.  A total of 10% of its staff, 400 people, will lose their jobs and 90% of these are nurses, who are front-line staff.  Yesterday morning, 140 people had their discharge from Beaumont Hospital delayed and last Friday, in the entire acute sector in all hospitals throughout the country, there were 880 delayed discharges.  This means people fit for discharge could not be discharged and that places a huge additional burden in cost terms on the health services.  In Drogheda there are 550 nurses, 180 of whom are on fixed-term contracts.  These contracts will not be renewed.  That means approximately one third of the staff at that hospital will be cast aside.  The Department of Finance has stated that the loss of each 1,000 jobs costs the State &euro;25 million through increased social welfare payments.  That means &euro;500 million in social welfare payments will have to be made up.</P>
<Col N="956"/>
        <P>It is bitterly ironic that this directive was issued days before the Mental Health Commission reported that patients in south Tipperary did not receive the required treatment because of understaffing and underfunding.  It is all the more ironic that sanction, which has been given to increase staff numbers in St. Luke&rsquo;s and St. Michael&rsquo;s, was not carried through.  On that subject I wish to make a declaration of interest.  I know many people who work at these facilities, one of whom is my husband.  I called on the Minister for Health and Children to issue an apology to the patients and staff working in the hospital because they are encased in a Victorian asylum.</P>
        <P>As far back as 2004, the authorities knew that serious issues surrounded these facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I am getting to the point.  A commitment was made to allocate money, but that was not spent.  The Mental Health Commission found no misconduct among the staff of St. Luke&rsquo;s and St. Michael&rsquo;s hospitals.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, stated that the deficiencies in mental health services in south Tipperary will be addressed &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;.  Professor Brendan Drumm stated that a significant bank of land in the ownership of the HSE in south Tipperary would be used for mental health services and to implement the vision for change document in Clonmel in south Tipperary.  I would like that commitment to be honoured.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments on the budget, it would be advisable to await the details of the budget before commenting.  Clear signals have been given that the budget will be very fair and I agree it is important it is fair and is seen to be so.  I do not know about anybody else, but I have been encouraged by the number of Cabinet meetings that have taken place.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will lay a foundation on which the economy can recover.  We live in unprecedented times and the challenges are extraordinary.  We have a daily diet of negativity and doom and gloom which, in its own way, exacerbates the situation with regard to consumer and investor confidence.  Without those recovering to some degree we will see a continuing decrease in the economic fortunes of the country.  I welcome the fact that Fine Gael in particular of the Opposition parties has become much more constructive during the past month.  While I do not agree with everything it brings forward, some of the detail is worthy of serious consideration and I am sure some of it will be reflected in the budget.  Rather than try to appeal to the populace at large by making popular statements, it is up to all of us in the House, including the other Opposition parties, to be constructive in addressing what is the biggest challenge this country has faced since its foundation.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="957"/>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The nation is indeed holding its breath to hear what is in the budget.  I am glad there was a number of Cabinet meetings about it.  Meanwhile, the banking problem has not gone away, it is still a monster.  We learn today that there is &euro;56 billion of toxic debt in the Irish banking system.  We are not sure what the Minister is planning for it, perhaps some kind of asset management model, but that is not enough to ensure confidence.  The general view of the public is that the banks will revert to their bad ways unless they are properly held in check.  There is evidence of young people in my constituency getting phone calls from banks offering them up to &euro;20,000 in personal loans, yet the banks will not lend to businesses in need of credit.  What is going on?  What type of behaviour is that by our banks?</P>
        <P>It is time we had a banking big brother, by which I mean it is time we called for a European bank regulatory model to regulate our banks.  We must have objectivity and independence.  We are far too small and too cosy.  The banks have cost us our international reputation.  As Senator Norris said, we are now considered as one of the most troubled economies in Europe.  The banking crisis has shown the need for us to have a very serious regulatory model.  I call on the Leader to discuss this with the Minister for Finance and ask him to pursue a European regulatory model that would guarantee our independence.  I also call on the European candidates to pursue this model.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the news on cystic fibrosis and the innovative way the Government is proceeding by providing that beds will be available and payment will be made in 2011.  I was contacted by a number of families over the weekend on this issue and I am glad the Minister will proceed on it.  It would have been a travesty for her not to proceed with it because it is regrettable that the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis in Ireland is much shorter than in other European countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ten years less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of this unit will go a long way towards giving people who have cystic fibrosis a chance of a better quality of life and a longer life.  The next step in this process is the provision of an improved organ donation system so that those patients can receive organs and can fulfil their great potential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Fairness is certainly the word of the day.  Our hope today is that the provisions of the budget will be fair and that the cuts and the increases in tax are made in such a way that those who can most afford it will pay.  T&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfaimid cinnte nach iad si&uacute;d is laige in &aacute;r socha&iacute; a bheidh th&iacute;os leis an ch&aacute;infaisn&eacute;is inniu.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Daly said about cystic fibrosis and I am also glad of that development.  It is a pity that people such as Orla Tinsely must go out and campaign to the extent that they do to get the priority they deserved all along.</P>
        <P>I am glad, a Chaithaoirligh, that you have introduced a stop-watch principle.  I am concerned that one Oireachtas committee seems to be in favour of getting rid of the stop-watch principle in the context of referendum coverage.  The cure they propose could be much worse than the disease.  I remember, during the divorce referendum, how scandalous was the one-sided coverage in the media.  Some 50% of the country voted one way and barely had political representation in the Oireachtas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Sincere democrats wish to have issues fully debated.  Sometimes there will be a referendum in which 99% are on the one side and it may seem odd that equal time should be given to the other, but the reason is that we are letting the people decide.  Sincere democrats should not lose sight of this principle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity we will have to debate the forthcoming budget.  I am particularly conscious of the reality that the Cabinet has spent hours, days and weeks in an attempt to ensure fairness.  At a time when the world markets appear to be making a resurgence, when the price of oil and money are low and when vast sums are being spent ensuring that economies are recapitalised, it would be good for the House to ensure that a positive note goes out at every opportunity, because there is a good deal more hope and opportunity than negative sentiment.  This is the ideal time to present the start of the resurgence of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I refer to the point made by Senator Mullen and he is correct.  It is very important that despite the views of the vast majority, even, for example, on a revised Lisbon treaty with all the amendments and guarantees that would ensure it is passed, there should be equal time for those who do not agree.  That opportunity proves that no matter what guarantees are given, they will not be satisfied no matter what they get.  I believe in equal opportunity despite what the other person has to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments on this side of the House in respect of the budget and the banking system.  The country has frequently faced its greatest challenges at Easter.  We think of Easter 1916 and the achievements of the Good Friday agreement.  What has marked the country out well at such times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been occasions at Easter time when our country has shown its best side.  Frequently at such times, we have dealt successfully with the events of  the day, but also put in place a map to deal with future challenges. </P>
        <P>What must be tackled in our economic system is the point touched on by Senator Healy Eames, that is, what is occurring with the magnitude and extent of bad debt in our banking system.  While our movement into recession was very sharp, our exit from recession could be very prolonged and take a good deal of time to achieve, unless we tackle this issue.  Banks will not be willing to lend and consumers will not be willing to spend.  I hope in today&rsquo;s deliberations and the statements from the Minister for Finance that he finds time to address this point, because whatever achievements are made on the taxation and spending side of the balance sheet, we will not get the credit we need from them unless we deal with the same issues in our banking system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to financing of local authorities.  I suggest to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I propose to the Leader that there should be a discussion following the budget on what I term, &ldquo;the sale of the century&rdquo;, that is, the sale of all local authority houses to their tenants.  It would be a very quick move to raise funds.  In turn, these funds could be used to buy up the thousands of vacant houses at very reasonable prices throughout the countryside, which could house those on the waiting list.  It would be a transfer of funds from those who have houses to those who have not.  Now is the time to take such radical steps and it can be done.  Some three-bed, semi-detached houses in a lovely and fully serviced location in Tulsk, County Roscommon, are being sold for &euro;100,000.</P>
        <P>After Easter, will the Leader arrange for a discussion on the structure of the HSE <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the management of welfare homes, where an average of &euro;100,000 per case has built up in clients&rsquo; funds?  The money should be used to assist the HSE in providing better equipment for patients to make their lives comfortable.  There should not be a massive fund with no facilities.</P>
        <P>Another anomaly arises whereby a patient who is transferred from a long-stay welfare home to a hospital will have the two or three days spent in the hospital deducted from his or her allowance, which must then be refunded to him or her.  It would be a useful exercise for the House to put all of its consideration into this matter to determine how to improve the lot of those in welfare homes and the conditions therein and how to use the patients&rsquo; funds in their best interests, as opposed to in the interests of relations who might receive the money in a will.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was startled by the report that a scientist had drawn attention to the possibility of the earthquake occurring due to radon.  I do not know enough about the subject, but the House held an interesting debate on radon last year.  This is a reminder that one of the benefits of the House, which is sometimes criticised, is the possibility of raising a matter for discussion that would not otherwise be debated.</P>
        <P>If it is true that the scientist was told not to cause panic or scares and to keep quiet about his or her concerns, it is horrific.  The situation is a reminder of our benefits in the House and of democracy in this State, as we can raise issues of concern that might not sound urgent at the time.</P>
        <P>I will add a point to Senator Daly&rsquo;s comments on cystic fibrosis.  The relevant figures are high in the Republic of Ireland, which I queried last year when the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland visited the Oireachtas.  I understand that those who survived the Famine of the 1840s had genes that made them more susceptible to cystic fibrosis.  It did not occur to the same extent in the North.  This is the reason for the South having a much higher rate of cystic fibrosis than anywhere else in Europe, including Northern Ireland.  I mention this matter because it places cystic fibrosis at a high level of importance in this country that might not necessarily apply in other countries.</P>

        <P>Will the Leader clarify what rules apply in respect of the elderly who require long-stay accommodation?  Will he also indicate the position regarding the fair deal scheme and when it is likely to be tabled before the House?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all accept that today&rsquo;s budget must be comprehensive and credible, which implies fairness.  I am glad to note the Government&rsquo;s signal that it will finally take the so-called bad bank route.  However, a timetable in that regard is important.  I understand that only an outline will be announced today, without details, to the effect that the Government intends to set up a State asset management company under the auspices of the National Treasury Management Agency.  I hate to hear the phrase, &ldquo;toxic debt&rdquo; because while everyone accepts we have problematic property loans, unfortunately amounting to billions, in some of our major banks, thankfully we never went down the sub-prime route that has caused so much distress in the United States.  Moreover, unlike a number of European banks, Irish banks never bought into that useless paper.  I understand they did not become involved in that spread.</P>
        <P>On foot of the delays experienced initially with the guarantee scheme and then with recapitalisation, which is in place for one major bank and hopefully it will be in place in respect of the other, we must speed up the bad bank or State asset management agency concept.  There will be no stability within the banking system until that is in place, which will mean the requisite confidence in the economy will be lacking and without such indefinable confidence, we will not get the lift-off we seek.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago, a debate was held in this House on the Irish Constitution on the occasion of its 75th anniversary.  It is worth noting the contributions people have made to that Constitution in the development of personal rights, which has given us a charter that is second to none in the world.  I make this point because judges such as the former Supreme Court judge, S&eacute;amus Henchy, at critical times when politicians and the political system failed, delivered critical judgments such as in the McGee case regarding the right to bodily integrity and the right of married women to contraceptives.  Mr. Justice Henchy also delivered a minority judgment in the Norris case on the criminalisation of homosexual acts.  I also note his decision in respect of the Single European Act case, which required referenda because of a doubt as to the compatibility of that treaty with the Irish Constitution.  Mr. Justice Henchy, who was a resident of Monkstown, passed away on Sunday and his funeral will take place tomorrow.  His contribution to the Constitution we have today, a modern Constitution for a modern Ireland, was of great significance and I acknowledge it.</P>
        <P>Successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, including the present Government, have been elected on give-away budgets that have been unsustainable in the long term.  It hope it does not expect to be congratulated when it claws it all back in the budget today and in succeeding budgets.  It is very important to place responsibility on, and to acknowledge, those responsible for the difficulties we face.  I note it is reported in today&rsquo;s newspapers that the Government intends to reduce the number of Ministers of State, even though it voted against a Fine Gael motion in that regard some weeks ago.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader of the House to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, to the House for a comprehensive <Col N="961"/>debate on unemployment.  The Leader is working very hard to maintain the relevance of this House and its responsiveness to important daily issues and no issue is more important in this regard than that 327,000 fellow citizens have no work to which to go today.  I suggest we have a full debate on unemployment that will focus on a couple of areas, such as the tourism sector, particularly cultural holidays.  I refer to Ireland&rsquo;s heritage and a range of great literary and cultural figures, notably in my county and people such as Percy French in County Roscommon.  There is major potential to do more, to create jobs and to attract tourists.  With the Leader&rsquo;s professional background he appreciates what I am talking about and it is necessary.  </P>
        <P>We should examine a more radical school building programme.  There is a generous sum in the budget for it but in the present context we should have a comprehensive school building programme where there is a school in need of refurbishment or a new school is needed.  The proliferation of prefabs costs a fortune.  Cheaper contracts can be agreed now; money would come back in taxation and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance would be saved.  This social reform has major social and economic potential in a cost neutral way.</P>
        <P>I would like green energy to be incorporated into the debate on unemployment.  The people will thank us for it and will see us responding to their needs.  I refer to the co-operative wind farms as we developed the creameries of old.  Farmers and other groups should develop small wind farms and hydro energy.   I ask the Leader for a full debate on unemployment, a real response to people and then people will say the Seanad is doing what it should do.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite to the House in the near future the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, who has taken great interest in psychiatric illness and services.  I support what Senator Prendergast said.  I worked in the psychiatric area for many years and we need to examine psychiatric services.  For many years it was the Cinderella service.  Many of the facilities available, such as shelters, are being used as treatment centres.  They were never intended to be used for this and are not suitable.  The visit of the Minister of State would be an ideal opportunity for the debate, which is long overdue.</P>

	<P>Talk of fairness in today&rsquo;s budget is premature when one considers the way the Government has dealt with the elderly, those with special needs and cystic fibrosis patients.  Can we have a debate on unemployment?  I call for a debate on social partnership.  I welcome the return to talks by all involved in social partnership.  It is time that elected Oireachtas representatives had a role in social partnership.  I ask that the Leader convey to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the idea of a new Ireland economic forum, where we can involve everyone, not just those involved in social partnership.  This could be similar to what was done with the new Ireland forum in the 1980s regarding the peace process in Northern Ireland.  It is important that we involve both Houses in social partnership.  I hope the budget will be fair, that we will see the reincarnation of a new Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and that the Green Party will finally find <Col N="962"/>its wheels pumped up in a Government that lacked leadership and vision on behalf of the people who want leadership from the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in wishing the Government well on this important day as we plot our course.  No matter how fair the measures introduced today, it will raise the frustrations and anger of many of us, including Members on this side of the House.  Difficult decisions mean pain must be taken by all.  They must be taken; we must get on with it and look to the future with determination and positivity.</P>
        <P>At the earliest juncture I seek a debate on entrepreneurship.  Entrepreneurship does not refer to the individual but is an approach, a way of doing things.  It refers to creativity and flexibility.  If we can introduce this to our education system from the primary sector right up to third and fourth level, we can seek to replace our level of dependency on foreign direct investment and on the private sector and, in particular, the public sector to provide jobs.  We can look to breed our own intellectual property and entrepreneurs in a way that will lay a foundation which will take this country far into the future in a very positive way.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the debate today on bowel cancer awareness, I seek a debate on the national cancer control programme.  It is being implemented by the Health Service Executive under the auspices of the professor whom I am specifically not allowed to name.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event I would like a debate on the progress of the implementation of that programme.  As Members will be aware, while there is progress in some parts of the country, there are very serious problems in the north west and there is continuing neglect and discrimination proposed by the control programme there.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the medical teams at Sligo General Hospital for standing shoulder square, as it were, in the defence of delivery of the best service to the patients of that area.  The general practitioners there, together with the medical body of Sligo General Hospital, believe their services must continue and they must do what represents the best care for their patients.  With that in mind, I ask for a debate at a convenient time in the near future.</P>

	<P>I listened to a radio programme last week during which I heard vulnerable people with depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses state they were using premium rate lines such as Irish Psychics Live and running up bills of hundreds of euro because of their vulnerability.  Regtel has introduced guidelines indicating people should be cut off when the cost has reached &euro;60 but this is not happening and people are being allowed run up bills of hundreds of euro.  The owner of the company running these lines has stated there are only guidelines rather than legislation to compel the service to stop at &euro;60.  If this is the case, we should introduce legislation to cover such lines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I found that difficult to believe but it is happening.  We must protect consumers adequately with regard to these lines and introduce legislation where necessary.  Will the Leader contact the relevant Minister to ensure we have legislation to cover this area?</P>

It would be ideal to have an opportunity to discuss the way forward and how best we can help those who are most vulnerable, such as the elderly or those caring for children, get back into employment.</P>
        <P>There is a golden opportunity to discuss the issue because of the budget.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, every success this afternoon and I know it will be a fair budget.  I hope we will have many constructive contributions from all sides of the House about the budget.  This is the only way forward and we must think about it.  Many issues will arise in today&rsquo;s budget which will give us an opportunity to use the Seanad as a way of expounding on such issues and how best to move forward with the social partners, the social inclusion forum and our policymakers in order that we can work together to make Ireland a better place for us all.  I look forward to the debate resulting from this afternoon&rsquo;s budget.  I ask that we all work together on this and make constructive contributions.  That is all I want.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 55% of funding for REPS emanates from Brussels and a huge number of farmers depend on these payments.  Many part-time farmers would have been dependent on additional employment in the construction sector and now their only source of income is in the area of farming.  Farmers have been affected by the deferral of payments under the 40:40:20 option relating to waste management, the abolition of the early retirement scheme and the removal of suckler cow grants.</P>
        <P>I speak on behalf of these people by endorsing the importance of farming and agriculture to our country.</P>

	<P>We will be obliged to become increasingly dependent on agriculture.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Sargent, displayed a degree of reticence when questioned about REPS.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Norris, Prendergast, Walsh, Healy Eames, Daly, Mullen, Hanafin, Quinn, Callely, Coghlan, Regan, Glynn, Buttimer, MacSharry and Ormonde expressed their views on the budget and matters relating thereto.  I wish the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, which invested a great deal of time and effort in framing the budget, well.  Let us hope the budget represents the commencement of the country&rsquo;s recovery.  The Taoiseach indicated that it will be the beginning of a five-year process.  Everyone is aware of the challenge facing the world.  Ireland has always responded magnificently when placed under serious pressure.</P>
        <P>People are very much looking forward to playing their part.  I have never met so many individuals, regardless of the difficulties they face, who want to contribute.  It must be <Col N="964"/>remembered that almost 89% of the working population is in employment.  That is almost 750,000 more people than were at work during the dark period from 1983 to 1987.  The level of preparation for the budget has been exceptional and top quality expertise has been sought from every quarter.  The Taoiseach and the Government have informed the people of the nature of the difficulties that exist and indicated the seriousness with which they treat the crisis.  I look forward to the Seanad debate on the budget, which will commence at 10 a.m. on Thursday next.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the plight of those with cystic fibrosis, which is a terrible disease and which was highlighted by Orla Tinsley, that brilliant young lady who appeared on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; on Friday last and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today.  She is doing much to capture the imagination of Ireland.  As Senator Quinn stated, the symptoms relating to this disease may date back to the Great Famine.  The Minister will come before the House at 1.30 p.m. to discuss another matter and I do not doubt that leaders and spokespersons on health will avail of the ten minutes that have been set aside for questions and answers at the end of the debate to make their views known.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for whom I have always had the highest regard, who began her career in the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who became leader of her party and was the first female T&aacute;naiste.  She is an exceptional Minister and, in extremely difficult times, she is trying to change the health system.  When one considers that 49,000 people are employed in administrative positions in the health service, one realises the challenge she faces in the context of reducing those costs.  I do not refer here to nurses, consultants and others who are doing wonderful work.  I am always delighted to refer to those who have responded magnificently to the challenge relating to standards in hospitals.  I am proud that I come from Mullingar, particularly in light of the great work being done in the hospital there.</P>
        <P>Senators Prendergast, Leyden and Glynn called for a debate on Health Service Executive matters including welfare homes in terms of better equipment, staffing levels and so on.  The Minister will be in the House at 1.30 p.m.  I have no difficulty in requesting the Minister to come back to the House following the Easter recess to have a broad discussion on the HSE.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on local authority housing and the sale of the century, which was so successful in 1989.  Such a debate could be timely.  Those of us who attended the convention in Castlebar last Sunday saw beautiful three bedroom houses for sale at a price of &euro;99,000.  One could not buy a site for that price two years ago.  There is great value available in the market and the State should avail of that and make the money available.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, a colleague of Senator Leyden&rsquo;s from the same constituency, will be in the House to hear the views of the Seanad, and particularly the wisdom of Senator Leyden, a former Minister, who can bring to the attention of the Minister of State the very good suggestion he has made.</P>
        <P>We join Senator Quinn in sending our best wishes to those who have survived and our condolences to the families of those who have perished in the terrible tragedy that occurred in Italy during Holy Week.  Yesterday morning we heard the number of fatalities was 15, which was very bad.  It rose to 16 and continued to rise during the day and the night.  We heard this morning that 100 lives were saved during the night.  Thank God they were saved.  This was a frightening experience and anyone who can assist should assist.</P>
<Col N="965"/>
        <P>Senator Callely raised the issue of the fair deal scheme for the elderly.  The Minister will be in the House at 1.30 p.m. and he might inquire about the matter at that time.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen and Donohoe referred to issues being fully debated in the Seanad, as they are always fully debated particularly legislation and equal opportunities issues.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the two Senators.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe mentioned this historic week, Holy Week, the week the good Lord brought us all back to the possibility of another life.  As Jim Reeves said, &ldquo;This world is not my home; I&rsquo;m just a-passing through&rdquo;.  It is also the week when we commemorate our heroes of 1916.

        <P>Senator Regan raised the issue of the 75th anniversary of the Irish Constitution on which we had statements in the House with the Minster at the time, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I want to pass on our condolences to the Henchy family on the death of Mr. Justice Henchy, who made a remarkable contribution in his lifetime in terms of justice, human rights and equal rights for the people of our country under the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly asked that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, come to the House to discuss matters relating to unemployment, particularly in terms of tourism.  I support his call and will have such a debate take place.</P>
        <P>The Senator raised also the question of the school building programme.  A total of &euro;641 million, which is a great deal of money, is being spent on the school capital programme this year.  He also referred to a proposal on green energy, including wind farming and hydro energy, which is the way forward.  The Senator is a candidate for Europe, along with our colleague, <Col N="966"/>former Senator Paschal Mooney.  If everyone supports the local candidates they should do well, and we wish them well in their plight in the European campaign.  We look forward to Europe playing a role by increasing its funding for Ireland because of its geographical location on the periphery of Europe.  We could be an exporter of energy in a few years if we have the right technology and the right policies.</P>
      
        <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on psychiatric services.  There is no one more experienced on this topic in this House than he is and I have no problem in setting time aside for this in recognition of the many years work he has done in St. Loman&rsquo;s in Mullingar.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer welcomed the restart of talks with the social partners and I join him in that.  I will pass his views on about the establishment of a forum where both Houses of the Oireachtas can engage with the Government and the social partners to make a contribution.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry asked for debate on issues relating to the north west, which I will arrange at the earliest opportunity, and for a further discussion of all matters pertaining to the HSE.  He paid tribute to Sligo General Hospital and the great work it does.</P>
        <P>I heard the broadcast referred to by Senator Cummins on Regtel and the need for legislation to prevent the abuse of consumers in this area.  I will request information from the Minister to see if legislation will be forthcoming in the next six to nine months that could have an extra section inserted to cover this point.</P>

        <P>Senator McFadden highlighted the plight of farmers and pointed out the importance of agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, is doing an excellent job.  He comes from an agricultural background and is a neighbour of ours in County Cavan, where there were not many big ranchers.  The poor people of Cavan often had to rear families on 25 to 30 acres, something I know from personal experience.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the topic of bowel cancer awareness.  In Ireland there is a relatively high incidence of this type of cancer, also known as colorectal cancer.  It is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in this country.  This is why initiatives such as the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s bowel cancer awareness month are so important.  Early diagnosis is a significant factor in improving outcomes for all types of cancer and this initiative will help to make people more aware of the signs of colorectal cancer and encourage them to take action where needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government published a national strategy for cancer control in 2006.  This sets out the blueprint for addressing the burden of cancer.  Under the strategy there are four main areas to cancer control: prevention, early detection, treatment and after care.  In response to the strategy, the Health Service Executive established a national cancer control programme in 2007.  Under Professor Tom Keane, the interim director of the programme, the HSE is reconfiguring the present fragmented cancer care system by the establishment of eight designated cancer specialist centres.  Progress under the programme must be on an incremental basis and the initial focus has been on the development of breast cancer services in the eight centres, together with addressing the gaps in treatment for other major cancers.  At present approximately 27,000 people are diagnosed with cancer each year.  The number of newly diagnosed cancers is increasing by 6% to 7% annually and unless a major reversal of trends occurs in the near future the number is likely to double in the next 20 years.</P>
        <P>Approximately 2,200 cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed in Ireland each year and more than 900 people die from the disease.  According to projections from the National Cancer Registry, the numbers are set to increase significantly.  By 2030, the number of new cases diagnosed is projected to rise by 110% in men and by 83% in women.  The rise in this type of <Col N="968"/>cancer is mainly due to demographic factors,essentially an increasing and ageing population.  Incidence generally increases with age, with more than four fifths of cases occurring in those over the age of 55.  However, survival rates have been increasing slowly over time.  Over the five-year periods between 1994-1999 and 2000-2004, relative survival from colorectal cancer, at five years after diagnosis, increased from 46% to 51%.  The increase for men was from 45% to 49% and for women from 47% to 53%.  We wish to see relative survival rates improve further.</P>
        <P>In the context of the national colorectal cancer screening programme, the optimum approach to population screening has not been fully defined, but as with all screening programmes, it must be acceptable, sensitive, specific and cost effective.  It is against this background that the Minister, Deputy Harney, requested the board of the national cancer screening service to advise her on the introduction of a population-based colorectal screening programme, including who should be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, the type of screening test that should be used and so on.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has been asked to conduct a health technology assessment on a colorectal screening programme to examine the cost effectiveness and resource implications of a population-based colorectal cancer screening programme in Ireland.  The Minister has received an expert report from the screening service.  I understand the health technology assessment is also complete and the Minister expects to receive this shortly.  At that stage, she will be in a position to consider further the introduction of a colorectal screening programme and the resources that would be necessary for this.</P>
        <P>A population-based screening programme would be aimed at prevention and early diagnosis for people who do not have symptoms but who nevertheless may be at risk.  Separately, however, it is important to ensure we can provide speedy diagnosis for symptomatic patients as well as timely and appropriate treatment for those who do receive a diagnosis of colorectal cancer.  There has been a great deal of media coverage in recent times on waiting times for colonoscopy services.  Colonoscopy is not the only diagnostic tool available for patients with symptoms that may indicate colorectal cancer but it is one of the most important.</P>
        <P>While most patients referred for colonoscopy will not have a diagnosis of cancer, timely access to colonoscopy is necessary to ensure appropriate treatment for those who receive a diagnosis of colorectal cancer as well as those whose symptoms relate to another condition.  For this reason, all hospitals have been instructed to refer anyone waiting more than three months for a colonoscopy to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  In addition, a target of four weeks from date of referral for urgent colonoscopies has been set and the Minister has asked the HSE to report to her under the service planning process on its compliance with this target.  Overall, therefore, there has been a significant reduction in waiting lists for colonoscopies and the HSE is continuing to work towards the target of four weeks for urgent referrals.</P>
        <P>There is a strong link between improved cancer outcomes and high levels of hospital activity for those diagnosed with colorectal cancer.  In this regard, the national cancer control programme continues to make progress in the implementation of the cancer control strategy and the centralisation of all cancer services over time into the eight designated cancer services.  Despite the difficult economic circumstances, the Government was able to allocate significant additional funds and posts this year to further develop services for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</P>
        <P>On colorectal cancer specifically, the NCCP has focused initially on rectal cancer surgery.  This is a technically demanding surgical procedure and there is widespread agreement that it must be performed by surgeons who specialise in this area.  At the request of the national cancer control programme the National Cancer Registry in collaboration with the Royal College of <Col N="969"/>Surgeons of Ireland has recently completed the first national audit of rectal cancer surgery.  The audit showed that in 2007, a large number of hospitals were performing small numbers of rectal cancer surgeries.  The programme has accepted a recommendation from the Irish Society of Coloproctology that the number of hospitals performing rectal cancer surgery should be reduced, with the ultimate goal of reducing this number to the eight designated cancer centres as surgical capacity is created.  A directive to reflect those recommendations will issue shortly.</P>
        <P>The national cancer control programme has not as yet taken a policy position on a timetable for the centralisation of colon cancer surgery.  Inevitably, there will be a requirement to reduce the number of hospitals performing colon cancer surgery.  The programme will continue to engage with the Irish Society of Coloproctology prior to adopting a policy statement.  Guidelines for the management of colorectal cancer have been issued by the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.  Those are supported by the programme, which is currently in dialogue with the Irish Association of Coloproctology in regard to formally adopting and implementing those as national guidelines.</P>
        <P>As we know, prevention, early diagnosis and timely and appropriate treatment are all of vital importance in the battle to improve outcomes and survival for this type of cancer, as for all cancers.  Much progress has been made in recent years on all these areas.  In terms of prevention and early diagnosis, for certain cancers screening is one of the ways that we can do that and a health technology assessment is due to be submitted to the Minister, Deputy Harney, shortly on a screening programme for colorectal cancer.</P>
        <P>Two national screening programmes are already in place: BreastCheck and CervicalCheck.  CervicalCheck was launched nationally in September 2008.  To date, approximately 90,000 cervical smears have been performed under the programme, with approximately 40,000 of those being in March.  Given that a successful cervical screening programme has the potential to reduce deaths from cervical cancer by up to 80%, it is encouraging to see this programme being availed of in such significant numbers.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck is now available in 22 counties and by the end of this year will have been rolled out in all 26 counties and the number of women screened is increasing year on year.  In 2007, a total of 66,527 women were screened, in 2008 it was 90,335 and this year the target is 140,000, with more than 27,000 women already screened this year.  Validated figures on the number of cancers detected for 2007 show that in that year 396 cancers were detected by the BreastCheck programme.  Where cancer is detected, appropriate treatment and follow-up is provided within the BreastCheck programme.</P>
        <P>Improving outcomes is also a key objective of the work being done under the national cancer control programme.  I have already outlined the work being done by the programme in terms of colorectal cancer.  That is one element of the reorganisation of Irish cancer services.  The programme is also continuing to focus this year on a number of other site-specific cancers.</P>
        <P>Centralising breast cancer diagnosis and surgery was the first priority for the programme.  There is worldwide evidence to show that centres treating higher volumes of patients have better treatment outcomes.  In mid-2007, a total of 33 hospitals were providing breast cancer diagnosis and surgery, but by the end of 2008 just 12 hospitals were providing those services.  The process of transferring services to the eight designated centres is almost complete.  The key objectives of this initiative are to ensure that where breast cancer services are provided, they comply with the national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease services and that outcome and survival rates improve.</P>
        <P>This year the cancer programme is also focusing on lung cancer and prostate cancer in particular.  Access to early diagnosis for these two cancers has been problematic and that is an area that must be addressed.  In this regard, the programme has decided that earlier diagnosis <Col N="970"/>and multidisciplinary decision-making must be enhanced for both of those cancers.  A key initiative this year, therefore, is the establishment of rapid access diagnostic clinics in the designated cancer centres for those cancers.  Based on agreed referral criteria, patients will be fast-tracked to the rapid access clinics from which they can receive a definitive diagnosis within two weeks.</P>
        <P>This year the national cancer control programme is also focusing on the reorganisation of services for brain tumours, pancreatic cancer and reconstructive surgery for head and neck cancer.  It has been agreed that there will be a single national programme for the management of brain tumours and other central nervous system tumours across the two sites of Beaumont and Cork University Hospital.</P>
        <P>Through the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme and in conjunction with voluntary agencies, we will continue to work towards our stated goals of better cancer prevention, detection and survival for all cancers, including colorectal cancer.  Some members of the Irish Cancer Society are with us in the Visitor&rsquo;s Gallery today.  I very much welcome its awareness campaign given the relatively high incidence of bowel cancer in Ireland and also because of the importance of awareness campaigns in terms of prevention and early diagnosis.  The Irish Cancer Society has produced some excellent information materials and I am sure many people will benefit from the current campaign.  I reiterate that anyone who has any concerns about colorectal cancer should consult their GP, as the earlier problems are detected the better the outcomes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the amount of money we have had here in the past ten years and the amount of money that has been put into the health service, it is very disappointing that a colorectal screening programme was not developed during the period of the Celtic tiger to address this disease that kills 900 people in this country every year and that affects so many others.  I hoped the Minister would announce today in the House the allocation of at least &euro;1 million to kick start the screening required.</P>
        <P>I welcome the representatives of the Irish Cancer Society, and the volunteers who work with them.  I congratulate it on the impact its awareness month is having.  I understand the freefone line is receiving more than 100 calls a day.  There is no doubt that there is a new awareness in the country about this serious disease.  We must remember that approximately 2,200 cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed and more than 900 people die from it each year.  It is difficult to believe the number is so high.  It is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the country.  I do not think people realise that unless they have been personally affected by it or know somebody affected.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, Bill O&rsquo;Herlihy and the various people who fronted the campaign because awareness is critical.</P>
        <P>In her script the Minister reminded us that the BreastCheck programme is still not available in 26 counties.  Given the amount of money that has been invested in the health service, what is it about the failure of health planning in this country that we cannot have universal screening and that it is taking so long to implement it?  Screening saves lives.  We should have a colorectal screening programme in place.  That is absolutely clear when one considers the seriousness of the disease and the number of people dying from it.  Irishmen have the fourth highest death rate internationally from this disease.  Surely a screening programme should be a priority in the health service.  In her speech, the Minister did not give any clear indications as to when a screening programme would be put in place.  At the end of this debate, I want the Minister of State to try to give some indication of the timeframe for delivering a screening programme for colorectal cancer.  It will not happen overnight, as we know.  Will the &euro;1 million to start the process be made available very soon or in the next few months?  If we are to reduce mortality rates associated with bowel cancer and promote early detection, this is critical.</P>
<Col N="971"/>
        <P>It is very worrying that 50% of patients with bowel cancer in Ireland are not diagnosed until the late stages of the disease.  This is why the information campaign is so important.  We must circulate the information, raise awareness and put the national colorectal screening programme in place.  Research shows that 70% of people would definitely attend screening for bowel cancer if the Government offered the service free of charge to all adults over 50.</P>
        <P>There is embarrassment about this illness.  People with symptoms are reluctant to go to general practitioners or specialists.  With the right type of awareness campaign people will begin to go to their general practitioners, to whom they should go in the first place.  It is hoped they would then be referred for proper tests.</P>
        <P>What is the most up-to-date position on colorectal screening plans for Ireland?  Could we have a clear statement from the Minister of State in this regard?  It is not in her script.  People want to know the position.  What is the timeframe and deadline and what actions are to be taken to ensure there will be colorectal screening in the near future?</P>
        <P>Has a decision been made on the &euro;1 million that was due to be given to the National Cancer Screening Service this year to prepare for the programme?  If not, when will one be made?  What is the timeline and financial provision in this regard?  If the Minister of State could cast some light on this issue today, it would be extremely helpful.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the Minister receiving a report on the health technology assessment for the bowel cancer screening programme.  Has she the report?  If not, when does she expect it?  What is the current position on the assessment and when will the report be presented to the Government?  These are critical questions I hoped would be answered on this very important day on which many serious budgetary decisions must be made.</P>
        <P>There is also concern over the waiting time for a colonoscopy.  We all remember our shock and upset when we listened to Susie Long before she died and to her husband after she died.  Her husband referred to the stress on the family.  Since Ms Long waited for a public service appointment, she did not catch her cancer in time.  It is critical that the waiting time be short.</P>
        <P>Best practice suggests a colonoscopy should be carried out within a very short period on those who are considered to be seriously at risk or who have serious symptoms.  The Minister of State said there should be a four-week waiting time.  Last November, 1,636 people were waiting more than three months and 900 people were waiting more than six months.  It seems as if some progress has been made in this regard; the Minister of State referred to four-week waiting periods.  I understand 194 people are waiting for more than six months &ndash; I will double-check this &ndash; and people are still waiting much longer than the optimal period.  Will the Minister of State inform the House about the action to be taken to address waiting lists and ensure colonoscopies are carried out as quickly as possible after referral by a general practitioner?</P>
        <P>It is not easy to solve this problem.  If one considers statistics on the number of gastro-enterologists <i>per capita</i>, one will realise Ireland is not well resourced by comparison to other European countries.  Austria has more than three gastro-enterologists per 100,000 while we have 0.65 per 100,000.  Is there a plan in place to address this staffing shortfall?  It is a critical issue.  How can the tests be carried out if sufficient staff are not in place?</P>
        <P>It is absolutely clear that there are many difficulties in this area.  We need to hear from the Minister on screening, access to colonoscopies and gastro-enterologists.  The Government needs to co-operate actively with voluntary organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society and set its mind and resources to dramatically reducing mortality from bowel cancer and promoting preventive measures alongside screening, which measures would lead to early detection and treatment.</P>
<Col N="972"/>
        <P>We all know of the dreadful upset to families when cancer is discovered at a late stage.  We know of the importance of early detection of symptoms, referral, screening and treatment.  I refer not only to the personal cost and upset caused by late diagnosis, which are considerable, but also to its effect on treatment.  Treatment is far more complex and expensive in cases of late diagnosis and the outcome is less favourable.  For these reasons, I welcome the awareness month that is under way.  It will do a great deal of good in promoting recognition of the disease and encouraging people not to be embarrassed and nervous but to seek the kind of help they need if they have the symptoms.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society commissioned a survey of more than 1,000 adults nationwide.  Some of its key findings are that 36% of people cannot name one sign or symptom of bowel cancer, 25% do not know factors that might increase their risk of developing bowel cancer, and 40% of people believe people under 50 years are most at risk of developing bowel cancer.  Ninety percent of people diagnosed with the disease in 2005 were over the age of 50 and, therefore, there is a very false perception about the illness and a considerable lack of correct information.  These factors inhibit people from seeking help.</P>
        <P>The results of the survey show there is a worrying lack of awareness of the early warning signs of bowel cancer.  This is why the Irish Cancer Society launched its awareness campaign.  It gives very useful advice on what people can do to reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer.  One should be aware of any family history of the disease, have a regular diet, take regular exercise and go to one&rsquo;s general practitioner if one has symptoms.  All we can do today is state that, at national level, we want the screening process in place and the money to be given soon this year to start the process.  We want the waiting lists to be tackled such that, if people are referred, they will be seen quickly.  We want the public awareness campaign to continue so people will not be diagnosed at such a late stage of the disease, thereby allowing them to receive the intervention that will lead to better outcomes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, and thank her for taking the debate.  I welcome the representatives of the Irish Cancer Society in the Visitors Gallery.  Two of the society&rsquo;s members, Ms Lorna Jennings and Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Meara, are very well known to Members of the House.  They leave no stone unturned in chasing us up.  If they do not get us in one way, they get us in another.  It is fair to say that it was easy for them to gain access to Senators&rsquo; offices as we are all singing from the one hymn sheet on this issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I first heard about the bowel cancer awareness campaign on the radio some days ago and was very impressed.  I went home at the weekend and noted I had received the relevant documentation from the Irish Cancer Society.  I brought it with me today because I believe that, if ever money was well spent, it was well spent on this.  The brochure is very attractive and catches one&rsquo;s eye.  There is red for danger and a balloon that would appeal to a child.  One is immediately attracted to it.  Senators will agree that we have plenty of expensive literature sent to our offices and we say it is a waste of money.  Whatever was spent on this was well spent and I congratulate the Irish Cancer Society on it.</P>
        <P>This is the first bowel cancer awareness month and, as Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, every year 900 people die from it.  More than half of those diagnosed are at advanced stages, namely, stages 3 and 4.  Sadly, only 42% of this group will survive.  This is very sad because, like all cancers, if it is caught early it is treatable.  This is why it is so important to have education and educators.  I look on the Irish Cancer Society as the educators and I congratulate it on this.</P>
        <P>October is breast cancer awareness month and November is lung cancer awareness month.  Given that we know so much about breast cancer from the Irish Cancer Society, people are <Col N="973"/>now less afraid than they used to be and women in particular, the minute they feel any abnormality to their breast, go to the doctor.  What a shame there is such a stigma and almost an embarrassment around all cancers.  We speak about it in hushed tones.  If we discuss somebody who has died we ask whether it was the big C.  We do not ask whether he or she died of cancer.  There is fear in all of us when we speak about it and there should be because it is a killer.  It knows no boundaries and it stops nowhere.  It penetrates all classes, boundaries, countries and races.</P>
        <P>I smiled when I saw Senator Feargal Quinn come in because until then three women Members of the Seanad were debating bowel cancer.  When we debate prostate cancer there will probably be all women in the Chamber also.  I state this with tongue in cheek because women speak about it more easily.  Men do not like going to the doctor.  Women do not like it either but they are more inclined to handle it, deal with it and speak about it.</P>
        <P>Education is the key and we need to be informed.  When I was researching this subject I saw that one in three people could not name any of the symptoms associated with bowel cancer.  It is important to name them and I know when I do there will be blushes.  They include change in bowel habits and bleeding from the back passage.  They are not nice matters to speak about but we must speak about them.  The symptoms also include a regular feeling of trapped wind in one&rsquo;s stomach, a feeling that one still has something to pass having gone to the loo, pain in one&rsquo;s tummy, ongoing tiredness and weight loss.  Yes, we blush and it is a little embarrassing to name these, but that is ridiculous.  What about them?  In my office, my PA stated that it will be hard to say these words but I said that I would say them.  Blushing never killed anybody but bowel and other cancers do.  I would rather blush for Ireland than continue to have a disease that is not diagnosed on time.</P>
        <P>How can we reduce the risk of getting cancer?  One way is to know our family history because if a family member has had the disease it is more like that one will get it because it is in the genes.  Unfortunately, only a year ago I lost a very close friend to bowel cancer.  Her cancer was at stage 4 when it was diagnosed.  It was horrific.  Not a day goes by when I do not think of her.  Everybody is affected by this.  As she stated to me often, she thought she had an upset tummy.  For about five weeks, she treated herself for an upset tummy.  By the time she was diagnosed she had a secondary.  She said that as she did not know about the primary how was she to know about the secondary.  That is why today I say to hell with the blushes and the embarrassment, let us talk about this and make people aware.</P>
        <P>It was with sadness and glee that I read the story of the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen.  A number of people stated to me that they did not know that he had bowel cancer and that it was great to be able to read about these matters.  The same is the case with Bill O&rsquo;Herlihy.  We will reduce risks by examining diet and exercise.  Nowadays we are all far too busy, but even 30 minutes a day of exercise would help.  I never knew about pilates until a few months ago and now I think it is the greatest thing ever.  Recently, I heard somebody state that the first thing an animal does when it gets up to move is to stretch.  What do humans do?  We get up, we crouch over and we hold our back or some part of us, and the older we get the more places we hold.  Lifestyle and exercise are important as is eating the right foods such as fruit, vegetables and fibre and keeping fat intake low.  Unfortunately, because it is in our nature we all like a little bit of fat.  We all like chips and the rind on the rasher.  It is endemic in us and what we were born into.  It is part of our DNA.</P>
        <P>We are all singing from the same hymn sheet on this matter and we will repeat much of what we found when we were researching.  However, it is no harm to repeat it.  Most cases are detected in those aged between 50 and 60 but one can be diagnosed before one reaches the age of 50.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, stated that 55 is a common age for diagnosis. <Col N="974"/> It is common in both genders and the breakdown is almost 50:50.  In 2005, there were 48 cases in Sligo, where I live, which was 10% of the national figure.  If 900 people die of it now it means the incidence is higher in every county.</P>
        <P>The Government has moved on the waiting lists for colonoscopies.  There should not be waiting lists and everybody, including the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, would agree with that.  Nobody wants waiting lists and the sooner they are eradicated the better.  Anybody waiting for more than one month should be referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I say to consultants, practitioners and doctors, do not be afraid to refer people.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated that she would like to see colonoscopies carried out immediately someone goes to the doctor.</P>
        <P>I know that the Government, including the Minister, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, are committed to breaking through the barriers and introducing various screening processes.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State say that the report of HIQA&rsquo;s health technology assessment group is ready and perhaps we will hear about it in the near future.</P>
        <P>When looking out for bower cancer we should take into account those in the 50 to 60 year old age group, family history, unhealthy lifestyle and heavy drinkers and smokers.  I take my hat off to the Irish Cancer Society and I bow to the work it does.  Without its valuable input we would not be where we are today.  It should keep the pressure on.  It is seeking a national screening programme for bowel cancer and I promise I will go every length of the way with it on this.  Until we get this nothing can be done with regard to people with stage 3 and stage 4 cancer.  We see the uptake for cervical and breast cancer screening.  People are no longer afraid to speak about breast cancer.  In the near future we will not be afraid to speak about cervical cancer.  Neither will we be afraid to speak about bowel cancer, as unsavoury as it might be.  Until that time comes, and it will come through screening, there will be no breakthrough in early detection.  Early detection will lead to more cures and we will be curing more than we are today.  We will not hear the stories of young women and men being cut down in the prime of their lives, families having to do without mothers and fathers and, in some cases, parents burying adult sons and daughters who have their own children.</P>
        <P>We are all committed on this.  In the same way that cancer knows no boundaries, no barriers and no differentiation between races, we in politics should not know any barriers on this.  We should not fight it on a party political basis but should be united on it.  We should all push for the early detection and early screening programmes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  There has been a certain questioning and criticism of the very existence of the Seanad in recent weeks.  I think today is an example of the sort of work that can take place and that can give the benefits to the nation that might not otherwise have taken place.  Today&rsquo;s debate is a very good example of that.  Senator Feeney has spoken about education.  There is little doubt that having this debate will not achieve what we are setting out to do unless we manage to get somewhere further with it.</P>
        <P>The debate has been very useful, and it was interesting to hear Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s words as well.  I was impressed with Senator Feeney&rsquo;s words when she pointed out she was glad to see me come in.  Senator Buttimer was not here at the time, and other than the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I was the only man here.  What Senator Feeney said had not dawned on me before, but maybe men are just unwilling to discuss things and unwilling to open their minds, their thoughts and their words to such a threat.  Today&rsquo;s debate is another step along the way in what the Irish Cancer Society has managed to achieve, by putting this on the agenda.</P>
        <P>All of us know somebody who has suffered from cancer.  All of us probably know somebody who has suffered from bowel cancer.  Senator Fitzgerald touched on the lack of awareness of <Col N="975"/>how important it is, that it is treatable and we can do something about it.  From that point of view, I congratulate the Irish Cancer Society for putting it high on the agenda, and for putting it on the agenda here today.  I welcome the launch of its campaign to increase awareness of bowel cancer signs and symptoms, as well as the importance of early detection.  Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in Ireland.  Every year, 2,000 cases are diagnosed and 900 people die from the disease.  The campaign is concentrating on the message that discovering the cancer early makes all the difference.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than 50% of cancer patients in Ireland are diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer with a very poor survival rate.  We as a nation can do something about that.  The Irish Cancer Society states that 36% of people cannot name one sign or symptom of bowel cancer, with one quarter not knowing what factors might increase their risk of developing the disease.  If only we could make sure that the whole nation was able to hear this debate, more people would be educated about this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children recently told the Joint Committee on Health and Children that no funding has yet been allocated to a national colorectal screening programme.  She stated that she would consider the introduction of such a programme and the resources needed when she receives the assessment.  Given the scale of the problem we have, that is not good enough.  There should be a programme to help those most at risk from the disease, namely, those over 50.  I support the call of the Irish Cancer Society for the roll out of a free national bowel cancer screening programme for everybody over 50.  Screening saves lives and that is the important thing.  There is evidence to show that a bowel cancer screening programme would start to save lives immediately.  It is not a long-term thing and is also the least expensive of all the screening programmes.  It is estimated to pay for itself in a period of five years.  The financial crisis is putting everything under threat, but doing away with the &euro;1 million set aside to begin a national screening programme would be a major step backwards.</P>
        <P>Recently I read an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of the case of a bowel cancer patient, Mr. Roddy Carter from Dublin, who was diagnosed with late stage bowel cancer after presenting with pains at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital emergency department.  He had been on the waiting list at Tallaght Hospital for a colonoscopy for a year.  Each time he inquired about the procedure, he was told he would just have to wait.  Such was the seriousness of his condition, he was operated on within three days of his visit to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  He needed radical surgery, and is now receiving radiation therapy as a follow up.  If he had not taken the initiative and gone to the emergency ward in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, he would probably still be waiting for a colonoscopy in Tallaght Hospital.</P>
        <P>Cases like these highlight the need for the introduction of a bowel cancer screening system for everybody over 50.  Ireland&rsquo;s cancer survival rates are way behind those of our western European neighbours.  Introducing the screening programme would go a long way to help improve the terrible record we have when it comes to cancer survival.  Let me touch on one or two of the figures.  A total of 25% of people do not know the factors which might increase their risk of developing bowel cancer, while 40% believe that people under 50 years of age are most at risk of developing bowel cancer.  In fact, 90% of people diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2005 were over 50.  Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in Ireland.  In 2005, 2,184 new cases of bowel cancer were diagnosed, and 924 people died from the disease.  Over 50% of patients in Ireland are diagnosed with stage three or stage four bowel cancer, the most advanced stages that have very poor survival rates.  The risk factors are age, family history, abnormal growth of tissue in the lining of the bowel, diet and obesity.  I thank Senator Feeney for being so blunt with words that I avoided when I was preparing my thoughts.  The most common symptoms of the disease are a change in bowel habits lasting more than a month, rectal bleeding, constipation and the other things she talked about.</P>
<Col N="976"/>
        <P>We can do something about this, but only if we are educated and determined to let it be known that this is solvable.  We need to put all our thoughts and actions together on this.  This debate has given us food for though and fuel for action.  We know what we can do, so let us make sure we do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>My father died of cancer of the colon.  He was 52 years of age when he was first diagnosed.  I was 17 and in my leaving certificate year.  He was lucky that the diagnosis was relatively quick.  In spite of that, and having an excellent surgeon and team of nurses, he went through three very debilitating operations in six months before he came home.  It was a cancer that recurred over ten year periods.  The second time, ten years later, he was more prepared to deal with it, knew what it was about and was more used to the side effects such as the use of colostomy bags.  When discussing awareness, we should not only consider the onset of the condition, but living with it as well, and today&rsquo;s debate is very useful in airing these matters.  The third time it occurred, he was 73 years of age and had lost the reserves to fight it.  During the intervening 20 years, which was a gift, he lived a very normal life and was, as people in the Chamber are aware, a colourful character.  My family were also lucky that my mother was a full-time nurse which meant we had advantages other families would not have had in identifying the causes and living with the condition.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that I am not too many years shy of when my father was first diagnosed.  Having listened to many of the risk factors outlined today, my personal awareness has been heightened especially.  As Senator Quinn stated, the value of the Chamber is in discoursing on subjects in a broader sense which do not receive an airing in the other House and in helping to inform a public debate which would not occur otherwise.</P>
        <P>There is a need to be more open about the existence of the condition, its prevalence and the fact the many thousands of people in families are living with this every day.  We must be more pre-emptive in helping to identify it through our health service.  The level of access to and use of colonoscopies is unacceptable.  The political system must ask the necessary questions, such as why the barriers which exist are in place how they can be prevented.  As Senator Quinn stated, there is a reluctance to air and discuss these issues and there may even be a gender issue concerning how we discuss them in general.  In terms of a national cancer strategy, I hope the existence of debates such as this will help to promote and inform what we need to know in this area.</P>
        <P>Apart from the lifestyle issues and issues of physical condition that are relevant factors, the issue of family history is also very important.  Subsequent to the death of my father, a brother of his also succumbed to the same condition.  We should be especially aware of the genetic factors when alerting people to the diagnostic facilities available.  They should be available as much as possible and to as many people as possible to give a general sense of the prevalence and onset of the condition, and this is not the case at present.  One could argue that lack of resources is the reason behind this, but it is probably more a matter of political will and commitment.  This is not a criticism of the Government or even of the political system.  One good aspect of this debate is that points are being made in a cross-party way and more out of sadness and sorrow for the fact that we have a difficulty within our system which must be tackled.</P>
        <P>In terms of general awareness, there is a lack of openness in our society and we should encourage a greater level of it among younger people.  I find myself in my mid-40s nudging towards the end of my fourth decade and these are subjects about which I would not have thought of or talked about previously and to which the generations behind me give no consideration whatsoever.  However, the lifestyle factors inherent in increasing the risk of the condition are borne by the lives of some people in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s.  The job of work <Col N="977"/>which must be done in terms of health promotion and awareness should be especially directed at such age groups.  While the discussion refers to the group at risk, namely, those aged 50 years and above, and those living with and suffering from the condition, far more needs to be done in the education area and in identifying the risks before people reach that age.  I hope this debate is an important part of that.  The Seanad should play a greater role in highlighting the issue.  The debate will be better served by whatever individual and personal stories we have to help inform it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, to the Chamber and I thank the other speakers for their contributions.  It is apparent that the homework has been done because invariably we all have the same statistics from which to quote.  As Senator Feeney stated, it is no harm to repeat a message because it is by repetition and by highlighting statistics that it becomes part of the psyche.  Having worked in the health service for many years I am aware that thousands of colonoscopies are carried out each year in South Tipperary General Hospital.  The procedure is very successful as a diagnostic aid, but there are simpler ways.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the subject and we are well into bowel cancer awareness month.  It is a shame that the debate will be overshadowed by events later today, because this is a very important issue.  It is the second most common cause of cancer, as the Minister of State said.  Depressingly, it is probably the easiest to treat and detect at an early stage.  However, if reaches stage three or four, survival chances diminish rapidly.  The most recent figures indicate 900 people die each year from bowel cancer.  The figure is that high because it is difficult to detect and because people are not aware of the symptoms.  It is always a matter of great surprise to me now because I am of a similar age to Senator Boyle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are great at keeping an eye on our cars and phones.  We are quick to upgrade and update them, have them checked out and put on new wheels.  However, we are not as great when it comes to ourselves.  Senator Feeney spoke at length about the embarrassment in respect of bowel cancer.  Perhaps it is because I have been so surrounded by issues in respect of the body that I have no embarrassment in discussing cancer of any part of the body.  In the course of my career I have encountered issues in respect of vulval cancer and cancers in areas which are difficult to treat.  If exposure is part of the treatment it is even more difficult to treat.  Sensitivity aside, it is a very important subject for debate.  Public attitudes are very relevant.</P>
        <P>The work of the Irish Cancer Society in promoting the issue with some very high-profile figures is warranted and welcome.  I extend a very warm welcome to the former Senator, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Meara, and the other members of the society present in the Visitors Gallery.  It is great to see them any time, but especially important in highlighting this issue.  The survey conducted by the society last summer, which has been emphasised, revealed 36% of people could not name a cancer symptom and 25% of people did not know what factors could increase the risk of developing bowel cancer.  It was startling and alarming that such a common ailment is so little understood.</P>
        <P>The health authorities in the UK have taken a simple step to reduce the rate of fatalities from bowel cancer by distributing a self-testing kit as part of a national screening programme.  The fecal occult blood test, FOBT, is sent to people who simply provide a sample and send it <Col N="978"/>to be tested.  If a blood trace is found, they are invited for a colonoscopy.  The test should be repeated every two years and is expected to detect approximately half of any bowel cancers according to the Institute of Cancer Research in Britain.  Occasionally there are false positives if a person has haemorrhoids or piles, which can sometimes bleed.  This may lead to a false positive and, obviously, it is a mater of great relief upon being told this is the case.</P>
        <P>The FOBT is a good, cheap test.  During trials of the test in Scotland, the positive predictive value was 10.9% for cancer and exactly 35% for adenoma.  Adenoma is benign but if untreated can lead to cancer.  It is a very simple and inexpensive process and will save money in the long run.  Early detection of cancer can reduce the need for invasive surgery.  The testing kit consists of little more than a cardboard swab and a cardboard receptacle.  In the USA each test costs $5, such that there is no comparison to the cost of visiting a general practitioner, although I am not advocating cost as a factor for not going to the GP.  In the UK the scheme is currently aimed at the highest risk group, namely, those between 60 and 69 years of age and it will gradually be rolled out to other target groups.  In Canada, the scheme is free for over 50s and kits are given out at health centres.  As Ireland does not have such a scheme, the Irish Cancer Society hopes that bowel cancer awareness month will help with its call for a screening programme.  This is supported by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, who is still recovering from bowel cancer.  We wish him and everyone diagnosed with any type of cancer or illness well.  I am glad to add my voice to the campaign, which is something that the HSE should focus on instead of giving a mere endorsement.</P>
        <P>Given that nearly 300 patients have been on colonoscopy waiting lists for more than six months and more than half of bowel cancers are diagnosed late, testing must be implemented as a matter of urgency.  In Canada, it is reckoned that 90% of bowel cancer is curable when detected early.  This means that nearly 800 people are dying needlessly in this country, which is an appalling statistic.  Everyone would be shocked by a mass of 800 deaths, but that is the number involved.</P>
        <P>The UK has committed to and is rolling out a national programme, which is due to start in Northern Ireland this year.  As long ago as 2003, Dr. Richard E. Schabas, the then chief of staff at York Central Hospital in Ontario, analysed the evidence of regional screening programmes and concluded that &ldquo;colorectal screening with FOB testing is simply too good an opportunity to ignore&rdquo;.  The institutes of health research in Canada conducted a cost benefit analysis of the scheme that it has been running for 50 to 74 year olds since 2000 and it concluded that screening appears to be cost effective under all the scenarios considered.  That was in 2007.</P>
        <P>Our system is failing dismally in terms of health outcomes and, given the evidence, cost effectiveness.  It is slow and cumbersome, with half of all diagnoses being for late stage cancer.  This means that the cost of treatment is more expensive than the treatment for early stage detection.  It is also contrary to the philosophy outlined in the cancer control strategy, which supports screening for bowel cancers and the further benefits of early detection initiatives.  The latter educate the public about recognising symptoms, performing self-examination and the importance of early presentation of symptoms to doctors.  While bowel cancer screening is not perfect, it is a better system than the current one and I call on the HSE to start implementing it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and to discuss the causes, effects and prevention of bowel cancer.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="979"/>Barry Andrews.  A number of speakers mentioned that we seem to have similar statistics and information regarding symptoms.  Repeating them will not hurt, but I will try to keep the repetition to a minimum.</P>
        <P>Bowel cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among Irish men and women and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States.  Each year, more than 1,000 men and 800 women are diagnosed with bowel cancer while 500 men and 400 women die from the disease annually.  In 2005, 2,184 new cases of bowel cancer were diagnosed and 924 people died from the disease.  Most striking is that more than 50% of patients when initially identified as having bowel cancer are diagnosed with stage 3 or 4, which are the most advanced stages and have poor survival rates.  In light of this alarming statistic, it is crucial that symptoms are detected early to improve chances of survival.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Irish Cancer Society on its bowel cancer awareness month.  I hope that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue and the awareness month will increase public awareness and the number of screening tests.  Opportunities such as that presented by this debate increase public awareness, information and education, as does the use of the information and posters forwarded to each Senator by the Irish Cancer Society with the request that we highlight them in the most appropriate manner to those with whom we come into contact.</P>
        <P>Ireland has the highest mortality rate for colorectal cancer in western Europe and the fourth highest mortality rate among men worldwide.  Yet, if caught early, bowel cancer is one of the most treatable cancers.  Screening is essential.  However, without an accompanying knowledge and awareness, its full potential will not be realised.  Therefore, education about the symptoms is essential.  I was struck by Senator Feeney&rsquo;s contribution and her forthright comments on our need to be open and to overcome any apprehension or embarrassment that we might have regarding this subject.  She also raised a critical issue for us regarding the need to be educated about practical measures that we can undertake to prevent the occurrence of bowel cancer.</P>
        <P>We must promote awareness and education concerning the symptoms.  We must send the message that this applies not only to bowel cancer.  Through BreastCheck and cervical screening, for example, we have been effective in getting the message across to the public about the importance of early detection.  We must ensure that the same message is heard in terms of bowel health.</P>
        <P>Many studies have been undertaken and a great deal of information is available from various institutes, including the European Institute of Women&rsquo;s Health, regarding the factors that contribute to the risk of bowel cancer.  These include age, a family history of bowel cancer, a diet that is high in fat and low in fruit, vegetables and fibre, lack of physical activity, weight, alcohol consumption and smoking.  While early screening is imperative, the situation can be helped by individuals taking care of themselves.</P>
        <P>In a study carried out by the Irish Cancer Society in 2008, 36% of people could not name one sign of bowel cancer while four in ten believed that people under 50 years of age are most at risk of developing bowel cancer when 90% of people diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2005 were over the age of 50.  This finding highlights the need for education.  Without education and awareness, we will not see the potential for screening.  Therefore, education and promotion of the awareness of this fatal disease is crucial.  I commend the Irish Cancer Society on its work this month and support it in its fight against this common type of cancer.</P>
        <P>The Minister of Health and Children, Deputy Harney, asked the board of the National Cancer Screening Service, NCSS, to explore the establishment of a national colorectal cancer screening programme.  I welcome her announcement this afternoon that the report of the NCSS is complete and is expected to be with her in the coming weeks.  I look forward to learning about its contents and recommendations.</P>
<Col N="980"/>
        <P>A key advantage of such a programme is that it can detect pre-cancerous adenoma and is, therefore, a preventive health measure.  In April 2007, the NCSS established an expert group on colorectal screening to make recommendations on a population-based colorectal screening programme.  This group, chaired by Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins, has evaluated the clinical and operational requirements for the establishment of an effective, well organised and quality assured service.</P>
        <P>In 2009, Professor O&rsquo;Higgins remarked that the abundant global evidence &ldquo;indicates that deaths from colorectal cancer, a common and potentially fatal condition in men and women, can be prevented by high-quality screening&rdquo;.  With Professors Wendy Atkin and Robert Steele from the United Kingdom and others, this expert group&rsquo;s clinical recommendations form a basis of a modern, best practice and quality assured screening programme for colorectal cancer.  Furthermore, this expert group noted that screening should be introduced as soon as possible, with a national bowel cancer screening programme to be established by January 2011.  It should be noted the expert group pointed out that through screening, a number of cancers could be found and a number of preventative actions could be taken to reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer.  It also should be noted that England and Scotland are in the process of introducing a similar programme at present.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that a survey carried out by the Irish Cancer Society in July 2008 found that 70% of people definitely would attend screening for bowel cancer, were the Government to offer the service free of charge to all adults over the age of 50.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s role in developing the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, for public patients who have been on waiting lists for more than three months.  Lists of those waiting more than six months for a colonoscopy now have been reduced by more than 80%, which was a crucial step.  Despite the hard economic times the country is experiencing at present, health is an issue that cannot be and will not be ignored by the Government.  Both BreastCheck and the cervical cancer screening programme exemplify how screening and tests are crucial for the well-being of Irish citizens and that they are effective.</P>
        <P>I welcome the funding allocated and the results that have emerged recently from BreastCheck.  All available evidence illustrates that early detection is crucial .  Life is precious and one only gets one shot at it.  As cancer is one of the biggest causes of deaths in our society, screening will help to increase a family&rsquo;s health and well-being, if the diagnosis is detected early.  The most striking and welcome message that can emerge from this debate or from the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s bowel cancer awareness week is one of hope.  Education, prevention, screening and early detection increase our opportunity to enjoy longer the preciousness of life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I dt&uacute;s, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le muintir na h&Eacute;ireann agus go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r, the Irish Cancer Society.  I thank the organisers of Daffodil Day and pay tribute to the many thousands of volunteers who collected money on that day.  In particular, I pay tribute to my local co-ordinator, Breda Ryan, who I know well and who did a great job in organising it.  At the outset, the Irish Cancer Society deserves great thanks for its ability to raise awareness, to educate people and to fund-raise.  I also thank it for the briefing notes it provided to Members in advance of today&rsquo;s debate.  It is important to consider this debate from both a political and a personal perspective.  People must take charge of, and be responsible for, their own health.  That said, it also requires a Government health policy to help them and to make it easier.  I fear this does not always happen in our case.</P>
        <P>Many Members have alluded to the importance of talking, communicating and discussing issues regarding cancer services and cancer in general.  This debate is political in nature because it highlights the lack of action of the Government.  It also has personal implications for the <Col N="981"/>lives of everyone and in many ways it is about life and death.  I approach this debate as a public representative to advocate on behalf of the people.  I also approach it as the son of a mother who died from ovarian cancer and as a friend of many people who have died of bowel cancer.  While it is important that Members should not be overtly politically adversarial about this debate, they must hold to account the Government and the HSE.  As Members are aware, cancer poses one of the greatest threats to the lives of all.  It must be on the political agenda as otherwise, Members are codding themselves and deluding those who are in the Visitors Gallery to support this debate.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Government can spin, talk or use rhetoric but what happened during the Celtic tiger era, when billions of euro were at our disposal?  While I will not discuss them in detail, Members should consider the statistics provided to them for today&rsquo;s debate by the Irish Cancer Society, which deserves great praise for highlighting such statistics.  In the context of this debate, what is the Government&rsquo;s role in, or plan for, raising awareness with which all Members agree in respect of early detection?  What programme does it have for visiting schools and third level colleges to educate through health promotion?  Everyone who deals with people understands and recognises the importance of early cancer detection, going to a general practitioner, getting early referral, the screening programme, recognising the symptoms and of personal awareness.  This a fundamental starting point from which Members should engage.</P>
        <P>Many Members, including Senator Quinn, referred to the issue of men&rsquo;s health.  I hope men&rsquo;s health can be put forward as a major issue before the male segment of our population.  There must be a new focus on men in particular to engage in a preventative programme and in respect of health awareness and on educating.  While everyone is agreed that education is the way forward, I am alarmed by the number of men who do not take their health seriously.  I count myself among them and note that Senator Boyle also referred to himself during his remarks.  However, this mind set must be changed and premature death rates of men must be significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>Why does no colorectal screening programme exist?  What is the date for it and when will it be set?  There are three questions, namely, when, when and when.  This is the second most prevalent cause of cancer death and like other Members, I am amazed that one in three people cannot name a symptom.  It is staggering, alarming and frightening that this statistic exists in this modern age and this issue must be addressed.  Why does Ireland not have a national bowel cancer screening programme?  As Members recognise that screening saves lives, where is such a programme?  Why has it not been unfurled or unleashed?  This question deserves an answer.  Where is the &euro;1 million that is needed to kick-start this programme and why has it not been granted?</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge there is a recession involving cut-backs and that a freeze is in place, this issue pertains to people&rsquo;s lives.  Are Members serious about this?  I am disappointed that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is not present.  While I have great respect for her at one level, I am amazed by the manner in which she gets away with it every time.  Although she makes promises repeatedly, the HSE reform is in shambles.  As for cystic fibrosis, I refer Members to this morning&rsquo;s broadcast of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  People should not be obliged to appear on national radio to talk about their health and the lack of programmes available to them.  I commend Orla Tinsley for having the courage to appear on that radio programme this morning.</P>
        <P>Cervical screening constitutes another example of the Minister&rsquo;s abdication of her responsibility.  As for the bowel cancer strategy under discussion today, where is it?  Are Members talking about people&rsquo;s lives or an agenda in which people&rsquo;s health is put first or are they simply playing to the gallery and playing with bureaucrats?  While I mean no disrespect to anyone, <Col N="982"/>when I hear Civil Service-speak about outcomes, efficiencies, collaboration and a timetable for decentralisation, I become worried because to me, that constitutes gobbledegook.</P>
        <P>I refer to the great work being done by the staff in Marymount Hospice and in St. Bernard&rsquo;s ward in the Bons Secours Hospital, Cork.  The debate should be about the work done by such people, as well as about the effect that cancer has on the thousands of men and women in Ireland who die every year.  This is an outcome, as is recovery.  Members should desist from using words like &ldquo;outcome&rdquo; because this is about people and I am greatly concerned by some of the language used.  Members can discuss education, checking, symptoms, diet and lifestyle, all of which is fine and must be done.  In tandem with so doing, however, there must be action from the Government.  There must be a reduction in the annual rate of 900 deaths and 2,200 diagnoses in Ireland.  We need an early screening programme that is resourced.</P>
        <P>I refer to the comments of Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins: &ldquo;Abundant evidence from all around the globe indicates that deaths from colorectal cancer, a common and potentially fatal condition in men and women, can be prevented by high-quality screening&rdquo;.  I am not an expert, nor a genius, but because both my parents are nurses and taught me the importance of health and the body, if there is something wrong with me I will get it checked.  Thousands of our citizens do not have that confidence, ability and awareness.  When an expert group comes forward with the proposal that screening should be introduced here, and fast, I become concerned when it is not done and no progress is being made.  The Minister of State referred to certain things but this is 2009 and we have had 12 years of the Celtic tiger.  Why was it not done?  We do not have BreastCheck in every county.  Who are we codding?  We are dealing with people.</P>
        <P>I am not being political but I have been in wards where people are looking for help and inspiration.  They expect to find it from the Government and its officials in the Health Service Executive.  When roadblocks are put in their way, it is very difficult when they are angry.  I do not blame those who protest outside the House.  Political action requires leadership and leadership requires early screening and helping people to reduce the number of cancer diagnoses and deaths.  I hope this can be achieved because, if not, all of us have failed the people.</P>

	<P>I welcome this important and timely debate.  I have had two members of my family die from cancer.  One brother died from pulmonary cancer and the other from cancer of the oesophagus.  I understand and appreciate the grave nature of the debate.  In the past 24 hours a young man I knew since I moved to Mullingar has been diagnosed with bowel cancer.  The cold fingers of cancer have touched the hearts and minds of everyone in society.  Every family has been affected in some way.</P>
        <P>Colorectal cancer is a common and lethal disease, the fourth most common cancer in the world and the second most common cause of cancer in Ireland after lung cancer.  The prospects of preventing death from colorectal cancer are now more promising than ever.  Focus on preventing death from cancer has shifted from treatment of established cancer to prevention of cancer in the form of screening.  Screening for breast and cervical cancer is already under way in Ireland under the auspices of the national cancer screening service.  The screening for colorectal cancer is performed in the USA and the UK.</P>
        <P>The basic goal of colorectal cancer screening is to lower the number of people who die from the disease.  This is done by a test that will detect lesions in the bowel that will turn into cancer if left too long.  These lesions, or adenomas, are growths that slowly develop over ten years into <Col N="983"/>cancer.  Some cancers have a similar pre-malignant state making them suitable for screening.  It is not the role of screening to find early or young cancer but rather to find the precursor lesions that can be removed easily and cheaply to remove the risk of cancer to that patient.</P>
        <P>I welcome members of the Irish Cancer Society in the Visitors Gallery and a former Member, Kathleen O&rsquo;Meara, who has a deep and ongoing interest in this matter.  I also welcome Ms Lorna Jennings, who worked in this House in another capacity and is performing an important role with the association.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society is committed to ensuring patients referred for a colonoscopy are seen as quickly as possible because early detection is key to survival.  It is fair to say that, in reference to what Senator Buttimer said, in the previous Seanad I called for and was responsible for a debate on men&rsquo;s health.  I have called for it again recently.</P>
        <P>Men are not as proactive in looking after their health as their female counterparts.  Men look after their cars and bring it for a regular service but they do not visit the general practitioner or the consultant in the same way as women.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>When they do go, it is following encouragement and prompting from the wife, partner, girlfriend, sister or aunt but they are not proactive in looking after their health.  The basis of this debate is being proactive in dealing with cancer.  Bowel cancer is treatable if identified in time.  The ignorance of people of the symptoms associated with the existence of bowel cancer is a worry.  The debate to highlight the incidence of bowel cancer is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to speak on this issue today.  As with all types of cancer, prevention is better than cure but cure is available more than in previous times.  What was absent from the speech of the Minister of State were the symptoms of bowel cancer.  We cannot say this often enough.  We have a forum for people to speak about bowel cancer and to encourage people to come forward if they have the symptoms.  Having read the speech of the Minister of State, I still do not know what the symptoms are.  We must use these opportunities to say what the symptoms are.  We must keep saying what the success rates are, which are gradually improving for men and women.  That addresses the main issue, which is fear.  It does not make a difference whether one is a man or woman.  If people think there is something wrong, the last thing they want to do is go to the doctor and be told there is something wrong, especially if they think it is bad news.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I remember we thought there was something wrong with my father when he stopped swallowing.  He stopped having fries and we did not know what the story was.  Then he stopped having other types of food and we did not know what was wrong.  We all stopped having these foods when he did and only after a certain amount of time and when he could no longer hide it did we discover he had cancer of the oesophagus.  We forced him to go to the doctor because we thought it might be a hiatus hernia but his attitude was that the doctor would get him under the knife soon enough.  He left it too long and, unfortunately, he died of oesophagal cancer.  I refer to the issue of fear and getting the message out that there are more successful treatments and a greater chance of survival if one gets there early.  I have raised this on the Adjournment and on the Order of Business.  The Government made a commitment to a personal health check in the programme for Government.  We should revert to that.</P>
        <P>I do not know if I have anything wrong with me.  I almost go too hard and too fast in this job to stop.  Sometimes when I stop I know I am very tired and blame everything on this.  I <Col N="984"/>might be as healthy as a trout or I may not be but I cannot remember the last time I was at the doctor.  People should be encouraged more.</P>
        <P>I went to college in Belfast and every two years I get a letter from a northern general practitioner asking me to come for a cervical smear.  I must write to the GP to refuse a cervical smear.  The GP must, by law, offer it and I, by law, must write to refuse it and explain why or else take it.  We have a long way to go before everyone has that access to information.  BreastCheck is still not rolled out in an area where breast cancer gets more of an airing than any other cancer.</P>
      
        <P>I have an uncle who was a cardiovascular surgeon and I realise there are other issues.  If I was to convey one other message today it would be that I hope the Minister for Finance will put a significant tariff on cigarettes today.  Not all cancers begin and end with cigarettes but having done much work in the area, I know cigarettes have a very big impact not only on fatal illnesses but with regard to people having to live with very significant illnesses for long periods.  This does not only relate to cancer but is also relevant to stroke and so on.</P>
        <P>I wish the campaign well and I wish a colleague of ours and Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, well.  The more people who can talk about this issue, the better, and we will continue to advocate for early detection and prevention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also glad to have the opportunity to take part in this debate and I would like to take up something which my colleague, Senator Keaveney, said in reference to a Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen.  I commend him on his courage as this is quite a private and sensitive matter.  It took courage for him to come out and say that he had this form of cancer.  This will encourage people to get screened.  It was a very important and courageous act and we should salute it.</P>
        <P>Speaker after speaker has said that we all seem to have been supplied with the same statistics but there is no harm in repeating them.  There may be no active harm but it is a pain in the fanny.  It does not do much good because what do we have for an audience?  We have distinguished people from the Irish Cancer Society and former Senator O&rsquo;Meara.  Although they may take up some of the ideas we have, it is unlikely to be covered by the broadcast media.  Perhaps it will be by one person.  I do not see much point in repeating the statistics, although the incidence and late diagnosis is very worrying.</P>
        <P>Like some of my colleagues, I will speak from personal experience, as my oldest school friend died of cancer of the colon on Friday night and I will be at his funeral tomorrow.  I learned an enormous amount from him, primarily about the very high standards in Irish nursing and the remarkable facilities we have.  We must bear in mind that there are a several matters that are important from the patient&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
        <P>This was particularly difficult for him because he was a very gentlemanly person, although not in any effete way, as he was quite a masculine man.  He was refined, fastidious and disliked anything to do with mess or unpleasantness.  It was terribly ironic that this horrible illness should have struck him in that area of the body.  One must be sensitive but I learned an enormous amount and my life has been enriched by the six or eight weeks that he lived since the diagnosis.</P>
        <P>I saw the way somebody in considerable distress could face with dignity a judicious approach to everything, with kindness and understanding for the people and friends around him who were distressed by this illness.  I also learned that it is sometimes selfish and cruel to try to persuade people to take the chance of prolonging their lives with chemotherapy.  This man had seen his sister and other relatives die awfully in the same way.</P>
<Col N="985"/>
        <P>Things have improved and I have let positive issues out in order to keep both options open.  Eventually my friend went for chemotherapy and it seemed to be doing an enormous amount of good.  I do not know whether it was because chemotherapy was so severe as to weaken the wall of the bowel but there was a rupture and he had to have invasive surgery, which was very unpleasant.  Two days later he had a massive heart attack in the intensive care unit.  I am quite glad for him because that was the best outcome.</P>
        <P>I am glad that he took the chance of having chemotherapy but in those matters it is a question for the individual.  It is unfair when somebody has what is very probably a terminal illness to bully them, either family or surgeons.  Doctors should be very careful about what they say.  For example, it is not helpful to say when somebody has been operated on that a stent was inserted into a liver, for example, to drain poison but the spread or severity of the cancer is much worse than first thought.  I am not accusing the particular surgeon in this case and there were other elements involved.  It can have a depressing effect to be told that so bluntly.</P>
        <P>When people say they are dealing with such issues every day, it is meant to be helpful but it is not, because each individual diagnosis and progress towards death is quite personal and unique.  My friend was extraordinarily lucky because he had a very strong religious faith, which I happen to share.  That cannot be overestimated because it is as good as or better than the drugs, although I do not undervalue drugs.  We must consider such options.</P>
        <P>We must also understand that apparently small issues such as diet are very important.  When people are at that stage they must be allowed eat whatever they want.  They do not need to be told that they should eat this, that or the other.  They should be left at it.</P>
        <P>Looking at the broader scheme, I have been aware since I was a student of bowel cancer because one of my great pals was a medical student.  She told me the story of a young man, just married, who had bowel cancer.  I asked if anything could be done and she told me it was too late, which was awful.  We know the old phrase that justice delayed is justice denied but screening denied is fatal.</P>
        <P>I will put on record some comparative statistics.  We have cervical screening, which costs &euro;42 million and breast screening at a cost of &euro;24 million.  The cost of bowel screening would be &euro;14 million or &euro;15 million, which is comparatively small.  Considering the first two figures I mentioned &mdash; they were not put on the record before &mdash; deal only with one very valued half of the human race, women, bowel cancer screening would get twice the value, and it would pay for itself inside five years.  The Minister of State would know better than I do that we are approaching a five-year plan, according to the Taoiseach.  Let us consider including in the five-year plan this financially sound approach to medicine.</P>
        <P>We understand 70% of people would attend for bowel screening, which is a very high rate.  I have certain intestinal difficulties and although I do not believe they are cancerous, we are trying to find out what is going on.  I have had things stuck in everywhere.  The minute I felt a bit awkward, I went to the doctor as I do not give a damn and I have absolutely no shame.  I got on to the problem straight away and had a colonoscopy immediately.  This was because I am on Plan E in the VHI; I was not going to give my place to another person as I am not that much of a Christian.</P>
        <P>However, that is not appropriate and in matters of life and death we should not have a two-tier system.  We need to do what we can to reduce this problem, as a four-week result system is the best.  We still have people waiting more than six months, which can do real damage to their health.  We need investment in more gastroenterologists.  Prevention is possible, although not in all cases, if people have a good diet, watch their weight and enjoy pleasures moderately with not too much smoking and drinking.</P>
<Col N="986"/>
        <P>Will the Minister of State be kind enough to pass on to his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harney, a message from all sides of the House concerning cystic fibrosis?  I raise this because we were invited to do so by the Leader, Senator Cassidy.  When we tried to raise the matter this morning, he said we would have an opportunity to do it when the Minister for Health came to the House.  She is not here so I hope the Minister of State does not think it inappropriate for me to ask him to carry the message to her that we are all thrilled that this commitment has been given.</P>
        <P>It is very difficult to believe that any builder will engage in a major building programme in this way.  May we have facts, figures and a commitment to a commencement date?  It would be cruel in the extreme to deceive people with cystic fibrosis.  Will the Minister of State use his good offices to persuade the Minister, Deputy Harney, to come into the House to give us a clear and cast-iron commitment on the matter?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss bowel cancer awareness.  How great is the problem of bowel cancer?  The answer is that it is massive.  Some 900 people die from bowel cancer each year.  That is the same as the combined number who die as a result of suicide and road accidents.  We hear a great deal about suicide and road accidents, and anything that ends the lives of 900 people must be dealt with and taken seriously.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Irish Cancer Society and former Senator Kathleen O&rsquo;Meara on raising our awareness of this issue.  As previous speakers stated, the leaflet provided by the Irish Cancer Society is extremely effective.  Many Members indicated their surprise at the lack of awareness among people of the symptoms of bowel cancer, but I am not one bit surprised.  I worked in health promotion and health education for many years but I was not aware of those symptoms because this issue received no attention.  The level of awareness is extremely low and 36% of people cannot name one sign or symptom of bowel cancer.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society is doing the right thing by devoting one month to promote awareness of this issue.  Holding awareness days or weeks is somewhat of a joke because these are usually over by the time one realises that they were being held in the first instance.  The society is taking the correct approach.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers highlighted the statistics relating to this matter and the need for a national screening programme.  Two issues arise with regard to personal health.  Every individual should take responsibility for his or her health, but we know that this does not happen.  It certainly cannot happen if one is not aware of the symptoms in the first instance.  We are aware that screening programmes work and they are needed wherever a public health issue arises.  If 900 deaths are taking place each year from bowel cancer and if only 2% of those who contract it survive, Ireland has a monstrous public health issue with this disease.</P>
        <P>I accept that the Minister for Health and Children has many priorities at present, particularly in light of the state of our national finances, but any disease that is taking 900 lives each year must be tackled.  It would only cost &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million to establish a national screening programme and such a programme would pay for itself within five years.  A national screening programme will probably have paid for itself before Ireland emerges from the current recession.</P>
        <P>In the absence of a screening programme, two steps must be taken immediately.  First, the Department must make plans to launch a media campaign to raise public awareness so that people will take responsibility for their health, attend their GPs and seek colonoscopies.  The <Col N="987"/>second step which must be taken is that, as Senator Keaveney stated, each person should be given the right to a personal health check.</P>
        <P>Medical error is prevalent when in terms of pathology.  At the relevant laboratory in Galway, there have been two examples of medical error in the past two years whereby a pathologist got the results wrong on a second occasion.  That is outrageous.  If we cannot have faith in the system and trust the results provided by laboratories in this country, how can we have confidence in the health system?  Medical error has serious implications for people&rsquo;s health.  However, if one considers the trend, it appears that locums are causing the problem.  Why are background checks not carried out in respect of locums?  In the case of one fifth of locums hired in this country, references are not checked and in one third of cases, interviews are not carried out.  Is this not a sign that the health system is, for want of a better description, all over the place?  Decisions are rushed and patients&rsquo; safety is placed at risk as a result.</P>
        <P>The most recent difficulties in Galway, in respect of two late diagnoses and one unnecessary intervention, would not have come to light had they not been identified by the UK National Health Service.  Where are the checks and balances in our health system?  As much as there is a need to promote bowel cancer awareness and to put in place a screening programme, there is also a need for reliable pathology.  As a report published in 2002 indicated, there is need for an ongoing review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I thank the Irish Cancer Society for providing Members with such comprehensive information in respect of this matter.  The poster contained in our information packs is extremely good.</P>
        <P>The briefing material we received indicates that people are dying because they are embarrassed to take steps to ensure the health of their bowels.  Bowel cancer is the most treatable of cancers but it is regrettable that for most people bowel cancer is only detected in the second, third or fourth stages, when the damage has been done.  As a result, survival rates are not as high as should be the case.</P>
        <P>A close friend of mine who was in her early 50s died from bowel cancer.  She was one of the lucky ones because she had access to private health care and was a medic so she was aware of how to handle her routine screening.  It is outrageous that people in this country do not have access to regular screening.  There must be universal screening for colorectal cancer.  It is extraordinary that bowel cancer is not diagnosed until the disease has reached the latter stages.</P>
        <P>I worked in a doctor&rsquo;s surgery and am aware that people are extremely private when it comes to their health.  People should not be afraid or embarrassed to consult their GP if they believe they are at risk.  Not eating properly, being overweight and smoking contribute to poor health.  People&rsquo;s lives are so stressful nowadays that they are obliged to eat on the run.  In addition, they do not eat enough vegetables and they consume considerable quantities of processed food.  These are strong contributory factors for bowel cancer.</P>
        <P>When we are young, we believe that we will live forever and that our health is perfect.  If the Government did more to highlight the need for annual screening in respect of bowel cancer, this would encourage people to take care of their health.  There would not, as a result, be over 900 deaths from this disease each year, particularly if it was diagnosed in the first stage.  It is imperative that, as is the case with cervical cancer, there be annual screening in respect of bowel cancer, which is the second most common form of the disease in Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board the points I have made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue and conclude the debate.  I thank all the <Col N="988"/>speakers for their insight, empathy and particularly the encouragement given to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, in his bravery in highlighting the issue.  Senator Glynn pointed out that men are not great at acknowledging their vulnerability at times and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has done much work in that regard.  It would have been easy for him to absorb the benefits of the medical system and of his treatment without giving anything back and for him to show that courage in the face of adversity is something many speakers highlighted, and I would like to add my voice to that as well.</P>
        <P>The type of cancer we are referring to is of a relatively high incidence in this country.  It is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer here.  As this is bowel cancer awareness month, so designated by the Irish Cancer Society, it gives us all an opportunity to reflect on that.  The society will be delighted to know that I have the poster in my constituency office in Blackrock.  I thank it for circulating that and I hope that taking this initiative will serve the general population well.</P>
        <P>I congratulate John McCormack and his team, who are present, for all the work they have done on behalf of sufferers and in raising awareness.  I thank them for the many briefings they have given to me and other Members of the Oireachtas over the years.  I know they have more than one item of interest in the proceedings of the Oireachtas today, and I wish them luck in all those matters as well.</P>
        <P>For those patients who are referred by their general practitioner for further investigations following the noticing of symptoms, there is a need for speedy access to diagnostic procedures including colonoscopies, and while the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harney, acknowledged pressures in this area, the Minister, Deputy Harney, has requested the Health Service Executive to ensure that all those patients who require urgent access to colonoscopies should be seen promptly.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that waiting times have fallen considerably in the past 12 months.  For those waiting longer than three months it is down by almost half.  However, it is without question that great improvement must be made in this area in terms of waiting times.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has been requested to arrange colonoscopies for any patient waiting more than three months.  At the same time, the HSE is working to address service pressures in this area to further reduce waiting times.  Of all patients referred for colonoscopies only a small proportion will be diagnosed with cancer but for those who are, the next step is access to the most appropriate treatment, delivered within a framework that maximises optimal outcome.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I take this opportunity to mention the national cancer control programme and the work it is doing in the reorganisation of cancer services here generally.  It is important to acknowledge the considerable progress made in the implementation of this programme under the directorship of Professor Tom Keane.  It is also worth noting that additional funding for this programme was allocated during 2009 despite the obvious circumstances in which we find ourselves generally.</P>
        <P>Regarding colorectal cancer in particular, there is widespread agreement that rectal cancer surgery must be performed by surgeons who specialise in this area.  Following the first national audit of rectal cancer services requested by the programme, the number of hospitals where rectal cancer surgery is performed will be reduced significantly to 14 in the first instance, before being centralised further to eight.  It is notable that the Irish Society of Coloproctology backed this proposal, and I believe there is not much dispute about the benefits that will accrue to the general population by the carrying out of this type of surgery in designated centres.  In regard to colon cancer, similarly, there will be a requirement to reduce the number of hospitals where <Col N="989"/>this type of surgery is performed.  The programme will continue to engage with the society in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society is widely acknowledged as Ireland&rsquo;s primary cancer charity and has done enormous work fund-raising, in addition to the items mentioned earlier.  Along with the Minister, Deputy Harney, I welcome its initiative in regard to this awareness month.</P>
        <P>As much as it is vital to be aware of the symptoms, it is also very important from the point of view of prevention that people should be aware of the risk factors for colorectal cancers.  Senator Keaveney raised the issue, as did others, of the symptoms.  I understand that symptoms include blood in a stool, loss of weight and tiredness and the obvious recommendation, if any of those are noticed, is to refer to one&rsquo;s general practitioner without delay.</P>
        <P>It must be noted that some of the risk factors cannot be avoided.  Approximately 5% of those diagnosed with colorectal cancer have an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer, and another 15% to 20% of patients are at increased risk because of family history.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers referred to lifestyle factors and the importance of prevention over cure.  They referred to obesity and lack of exercise, the failure to maintain a proper diet and smoking, which is at the heart of so much of our cancer problem.  By addressing all of those factors, to which Senators Corrigan and Keaveney referred, we can help to reduce our own risk of developing this disease.  People are rightly political in this House and because it is a political House there tends to be an over-emphasis on the failure of the Government rather than the responsibility of the population in general, but that is part and parcel of the manner of the debates we have here.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised the issue of the errors in laboratories in Galway.  It is worth noting that those errors occurred in 2004 and 2005, since when the Faculty of Pathology has developed protocols that have been adopted generally by the HSE in hospital laboratories.  New procedures have been adopted since the end of last year for the recruitment and monitoring of locums.  References are always checked for locums.  These developments have occurred since those errors came to light.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked when a decision would be made about a national colorectal screening programme.  The Minister requested the board of the National Cancer Screening Service to advise on the introduction of a population based screening programme for colorectal cancer.  It was anticipated that the advice would include who should be screened, at what intervals screening should take place and the type of screening test that should be used.  This expert report was submitted by the board to the Minister last December.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Health Information Quality Authority was asked to conduct a health technology assessment on a colorectal screening programme.  The Minister understands this assessment has been completed and will be submitted to her shortly, at which time she will give further consideration to the introduction of a screening programme and the resources necessary for that.  Many speakers, including Senator Norris, referred to the obvious economic benefits in the long term from the rollout of the screening programme, which I do not believe anybody will dispute.</P>
        <P>I again commend the role of the Irish Cancer Society in promoting public awareness of colorectal cancer.  The Government remains committed to enhancing diagnostic and treatment services for patients with colorectal cancer, and I am confident that survival rates for patients will continue to improve.</P>

	<P>It would be helpful if the Minister of State could arrange for a copy of his speech to be sent to the spokespeople.</P>
        <P>The point the majority of speakers made is that there is not a national colorectal screening programme in Ireland.  An expert report has been published which recommends that there should be screening but as yet we do not have a timeframe, nor do we have a funding decision to begin the preliminary work.  The question is when the national cancer screening service will get the go-ahead to begin preliminary work on this, which I understand involves an allocation of some money.  A total of &euro;1 million has been mentioned as the amount needed to begin the process.  Can the Minister of State give the House any more information on whether the decision will be progressed?  It is a question about decision making in this area at this stage.  It is clear there is goodwill and the information.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel on it because other countries have done this, and we know how to move forward.  The question is whether the Minister has any information.  Will the national cancer screening service get a decision, some financial provision and a timeline to begin the work towards developing a national screening programme?  Does the Minister intend making a decision shortly on the health technology assessment, which report she will get very soon?  Will that decision be made this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>General practitioners have a pivotal role to play in this area, and a number of them are doing that.  On the lack of attention Members of my gender pay to their own health, it is important that GPs encourage their patients of a certain age, say those over 40 or 45, to have a colonoscopy in view of the fact that, as was pointed out by a number of speakers, most people are unaware of at least one symptom or any symptoms that can indicate they have bowel cancer.  It is important that GPs advise their patients in a certain age category to have a colonoscopy.  There are many thousands of people walking around with type 2 diabetes who have no idea they have it and the same situation pertains to bowel cancer.  General practitioners should play a role here and the Minister of State should exhort them to encourage patients to arrange a colonoscopy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>While I agree with Senator Glynn about the responsibility of GPs, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has issued frightening statistics showing that 164 people are on a waiting list for a colonoscopy as of 19 March.

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter to ask the Minister to explain the status of a self-appointed limited company in the electrical business &mdash; EPACE, with PACE referring to pensions and conditions electrical &mdash; and to query its right to see electrical contractors&rsquo; books and refer them to the Labour Court under the guise of a registered employment agreement.  My questions relate to the proposed Employment Law Compliance Bill.  I will give a brief outline of what has been happening within the electrical contracting sector in recent years.  It has been brought to my attention by electrical contractors in Galway city and county.</P>
        <P>A company called EPACE, pensions and conditions electrical, was formed in 2007 to monitor rates of pay and conditions for electricians.  This is a private limited company with some of the directors also being trade union officials of the TEEU, the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union.  It is allegedly funded out of the union contributions paid by electricians, apparently without their knowledge or consent.  The company without any mandate or statutory right has been hounding contractors in Galway city and county to allow office inspections by its staff to examine records of all electricians and apprentices relative to a registered employment agreement, of which the majority of contractors are only now becoming aware.</P>
        <P>While most of the smaller electrical contractors are really struggling at present and finding it impossible to get paid for work done, EPACE appears to have a very healthy bank balance of allegedly &euro;800,000 and its constitution provides that it may pay to its management and directors whatever gratuity payments it wishes.  What type of behaviour is this?  It appears to be more jobs for the boys.  I am aware of an electrical contractor who has been deeply affected by the EPACE company.  He told me: &ldquo;I received advice not to allow this private limited company access to our books.  I now find myself hauled before the Labour Court as this company, through the union, passed on information about us.  This is all I need at a time when I am struggling to meet wages bills, not to mention suppliers&rsquo; bills.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>At present, it appears that the Government is about to hand over statutory power to these people to govern the industry when there is already another body in place, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  Why is another monitoring body required?  It is also worth noting that in recent years a huge amount of the larger contracts were awarded to Northern Ireland contractors as the registered employment agreement does not apply to them.</P>
        <P>What is the status of EPACE?  What rights does it have and is the Government supporting its intervention in this manner?  It is having a hugely negative impact on businesses.  Does it have the right to see electrical contractors&rsquo; books and to refer them to the Labour Court under the guise of a registered employment agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The company to which the Senator refers, EPACE, is a private company, which is limited by guarantee and established under the aegis of the National Joint Industrial Council <Col N="992"/>for the Electrical Contracting Industry by employer and worker representatives.  Its main objective is to advise electrical contractors of their responsibilities under the registered employment agreement, REA, for the electrical industry and it also carries out inspections of electrical contractors to ensure compliance with the agreement.</P>
        <P>While the organisation does not have statutory authority under employment rights legislation to undertake such inspections, electrical contractors in the past have been willing to facilitate, and co-operate with, these arrangements.  I am not in a position to comment in detail regarding the operations of EPACE Limited because it is a private limited company and neither my Department nor I have a role, representation or interest in it.  It is an arrangement that was established by the parties to the registered employment agreement.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out, by way of background, that a registered employment agreement, REA, is a collective agreement arrived at in one of two ways.  It may be made between a trade union or unions and an individual employer or employers&rsquo; organisation or, alternatively, it may be made by a registered joint industrial council.  Such an agreement relates to the pay or conditions of employment of any class, type or group of workers and has been registered with the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  The effect of registration is to make the provisions of an REA binding not only on the trade unions and employers involved in its negotiation but also on others who were not party to its negotiation but who are in the categories covered by the agreement.</P>
        <P>In general, an REA can deal with any matter that comes under the general heading of pay or conditions of employment.  It may provide for the variation of any of its provisions.  Each REA must contain a disputes procedure that is binding.  The registration of employment agreements, such as the electrical contracting industry REA, is a matter for the Labour Court, as provided for in the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  It is important to state that I do not have any role either in regard to the registration of registered employment agreements.</P>
        <P>As with other REAs, enforcement of the provisions of the REA for the electrical sector is effected through the Labour Court under the industrial relations legislation.  I understand the Labour Court recently considered an application to cancel the registration of the agreement covering the electrical contracting sector and that the application was rejected by the court.  Accordingly, the REA remains a minimum legal standard for the sector, against which failure to comply is an offence.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is the body charged with promoting and ensuring compliance with employment rights legislation, including those statutory rights derived from registered employment agreements.  Under the Industrial Relations Act 1990, NERA inspectors are empowered to inspect records, recover arrears and, if necessary, institute civil proceedings on behalf of workers if they are not receiving the minimum pay and conditions of employment laid down in an REA.</P>
        <P>While NERA currently does not have a formal relationship with EPACE, it does investigate complaints referred to it by any person and, in so doing, it may also examine information furnished by EPACE on alleged breaches of the REA for the electrical contracting sector.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to section 45 of the Employment Law Compliance Bill, as published last year.  It is intended to support and enhance monitoring and inspection activity in regard to compliance with the REA in the electrical contracting industry.  This section gives legal effect to commitments entered into under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, to complement the work of NERA on compliance with the REA in the electrical contracting sector.</P>
<Col N="993"/>
        <P>Specifically, the Bill provides that the director of NERA can enter into a service agreement with bodies as may be approved by the director of NERA with the consent of the Minister.  The service agreement would prescribe the operational arrangements to obtain between NERA and the approved body regarding the conduct by that body of inspection activity in regard to the electrical REA.  In essence, the provision gives legal standing to the relationship between NERA and any such approved body.</P>
        <P>Section 45, as drafted, does not prevent any individual pursuing his or her legal entitlements through NERA or any of the employment rights bodies.  It simply recognises that, in the case of the electrical contracting sector, there are specific arrangements on the administration of the REA that predate the establishment of NERA and which were put in place by the parties to the REA themselves.</P>
        <P>The Bill as published does not envisage any prosecutorial role for any approved body and that role will continue as currently through NERA or the other employment rights bodies or by the parties to the REA.  In that sense, the Bill does not propose different enforcement standards for the REA in the electrical sector compared with those that obtain in other sectors.  I am aware there are different views within the electrical contracting sector on the role of EPACE and the value of the registered employment agreements.  I am open to hearing such views in the context of the Employment Law Compliance Bill and I am equally interested in hearing the views of Senators on the subject.  I am sure there will be ample opportunity to debate this issue in greater detail when the Bill comes to this House, which I expect will be before the summer.</P>
        <P>This issue was raised a number of times in the context of the Second Stage D&aacute;il debate on the Employment Law Compliance Bill.  Various views were expressed and this issue was raised forcefully.  We will have ample opportunity to discuss it and we can listen to the arguments put forward by Oireachtas Members on the issue.</P>

	<P>May I ask a supplementary question?</P>

	<P>A brief one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how much further advanced I am in my understanding.  The Minister of State said, &ldquo;Under the Industrial Relations Act 1990, NERA inspectors are empowered to inspect records, recover arrears and, if necessary, institute civil proceedings on behalf of workers&rdquo;.  Can EPACE do that and who gave it the authority?  I accept it is a private company but can EPACE do what it is currently doing to electrical contractors?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>An agreement was reached between employers and employees that were party to the registered employment agreement for the electrical sector to the effect that a private limited company would be set up with the consent of the industry.  There are views among electrical contractors that it does not have that authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>From what I can see it is acting like a bully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>In effect, it is with the consent of the industry but NERA is the advocate in the context of pay or conditions not being met by employers.  It would take the cases and it would have the prosecutorial role in any event.  Equally, the Bill as drafted &mdash; it has only completed Second Stage in the other House &mdash; states that a service agreement could be entered into between the National Employment Rights Authority and a body such as EPACE for it to carry out the inspections on behalf of NERA.  Most importantly, NERA would take any case in the context of civil proceedings.</P>

	<P>This Adjournment matter relates to dermatology services for the people of Longford-Westmeath.  I fear that the consultant who has left will not be replaced.  I attended a meeting in Mullingar organised by the Health Service Executive for Oireachtas Members.  We are very proud of the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  According to recent ratings, it is one of the top three hospitals in Ireland.  Sadly, there is a consistent threat to services in the Mullingar area.</P>
        <P>The consultant dermatologist left last February.  There was very little incentive for her to stay.  She had a part-time secretary, a part-time nurse, no registrar, no SHO and no infrastructure.  There was no phototherapy, which is necessary to treat people with skin problems.  Essentially, there was no goodwill within the HSE to support her.</P>
        <P>As a junior Member of the Seanad I have experienced a similar situation in regard to a few services in the hospital.  Colposcopy services are being downgraded and we will probably lose them.  An acute mental health unit has never been developed.  We had to fight tooth and nail to get a sexual assault unit, even though we have first-rate obstetrics and gynaecology.  We also have an excellent paediatric unit.  I fear that all these services are being downgraded in favour of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency and the hospital in Tullamore.  That is an outrage.</P>
        <P>I raise this serious issue because people are coming from as far away as Roscrea and Kildare to the hospital in Mullingar.  How can we encourage highly qualified consultants to come to Mullingar if we do not put the services in place?  We need to provide attractive positions.  We have a wonderful facility in Mullingar.  It is an hour from Dublin and it offers a great quality of life for such consultants, yet we do not put in place the requirements needed by a consultant such as a second consultant to provide support for time off.  I have made my point clearly so I will hand over to Senator Glynn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach will recall that I made these points on the Order of Business on at least two occasions.  I lobbied hard to get a dermatology service for Mullingar and I succeeded in doing so.  It is true that the resources available to the person appointed were insufficient.  The reason given was insufficient financial resources, yet when the person in question left, resources suddenly could be found to recruit two dermatologists.  Having spoken to an individual from the Health Service Executive, I note a question mark was placed over the location of the dermatology service.</P>
        <P>When I lobbied successfully for the provision of a dermatology service, it was stated to me there would be a department of dermatology for Mullingar.  Since then, I have spoken to the chief executive officer of the HSE, Professor Brendan Drumm, and impressed upon him the importance of retaining the service in Mullingar.  Not doing so sends out all the wrong signals.  This has nothing to do with the fact that the Taoiseach is from 22 miles down the road.  The health service is operated by the HSE.  If one tables a motion pertaining to any given health service, one will be told the Minister has no direct responsibility as it is a matter for the HSE.  That said, it sends out the wrong signal to the staff of the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar, which is among the top three hospitals, as I have stated <i>ad nauseam</i> in this Chamber.  The sustained efforts of all the staff will be dealt a body blow if the dermatology service is lost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Statistics pertaining to all the services in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar show it is a very high performing hospital and that the amount of sick leave and other leave taken is not as high as in other hospitals in the region.  An in-depth examination must be carried out <Col N="995"/>because the hospital has provided the goods and done the job.  All we are saying now is that what we have, we hold, and that we want the services in the hospital augmented further.  Although Ireland and the rest of the world are experiencing a difficult time, I am not prepared to accept the circumstances that obtain.  A communication I received from a relative in Canada yesterday indicates that, contrary to what is being said, that country is not immune to the downturn.</P>
        <P>In any event, the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar has a long and proud history of health service provision.  It was one of the top hospitals nationally in terms of student graduates when it was a training hospital.  Operating in tandem with the dermatology service, the psychiatric service and all the others, there is a psychiatry of later life unit, which is one of the most successful in the country and the only one in the midlands.  We have a lot of firsts to our credit.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence and Senator McFadden for sharing her time.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator McFadden for tabling this matter on the Adjournment and for sharing her time so generously with Senator Glynn.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who sends her apologies for not being present.</P>
        <P>The Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar provides an extensive range of acute services to the population of Dublin and the midlands, especially to people in the Longford-Westmeath area.  The Government has shown its commitment to the hospital by way of the capital improvements it has supported in recent years.  Recent developments at the hospital have seen the bed complement increase from 215 to 244.  The developments include the fitting out of the existing ward shells to provide a new paediatric ward, a new day surgery and gynaecology ward, a new obstetric ward and a new medical ward incorporating an acute stroke unit; refurbishment of the existing paediatric and obstetric wards to provide surgical and medical wards and a palliative care unit; and the extension of the existing facilities to accommodate an interim special care baby unit adjacent to the new paediatric ward.  I am pleased that these works have been completed and that the ward areas are now fully operational.  Approval was granted for the refurbishment of two further wards in the existing hospital: a medical-surgical ward and a delivery-gynaecology ward.  This work is due to be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>The first consultant dermatologist for the midlands was appointed to the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar in September 2007.  However, the consultant resigned from her post in February and the Health Service Executive has since advertised for a locum replacement.</P>
        <P>The HSE also allocated funding to allow for the further expansion of the service for the midlands.  In the interim, the executive will seek to recruit a locum dermatologist to continue the service at Mullingar.  The HSE is also seeking to put in place short-term alternative arrangements outside the region for the continuing provision of services for patients, where necessary.  The HSE will continue to ensure that a high-quality dermatology service is available to the people of the midlands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said, &ldquo;The HSE also allocated funding to allow for the further expansion of the service for the midlands.&rdquo;  This explains all.  I asked that the service be provided in Mullingar hospital.  Therefore, the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply did not really answer my question.  Will he ask the Minister for Health and Children for further clari<Col N="996"/>fication on providing high-quality dermatology services for Mullingar hospital in the midlands rather than for anywhere else?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>To reiterate, in the interim, the HSE will seek to recruit a locum dermatologist to continue the service at Mullingar.  I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s views on long-term provision to the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>

	<P>On a sad note, the young garda who was hit by a car in Donegal earlier this month died this evening.  This is an awful blow for everyone concerned.  The man had very close connections with my area.  While I realise it may not be in order to do so, I extend my sympathy to the Garda force and to all the family and friends of the young garda.</P>
        <P>I want to raise the issue of the Mosquito device, which in some respects is as much a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as it is for the Department of Health and Children.  Therefore, the matter does not come directly within the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  Nevertheless, I am glad he is present to address the matter.</P>
        <P>The Mosquito device is a device that emits a high-frequency, high-pitched sound which, unfortunately, none of us in this room will ever hear because our hearing has deteriorated to such an extent that we can no longer hear sounds at such a pitch.  We are born with an ability to hear at a certain frequency but, as we age, this frequency changes.</P>
        <P>The difficulty at present is that the device is being used to stop anti-social behaviour.  Many shops are using the device to try to stop children from congregating, usually at the shop front.  A county council, for example, could use the device to prevent youths from congregating.  This is especially the case in England.</P>
        <P>At a recent Council of Europe committee meeting in Molina in Spain, I was asked to raise this issue with European Youth Forum representatives and the policymakers from the Directorate of Youth and Sport.  There was complete agreement that this is a human rights issue.  It is assumed by those installing the devices in their premises that all youth are up to no good.  It sends out a strong message that youths cannot congregate.  The device is perceived to oppose the right of young people to free movement.</P>
      
        <P>It goes beyond that.  From the age of 20 upwards, one is unlikely to hear the sound emitted by the device, but it can be heard by some between 20 and 30.  After 30, one definitely cannot hear it.  Therefore, adults are installing it to terrorise children.  However, the adults installing it cannot hear it themselves.  They do not know what they are inflicting on the youths.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It seems that in some places where it is operated, and it has been operated in my constituency and other places throughout Ireland, people have refused to enter the shops.  I know of a case in England where people withdrew from the only shop in a village which was using this device.  Parents were told by teenagers that they developed pains in their ears when they were near the shop.  The parents refused to use the shop and withdrew their custom.  Very quickly, the shop withdrew the Mosquito device and replaced it with what Senator Quinn laughingly suggested he used when he had a chain of supermarkets, namely, classical music.  This served the same purpose.  People did not tend to congregate and yet it was not an overt attack on the children&rsquo;s senses.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, may have a few children under six.  Older children can articulate there is a problem but until they can speak in sentences, children will not be able to explain that they are hearing an awful sound.  If one lets go a child&rsquo;s hand to pay for what <Col N="997"/>one is purchasing or examine what one wants to buy, the child can disappear because the goal of the Mosquito device is to stop children from being there.  A toddler will try to get away from the sound as soon as one frees him or her.  He or she does not have the capacity to articulate what is the problem and a parent over the age of 30 will not hear it and will not know there is a problem.  A question mark is raised as to whether it is a problem for the unborn child, the foetus in the womb, in terms of whether it can hear or whether the umbilical fluid prevents it.</P>
        <P>There are other ways to deal with this.  In England, where children were congregating at an underpass the local council installed a pink light which showed up acne.  It was a different approach to this problem but was very effective.  There are imaginative solutions that do not necessarily impact as cruelly or dangerously or in a way which violates human rights.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that other countries used a variation of this with a different frequency which could be heard by everyone and did not discriminate.  It was used as a form of torture.  If we do not stop and act now to prohibit or regulate this it is only a matter of time before the right of people to congregate and the right to free speech could be impacted by people introducing variations of the Mosquito device.</P>
        <P>The Council of Europe is compiling a report and the vice-chair of the committee is responsible for it.  A questionnaire was circulated to the Minister for his response.  We have not responded and many other countries have.  Being in the position I am in, I ask that we respond officially.  Since I raised this issue through the media I have received staunch supporting legal and other advice from various youth sector representatives throughout the country at national and local level.</P>

	<P>I wish to express my sympathies to the family of Garda McCallion and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the very tragic news of his passing. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform apologises as he is unable to be present.  The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the device referred to by Senator Keaveney.  It is designed to deter people from congregating or loitering in certain areas by generating a near ultrasonic tone which, it is claimed, does not cause physical damage or pain but becomes highly annoying.  It is claimed that because of natural age related hearing loss, the majority of those over the age of 30 only just hear or are aware of the noise.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 creates the offence of assault, which is committed by the application of force.  The section specifies that &ldquo;force&rdquo; includes application of, <i>inter alia</i>, noise.  The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that an instruction has issued to all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that any complaints received regarding the use of such devices are to be the subject of investigation and an investigation file submitted to the law officers for directions as to what charges, if any, are to be preferred.</P>
        <P>The Minster and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are aware of the damage and distress which anti-social behaviour causes communities.  The Garda policing plan for 2009 reflects the priorities set for the force by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one of which is to preserve peace and public order in co-operation with local communities, in particular by targeting disorder arising from binge drinking.  It contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour, and one of the strategic goals identified in the plan is to reduce significantly the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in communities.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse, which is often at the root of crime and anti-social behaviour, and its effect on public order, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late-night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 brought into force additional legislation to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  In January 2007 behav<Col N="998"/>iour warnings and civil orders were introduced for adults, and in March 2007 behaviour warnings, good behaviour contracts and behaviour orders were introduced for children.</P>
        <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda to tackle the misuse of alcohol.  The Act places restrictions on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse.  Garda&iacute; may seize any bottle or container from a person under the age of 18 and which a garda suspects contains alcohol to be consumed by a person under 18 in a public place.  They may also seize bottles or containers containing alcohol where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  The Act also allows for the issue of fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place, which are offences under sections 4 and 5 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</P>
        <P>The Irish youth justice service is an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and works with the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It is responsible for leading and driving reform in the youth justice area.  In addition, it funds organisations and projects providing services, including Garda and probation service projects, to young people aged under 18 years who find themselves in conflict with the law.</P>
        <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme, operated by Garda juvenile liaison officers, has proved to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  It also enables referral to the Garda youth diversion projects which are funded by the youth justice service and are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives operating separately from the diversion programme.  At present, 100 of these projects operate in various locations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that the Minister and the Garda authorities will continue to attach the highest priority to tackling anti-social behaviour, and the legislative provisions dealing with anti-social behaviour are kept under continuing review by the Department.  I will express the views expressed by the Senator on the ultrasonic high-pitched noise equipment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  The answer &mdash; which I accept came from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; concentrated on the need to explore alternative methods that can be deployed to target anti-social behaviour.  However, I have a report which is specific and is asking whether we are looking at the human rights violations posed by use of the Mosquito device, and at the need for the regulation or prohibition of that device.  I would be happy to get a written response, but I ask that the Minister of State bring it to the Department&rsquo;s attention that I feel the first part of the question was not answered at all.</P>

	<P>The reply might have been a synopsis of what the Senator would have liked to have heard.  The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the instruction has been given to all members of the force that any complaint received about the use of such devices is to be the subject of investigation, and an investigation file submitted to the law officers for directions on what charges, if any, are to be preferred.  There has been an acknowledgment that if there is a complaint, it must be investigated.</P>
