	<P>I have notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">An g&aacute; leis an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, i bhfianaise na gciorruithe 58% n&oacute; &euro;50 milli&uacute;n at&aacute; molta ag an bord snip nua don Ghaeltacht agus do na hoile&aacute;in, dearbh&uacute; a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge go mbeidh an Rialtas ag seasamh leis na c&uacute;ig phrionsabal i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to revise the plan of the HSE to replace local services with a centralised application system for medical cards.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Eugene Regan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify the action, if any, that has been taken to charge members and leaders of criminal gangs since the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 was rushed through the Seanad on 14 July, given that he stated during the Second Stage debate that the enactment of this legislation was crucial and could not be delayed until the autumn.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Defence to give an appraisal on whether the bomb disposal unit should be returned to Finner given the recent heightened security threats generally in Ulster.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify whether, in the light of the Lisbon guarantees on the right to life, the family and education or otherwise, the European Commission would have any competence to challenge any legislation in Ireland, should such ever be proposed, along the lines of the Lithuanian law on the protection of minors against the detrimental effect of public information, which legislation has led to Lithuania being censured by the European Parliament, and to clarify whether in the event the European Commission <Col N="74"/>sought to challenge a member state on such a law, the Irish Government would oppose such interference.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline whether funding will be made available for necessary roadworks to ensure access by local communities to primary road routes at Tay Lane in Newcastle and Tandy&rsquo;s Lane in Lucan, County Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Pearse Doherty, Nicky McFadden, Eugene Regan, Cecilia Keaveney and R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Pearse Doherty, Nicky McFadden and Eugene Regan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Frances Fitzgerald as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter which is one for the National Roads Authority.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business, with spokespersons having 15 minutes to speak, all other Senators ten minutes, on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and Second Stage to adjourn at 2 p.m. if not previously concluded.  The Minister shall be called upon for closing comments at the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader ensure adequate time is provided for consultation on the Bill with interested parties?  Will a good break be provided for between Second and Committee Stages to allow for such consultation rather than rushing the legislation through?</P>
        <P>Yesterday, we witnessed a new level of disunity and disagreement among Ministers on the way forward economically with the T&aacute;naiste becoming the latest to rubbish the McCarthy report, yet the Minister for Finance said it would form the basis of the forthcoming budget.  This is poor leadership by the Government at a critical time for the country and it does not inspire confidence regarding the tough decisions that must be taken in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
        <P>I refer to another area in which there is a serious lack of leadership by the Government.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and we were disturbed yesterday when the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, announced that the Government would revert to the wording of the 2007 legislation which provided poor protection for children.  All parties represented on the committee had decided a new wording was needed but the Minister of State said the Government would row back to the original wording.  The Chairman of the committee, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, expressed the view that she did not agree with this; therefore, we are in limbo about what will happen regarding a constitutional amendment on children&rsquo;s rights.  The Green Party made no submission to the committee.  Is the new position a Government position?  Does the Green Party agree with it?  Where now for children&rsquo;s rights?</P>
        <P>Senators were concerned earlier this year about the Ryan commission report.  A report was subsequently published by the Government to implement the commission&rsquo;s findings.  It is time the Minister of State was invited to the House to discuss these vital issues.  It is disturbing that <Col N="75"/>it looks like the Government parties have lost the heart and the will to lead on the issue of children&rsquo;s rights and do not have the confidence to put a strong constitutional amendment to the people.  They have lost courage and are not leading on this critical issue which was highlighted in the Ryan report.  The Minister of State should come to the House as soon as possible to outline the Government&rsquo;s views and why it has taken this decision, which is a retrograde step.  We spent months at the committee working on a new wording, yet the Government has rowed back on it.  This is serious and I would like the Minister of State to come to the House to give us the full picture.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State brought the Adoption Bill 2009 through the House and subsequently addressed the House on the bilateral agreement with Vietnam without ever putting the full facts about it on the table.  Many aspiring adoptive parents want to know the facts about the agreement.  What will happen?  When will it happen?  Will there be no agreement?  If so, what are the proposals for parents caught up in this issue?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is causing untold stress.  As a number of Members said yesterday, if the House is to mean anything, will the Minister of State come and put the facts before us?  He did not do so when he attended the House previously.  We need the facts and the truth; the parents deserve no less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised the need for a debate on the public sector and how it operates etc.  I received a number of queries afterwards about the recent report which came to the conclusion that public servants were paid 25% more than private sector workers.  I will give one example to show how wrong is that report.  No job assessment or measurement of the input or output of a job was used.  None of the jobs was examined.  The report was based on demographics, qualifications and age.  For example, if it were applied to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s post, the outcome would be that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s pay should be that of a 47 year old solicitor living in a midlands town.  I do not say that is right or wrong but this is an example of how the report is unrelated to what is happening in the public sector.  Members, particularly those on the Government benches, should be keenly aware of this.  I acknowledge the public service issue and that public service pay needs to be dealt with in an appropriate way but the report that emerged this week is misleading and unhelpful.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions I have raised the need to deal with the question of the North-South Ministerial Council.  I wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the matter during the summer.  Meetings take place regularly and Ministers return to Stormont to report on what they have done but no report is made by our Ministers to either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  I have suggested to the Leader who seems open to the idea that a Minister attached to the Department of Foreign Affairs should come to the House to give a summary of the work of the Council following meetings and that the same should also be done regarding the business of the European Union.  On a monthly basis, a digest or precis of the key decisions and policies dealt with by the Union should be given to the House.  The advantage of taking these two actions would be that diverse issues would be addressed and we would not have a dead House with only one or two speakers.  The North-South report could concern three or four different ministries.  It is important that the work of the Union and the North-South Ministerial Council be recognised.  The Council will celebrate its tenth anniversary in December and I would like the House to mark it with a special debate on its work which is hugely important but which goes unrecognised.  We should mark the occasion with a major discussion which could lead to something being held on a regular basis.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald correctly referred to the necessity for consultation on the public transport legislation.  One of the issues we have highlighted in the report on Seanad reform is that where Bills are initiated in the House, an invitation should be extended to interest groups to make presentations to a group of Senators on the issues involved.  That would address the concern raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  These are simple actions that we should take until such time as the Government parties get their act together regarding proper reform of the House.</P>

	<P>This is the final sitting day before the Lisbon treaty is put again to the people next week.  Many of us have campaigned heavily during both referendum campaigns.  It has been different this time.  During the previous campaign key concerns were expressed and clarification sought on issues such as the loss of our Commissioner, taxation, abortion and a defence force.  These have largely been addressed and it is clear people have no reason to fear the Treaty of Lisbon.  If ever there was a time Ireland needed to be at heart of Europe, it is now.  The economic climate has deteriorated significantly since last year and the benefits of EU membership are clear to everybody.  Since we joined in the early 1970s, the country has been transformed.  We can send a message next week as a nation to international investors that we are at the heart of Europe andare a well educated English speaking workforce looking for business with access to a market of more than 500 million people.  I will canvass heavily during the final week of the campaign and that is the message I will put to people on the doorsteps.</P>

	<P>I was struck by the inspiring speech made by President Obama last night to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  It is remarkable how quickly the President and his Secretary of State, Mrs. Hilary Clinton, have managed to rehabilitate the United States in the eyes of the world.  I very much welcome his comments on adopting a policy of mutual respect for mutual interests.  I encourage countries such as North Korea and Iran to take him at his word and enter a process of engagement in order that they can rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of the world.</P>
        <P>As everybody will be aware, today is the 250th anniversary of the &ldquo;black stuff&rdquo;.  Many people will extoll its virtues and its taste, and will say how healthy it is.  I was always impressed by its advertising department and its adverts.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Any potential suggestion of disarray or disunity in the Cabinet would be completely unfounded.  As I said in the debate on the economy last night, in the context of various reports from an bord snip nua, on the numbers in the public service or anything else, it is important that we all have different points of view.  I said it was vitally important that we had a report as stark and with such a severe menu of options of cuts such as those brought forward by McCarthy.  He was the appropriate person to do that.</P>
        <P>What the T&aacute;naiste said yesterday was that to her, and many of us, there are a number of things in the report that do not make sense.  There are many things in it that do not make sense to me, my political aspirations and my views and those of my constituents, but it does not mean <Col N="77"/>it is not necessary for them to happen.  The T&aacute;naiste well knows that and that was what was being confirmed by her ministerial colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, yesterday evening.</P>
        <P>In the context of that, I ask the Leader if he can arrange a schedule of debates between now and the budget on all the different ministerial voting groups, and if there is not time, to pool some of them.  One thing is clear &mdash; we will have &euro;4 billion in cuts so let us make sure that this House, in a mature way, can have its say and see what we can come forward with.  The suggestions do not have to be in the McCarthy report or any report.  Maybe we will just come up with them ourselves.  One might say under education, one proposes to cut here, there and wherever or under transport, one proposes to have cuts in certain area, because that is what we will have to do and we may as well have our say.  As I said last night, toes will be stepped on between now and the first week in December.  The onus is on all of us to ensure that the toes that are stepped on are those that are best placed to take the pain and that the most vulnerable in society are protected at all costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>An issue that was raised, as I recall, last May by Senator Quinn and me, and at the time the Leader concurred with our opinion, was that of our unemployed and the contribution they can potentially make to our communities, towns and villages.  As we approach an unemployment figure of 450,000, I am sure many of us know people in our families and neighbourhoods who are unemployed for the first time in their adult lives.  One of the biggest challenges they face is preserving their sense of dignity and self-worth.  More often that not, they are more than willing to roll up their sleeves and make a contribution to their community in whatever form they can.</P>
        <P>At the time this was discussed by Senator Quinn and me, we suggested that perhaps the Government should put in place a national insurance policy to cover such people if they were engaging in such work in our communities.  During the summer a number of people in one of my local towns took it upon themselves to begin to tidy up an area near a children&rsquo;s playground that had become very unkempt and were told to stop immediately by staff from the local authority because they were not covered by an insurance policy.  On 21 July, the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, announced that one idea he was taking from the ideas campaign was to create a new volunteer corps to engage the unemployed in community and voluntary work in Ireland and internationally without losing their unemployment benefits.  Three months later we still have no details of how he intends to do that.  It is an area we should look at seriously and should debate in this House.</P>
        <P>Not alone are we offering these people a chance to maintain their dignity and self-worth and make a contribution to their communities, we would also be offering them a healthier CV when they go back to the workplace because they could show categorically that they did not sit idly during the six, 12 or, perhaps, 24 months they were unemployed.  It is an idea worth exploring and is one this House should be exploring in the very near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There was an interesting figure in the Commission on Taxation report in regard to tobacco smuggling.  What interested me was that the amount of money the nation has been getting from tobacco revenue has been coming down in recent years, but what I did not know was that tobacco consumption is going up.  The only way this can happen is with counterfeit and imported illicit cigarettes.  I was surprised at the figures.  The figures stated that approximately &euro;65 per carton of cigarettes is lost by the State every time a carton is illegally imported.  The effect is somewhere between &euro;500 million and &euro;750 million per year.  I was startled by those figures.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P>The other fact that surprised me, and of which I was not aware, was that these cigarettes are not just illicit or smuggled cigarettes, but many of them are counterfeit cigarettes that contain 75% more tar, 28% more nicotine and 63% more carbon monoxide than legal cigarettes.  There are two things we should be doing.  We should be publicising that fact and making sure that steps are taken to ensure we reduce the amount of illicitly imported or counterfeit cigarettes.  The fines and steps that can be taken are the sort of action we can take.  The Garda are working very hard on it, but I am not sure we are giving it the support it needs.</P>
        <P>During the last number of days the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, said he was introducing a postal code system.  I understand it will cost some &euro;22 million.  It may well be very worthwhile.  I noticed that the Communications Workers Union is concerned about it and is not sure why it is proposed.  The vast majority of the public I meet are unsure as to the benefits of this proposal.  There will probably be a substantial benefit from it.  If we are going to introduce this I suggest the Minister, Deputy Ryan, should come into the House and let us have an explanation on the cost of it and why we will do it.  There are 1.8 million addresses in Ireland and they will all have to have a postal code system.  I am sure there are benefits to it.  There are benefits to the nation as a whole.  Let us make sure we debate the matter and understand what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a public meeting in Wexford town on Sunday night regarding the services at Wexford General Hospital.  At a meeting with the HSE last Monday morning, it said there would be no major reduction in services at Wexford General Hospital, yet shortly afterwards the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, announced cutbacks of &euro;1.5 billion for the health services next year.  We should have an urgent debate on those cutbacks, because there is no way in the world one can implement cutbacks to that degree without having a significant affect on patient services across the country, especially on our acute  hospitals which, quite clearly, will be in the front line of most of the cutbacks.  We need an urgent debate on this issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We also need a debate on what is happening with the embargo on recruitment in the public service.  There will be no night classes for anybody in Wexford town between now and Christmas because an individual retired and for some reason the VEC cannot or will not replace that person, even from within its current personnel.  Instead it has cancelled all night classes, while all the other individuals connected with running the night classes are still expected to come into work with nothing to do.  It is a complete waste of resources and is a very poor interpretation of the current embargo on public service employment.  I ask the Leader to bring the appropriate Minister into the House to discuss this issue and stop this sort of nonsense from happening anywhere else in the country.</P>
        <P>I would have liked to have seen a debate on the Lisbon treaty before the vote on 2 October.  It is a pity the Leader could not facilitate that in some way, because it would have made a great impact to put on the record what we have seen and what we have done so far in regard to getting the treaty through.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard Deputy Brendan Howlin on the radio this morning talking about the children&rsquo;s rights amendment.  I am not opposed to a children&rsquo;s rights amendment. <Col N="79"/> Anything that strengthens the position of children in our Constitution would be welcome.  The matter needs to be debated, however.  It needs to be made clear that the Constitution currently guarantees the personal rights of the child.  While it would not be a problem to clarify or strengthen certain aspects of that, we need to be very precise about what we seek to achieve.  It is not enough to seek to change the Constitution in order to make some big statement.  If the traceable benefits of such a measure are not immediately obvious, we should question it.  The child care Acts currently allow hundreds of children to be taken into care each year.  It is obvious that the HSE and the social services are reluctant to intervene in certain situations, not because the Constitution prevents them from doing so but for various other reasons.  They may be afraid of local controversies, for example.  The salient point is that the law needs to be enforced.  The agencies involved need to act in accordance with the powers they currently have.  We must not engage in any scapegoating of our Constitution.  As I have said, the Constitution as it stands rightly protects the personal rights of the child.  It appropriately sits those rights in the context of the rights and duties of the family.  That should be a central point.  The 1996 report of the Law Reform Commission suggested that each child has the right to the care of his or her natural and biological parents, where possible.  We should be espousing that principle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The reputation of this nation among Irish people and people throughout the world was defiled when the Ryan report was published in May of this year.  The report stated that at least 30,000 children who were under the care of the State in industrial and reform schools were sexually, emotionally or physically abused.  Our Constitution was drawn up in 1937, at a time when children were seen and not heard.  It is about time we listened to the children.  When the Minister launched the implementation report in July of this year, he said he accepted all the recommendations and would implement them.  One of the report&rsquo;s key recommendations was that there should be a memorial to the men and women who were abused, many of whose lives are still destroyed.  I suggest that we should have a national day of remembrance to show our respect for the Irish children who were physically and emotionally abused by civil servants, volunteers, doctors, Christian Brothers and members of other religious orders.  It is critical for the Leader to seek the attendance of the Minister of State with responsibility for children in this House as soon as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, should update Senators on the position with regard to the constitutional amendment on children.  I emphasise that the rights of children have to be fully enshrined in the Constitution of today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to formally second Senator White&rsquo;s proposition.  The abuses that were documented and chronicled in the Ryan report should make us collectively ashamed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to speak about a different matter.  The Minister for Health and Children recently suggested that the health service will be the subject of &euro;800 million of cutbacks over the coming year.  When one takes demographic factors into account, the real figure will be between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.5 billion.  The impact could be even greater if the risk posed by the current flu pandemic gets worse.  I ask the Leader if the House can have a debate on this specific issue in the presence of the Minister.  I am afraid that we will throw the baby out with the bath water.  No Member of this House is opposed to efficiencies.  All Senators appreciate that savings need to be made.  We are all aware of the need for a huge trimming of the national finances.  However, we should not forget that certain core services, which are of essential and real value to people, need to be retained.  Not only would it be uncivilised to withdraw such services, but the cost of reassembling them at some future stage would be monumental and would set the country back hugely.  I would like to defend some of the traditional easy targets for cutbacks within the health service.  The home help and home care assistance systems are cost effective <Col N="80"/>in the sense they keep people out of hospital and provide local jobs.  The primary care system that is being developed will be of critical value in keeping people out of long-term care.  The implementation of the report, A Vision for Change, which deals with psychiatric services, is of crucial importance.  We need to make a clear statement, in the presence of the Minister, Deputy Harney, that we are in favour of trimming but not at the expense of core services.  I ask the Leader to convey that point to the Minister.  We do not want to develop a system like that in the United States.  The US President, Mr. Obama, is trying to undo a system that caters for just one sector of the population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the bank sector.  I refer specifically the &euro;54 billion injection that is to be invested in the banks as part of the NAMA proposal.  At this time, we should be introducing regulations to govern how much money can be loaned against private property.  We should limit the percentage of total bank lending that can be made available for commercial purposes.  This part of our island nation has a population of 4.25 million, by comparison with a global population of 6 billion.  If we are to renew the real prosperity we enjoyed up to 2002, our future lies with export-led growth.  I suggest that we should limit the amount of property lending the banks can engage in.  There should be no off-balance sheet lending.  We should specify that the banks have to ensure that a certain proportion of their lending is used for export-led growth, rather than for speculative purposes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Over the last 12 months, the Government has appealed to the Opposition to work with it on various issues, including NAMA and the Lisbon treaty, with which it has been confronted in the context of the recession we are facing.  It has been suggested that the Opposition&rsquo;s reasoned debate and our criticisms of some of the Government&rsquo;s policies have created uncertainty in the financial markets and thereby affected this country&rsquo;s credit rating.  I remind the Government that the serious infighting it is experiencing is not between the Government parties, as the Green Party is totally compliant with Government policy.</P>

	<P>It has been an effective apologist for the policies of this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  I would like to ask the Leader a serious question about the statement made by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday, when she criticised the validity of the bord snip nua report.  We all have our views on that report.  What has happened to the principle of Cabinet collegiality?  The T&aacute;naiste is not alone in criticising the report.  Her ministerial colleagues, Deputies Cullen and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, have also criticised the report.  The Minister for Finance had to issue a statement to the effect that the McCarthy report is the basis of the Government&rsquo;s thinking in the forthcoming budget.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position?  Do the comments of various Ministers &mdash; I refer in particular to the T&aacute;naiste &mdash; represent a concerted effort to undermine the Minister for Finance as he tries to restore order to the public finances?  I would like the Leader to answer that question.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Leader a brief question about the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign.  We are all working to get the message out and clarify the issues that have arisen where the treaty has been criticised.  The poster suggesting that the minimum wage might be reduced to &euro;1.84 is clever because it contains a question mark.</P>
        <P>A lot of people see it but others miss it.  The answer to the question is very clear.  This country has a minimum wage established by statute.  It is a matter for each member state to establish a minimum wage and, if anything, the influence from the European Union tends towards setting it at a reasonable level.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I join Senator Fitzgerald and others in calling for a discussion with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, on the important issue of the rights of children.  I am concerned that we have not concluded our debate on the Ryan report, as was promised by the Leader.  Where has that report gone?  Is it gathering dust on a shelf while the Government procrastinates and fails to do nothing?  What is happening in the area of intercountry adoption, particularly in respect of Vietnam?  As Senator Fitzgerald rightly pointed out, there are hundreds of distressed families in this country.  What is the status of the adoptions?  The Minister of State is saying nothing.  I urge him to discuss this issue in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>We need a debate on Ireland, the type of society and Government we want and the role of politicians and civil society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Buttimer is intoxicated by the exuberance of his own verbosity.  He noted that the Government is failing to do nothing.  Within this double negative lies a positive, therefore the Government is highly active.  He would be better to choose his words more carefully.</P>

	<P>I seek a discussion on education. A number of the industrialists who spoke at last week&rsquo;s forum in Farmleigh noted out that our reputation for education is no longer as high as we believe it to be.  Now would be an opportune time to invite the Minister for Education and Science to discuss education policy in a broad sense.  It is a matter to which I have given considerable thought over the summer break.  We need to fundamentally assess how we educate children.  Is it merely a question of passing the junior and leaving certificates?  We need to engage in teaching children to think for themselves.  I would welcome a broad debate on education given that it is one of the ways through which we escaped our previous economic doldrums.  It would represent a long-term investment in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made by previous speakers on the rights of children.  Yesterday I also spoke about our vulnerable elderly.  Today I want to highlight the problems of those aged between 25 and 40 who are exposed to serious financial and emotional pressures.  They bought houses at the peak of the property market and in many cases have young children who are attending school or college.  Furthermore, they are now falling victim to redundancies.  As parliamentarians, we need to take account of this age group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For several days we received mixed messages from Ministers with regard to how the Government intends to address the economic crisis.  A national programme for recovery was introduced in 1987 and the Government of the day engaged with the social partners and communities.  Such a programme is once again needed.  If we are to find a roadmap to recovery, we need to be honest with the people and put our cards on the table.  Last week&rsquo;s forum of leading business people with Irish connections was positive in terms of proposing solutions.  Such an approach could also be tried at local and regional levels.  Universities, institutes of technology and regional business leaders could get together with communities to identify problems and propose solutions locally.  That is the only way we can be inventive or offer new hope.</P>
        <P>This morning Senator Fitzgerald proposed a motion on the NRA.  Last year I raised my concerns about the lack of service stations on our national primary routes.  Over the summer, hundreds of miles of national roads were designated motorways with a click of the fingers.  No regard was paid to strict international standards on driver fatigue, which is one of the most unsafe practices in the developed world.  Ireland has no service stations and only two are proposed.  That is a disgrace and I call for a debate on our national roads network and accountability from the NRA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support all the requests for debates made by my colleagues this morning.  The Leader received dozens of requests for debates yesterday and he faces a difficult job in prioritising them.  A number of speakers have attempted to progress legislation on a <Col N="83"/>children&rsquo;s referendum but at the other end of the spectrum the question arises of the challenges facing the elderly.  I have previously stated in the context of a broad debate on services and protections for the elderly that we should set the bar higher by considering a referendum on the rights of the elderly.  This proposal deserves meaningful scrutiny from the perspective of health care and civil rights.  Elderly people are facing huge challenges which require political attention.</P>
        <P>I support the call for a debate on education.  The majority of Senators have received representations in regard to the school building programme.  If the Government survives the coming weeks I am sure an announcement will be forthcoming in that regard.  We need to reflect on the prefab industry.  I understand that more than &euro;100 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent on prefabs over the past three or four years.  Many school boards and parents&rsquo; associations now argue that if the money was available in a different form proper structures could have been built.  Can we hold an urgent debate on the prefab industry?  One school in the village of Rathcormac in my constituency has had prefabs for more than 40 years.  I could identify many more examples from across the country.  Significant amounts of money are being wasted on renting prefabs in cases where solid structures could be provided.  We should hold a debate on how the taxpayer could save and the pupils gain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Mullen, Mary White, Buttimer and Coffey raised the transport Bill.  In reply to Senator Fitzgerald, I will give whatever time is required &mdash; definitely a week to ten days &mdash; between the Second Stage and Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
        <P>On the serious concerns expressed by Senators this morning, particularly Senator Mary White, regarding the abuse of 30,000 children, which is horrifying to say the least, I certainly have no difficulty in coming back to the House on having a continuing debate on the Ryan report, on which I gave a commitment to the House before the summer recess, and also on having the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, come to the House on the concerns being expressed regarding adoption, especially from Vietnam.  As the House will be aware, the Minister of State went to Vietnam and met representatives of the Vietnamese Government.  I certainly have no difficulty in inviting him back to update the House on his discussions there, and also on all matters pertaining to the concerns of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, and all the various issues and challenges facing children and their well-being in the country at present.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the need for a debate on the public sector to discuss the serious issues and challenges facing everyone at work and what their contribution will be.  What he proposes is a good idea, that we would go through it portfolio by portfolio &mdash; perhaps two per week if possible &mdash; between now and the budget to see how the House with its wisdom can make proposals to assist the Government in its plight of finding &euro;4 billion in savings as outlined by Senator Marc MacSharry.  It is a matter in which this House can play a leading role.  I invite Senators over the next few days to put their thoughts together with all their teams of expertise with whom they have worked down through the years to come to the assistance of the Ministers to see how the reduction in income there will be in their portfolios can least affect those who are underprivileged and on the margins of society.  This is a good idea.</P>
        <P>On Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s proposal that we would spend one day a month in the House with the North-South Ministerial Council report, possibly we can have a lengthy period of time allocated on one day so that we can celebrate the tenth anniversary of the great work being done by Ministers North and South.  We could also allocate one day a month for the House to discuss EU reports and decisions.  There is all-party agreement on this.  I understand it is in our sub<Col N="84"/>missions &mdash; certainly in the Fianna F&aacute;il one &mdash; that we would get more actively involved in all EU matters as well as matters pertaining to the North of Ireland.  It would be timely to have this debate take place one day a month.  I will discuss this matter with the various Ministers and get their full support and approval.  The great work taking place is not being relayed to the people and I would like to think that Seanad &Eacute;ireann could be the conduit for the various achievements taking place, particularly in the North-South Ministerial Council.  We can let this take place and let the people know and be updated on the achievements taking place.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan and Regan raised the Lisbon treaty referendum on Friday, 2 October.  I am pleased to inform Senator Regan that the new posters went up overnight to point out the lie of the &euro;1.84 minimum wage and I congratulate those who were involved in this.  They went a step too far and this was the poster that really highlighted the lies that were being told by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign on this matter.  The minimum wage is enshrined in law in primary legislation passed by both Houses and is &euro;8.65.  It is something of which we can be proud on the one hand, but we can certainly give the lie to the myth being perpetrated by people who are misleading people, especially senior citizens, in many areas.  I am pleased to see the posters being erected to correct the matter and to state that the minimum wage is &euro;8.65 and, as I stated, that it is enshrined in primary legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan remarked on what President Obama is trying to achieve, and what he is trying to do is uplifting.  As I often have stated, it is never the wrong time to do the right thing.  What President Obama is trying to achieve is positive and I concur with Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s remarks.</P>
        <P>While it may be the anniversary of Guinness, which is our greatest export and a world leader as an ambassador for Ireland, the Cathaoirleach and I never partook of it, of course.  That is not to say that to discuss may not be always to agree.  At the end of the day, we congratulate everyone in Guinness on the wonderful employment the company has given in Ireland over 250 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator MacSharry called again for a debate on the economy &mdash; there was a good debate in the House yesterday evening &mdash; and also on the various reports that have been published.  These are for our consideration as legislators.  When we have discussed them and made our views known to the Government, it will then assess the views of colleagues from all sides of both Houses and then make up its mind.  The Minister for Finance and the Government will let the people know on budget day when it will start to look at parts of those reports.  As I stated in the House yesterday, I do not see the closing of Garda stations to save &euro;1 million as a serious and common-sense proposal.  I do not expect that will happen.  I hope it will not happen because, as we all stated yesterday, the people deserve security in their homes.  The proposal on &euro;11 million for the rural transport scheme does not seem to make sense given the great and important good the scheme is doing right across the entire nation.  However, there are good proposals that will assist Government.  Every Minister can have his or her individual opinion and then collectively sit down as a Government and make decisions.  We all represent constituencies individually, no matter what office we hold in either House.  It would be a poor day if individual Members coming to these Houses to represent their constituents could not be allowed express their opinions on behalf of their constituents and then collectively make their decision as members of Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon spoke of the unemployed and voluntary employment.  His is a worthwhile suggestion.  I say to the Government it is about time whoever is in charge would cover the <Col N="85"/>insurance of tidy towns committees or town development committees for individuals and groups of young people.  If young people want to work voluntarily in areas identified by those experts who are advising these committees, insurance should not be the problem to stop them from doing the good work and improving the environment in the place where they were born and are living.  I certainly will allow a debate on this take place at the earliest time because there is nothing more soul destroying than getting out of bed in the morning with nothing to do all day.  Money has nothing to do with this.  This is a social contribution and it can bring in significant dividends, whether in constructing walls, improving cemeteries or doing whatever in the local parish.  We all see the power of the local parish in Croke Park on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  It moves mountains and does tremendous work.  We, as legislators, should ensure this determination by our young people is not interfered with because they have no insurance cover.  I thank Senator Cannon for bringing the matter to the attention of the House this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised tobacco smuggling and the resulting loss to the Exchequer.  Most important of all, however, the Senator brought to the attention of the House the high tar content in such cigarettes which is so dangerous to the health of those smoking them.  I certainly will past his view on to the Minister.  He also raised the postal code system and said that it will cost so much.  It is my intention to have the Minister present to update the House on his proposals for the 1.8 million addresses that must be re-coded according to his proposal.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey and O&rsquo;Reilly called on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to come to the House to discuss health services.  I already gave my commitment to this yesterday and I am endeavouring to get a date in the Minister&rsquo;s diary so that this can happen.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey highlighted an issue with night classes in Wexford.  As a former member of a VEC for four decades, I can say this is the function of the board of management in the first instance or the VEC in the second instance.  A small contribution is needed by mature students attending in the evening.  What was most uplifting in the 40 years I was a member of the VEC was the huge contribution to adult education, particularly in evening classes.  If a small contribution of &euro;5 or &euro;10 is needed to allow this to continue, I do not believe the people, students in particular, will stop this from taking place.  However, to suggest schools will close down every night of the week in a proud county like Wexford is unacceptable.  I ask Senator Twomey and all Oireachtas Members from County Wexford to go back to the VEC to make their strong views known.  If this is the case, it should not be allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin and Regan expressed their strong views on the banks.  In particular, Senator Hanafin said the people and the Government should know the percentages for mortgages, business and export-related growth, respectively.  This is a commonsense proposal.  When the Minister comes to the House to discuss the finance portfolio, we can make this proposal to him.  This is where NAMA will be really effective once the percentages are agreed and all concerned, including the Government and the banks, are happy that this is what the plan will be.  It is the national plan for recovery, which is as it should be.  Once the taxpayer sees that the money will go to those who will generate growth and first-time house buyers, we will all know it is going to the productive end and will not be abused on this occasion.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer again called for a debate on Ireland of the future.  I agreed yesterday to have such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley called for a debate on future education policy.  I have already given such a commitment and believe it is a very good idea.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey has expressed serious concerns about those aged between 25 and 45 years who are under financial and emotional pressure.  I agree with him in this regard.  This is the section of society now most at risk and experiencing pressure never experienced before.  The financial institutions need to play a serious part in this regard.  If couples cannot make repay<Col N="86"/>ments through no fault of their own and they have a previously good track record, there is no reason they should not be allowed to pay interest only for a period of, perhaps, two years, or roll it over for a year at the end of the loan.  If they have a good track record, the financial institutions and the Government need to take into account the difficulties couples aged between 25 and 45 years are experiencing.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey also called for a debate on the National Roads Authority and the designation of many miles of national roads as motorways.  Local authority members have made strong proposals in this regard.  In our area the road from McNeads Bridge to Kinnegad and from Kinnegad to Athlone has been a dual carriageway for some years.  It has been tried and trusted and, thank God, very few accidents have occurred, with no accidents on some stretches.  While the research has been done, I have no problemn in having a debate on the National Roads Authority and where we go from here.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford called for a debate on the rights of the elderly.  I can certainly agree to have a debate on the matter.  He also spoke about the &euro;100 million spent on renting prefabricated buildings.  This is an enormous amount of money.  This is the time to get value for money &mdash; more for less, we are told.  Builders would be delighted to undertake small schools projects such as this if it was the best that was to happen in the long term.  I do not have any difficulty in having a debate on that matter also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009 for the consideration of the House.  The Bill is the second phase in the Government&rsquo;s public transport legislative reform programme which commenced with the enactment of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill last year.  The Bill follows and builds on the enactment of that legislation and, together with that Act, presents a comprehensive framework for the future regulation and control of public passenger land transport.  It is particularly appropriate that the Bill should commence its Oireachtas journey in Seanad &Eacute;ireann as it was here <Col N="87"/>that the Dublin Transport Authority Act was first presented to the Oireachtas.  We had a very good debate with very constructive suggestions and a number of amendments were subsequently taken here or in the other House.  I am delighted to come back to have the Bill scrutinised for the first time by the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The immediate primary focus of the Bill is to establish a new modern legal framework for the licensing of commercial public bus transport services with the objective of promoting regulated competition in the provision of licensed public bus passenger services on a national basis, as well as the further promotion of integrated, well functioning and cost efficient services.  The legislation has been drafted in a manner to ensure it complies with EU law, in particular, EU Regulation 1370/2007.</P>
        <P>In association with this, the Bill also provides that responsibility for the administration of the new system will be given to the Dublin Transport Authority as it is now known.  The transfer of the bus licensing function from my Department to the authority establishes a synergy with the current role of the authority under the Dublin Transport Authority Act.  That Act put in place a legislative framework to support the procurement of public transport services by the authority by way of public service contracts within the greater Dublin area.  That latter role is also being expanded through the Bill to apply nationally.  In effect, the contracting arrangements in Part 3, Chapter 2, of the Dublin Transport Authority Act are being extended nationwide.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also realise the transfer of the Commission for Taxi Regulation to the authority.  The amalgamation of a number of important functions relating to the regulation and control of all land-based transport modes on a national basis within the authority has prompted my decision to confer it with the title of National Transport Authority.  The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions regarding public transport.</P>
        <P>When the Government launched the ten-year, &euro;34 billion capital Transport 21 investment framework in November 2005, it was recognised that there was an urgent need for institutional reform, as well as infrastructural renewal.  An Agreed Programme for Government in 2007, therefore, incorporated the commitment to reform bus route licensing to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, whereby both private and public service providers would be licensed and operate under the same rules.  The Bill before the House today therefore establishes a new bus route licensing regime replacing the Road Transport Act 1932, which currently governs the licensing of commercial bus services provided by private bus operators, and also replaces provisions of the Transport Act 1958 which relate to bus services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The provisions of the 1932 and 1958 Acts have long been recognised as being in need of significant reform.  The 1932 Act in particular was designed primarily to protect the then rail network but has never been amended in light of changed economic and social circumstances.  It is recognised by all consumer groups and stakeholders in the bus sector as a body of legislation which is unsuited to modern conditions for the regulation of a public bus market which has many different characteristics &mdash; interurban, suburban, rural, local and community &mdash; all of which serve different needs.  It deals only with the licensing of private operators on routes and applies criteria which are totally outdated.</P>
        <P>The 1932 Act does not apply to services provided by Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann, which are authorised separately under the Transport Act 1958.  Under existing arrangements, proposed new services or changes to existing services by either company must be notified to my Department under an administrative procedure.  My consent is required under section 25 of the 1958 Act where a new service or an alteration to an existing service would give rise to competition with a licensed service provided by a private operator.  Neither Act provides a legislative basis <Col N="88"/>on which to regulate both public and private operators in the market in accordance with current EU regulations regarding monopoly and exclusive rights and direct award contracts.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government, the proposed bus route licensing regime in respect of commercial bus services will provide a level playing field for all bus market participants.  The new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus passenger services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It will establish a clear structure against which applications for bus route licences will be considered, as well as a modern system of penalties and associated powers for revocation of licences.  The new regime will operate side by side with a new contractual regime to apply in respect of bus and rail services which are the subject of public service obligations, PSOs.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 established a contractual framework for the procurement of public transport services by the authority in respect of services which in EU terms are defined as PSOs, and a basis for a new performance-based and transparent contractual structure relating to the provision of bus and rail services in the greater Dublin area, GDA, deemed to be the subject of a PSO.  This will ensure the best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from the still significant subvention being provided by the Exchequer for public bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann or indeed other service providers in the future.  The Bill provides that the contractual framework under the DTA Act for the future subvention of non-commercial bus services and rail will be extended to apply to such services nationally.  Parallel with this Bill, work is proceeding in my Department in drafting direct award contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann with a view to having such contracts concluded in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In a wider strategic context, the reform of the legislative framework must also be viewed against the background of the substantial investment in infrastructure which has been completed or is currently under construction or planned under Transport 21, which remains the most significant and sustained transport capital investment programme in the history of the State and will rectify deficits in transport infrastructure which, if not addressed, could seriously undermine our competitiveness, discourage inward investment, slow our economic growth and retard the future potential of the economy.  Population and employment growth and the associated increase in car ownership, even if moderating in the current recession, have placed the transport infrastructure under severe pressure.  This is most evident in the GDA where deficits in the transport infrastructure, even during periods of economic contraction, have resulted in congestion, increased journey times and an ever-expanding urban sprawl.</P>
        <P>The bus network provides the backbone to the public transport system in Ireland, particularly in the GDA, with almost 150 million passengers carried by Dublin Bus in 2008.  This accounts for nearly half of all public transport passengers in the State.  However, the provision of well-functioning bus services is at least as important in areas outside the GDA because in general there are no other public transport facilities available, save for limited suburban rail services provided in respect of certain cities.  Legislative reform, through replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932, is an essential part of the interrelated structural and regulatory modernisation process of public transport.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that taxi, hackney and limousine services comprise a significant element of the national public transport service.  Accordingly, it is appropriate that the regulation of this sector should be undertaken by the authority that is being given responsibility for the regulation and control of all other modes of land-based transport in the State.  The Bill therefore provides for further rationalisation of the institutional arrangements in the public transport sector by proposing that the Commission for Taxi Regulation be amalgamated with the DTA to form a single entity.</P><Col N="89"/>
        <P>I will now discuss the main provisions of the Bill, which are outlined in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to Senators.  Part 1, preliminary and general, is standard in all legislation and includes the interpretation of specific words and phrases that have a particular relevance to the provisions in the Bill as a whole.  Part 2 establishes a new regulatory regime for the licensing of commercial public bus services.  As I adverted to earlier, its immediate focus is the replacement by a single licensing regime of the existing legislative regimes that separately authorise the provision of bus passenger services by private and State-owned public operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  In replacing the existing codes, especially the Road Transport Act 1932, this Part will address fundamental problems that have served to stifle rather than support the instigation of new bus services.</P>
        <P>At the outset, Part 2 sets out certain fundamental elements for an appropriate licensing system, addressing issues such as the requirement to hold a licence, a description of the service to be provided in terms of route, frequency, timetables, etc., categories of licence, and the form of application that must be followed.  Senators will note that in establishing these and all other elements of the proposed system, the Bill is particularly descriptive.  It does not mandate the making of regulations or orders by the authority but directly addresses issues and allows the authority to make determinations on an ongoing basis on a range of matters so that it may adapt the system to meet changing demands and consumer needs.  However, those powers are tempered by the mandatory requirement for the authority to consult broadly in its activities.</P>
        <P>Bringing the needs of consumers to the centre of the consideration of the overall licensing system is a particular theme of this Part.  I am particularly grateful for the advice and support given by the Competition Authority in the development of that theme.  In that context, I direct Senators to two sections in particular &mdash; sections 10 and 23.  Section 10 is a pivotal element of this Part in that it sets out the general provisions for the consideration of applications for licences.  The section places that consideration within the parameters of the general objectives of the authority, thus highlighting the importance I place on ensuring the provision of properly regulated commercial bus services will be central to the future growth of passenger services.  Having regard to those objectives, the consideration of applications must take account of the demand that exists for services, with particular reference to the needs of consumers.</P>
        <P>The authority is then given latitude, as far as it considers necessary, to address a range of other matters.  For example, it may consider the potential impact of a proposed commercial bus service on existing transport services being provided under contracts, the need to increase the availability of transport and the promotion of integration and competition.  In addition, it can bring more general factors to bear such as the national spatial strategy, planning guidelines and the sustainable travel and transport action plan.</P>
        <P>Senators will note that there is a wide menu provided for the authority in the consideration of applications.  They will also note that subsection (6) specifically requires the authority to inform applicants of the reasons applications are refused.</P>
        <P>Section 23 provides that the authority must prepare and publish guidelines in relation to this Part of the Bill.  The guidelines must, in particular, set out how the authority will consider applications under section 10.  It is my view that this pivotal element of the overall licensing framework must be pursued in an open and transparent manner.  Accordingly, drafts of guidelines must be published.  Specifically, they must be submitted to the Minister for Transport and the Competition Authority for their respective views.  This will ensure that at all times the approach to licensing is in line with national transport policy and competition policy generally.</P>
        <P>In regard to this Part of the Bill, I point Senators to sections 19 and 24 which, respectively, identify a range of circumstances where licences can be revoked and establish a system of very <Col N="90"/>significant penalties for those who breach mandatory elements of the overall licensing system.  This has been in need of urgent reform for some time.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill which consists of sections 28 and 29 provides the framework for the refocusing of the Dublin Transport Authority into a national body.  That refocusing is prompted by the fact that as a result of the Bill, the authority is being vested with a range of new functions that have national application, in particular, the bus route licensing system, as outlined in Part 2.  The advent of that system and the linkages that naturally arise between it and the provision of subvented bus services through contracts provide an immediate logic to the authority taking responsibility for its administration nationally.</P>
        <P>Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the authority will, on its establishment, be responsible for the contractual framework for the provision of land transport in the greater Dublin area.  With the addition of the bus route licensing functions under the Bill, it is clearly appropriate that the authority&rsquo;s engagement in contracts for transport should also apply nationally.  Section 28 provides for that linkage.  I recently announced the appointment of Mr. John Fitzgerald as chairman of the DTA and he will now work with my Department in making the necessary arrangements to set up the DTA on a formal basis in the coming months and, when the Bill is enacted, in assuming the additional responsibilities in it.</P>
        <P>The result of this initiative is that the regulation and control of all bus, rail, metro and light rail services will be centred in one national authority.  Against this background, there is a clear logic in further expanding these linkages to incorporate the regulation and control of taxis, hackneys and limousines.  Therefore, section 28 also provides that the functions currently carried out by the Commission for Taxi Regulation are being subsumed into the overall remit of the authority.  To reflect the significant broadening of its the role, section 28 also amends the application of the authority&rsquo;s overall objectives to ensure they are relevant to the carrying out of the new functions it will have to carry out nationally.</P>
        <P>Section 29 specifically provides for the renaming of the authority as the National Transport Authority.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill consists of 11 sections which address practical and legal issues that arise as a result of the transfer of the functions of the Commission for Taxi Regulation to the authority.  I refer Senators, in particular, to section 30 which provides for the dissolution of the commission; sections 38 and 39 which address the transfer of both the employees of the commission and the office of commissioner and section 40 which gives overall effect to the transfer of all the commission&rsquo;s functions.</P>
        <P>Part 5 of the Bill which consists of three sections and two associated Schedules provides the basis for amendments to a number of existing pieces of legislation.  In particular, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 is the subject of a series of amendments.  In the first instance, section 41 addresses the repeal of provisions relating to the establishment and governance of the Commission for Taxi Regulation consequent to the amalgamation of that body into the new National Transport Authority.  Second, section 42 provides for necessary changes to titles and references in that Act that also arise from the proposed amalgamation.</P>
        <P>Part 1 of the First Schedule presents a series of amendments to the 2003 Act which have arisen as a result of recommendations by the Commission for Taxi Regulation.  In particular, a restatement of section 43 of that Act is proposed to ensure the prohibition on providing a service without the necessary licences applies equally where a vehicle is the subject of a lease arrangement and to give powers to authorised persons under the Act to seize and detain vehicles being used in the commission of offences established through the section.  Parts 2 to 4, <Col N="91"/>inclusive, of that Schedule address minor amendments to the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 and the Roads Acts 1993 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The Second Schedule provides for a further range of changes to provisions in the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 that provide for the substitution of the existing references to the commission to references to the authority in respect of a range of functions currently carried out by the commission.  It also provides that the existing Advisory Council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be known as the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles.</P>
        <P>Section 43 provides for amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to give the authority a role in regard to the preparation of regional planning guidelines outside the greater Dublin area.  The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 already provides that the DTA will have involvement in the planning processes in the greater Dublin area.  This involvement is mandated primarily by reference to the requirement imposed on the authority to make a strategic transport plan for the greater Dublin area under section 12 of the Act.  Given the importance of co-ordinating transport infrastructure and strategies and the lead-in time for their implementation, I consider that the DTA should have a limited role in regard to land use planning issues outside the greater Dublin area.  Accordingly, following consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Bill proposes to give the DTA a role in relation to the preparation of the regional planning guidelines outside the greater Dublin area through amendment of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  All regional authorities will consult the authority when they are preparing the guidelines for their areas and include a statement of proposed actions to ensure effective integration of transport and land use planning.  The amendments are modelled substantially on the relevant provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 in regard to the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Part 6 of the Bill addresses two separate issues.  Section 44 deals with a legal obligation under EU law to provide for the transposition of Article 6 of EU Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification into Irish law.  It designates the Minister for Transport as the competent authority in this regard.</P>
        <P>Section 45 seeks to clarify the powers of local authorities to provide bus priority measures and cycle facilities and, where necessary, provides a step-in power for the DTA.  The section exempts bus priority measures from regulations applying to local authority developments under section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, known as the &ldquo;Part 8&rdquo; procedure.  The Bill proposes that bus priority measures will be delivered under the road traffic legislation as an executive function of the relevant county manager, with the exception of such measures involving road widening.  The purpose of these amendments is to streamline the delivery of bus priority measures.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the Bill is the replacement of the current outmoded and inadequate licensing regime that has applied to the authorisation of bus routes for some 77 years.  The passage of the Bill presents the ideal opportunity not only to modernise the current licensing system but to provide for the rationalisation of the regulation and control of all land transport modes under one body.  Subsuming the regulation of taxis, hackneys and limousines within the same body also supports that rationalisation.  I remain convinced of the robustness of the reasoning and need for the establishment of a body to oversee the co-ordination and control of both the delivery of the major programme of transport infrastructure and the integration of transport modes in the greater Dublin area.  In the Bill before the House I am not seeking to expand these roles to the rest of the State.  However, through section 29, the prospect for the further expansion of the remit and functions of the authority can be pursued against the back<Col N="92"/>ground of the experience gained by the authority in pursuing its initial remit role in that regard.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I acknowledge the value of the introduction of this legislation in the House and the positive experience we have had in relation to Bills in this area during the past two years.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister, who stated at the outset of his contribution that legislation in relation to the regulation of transport in Ireland has been fraught.  Such legislation has been, at times, outdated and irrelevant to the challenges faced by modern public or private transport and changes often have been incremental and frequently inadequate.  At other times a tango has taken place with one step forward in terms of dealing with transport policy issues and two steps back owing to a change in philosophy on the part of the Minister or Government.</P>
        <P>I would like to deal now with the legislative background in which this Bill is being introduced.  Key legislation on the regulation of the private and public bus market in Ireland dates back to 1932.  The integration of transport planning was really only grasped last year with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Prior to that we had the Dublin Transport Authority Act 1986 which was repealed in 1987.  The crucial issue of the integration of transport planning with land use planning was only dealt with in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and even then only in respect of the greater Dublin area, as acknowledged by the Minister in his contribution.  There is a need for us to update and make relevant legislation in this area even in the changed economic climate in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On the philosophy behind this Bill, two objectives deserve to be acknowledged and welcomed.  There has long been a contradiction in the regulation of the bus market with a particular Department bearing responsibility for the companies providing public transport and also making decisions on regulation in that regard.  This legislation will resolve that contradiction and ensure we have in place a regulator that differs from the owner.  That is to be welcomed.  The objective this legislation presupposes of regulating competition within the bus market is also to be welcomed.  My party has long argued for this.  A move to an environment wherein one will have regulated competition, and in particular the prospect of competition even if that prospect does not materialise, will lead to a better use of taxpayers&rsquo; money, the better development of routes and will ensure the needs of passengers and commuters are better met than is currently the case.</P>
        <P>That being said, there are seven areas in which this legislation is deficient.  These are the issues on which I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  The first issue is the steps forward in the Bill in terms of the integration of land use planning and transport planning.  The legislation gives the national transport authority the power to get involved in the consultative process and to make observations not alone on regional planning guidelines but in regard to the development of area and development plans.  However, the authority does not have this particular power outside of the greater Dublin area.  We are creating within this legislation a two-tier environment with which the authority must work.  It will in relation to the greater Dublin area be able to comment on and make observations and recommendations on the development of county and city development plans but will not be able to do so outside of the greater Dublin area.  In this regard, its ability will be confined to the development of regional planning guidelines.  We all acknowledge that a lack of this type of integration is responsible for some of the horrific planning decisions made, examples of which include estates and homes with no public transport.  That the Bill does not tackle that issue is a grave concern.  I am astonished to hear that while the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was consulted on this matter it expressed no observations on it.  I cannot see how the Bill <Col N="93"/>would not be improved by at least giving the national transport authority the power to make selective observations and contributions on the development of county development plans.  It is the county and city developments that deal with the real issues facing us.  This is an issue on which the Green Party has spoken passionately and at length throughout its entire existence and I wonder whether it has gone missing in action.  Where in the legislation is the action in this area?</P>
        <P>The second issue is the role of a directly elected Lord Mayor for the greater Dublin area.  In May this year, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government issued a press release to the effect that the chairperson of the national transport authority would be a directly elected Lord Mayor for Dublin.  The DTA is being subsumed into the national transport authority.  However, the legislation makes no reference to the directly elected Lord Mayor and what role he or she will play in this area.  What does this mean?  Does it mean we will have a directly elected Lord Mayor for Dublin who is chairperson of the national transport authority or that no directly elected Lord Mayor will play a role in this area?  I strongly believe that the development of the role of a directly elected Lord Mayor will be a big step forward for local government.  However, this legislation makes no reference in this regard.  Again, where is the Green Party on this particular issue?  Given the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to local authority development and his work in this area under previous portfolios, what role will a directly elected Lord Mayor play in respect of the provision of transport, in particular given it has been established that directly elected Lord Mayors worldwide tend to be more effective when they have a role to play in transport provision?</P>
        <P>The third issue is the subsuming of the taxi commission into the new authority, a dissolution which makes complete sense and which I support.  Legitimate issues have been raised in regard to what is currently happening in the taxi market, in particular in Dublin.  It is a real tragedy to see reported in the media during the past couple of days the number of people involved in the taxi market who have taken their own lives.  While I am not suggesting they have done so because they were taxi drivers, there is huge pressure on people involved in that industry, an issue into which the Joint Committee on Transport has put a great deal of work and made a number of recommendations on.</P>
        <P>The Bill acknowledges that regulated competition is the way to deliver transport needs for markets.  This applies in respect of buses and all other forms of transport.  Surely, some form of regulation is also appropriate for the taxi market.  I am a believer in free markets.  I also believe that competing individuals will deliver in the common good.  However, there are pragmatic measures that could be included in this legislation, namely, the new transport authority could be given the power to make observations on whether capacity has been met within the market of a particular county or city and the ability to declare a limited time period within which issues must be dealt with.   For example, the authority could be allowed to tackle a situation where a particular individual is in possession of a large number of taxi licences which he or she is renting out to others.  One would have to be blind not to be aware of the legitimate concerns in the area of taxi regulation.  This legislation offers an opportunity to acknowledge these concerns and do something about them, but the Bill, as drafted, is inadequate in this regard.</P>
        <P>A fourth issue of concern is the investigation of public transport accidents.  In the last two days there have been four accidents in Dublin involving buses and last week there was the awful incident involving a collision between a bus and a Luas tram.  In this context, it is appropriate that the new authority should have a role to play in regard to passenger safety on public transport.  In the case of bus accidents, my understanding is that the ensuing investigation is largely undertaken by the bus companies.  There seems to be no statutory provision whereby the conduct and findings of such investigations must be made public.  Given that passenger and <Col N="94"/>public safety must be the number one priority for any company involved in the provision of transport, it is somewhat strange that the Bill is silent on this subject.  Will the Minister consider including a provision whereby the new authority would have a function in initiating or reviewing investigations of public transport accidents?</P>
        <P>The fifth issue of concern to me is that the Bill has nothing to say on the subject of rural transport.  I understand most rural public transport services are provided by Pobal, under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Given that this legislation deals with national transport regulation as opposed merely to regulation within Dublin or particular cities, the new body should have a role in overseeing rural transport services.  This should be done either through a stronger and tighter legal relationship with Pobal or by ensuring the Department of Transport and the new authority throw their collective influence behind ensuring rural transport needs are met and the appropriate services are in place.  My colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, spoke passionately about this issue yesterday.  There is surely a role for the new authority in this area.</P>
        <P>Sixth, we will have to examine the role of the new transport authority as a provider of last resort.  In our debate on the legislation establishing the Dublin Transport Authority the Minister scaled back its capacity as a provider of last resort in amendments he accepted in this House.  He recognised there could be a conflict of interest where a body functioned both as regulator of a service and a potential provider of that service at some point in the future.  While the legislation before us is to be welcomed in removing one potential conflict of interest, in terms of the Department of Transport simultaneously owning public companies and acting as regulator of those companies, it seems risky to allow scope for a similar potential conflict to arise.</P>
        <P>The seventh issue of concern relates to the licensing and procurement of bus services.  There is much to be welcomed in the Bill regarding the clear statutory footing provided for the licensing of bus services.  The crucial issue will be the licensing guidelines the Department produces in order for the Bill to be implemented.  The last set of such guidelines from by the Department was issued only last month.  Under these guidelines, the stated principal consideration when deciding upon whether a new route should be provided is whether there is an existing service.  It is imperative that we deal with this issue.  It should be a case of taking a step back and asking whether a particular sector of the market is currently in operation.  While the Bill offers the framework for that to happen, the guidelines published last month seem to be at odds with this.</P>
        <P>In regard to regulated competition, there is provision that bus routes operated by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann will be protected for five years.  I have little doubt that when regulated competition is introduced, these providers will continue to win most of the contracts because they are generally very good at what they do.  However, we should take this opportunity to put in place on a statutory footing the performance measures that will be required in order to win these contracts.  While researching the Bill, I looked at what Transport for London, that city&rsquo;s equivalent of the Dublin Transport Authority, was doing.  That organisation publishes figures every month on its website indicating how the various bus companies are performing in different areas, on the basis of such measures as reliability, the amount of miles lost due to congestion and so on.  No such information is available for bus services here.  Introducing a statutory provision to ensure such data are published is essential to ensure the legislation works as we want it to.</P>
        <P>As I outlined, while there is much to be welcomed in the legislation, it does not go far enough in several aspects.  This is particularly so in regard to the issue of integrating land use and transport planning and the procurement and licensing of bus services.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="95"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Members, I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  The establishment of an effective public transport regulatory system is long overdue.  During the years various bodies have had responsibility in this area, including the Department of Transport, CIE, Bus &Eacute;ireann and so on.  The 1932 Act was introduced at a time when there was no such thing as competition, with CIE essentially enjoying a monopoly of all types of transport in the State, whether passenger, commercial or otherwise.  Some of us are old enough to remember how drivers who applied for licences in rural areas to undertake certain haulage work were left on tenterhooks for years before a decision was made.</P>
        <P>It is important that we ensure there is full transparency in all these matters.  The Bill stipulates that any transport provider whose application is refused must be given full information on the reasons for that refusal.  However, it seems no appeal mechanism has been provided, either to the Minister or the courts, for unsuccessful applicants who consider themselves to have been unfairly treated.  This is something the Minister may be able to clarify at a later stage.  As politicians, it is inevitable that we will be approached by constituents whose licence applications have been refused.  Some of us know it was right and proper to refuse them in some cases but in others one might wonder if they were fairly treated.</P>
        <P>Will the Bill also cover character references for people who seek licences?  I am aware of the problem that has arisen, with which the Minister is dealing, regarding operators of haulage licences.  There is a need to ensure those who operate on behalf of various transport agencies, particularly bus drivers, have proper clearance.  While a person or company might be the licensee, the people who operate for them should be listed and receive full clearance from the Garda authorities and others.  Everybody is aware of the fear people, particularly women, have of taking taxis at night in this city.  There have been a number of serious incidents.  It is important, therefore, that there be full character references and checks carried out with regard to those who operate in this area.</P>
        <P>There will also be an onus on providers.  Those granted licences are getting an opportunity to operate and will have to provide a service that will cater for people&rsquo;s needs.  When discussing this issue and providers, we tend to focus on the main providers, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  However, we must also begin to consider the provision of services in some of our larger towns, where there is no internal transport service.  There is probably enough business in many of these towns to create such a service.  In doing so, we do not want a situation where ten operators are given routes when there is only sufficient business for one.  On the other hand, where there is business for one operator, we do not want that operator to abuse his or her position with regard to charges and so forth.  This is something that must be monitored.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of regulations has always been a problem, regardless of what regulations are introduced.  Will there be sufficient powers of enforcement?  The Garda will have to become more active than at present in enforcing regulation.  In some cases it does not provide the enforcement necessary.  Sometimes one is told it is due to a lack of resources but I have seen many cases where the resources were available but regulations were still not enforced.</P>
        <P>We are aware of the problems that have arisen with the taxi regulator regarding the number of taxi licences issued and the viability of the business.  It is a problem, but we should recall what happened prior to that, when one could be seeking a taxi in this city on a Friday or Saturday night and one would be lucky to get one by Monday.  Perhaps too many rushed in to obtain licences when they became unemployed.  There is definitely a need to re-examine the situation and I am aware the Minister is trying to do something about it.</P>
        <P>Rural transport affects all rural communities.  In some parts of the country there is still a lack of taxi or hackney services at night.  All the operators want to work Friday and Saturday nights when there is plenty of business but if one is looking for a taxi on a Monday or Tuesday night, <Col N="96"/>one just cannot get one.  I accept the operators must make a living but is there a need to make it mandatory that they provide a service for a certain number of hours over the week rather than allowing them to work Friday and Saturday nights before returning to their ordinary jobs for the rest of the week?  It annoys people in rural areas that when they are seeking a taxi or hackney, they cannot find one because the operators do not work on a particular night.  I accept it is a person&rsquo;s prerogative, especially if it is a one-person operation, to decide when he or she wants to work.  This issue will have to be examined in granting licences.  There might even be a case for providing that when licences are granted, a commitment must be given by those who receive licences to operate a service in non-high profit hours rather than just in high profit hours.  Perhaps the Minister might consider this and discuss it with the Taxi Regulator or those who will be responsible for enforcement.</P>
        <P>I referred to rural transport.  I compliment the Minister on receiving a briefing from his colleagues in the parliamentary party on the retention of the rural transport scheme which has been a tremendous success in alleviating the isolation of older people in rural areas.  Many of them can continue to live in their own communities because of this facility rather than ending up living in institutions and costing the State a great deal more money.  All public representatives have met the transport groups in the past couple of weeks.  There has been much talk about the McCarthy report but if Mr. McCarthy had been sent to visit some of these groups, he would not have included them in his list of proposed cuts.  For older people the service means they can collect their pension, do their shopping, meet friends and make new ones.  If a person had a feeling for rural Ireland, he or she would not include it in a list of proposed cuts.</P>
        <P>People should realise that the McCarthy report is a proposal, not a definitive position.  Every part of the report will have to be examined in detail to assess the social, community and economic effects.  It should be remembered that it might look good on paper to cut something but the knock-on effects in terms of what it would cost the State indirectly could be ten times more than the amount saved.  The Leader has given a commitment to have a debate in the House on the report prior to the budget.  It is important in that context to ensure the knock-on effects of doing something are assessed as much as the savings that can be made.  It is possible to be penny wise and pound foolish, as one can see with a number of proposals made in the report.  However, we are not here to discuss the McCarthy report but the regulation of transport services.</P>
        <P>The Bill will have a big influence on development and proposed development, even in smaller towns and villages.  I hope there will be tight control of the length of time the authority will have to reply to queries sent to it by local authorities.  It is imperative that there be a maximum period of either 30 or 60 days in which to respond.  It will have to be in conjunction with the planning laws to ensure people will not find that their planning application fails because the authority has not replied within the prescribed time.  This is very important where the responsibilities of the authority are concerned.  If it is given an open-ended period of time, there will quickly be major problems with planning permission either being granted by default or refused by default due to the authority not responding.  This has happened with the NRA &mdash; queries were raised recently about the authority not replying with regard to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and a bridge in Athenry.  This matter must be examined.  These bodies must have that statutory responsibility.  They should face the same requirements as pertain in the planning laws.  In other words, if someone does not respond within the prescribed period, he or she should be precluded from having a second bite of the cherry.  The Bill does not appear to provide for a statutory responsibility to respond.</P>
        <P>A transparent system must be established for the selection of routes because without transparency major problems will arise.  The body will be required to outline the reasons an appli<Col N="97"/>cation for a licence is refused.  Licences should also be granted for a specified period of between five and ten years.  Licence periods of less than five years will not lead to competition as people would be reluctant to become involved in the process.  No one will invest in vehicles to provide services without certainty that he or she will be permitted to operate the service, subject to meeting the relevant conditions, for the lifespan of the vehicle, which is between five and ten years.</P>
        <P>It is also imperative that high standards apply to the quality of vehicles.  While I am aware that a variety of tests are carried out on vehicles, a roadworthy vehicle may not be suitable for the function for which it is licensed.  It could, for example, be uncomfortable or too large.  Some of the routes will probably only be viable if the service is provided using minibuses rather than 40 or 45 seat coaches.</P>
        <P>While I fully support the concept behind the Bill, the nitty gritty of its implementation will be of the utmost important and some fine-tuning will be required.  Individuals should have a right to appeal a decision to the Minister or, preferably, to the courts.  One can license a person to serve a route with a passenger capacity of 15 or 20 people per trip.  If one stipulates that the individual must provide a 40-seat bus on the route, he will not be able to do so.  Given the competition which will exist for these routes, one option available to those who wish to eliminate a competitor is to undertake to provide a 40-seat bus on routes where the competitor offers to provide a 20-seat bus.  While 20 seats may be more than sufficient to do the job, the individual offering to provide a 40-seat bus will secure the licence.  As his or her service will not be viable, it will fail.</P>
        <P>An open system will be required for tendering.  This could involve the use of local public notices or a requirement that individuals submit their names to be placed on the tender list.  This could avoid the considerable expense of public advertising in national and local newspapers.  All organisations have websites and even the most computer illiterate of us is able to perform basic computer tasks.  Every week, newspapers publish large public notices targeted at a limited number of people involved in the business in question.  These individuals will already be aware of the contract being advertised and others who wish to enter the business will be aware that the information they require can be downloaded from the relevant websites.</P>
        <P>Every week, Departments spend substantial sums advertising contracts.  If this money could be diverted to fund services, for which funding will soon be tightened up, it would make a considerable contribution and reduce costs.  If one lifts a national newspaper today, one will see a number of major notices on various issues.  The cost of these notices to the State is much higher than the funding provided to some of the agencies and groups involved.  While this legislation is a positive step forward, its implementation and the operation of the authority will have an important bearing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and Senators will appreciate his decision to introduce the Bill in the Seanad.  The Minister noted that he accepted a considerable number of amendments to the most recent Bill he introduced in the House.  I hope he will consider doing likewise with regard to this legislation.  Our efforts are focused on improving the Bill.</P>
        <P>I learned from my experience with the Minister when he introduced a levy on plastic bags which, as he will have noted, is due to increase to 44 cent.  At that time, I objected to the Minister&rsquo;s proposal and told him the levy would not work.  He listened to my objections and those voiced by other Members and found a solution for each of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator eat humble pie?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="98"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Minister addressed my concerns and the plastic bag levy is a good example of how to achieve a specific objective.  As a member of the boards of a couple of international bodies, I have become an advocate for similar legislation elsewhere.  I fail to understand the reason other countries have chosen not to adopt the plastic bag levy and have opted instead for other measures.</P>
        <P>The legislation before us is tricky because the Minister must take into account previous legislation, both comparatively recent in origin and Acts dating back to 1932 and 1958.  Senator Ellis noted that some of us were old enough to remember certain things.  I am not old enough to remember Dublin in the 1930s but, as my father told me, no one queued for buses at that time.  As a result, CIE appointed inspectors to visit bus stops to get people to queue.  Within a few weeks, the practice of queuing became established.  It may be necessary to have inspectors do this again because I understand some newcomers from countries without a tradition of queuing engage in battles to board buses in the centre of Dublin and elsewhere.  Perhaps we need to remind ourselves of that.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill raise the question as to what the Department of Transport does and whether we need a new quango.  We have become accustomed to establishing State agencies to perform functions previously done by Departments.  While I am an enthusiast for transferring departmental functions to State agencies, I question whether it is always the correct approach.</P>
        <P>For obvious reasons, I welcome the recognition in the Bill that we need transport to be devolved to local government rather than centralised. I am concerned, however, that the Minister has indicated his intention to give the new national transport authority a nationwide remit.  This means the new authority will be responsible for commercial bus route licensing and the allocation of public transport subventions nationally.  It will also oversee local and county development plans.  This decision runs contrary to the decision to establish the Dublin Transport Authority in the first place.  The capital needs a transportation authority, as do all large metropolitan areas.  I hope Dublin&rsquo;s needs will not be marginalised as a result of the establishment of the new national transport authority.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes many positive developments.  Are there plans for improving the service for customers of Dublin Bus or bus services in general in an upfront and tangible manner?  Ireland lags behind in certain areas, for example, in introducing a system of real time electronic timetables under which an estimated time of arrival is provided at each bus stop.  Such a system would not be difficult to introduce in such technologically advanced times.  There is already such an efficient system in place in Vienna, Austria, where the buses actually arrive at the time indicated on the electronic timetable.  I have also seen a similar system in Munich.  It is probably used in many other European cities also.  Such a system would greatly benefit bus passengers here, so I would like to know if the new national transport authority has plans to introduce a system along those lines.</P>
        <P>I note that the new head of the national transport authority has already been appointed, but surely we should also look to European cities to see how to run a transport network efficiently.  What we have had to date is a light rail system with two lines that do not interconnect, and so-called quality bus corridors, which do seem to work.  Some &euro;19 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent since 2002 on an integrated smartcard ticketing system that will not be fully available to commuters in Dublin until next year at the earliest.  I would like to know if we will be getting any real experts from Europe to show us and the national transport authority how they do it elsewhere, taking inspiration from others and adapting to what the private sector is all about.  The public sector must do the same.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With this Bill we must ensure public transport licensing for new companies is fair, efficient and speedy.  I get frustrated at the length of time things take.  As we all know, getting decisions <Col N="99"/>on such matters usually takes several months, if not years.  Perhaps an amendment is needed to the Bill to put a time limit on how long the national transport authority will have in order to consider applications for public transport licensing.  I wonder how efficient the new national transport authority will be in this respect.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the monopoly of Dublin Bus is being tackled.  The Bill recognises that its special treatment needs to end.  However, I am concerned that certain private operators could be favoured and allowed to cherry-pick their routes.  It was interesting to hear Senator Ellis who spoke about the need for tendering and avoiding political cronyism in future.</P>
        <P>When I became chairman of what was then called An Bord Phoist, which later became An Post, I could not get over the number of letters I received seeking jobs and particular favours.  I remember being very blunt in my answers, which said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Minister at the time asked me to be a bit less blunt, saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that when the local TD writes to you, he really is not expecting anything other than to be able to go back to his constituent and say &lsquo;Look, I did write to the chairman and got a letter back&rsquo;?&rdquo;  Such letters were often written in first name terms.  The Minister asked me to be less blunt, even though he said he was not expecting me to do anything.  I fear the danger of cronyism occurring at some point in the future.</P>
        <P>An efficient transport system is vital to our economy, but it is estimated that Bus &Eacute;ireann will not have a fully integrated ticketing system until 2012.  This means it will have been ten years in development.  It seems to take so long.  I hope the new NTA will be more successful in resolving such matters.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise one or two other issues.  The Minister has not indicated whether the new NTA legislation will slow down the establishment of a much-needed transport regulator for the greater Dublin area.  He has also failed to provide a timeline for establishing the NTA or to report on how it will be financed.  Perhaps the Minister did so, but I may have missed it.</P>
        <P>Many taxi drivers have indicated that they hope the development will provide an opportunity for serious reform of the regulatory system that oversees their industry.  The taxi system has been hugely improved in recent years.  It is fair to say that this is the result of work by the previous Minister, Mr. Bobby Molloy, and that his PD colleagues pushed hard for it.  I can remember attempting to bring a big conference to Dublin in 1999 or 2000.  In the week the decision was due to be made, the chief executive came from Paris and had a lovely meal.  He then asked for a taxi to his hotel but was told he might have to wait two hours because it was not possible to get one.  We must recognise the huge benefits that have come about from deregulation.  I do not have much sympathy for those taxi drivers who say it is not fair, that there are too many taxis and they have to wait too long for fares.  It is almost like saying we should put a restriction on the number of grocers because it is not fair to grocers who cannot survive because other grocers are taking business away from them.  I am fully in favour of deregulation and competition.  Those who succeed will be those who provide the best service in some form or another.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the need to cut costs, although it will have to be done.  To what extent is the free travel scheme being questioned?  I cannot remember whether it is in the report of an bord snip.  When it was introduced it was a simple decision, originally for the elderly who were to travel only in off-peak times.  Obviously, if there were empty seats it made sense to fill them.  Over the years the scheme was increased and was very welcome.  I came across somebody recently who is not badly off and who goes on holidays to Kerry for the summer.  However, because she has free travel, she always takes the train from Killarney to Dublin and the Luas to Dundrum just to visit her hairdresser.  It is a nice way to spend the day.  I mention that because there is clearly a cost to us if seats are filled and have to be used.  I am not advocating <Col N="100"/>that we should step away from free travel but perhaps it is time to examine whether we could be more efficient in operating the scheme.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s objective and believe the legislation can be improved.  I am sure the Minister will listen attentively to amendments on Committee Stage, as he has done in the past.  The Bill will be improved by such amendments.</P>

	<P>I envy the Minister his job as he will go down in history as the man who finally brought the Irish transport service up to date.  To have finally dispensed with the 1930s legislation will be as significant as the introduction of the smoking ban by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.  I am delighted this Bill is finally being produced.  Residents of Dublin in particular, but elsewhere also, have suffered as a result of outdated legislation.  I know the Minister has been trying for a long time to bring this legislation forward.  In his speech, the Minister said this was the second part of the modernisation plan for transport infrastructure.  It is long overdue.  I was delighted to hear Senator Donohoe largely welcome the Bill.  Other speakers have said it will be improved by discussion here.  I was impressed by Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s points in particular, which included matters I had not thought of.  He is right to say the Bill can be improved by the introduction of some amendments.</P>
        <P>The Minister said we need to put customers at the heart of the transport system.  He also stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">An Agreed Programme for Government in 2007, therefore, incorporated the commitment to reform bus route licensing to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, whereby both private and public service providers would be licensed and operate under the same rules.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Will both public and private operators have equality in terms of benefits?  I did not see any reference to that point in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  I am referring to the advantage public service operators have in fuel rebates, so will we see an end to that?</P>
        <P>I intend to participate in great detail in the debate on Committee State.  We finally have this Bill after 70 years and it is so important to get it right in case it takes another 70 years for the next one to be published.  We must allow flexibility in the legislation and give the authority freedom to operate as it sees fit.  I am encouraged that the Minister is cognisant that we cannot allow the current policies of public transport service providers, particularly, those operating buses, to continue.  The policies are from another era and consumers have been left high and dry.  It is intolerable that services are provided for operators, not consumers.  That is fundamental to my thinking as the Bill progresses through the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn mentioned licensing and the experience of operators in the current system whereby there is no limit on the time it takes for a licence application to be approved.  That needs to be addressed because it is unfair to keep businesses hanging on when a licence is pending.  This proposed legislation was one of the reasons for delays in approving licences recently but it has been published and a timeline needs to be provided for how long it should take to issue a licence.  I also have reservations about the granting of licences.  I refer to section 18(4), which relates to the sale of a service.  I am worried that when an operator is granted a licence, he or she can sell it on quickly.  A monopoly may recur.  We need to protect against that and I will seek to ensure that happens.</P><Col N="101"/>
        <P>I refer to the integrated ticketing issue.  All of us who have travelled to cities in Europe have experienced other public transport systems and lament our failure to introduce a similar system.  Our transport infrastructure has come on in leaps and bounds.  It is another reason I am annoyed when people say we have no legacy from the Celtic tiger era.  There is a legacy and one will experience it on public transport routes throughout the country.  When tourists visit Ireland, they find the system antiquated because they cannot transfer from one public transport service to another seamlessly.  In Belgium, for example, a user can purchase a ticket that lasts an hour and so on.  The situation is intolerable and while significant investment has been made in researching integration and problems were experienced when the current dominant bus service provider was asked to share information about bus routes, that cannot be allowed to continue.  I hope the legislation heralds an era of public transport for the public and not for the operators or their workers.  Special attention needs to be paid to how service providers can be obligated to be fully integrated.  Is the Minister thinking about this?</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe stated the Bill seems to allow for the continuation of two types of service operators for five years, although I understood the period involved to be two years.  All types of licences will eventually be uniform.  Will there be a difference between the licences given to Dublin Bus and to private operators during the two-year period?  Competition is good for all operators, including Dublin Bus, which will rise to the challenge.  When competition emerged at the Spencer Dock development site, the company recognised it was likely to lose the contract.  It upped its game and that demonstrates that when competition is introduced for a service and the incumbent is threatened with losing a licence it has held for a long time, it can up its game and put the customer first.</P>
        <P>A 24-hour bus lane should not be provided for when there is not a 24-hour service.  That does not make sense.  Can this be outlawed?  I hope the legislation will also outlaw predatory practices.  Private operators believe a cowboy operation is in place, which is not the case.  Safety standards apply uniformly to public and private transport providers but predatory practices are used by the dominant incumbent and I hope that will be outlawed.  I look forward to further discussions on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Malley for sharing time and I welcome the Minister.  I broadly accept the thrust and principle of the legislation, which is forward thinking.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s effort in bringing it forward at this time.</P>
        <P>I come from a rural area and I urge him to be kind to the rural transport system.  While it is not covered directly by the legislation, the rural transport scheme would be a significant loss to rural Ireland it if were abolished on foot of the bord snip report.  The scheme works extremely well in west Cork where I live.</P>
        <P>Will the proposed national transport authority have control over metro north?  As a tourist destination, Ireland should have had an integrated ticketing system before now and I welcome the provisions in this regard.  I hope the Minister will fast track it.</P>
        <P>How does he propose to deal with land acquisition for the underground link between Dublin Airport and the city centre?  What are the proposals?  Bord Gais built a pipeline between Kinsale and Dublin.  When the Joint Committee on the Constitution examined property rights, legislation was proposed.  The concept is one owns one&rsquo;s property from the sky to the core of the earth.  Undergrounding has legal implications where land acquisition is concerned.  Dr. Gerard Hogan, who advised the committee, believes it is possible under the Constitution to legislate that property rights would only cover the first 10 metres underground, for example, and that would allow for the fast tracking proposals for underground works.  If one had to deal with every householder between St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and the airport in the context of the underground metro, it would be a logistical nightmare.  The Minister and his officials will be <Col N="102"/>aware of this issue but it was an interesting proposal and the representatives of many transport providers were before the committee to participate in that debate on property rights.  The committee&rsquo;s report might be worth considering in that regard.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill forward.  Will the national transport authority have control over transport nationally or just in the greater Dublin area, GDA?  On the basis of the documents I have read, it will primarily deal with the GDA but in the development of policy its remit should extend nationwide.</P>
        <P>A number of bus routes in west Cork are inefficient.  Almost nobody uses one route which operates only on a Saturday and I raised this issue with CIE in Cork.  The bus was rerouted and people still did not use the service.  It is a 42-seater bus which uses particularly bad roads.  Something like a small minibus would be much more efficient.  There are probably several such routes and the situation should be examined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his officials back to the House.  I broadly welcome the publication of the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009, which has been promised by the Minister and his predecessors for many years, because it brings some sense to the whole bus licensing regime.  The time for reforming the antiquated 1932 bus licensing laws is long overdue.  The different arrangements for CIE and the private operators, as defined in the 1932 and 1958 Acts, made no sense whatsoever.  Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and private operators have often been precluded from offering new services to commuters because of the outdated and cumbersome bus licensing system overseen by the Minister and the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>The Public Transport Regulation Bill will establish a national transport authority and transfer the responsibility for bus licensing for the whole country to the NTA.  It is also proposed that the Dublin Transport Authority and the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be subsumed into the NTA.  It is to be hoped that the new NTA legislation will not slow down the establishment of a much-needed transport regulator for the greater Dublin area.  I have not seen any mention of a timeline for establishment of the NTA and some other Senators have mentioned this.  Is it in the Bill?  I would be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>The explanatory and financial memorandum states that there will be no immediate significant financial implications for the Exchequer as the authority will rely on a surplus from the Commission for Taxi Regulation to fund its operation.  I have serious reservations about this and if a body such as this is to achieve anything it must be properly resourced.  Might the effect of this be that taxi regulation licence costs will have to remain high to maintain the revenue stream necessary to fund the authority?  I would be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The new bus licensing regulations contained in the Bill will have a profound effect on public transport bus services.  Section 10 is entitled &ldquo;General provisions for the consideration of applications for grant of licenses&rdquo; and will require a good detail of teasing out on Committee Stage.  Many things contained in that section can be discussed.  There must be a level playing field in all of this and there must be no ideological bias in favour of private operators.  There must be no opportunity for cherry-picking of routes by private operators, as other Senators have said.  There must be no hiving-off of profitable bits to private operators.  There must be fair play for all operators.</P>
        <P>We saw what happened in Swords where, because of the licensing of the Swords Express, Dublin Bus was restricted from changing anything on its services out of Swords for fear of any impact on the private operator concerned.  Regulation of competition should not overly limit the possibility of a competitor modifying its service offering.  That is very important.  It is also <Col N="103"/>essential that the needs of passengers are put at the centre of bus route licensing and the Minister referred to this in his speech.  How is this to be properly addressed?  In planning legislation, with which the Minister is familiar from his past responsibilities, there is a requirement for consultation with local people on planning matters, but my sense is that in a lot of cases, while people make submissions or whatever, they are totally ignored and people do what they planned to do anyway.  I hope some mechanism is put in place so that the needs and views of people are taken into account properly.</P>
        <P>Buses can provide an excellent service if that service is properly designed in consultation with public transport users.  The people from my constituency in parts of Dublin North such as Lusk, Rush, Skerries and Balbriggan have in recent times, following the collapse of the Broadmeadow viaduct and its impact on the train service, seen what a good bus service can be like for the first time and many have taken a liking to it.  I have been out in the early mornings talking to people as they used the alternative service on offer, so I have a real sense of what people are saying.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People in Lusk and Rush, for example, while the rail service is down, no longer have to walk or drive a couple of miles to the station, find parking spaces, pay for it and have to stand all the way into the city centre.  With the alternative bus service now in place, many commuters have only a short distance to walk to the nearest bus stop to pick up a bus and have a seat on an express bus that goes through the port tunnel and gets them to work in a comfortable and speedy fashion.  I would recommend to the Minister that he request larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, in consultation with his departmental officials, to take the opportunity during the next number of months, while the viaduct is being repaired, to seriously survey commuters as to how their needs might be better met with a redesigned service.</P>
        <P>Rather than just reverting back to the services that were being offered before the viaduct collapsed, efforts should be made to try to redesign the services being offered to provide the optimum offering of a mix of rail and bus for the north Fingal travelling public.  Maximum use must be made of the port tunnel for high-speed public bus transport.  Bus and rail services must be developed continually if commuters are to be enticed out of their cars and on to public transport.  The delivery of metro north to the airport and Swords will play a significant part in all of this, but in the meantime buses will play a major part.  It was important that the Minister spoke positively about metro north and other Transport 21 infrastructure.  It was astonishing, therefore, that the Minister allowed Dublin Bus to take buses out of service during the past year.  There was much comment on that so I will not go beyond that at this point.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of John Fitzgerald, former Dublin city manager, as chairperson of the Dublin Transport Authority.  His experience of planning and development in Dublin will be of enormous benefit to the authority.  However, no sooner has the appointment been made than the Minister proposes to subsume it into the new NTA.  Is he to be chairman of the NTA?  It seems from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he is.  The Minister might clarify that issue.</P>
        <P>Although the DTA is to be subsumed into new NTA, the powers given to the DTA, such as in the areas of transport infrastructure, integrated ticketing, traffic management and land use provisions for the greater Dublin area, have not been extended to cover the rest of the country.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that.  This will mean that the NTA will have these powers in the greater Dublin area but will not have them outside this area.  I ask the Minister to explain the reasoning behind this decision because it seems strange to me.  Most of us in this House, notwithstanding certain reservations and amendments tabled and hard fought for, welcomed the Dublin Transport Authority.  It is now gone before it even starts.  When subsumed into the national transport authority, it will not have the optimal and singular focus that is required to resolve Dublin&rsquo;s transport problems.  Dublin still needs a transport authority. <Col N="104"/> I ask the Minister to clarify if it is the case that the remit of the authority remains exclusively for Dublin until it makes a recommendation to extend its remit to the rest of the country.  If so, when is that likely to happen?  Is it the case that, to all intents and purposes, the NTA remains Dublin-focused until such a recommendation is made by the authority?</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill will also see the role of the Commission for Taxi Regulation being merged into the NTA.  However it makes only few changes to the taxi regulatory regime.  The only significant change is an increase in sanctions for unlicensed taxi operation.  There is concern within the taxi industry &mdash; the Minister will be aware of this &mdash; that the current regime will lead to an oversupply of taxis in the market and there is much evidence of this already.  Many taxi drivers have informed me they hoped that the development happening in this Bill would provide an opportunity for serious reform of the failing regulatory system that oversees the taxi industry.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation does not have the power to limit the number of taxi licences and this Bill does not change the powers of the regulator in this regard.  This is unfortunate.  An opportunity has been missed and I ask the Minister to give this some consideration as I am giving consideration to tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to provide such powers for the regulator.  The powers might never be used, but if the commissioner sees fit, he or she should have available to him or her the power to act if he or she considers it appropriate.</P>
        <P>The consultative powers given to the NTA on planning guidelines are similar to the powers given to the DTA.  However, less extensive powers are given to the NTA regarding development plans and local area plans.  Why should this be so?  If it made sense for the DTA, then why not for the NTA?  Is it a question of resources and is the Minister bringing forward non-optimal legislation because of a lack of resources?  The possibility of a directly elected mayor of Dublin, which was referred to by Senator Donohoe, becoming chairperson of the Dublin Transport Authority is now gone out the window with the merging of the DTA into the NTA.  This is also unfortunate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is much to be welcomed in this Bill, but as I have said, there are some missed opportunities.  I will go into greater detail on Committee Stage.  I compliment the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on its comprehensive digest of this Bill, which has been prepared and made available in recent days.  I ask the Minister not to take too seriously Senator Quinn&rsquo;s advice that he should examine the free travel scheme.  It should be left alone.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Regardless of where people are coming from in this debate, it is clear this country&rsquo;s approach to public transport has improved in recent years.  Despite our straitened economic circumstances, the balance between expenditure on public and private transport is better than it once was.  It is nowhere near equality, but it is better.  The Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement of new Luas routes shows that this imbalance is constantly being examined.

	<P Just="Left">While he made many fair points, he was slightly disingenuous when he said he believes this Bill can solve problems in all the areas he mentioned, such as spatial planning.  I am confident that many of the issues he raised will be dealt with in parallel legislation, such as the new local government Bill and the two planning and development Bills.  The fruits of this approach are evident in the amendments that have been made to the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009.  The issue of spatial planning and the role of transport in bringing about sustainable communities are at the heart of much of our legislation.  The Bill before the House is similarly well intentioned.  I agree that the establishment of a national <Col N="105"/>transport authority is important as a precursor to our future debates on the administration of this country&rsquo;s transport policy.  We need to consider our expenditure on infrastructure and our approach to organisations like the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency.  I would like to see more cohesion in the latter instance.  There may be scope for a single entity to be developed.  The Bill before the House allows such matters to be considered in the medium and long terms.  I agree with Senator Ryan that much of our transport policy has developed in a radial fashion from Dublin to the rest of the country.  As a representative of this country&rsquo;s second major urban centre, I believe there continues to be a huge imbalance despite the additional resources that have been used to improve the scale of our public transport network and to offer more public transport choices in all our major urban centres.  I hope this can be addressed through the establishment of a national transport authority.  The provision in this Bill to integrate the Commission for Taxi Regulation with the authority has its own inherent logic.  We need an integrated approach to transport if we are to achieve sustainable policies in the transport area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Donohoe started his contribution to this debate by saying the devil was in the detail.  Many people would agree with the Minister that public transport routes and choices need to be expanded greatly.  We can have a debate on who should provide public transport services.  Consideration needs to be given to the effect of the introduction of new routes on the network in general.  The introduction of additional routes, which would offer more opportunities and allow more people to use public transport, needs to be done in a cautious and careful manner.  I hope the national transport authority can facilitate that.  Existing routes that are viable may be undermined if people choose other options.  The need to strike a balance in such cases is at the heart of this legislation.  I hope the Minister will examine such detail on Committee Stage to ascertain how the Bill can be made more effective in this regard.  I generally welcome the broad precepts of this legislation.  I recognise that it is part of a package of measures that aim to make this country&rsquo;s transport system better and more democratic.  The Bill is based on an acceptance that we need sustainable planning if we are to avoid repeating many of the mistakes that were made in this country in recent decades.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  I would like to give a broad welcome to the intent of this Bill.  I would like to speak about a couple of aspects of the rural transport issue.  My colleagues have already highlighted some of the points I intended to make.  A recent Central Statistics Office survey emphasised the real need to retain the rural transport service, which offers rural people a consistent means of accessing local services.  When I used local buses over recent weeks, I realised that it can be difficult for rural people who may live eight or ten miles from an urban centre or even a village to access shops or doctors&rsquo; surgeries.  It brought it home to me that people in rural areas, especially older people, can be discriminated against in the transport sector.  An elderly person in Dublin can hop on a bus at any time to access basic services, such as the local doctor or pharmacy.  People in rural Ireland, by contrast, are lucky if they can use public transport to go to town or visit the doctor once a week.  I appreciate how important are such services.  I compliment Pobal and the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on the service that is provided.  However, it would be better if there were more co-operation between Pobal and the Department of Transport.  Perhaps it would be more efficient if the Department were to oversee the whole programme and take the rural transport service on board.  I would appreciate if the Minister could comment on that.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to respond to Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments on the spatial strategy.  Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore, which are deemed to be gateway towns under the strategy, would have a very good public transport service if the political will existed to develop the rail link between Mullingar and Athlone, which was not included in Transport 21.  Given that the Bill before the House is about controlling passenger services, this is an appropriate <Col N="106"/>time to ask the Minister to include the rail link between Mullingar, which is the county town of Westmeath, and Athlone, which has the county&rsquo;s institute of technology, in the Transport 21 plan.  The bus service between the towns, both of which are deemed to be gateways under the national spatial strategy, is very poor.  The development of the line would also link Sligo to Athlone by rail.  I ask the Minister to comment on that issue and also on the possibility of reopening Killucan railway station, an issue with which he is very familiar.  If the station in question were used to serve those who commute into Dublin, it would help the people of north Westmeath and south-west Meath to access Dublin conveniently.  I advocate that as something the Minister should do.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to labour the points that have already been made by other speakers.  There should be greater consultation with the general public and community groups.  Needs assessments should be conducted when decisions are being taken about the locations of bus stops etc.  As a result of the economic downturn, many people are accessing education in local colleges because they cannot afford to live in the greater Dublin area or in other cities.  I learned last week that 20 students from the Rochfortbridge area use the Dublin to Galway inter-city bus service to get to Athlone each day.  It makes no sense that the bus stops at the bus station but not at the institute of technology.  The students have to walk two miles from the bus station to the institute.  If more students were able to use this very good service, more families would make savings.  Economies of scale would also improve as bus usage increased.</P>
        <P>I read a disturbing article in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Evening Herald</i> about taxi men and women &mdash; mostly men &mdash; who are being put to the pin of their collars.  They are so unregulated that I question whether it is right to allow this many taxis.  I am concerned about the poor unfortunate people who are trying to earn a crust and that suicide rates among taxi drivers have risen.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Minister for his contribution and welcome the bones of this Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank all those who have contributed to the debate and welcome the constructive approach adopted by Senators.  As I indicated, my intention in bringing the Bill is to improve the provision of transport services throughout the country.  Through this debate and our deliberations on Committee Stage, I hope the Bill can be further improved.  I am grateful to Senators for raising issues with a view to ensuring the Bill will improve the licensing regime and at the end of the day provide a better public transport system.  I do not wish to discuss the issues raised in great detail because it is better to tease them out on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the McCarthy report&rsquo;s recommendations on the rural transport programme.  All the recommendations in the McCarthy report will be considered and put before Cabinet before decisions are made.  I am aware of the value of the rural transport programme which is financed by my Department and administered through Pobal.  The programme did not meet favour in official circles for many years but my predecessors as Minister for Transport, the late Seamas Brennan and Deputies O&rsquo;Rourke and Cullen, progressed it from a pilot scheme to its current form.  It has been further expanded since I came to the Department and I have secured extra funding for it despite the economic crisis we have been facing since last year.  The Government makes its decisions collectively and I will not be making a statement one way or the other until we consider the programme.  I urge those who are making definitive statements that the programme has been discontinued to desist because they are only increasing anxieties, especially among the elderly.  If the decision is ultimately made to discontinue the service, they can then make their party political broadcasts.  I do not refer to anybody in this Chamber.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we should wait until a decision is made.</P>
        <P>It is not true to say the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government returned no observation.  We held extensive discussions with that Department in regard to land use and transport nationally.  The approach we adopted is a result of these discussions.  As we proceed in this area, we will encounter resource and finance implications which cannot be met immediately but it is the intention in the Bill that land use and transport policies will be co-ordinated and the national transport authority will play a role in this.</P>
        <P>The Government has not even seen the heads of a Bill on directly elected mayors and I cannot provide in this legislation for something that is not yet in existence.  It is our intention, however, that a directly elected mayor will have a role in transport in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Several Senators raised the issue of taxis.  There was a time in this city and elsewhere around the country when it was impossible to get a taxi.  The service was so bad that it affected our economic competitiveness.  We now have a large number of taxis and the service has greatly improved.  The current difficulties faced by taxi drivers are not solely due to the increase in the number of taxis.  The general economic situation is affecting all businesses, including taxi services, and it would be wrong to take a knee-jerk reaction such as imposing a moratorium on licences.  I acknowledge that certain issues need to be addressed.  Senator Ellis and others raised the issue of people with other jobs cherry-picking lucrative hours.  These issues have been subject to consultation and are being considered by the taxi regulator and the taxi advisory council.  The regulator has made proposals for dealing with these issues and I will carefully consider the positive proposals I am confident will emerge.</P>
        <P>Senators Ellis, Donohoe and O&rsquo;Donovan raised the issue of licensing, which we will discuss in greater detail on Committee Stage.  The principle is straightforward in that the same licensing regime will apply to everybody, unlike the present regime whereby a separate licence operates for public and private transport operators.  It is important this message is sent.  Although the CIE group of companies will continue to operate subsidised routes for an initial period, any new routes will be subject to open tender by the private sector.  That is the level playing field we wish to create.  A transition period of between two and five years will apply to ensure we continue to have an operational public transport system.  It is not easy to change systems overnight, partly because those private operators who are interested in providing services would need time to make preparations.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators mentioned the possibility of introducing an appeals mechanism in the context of licence applications.  It is certainly a matter we can tease out, as it is an important one, as are the points made about the need for character references and full vetting of persons who provide public transport services.  That is in place but we will see if we can make the provision a little clearer, or perhaps stronger, in the legislation.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by a number of Senators of making routes and the licensing system transparent and obvious to everybody, when we delve into the detail of the legislation on Committee Stage, Senators will find that, between them, the primary legislation and the guidelines to be issued will meet their requirements for openness and transparency.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Quinn, raised questions on whether the NTA would be able to introduce an integrated ticketing system and whether there would be real-time passenger information etc.  In both instances, the answer is yes; the NTA will be responsible in that regard.  There is already real-time passenger information and we are well advanced with the integrated ticketing project, on which trials are starting.  The system will be rolled out during the course of 2010.</P>
        <P>When the Bill, under which the National Transport Authority will be established, is passed, Mr. John Fitzgerald who has been appointed chairman of the DTA will be chairperson of the new national authority.  The chief executive of the DTA will become its chief executive.  We are providing for these changes in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I was asked whether the licences would be the same.  They will be in the sense that the application and the guidelines to be applied in deciding on them will be the same.  I take the point made by Senators about stipulating timeframes for the making of decisions; it is a matter at which we will look closely.  Everything about the licence will be the same, as will the period of the licences.  In that regard, I take the point made by Senator Ellis, that people must be assured of some economic return and that the period of the licence ought not be too short.</P>
        <P>In answer to a point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Malley, the Bill deals with predatory practices.  A new regime of penalties for those found in breach of the licensing law is being put in place in the Bill.  At present, it actually pays to ignore the law on bus service licensing.  There are examples in this regard because the level of fines is so ridiculous.</P>
        <P>To respond to a number of the points made by Senator Ryan, specifically on redesigning services, I have received positive reports from the Fingal area on the level of service provided and the flexibility shown by the new services in the absence of a rail service.  That is exactly what I am trying to get Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to do on an ongoing basis, namely, to react to the market and provide services where they are needed.  In this regard I seek the support of Members of the House.  In fairness, there are changes being implemented following the Deloitte review such as changes to routes which will mean changes in the frequency of services, etc.  That is what we need from the public transport system, namely, flexibility, not a belief that just because one has been operating on a particular route for the past 25 years one should not be discommoded by having to take in 500 new houses in an estate.  Flexibility, responding to the customer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  As the Senator knows and as the Minister has said many times before, the Government will decide on the various recommendations that have been submitted to it, and which are mentioned in this question, in due course.  The Minister understands that Gaeltacht communities view the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs as being very important, particularly the activity and support schemes of both the Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht.  Some of these schemes, such as the Irish language learners&rsquo; scheme, have been in existence for many years.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The summer colleges not only support the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and nationally, but also boost the Gaeltacht economy.  Without those colleges, the Gaeltacht would be a far poorer place.  The Irish colleges also foster mutual support and goodwill towards the language on a national basis.  It is vital that the accommodation of summer college students in their homes be advantageous to Gaeltacht families.  The language-centred Irish college industry greatly enhances the tourism industry in the Gaeltacht and provides significant earnings for the Gaeltacht communities whose household and community language is Irish.  The Irish colleges also have a positive effect on young people in the Gaeltacht with regard to how they use the language themselves.  Many of them work in Irish colleges during the summer, which illustrates to them the advantages of the language, in turn preserving the language among them.  The youth of the Gaeltacht see that their peers from other parts of the country are inspired to learn the language and are more inclined to speak it among themselves. Responsibility for the question of education in the Gaeltacht rests with the Minister for Education and Science and there is full co-operation between my Department and the Department of Education and Science in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having said that, the Department administers certain schemes that support the language in the Gaeltacht through the education system.  These schemes are reviewed regularly.  Support is also provided for Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge in NUI Galway which has a central role in community development and in preserving the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.  The Minister understands very well, therefore, the importance of education in preserving the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware also that a Government committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, is currently preparing a 20-year strategy for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, understands the support needed by the Gaeltacht communities to sustain and develop their own language.  The policy statement published by the Government in 2006 contained the Government&rsquo;s vision for the language.  The 20-year strategy will aim to develop that vision and designate a strategy to implement it.</P><Col N="112"/>
        <P>With regard to sustaining &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s enterprise responsibilities, the Minister would like to remind the Senator that the Department carried out a comprehensive review of the powers and functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2006 to amend, as appropriate, the legislation under which the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s operates.  The Minister invited the public to submit proposals to the Department as part of that review process.  A total of 67 submissions were received from the public in that regard.  The public submissions were independently analysed and the public&rsquo;s opinion will be taken into account if changes are to be made to the structures under which &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta operates.  The current situation regarding this matter is that the issue is being considered in the context of the discussions of the Government committee relating to the 20-year strategy to which I referred.</P>
        <P>I do not believe anyone could question the Government&rsquo;s commitment with regard to the investment made in the Gaeltacht and on the islands in recent years and the improvements that have taken place in those areas as a result of that.  Ten years ago there was a huge lack of capital infrastructure on the islands, especially with regard to piers, roads, recreational centres and coastal protection.</P>
        <P>The State has spent more than &euro;100 million on the development of infrastructure on the islands from 1998 to date.  A total of &euro;11 million has been spent in Donegal, &euro;20 million in Mayo, &euro;7 million in Cork and &euro;62 million in Galway, where most of the populated islands are.  This does not include the extra funding provided as joint funding from the county councils or specific expenditure from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or other State Departments and organisations.  The result of this expenditure is evident throughout the country from Donegal to Cork.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has invested continually in the development of the physical and social infrastructure of the Gaeltacht for many years.  Evidence of this can be seen in the many facilities available such as community halls, Irish colleges and playing pitches.  Under the strategic roads scheme significant development has taken place on the network of main roads in the Gaeltacht.  The Minister is proud of the progress made with regard to these developments in the Gaeltacht and on the islands.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, we face many challenges in our current economic climate and with the world economy as it stands.  The Senator will understand that it cannot be stated in the current climate that no cutbacks will take place in the various sectors that fall within the remit of responsibility of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, but it can be said that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Gaeltacht, the Irish language and the islands is evident and it will continue to strive to improve the quality of life of those communities and to reinforce the Irish language as a household and community language for the generations to come.</P>

        <P>The Senator made a valid point that the question was put in Irish.  With the way the business of the Houses is conducted, relatively short notice of this was given.  Had it been possible, the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, would have responded in Irish quite competently as the Senator would be aware, but unfortunately he was not in a position to be here because the way of the business is conducted.

    <Title>Medical Cards. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter because it has been brought to my attention that the HSE plans to centralise the processing of all applications for medical cards in Dublin.  A pilot project has been established since 1 September 2009 and the new system is called the primary care reimbursement system.  I have grave reservations about this change because I believe it will lead to chaos and confusion for medical card applicants.</P>
        <P>When the automatic entitlement to a medical card for those over the age of 70 was removed earlier this year, the processing of applications for medical cards was centralised.  Applicants have experienced long delays and elderly people have experienced poor access in terms of a response to queries because of this system.</P>
        <P>A constituent brought to my attention the case of his father who was born in 1918 and was moving from Dublin to live in a nursing home close to him in Athlone.  The man&rsquo;s family only realised that his medical card had been cancelled when his general practitioner requested a &euro;50 fee.  The man did not receive any communication from the centralised primary care reimbursement system advising him of that.  I do not want this system to be a reflection of our society in terms of the way we treat our people who are vulnerable, sick, or less well off.  Our health service must be patient-centred and must always act in the interests of the sick and vulnerable person.</P>
        <P>The centralising of the processing of applications for medical cards will make the service slower and less accessible for all our citizens.  It will dramatically reduce the system&rsquo;s responses to citizens, GPs and politicians.  Neither I nor the Minister of State will have adequate access <Col N="114"/>to it, although the Minister of State who is based in Dublin will probably find it easier than I to do so.  It is discriminatory that it is not easy for rural-based politicians to check and monitor progress on the processing of an application for a medical card.</P>
        <P>The new system will remove flexibility and safeguards from the process.  Staff in the local office were able to proof an address.  The local staff in the office in Athlone, from where I come, know every street and area in the town.  Matters requiring such knowledge cannot be dealt with in Dublin.</P>
        <P>There is also the aspect of the depersonalising of the service.  I am speaking on behalf of elderly people.  Not everybody has access to e-mail nor can everybody communicate even by telephone.  There are people, in particular in lower socioeconomic categories, who do not have access to these technologies.  I gave an example already of a man born in 1918 who did not even receive a letter from the Health Service to say that his medical card was being cancelled and who was requested by staff at the local office to bring in a utility bill as proof of address.  How does a person with no son, daughter or relative to assist him or her at aged 89 or 90 years do this?  I earnestly and fervently request that the service remain as is.  I believe the local administrators do an excellent job in terms of medical card applications.  I will be fighting this move tooth and nail.  There is no question of this service being better for the patient or that replacement of the current medical card applications service will benefit from a depersonalised, nameless, faceless service in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and general practitioner, GP, visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE, and is determined following an examination of the means of an applicant and his or her dependants.  Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the 32 local health areas. However, under the HSE&rsquo;s 2009 service plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will be centralised and will transfer to the executive&rsquo;s primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Dublin.  The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 years or over.  This phased implementation will allow the HSE to monitor the situation and, if required, modify it to address any issues arising.</P>
        <P>The decision by the HSE to centralise the processing of applications has been made in the context of the requirement to realise savings in this very challenging economic environment.  The change will provide an enhanced standardised service to the client population.  It will deliver services for the public within sustainable levels of expenditure and has the aim of achieving efficiencies by the greater usage of shared services.  Centralised processing of medical card applications will result in a more consistent and transparent approach being applied and will not have an adverse impact on patient care or the quality of service provided.  There will also be no adverse affect on the assessment of people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but who have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours.  The HSE has advised the Department of Health and Children that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices.  These offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature relating to the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process and, along with the executive&rsquo;s national helpline, will deal with inquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitle<Col N="115"/>ments and completion of application forms.  However, the process will involve a reassignment of existing human resources within the HSE.</P>
        <P>This is a good example of the type of innovation signalled in the transforming public services programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.  I fully support the HSE&rsquo;s decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented the measure will ensure an improved turnaround time for the processing of applications, equitable application of eligibility throughout the country, consistency of service provision to customers, clearer lines of governance and accountability and improved unified data.</P>
        <P>The number of persons with a medical card has increased by more 290,000 since the start of 2005.  More than 1.43 million people are now covered by the card.  In addition, more than 93,000 people have a GP visit card.</P>

    <Title>Legislative Programme. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion relates to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 rushed through this House on 14 July, at which time we had a long debate on the need for proper examination and thorough vetting of the legislation.  However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was insistent that this legislation could not wait and that a breakthrough in terms of tackling gangland crime was imminent by the enforcement authorities and as such this legislation had to be put in place immediately.</P>
        <P>The Minister previously stated that legislation in regard to tackling gangland crime was adequate.  A continuation of gangland wars and the death of innocent people led to a great deal of debate in this and the other House and a recognition by the Minister that further legislation was needed.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 was then rushed through the Oireachtas.  The Minister during the debate in this House on 14 July stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have heard some comments in recent weeks that the passage of the legislation should be delayed until September ... were the Government to wait until September, no one could be charged in the meantime with any of the proposed new offences [of being a member or a leader of a criminal gang].</P><Col N="116"/>
        <P FLI="0">In this regard, I am asking what actions have been taken pursuant to enactment of that legislation which justify and vindicate the Minister rushing it through this House?  In raising this motion, I acknowledge the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies in terms of their co-ordinated raids on many premises as announced on 20 August.  However, <i>The Irish Times</i> report in that regard specifically states that the searches were not specifically carried out under the new Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 which created new offences in regard to membership or direction of a criminal gang.  The Garda is doing its work and has had other major successes in confiscating and recovering serious amounts of drugs as announced on 19 September.  What actions have been taken pursuant to enactment of the legislation given the Minister&rsquo;s insistence a full debate on it in this House was not necessary and that it was required instantly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  </P>
        <P>The debate in this House on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 was useful and informed.  It is even more of a shame, therefore, against the background of the grave threat posed by criminal gangs to our communities and the death and destruction they have wreaked, that Senator Regan should respond simply by seeking to cause mischief.  That does little service either to this House or the victims of these gangs.  In taking this approach the Senator echoes points made by Deputy Rabbitte in the other House earlier this week.  Such a display of political unity would be a little more impressive were it not for the fact that Fine Gael and the Labour Party took diametrically opposed positions on the Bill, differing completely in their approaches to one of the gravest situations facing the country.</P>
        <P>The case for the early enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill was compelling.  Had the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sufficient evidence in recent months to charge someone with offences created under the Act and had we failed to bring the legislation into force on time, we would have been guilty of a gross dereliction of duty.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s basic proposition seems to be that because nobody has yet been charged under the provisions of the legislation, it would not matter if it had not yet been enacted, thus allowing the debate on its provisions to continue in this House.  Even by the Senator&rsquo;s standards, that is an extraordinary assertion.</P>
        <P>The legislation in question was signed into law on 23 July and it would be completely unrealistic to expect arrests and convictions to have been secured under it at this stage.  It was precisely because there was an inevitable time lag between legislation coming into force and its yielding results that it was so important to have the legislation, together with that relating to surveillance, enacted before the summer recess.  If that had not been done, the Garda would have been deprived in recent months of the opportunity to take action designed to lead to convictions under both items of legislation.</P>
        <P>The Garda cannot act on the basis of what legislation may eventually emerge from the Oireachtas.  It can only proceed to prepare cases on the basis of enacted legislation.  Those cases must be prepared painstakingly in order that they will stand up in court.  Senator Regan is better acquainted than most in this House with the requirements of our legal system.  That he should seek to hide that knowledge in an effort to score cheap and baseless points on a very serious subject is a matter for him.  However, he must know that his basic proposition which amounts to saying that when one finishes a project has nothing to do with when one starts it is nonsense.  He knows well too that it is a fundamental principle that criminal legislation cannot be retrospective.  As such, the idea that it does not matter when legislation is enacted is absurd.</P><Col N="117"/>
        <P>In an attempt to ground this discussion in reality I am pleased to inform the House that against the background of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act the Garda has launched a series of operations designed to disrupt the activities of gangs and gather evidence for use under the new legislative measures.  Information on some of these operations which involved raids and searches is in the public domain.  It would clearly be counterproductive to provide details in respect of surveillance operations, nor would it be helpful to offer a running public commentary on the actions the Garda is taking against specific gangs.  However, the House is entitled to know that the force is determined to use to the full the measures passed by the Oireachtas prior to the summer recess to support it in its efforts to counteract the activities of these gangs.  The Garda has been extremely active in the light of the enactment of these legislative provisions.  As well as undertaking the operations I have mentioned, it has received legal advice on how best to proceed in what by any standards is new legal terrain.  A major conference was recently held in Templemore at which Garda management concentrated on how best to target these gangs in the light of the new legislation.</P>
        <P>Selective quotations by Senator Regan do not detract from the fact that the Government has always made it clear that these legislative measures, important though they are, do not represent a panacea against gang crime.  The fight against criminal gangs will inevitably be a long one.  What the Government has done is to ensure the Garda has the resources, both legal and otherwise, to take on the gangs.  The Government is not responsible for media speculation.  However, it is worth pointing out that the fundamental point of much of what has been reported is accurate, namely, that the enactment of these items of legislation has equipped the Garda to take on gangs in ways it has been unable to do heretofore.  That is precisely what it is doing.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan knows well that it is laughable to suggest the effectiveness of any legislation can be judged a mere several weeks after it was passed into law.  What is more troubling is that he seems to be of the view that in the profoundly important business of protecting the community procrastination should be substituted for determination and cynicism may be passed off as strategy.</P>

I intend to continue to raise questions about whether legislation passed by the Oireachtas is being properly implemented.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, specifically insisted there could be no delay in the enactment of the legislation to which I referred and that its provisions would be implemented during the summer.  That has not happened.  I remind the Minister of State that Fine Gael supported this legislation in both Houses.  Moreover, my party was calling for the introduction of these measures a long time before the Bill in question was introduced.  </P>

	<P>I remind the Senator that he should put a brief supplementary question to the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State said the Government was not responsible for media speculation.  On the contrary, the Minister issued a significant number of statements to the media &mdash; or they were at least attributed to him &mdash; indicating there would be a wholesale rounding up during the summer months of those involved in criminal gangs.  That did not happen.  Whether it will happen in the next three months or six months, we must wait and see.  The question I have raised is legitimate and I intend to hold the Minister to account now that the legislation is in place to tackle gangland crime.  We will continue to monitor the results.</P>

	<P>To reiterate, since the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill on 23 July, the Garda has launched a series of operations based on the legislation.  As I said, the force has sought legal advice on the implementation of this new legislation and a conference took place in Templemore to examine how best to proceed on the basis of its provisions.</P>
