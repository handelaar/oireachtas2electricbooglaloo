	<P>I have received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a statement on the low level of cryptosporidium contamination in the water supply in the Bantry area; the steps he proposes to prevent this happening again; the stage at which the Bantry regional water scheme is at present; the amount spent on the scheme in the past seven years and when the new scheme will begin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine how a system to allow tenants in existing voluntary housing schemes to buy out their houses might be introduced similar to that which applies to local authority tenants in view of the fact that social housing is funded by the State and that many of the tenants of these existing schemes are seeking a transfer to local authority houses purely to be able to access the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an update on his position on Educate Together&rsquo;s request to be recognised as a patronage body for second level schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify that the home support service will be protected, given the importance of the service to the disabled and the elderly in County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify if Col&aacute;iste na Coiribe, Galway city, will be included in the next PPP bundle and when this is likely to take place in order that the school may proceed to meet the large pupil enrolment on waiting lists for accommodation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">An g&aacute; leis an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, i bhfianaise na gciorruithe 58% n&oacute; &euro;50 milli&uacute;n at&aacute; molta ag an bord snip nua don Ghaeltacht agus do na hoile&aacute;in, dearbh&uacute; a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge go mbeidh an Rialtas ag seasamh leis na c&uacute;ig phrionsabal i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify whether, in the light of the Lisbon treaty &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; on the right to life, the family and education or otherwise, the European Commission would have any competence to challenge legislation in Ireland, should such ever be proposed, along the lines of the Lithuanian law on the protection of minors against the detrimental effect of public information, which legislation has led to Lithuania being censured by the European Parliament, and to clarify whether, in the event that the European Commission sought to challenge a member state on such a law, the Irish Government would oppose such interference.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Eugene Regan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify whether a fault has been discovered in the lion intoxilyser and a notification issued from the Chief Prosecution Solicitor to persons convicted in D&uacute;n Laoghaire District Court of an offence under section 13(2) of the Road Traffic Act 1994 concerning a failure to provide breath specimens that they may appeal their convictions and that if they choose to do so, the State will not oppose such appeals and, in particular, if he will clarify the nature of the fault and the effect of this fault in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other parts of the country in terms of the number of convictions which may be affected and how long this fault has been known to him and the authorities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Defence to give an appraisal on whether the bomb disposal unit should be returned to Finner, given the recent heightened security threats generally in Ulster.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to revise the plan of the HSE to replace local services with a centralised application system for medical cards.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline her plans for a rehabilitation hospital in Cork as this new facility is required as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Michael McCarthy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide enough resources to allow Cork County Council to deal with the toxic sea lettuce growing on the west Cork coastline.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Walsh, Fitzgerald, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Healy Eames, Doherty, Mullen, Regan, Keaveney, McFadden and Buttimer as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Walsh and Fitzgerald and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator McCarthy as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter which is one for Cork County Council.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, why does the Minister have official responsibility for traces of cryptospiridium in the water at Bantry but no official responsibility for toxic sea lettuce which is destroying the environmental health and tourism in west Cork?  Why does he have responsibility for one and not the other?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made a decision on that matter and am not discussing it now.  I call the Leader on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business"> 
    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Before starting the Order of Business, I wish to acknowledge the sad passing of former Seanad colleagues Willie Kenneally, Joe Doyle, Nuala Fennell and Dominic Murphy.  I will be in contact with their families and group leaders in the House to allow tributes to be paid at the appropriate time to mark the sad passing of our dear colleagues.</P>
        <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re allocation of time, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and adjourned not later than 6 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 3, statements on the economy, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2, to conclude not later than 8 p.m. if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes, on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called upon not later than 7.50 p.m., prior to the conclusion of the debate, for his concluding comments and to take questions from leaders and spokespersons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Why have the writs not been moved for current vacancies in the Seanad?  Is this yet another example of paralysis between the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il in Government?  Are we awaiting the outcome of negotiations on the programme for Government before this can be done?  Will the Leader explain why Private Members&rsquo; Business has been dropped from the Order of Business today?  I do not know if that is for the same reason, because he is worried about support from the Green Party on a financial motion in Private <Col N="4"/>Members&rsquo; time.  It is unusual for the Seanad not to have Private Members&rsquo; time on the first sitting day after the recess.</P>
        <P>This paralysis is typical of the Government&rsquo;s approach to decision making.  Earlier today, we heard the T&aacute;naiste raise doubts again about the McCarthy report, while the Taoiseach did so on the report of the Commission on Taxation.  One must ask where the leadership on decision making in Government resides at this stage.</P>
        <P>I indicate in particular the report last week from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The figures in it are quite astounding.  When one thinks of the pressure individual families are under at the moment, with them facing negative equity and queuing outside social welfare offices to get small sums of money, while on the other hand we saw in the figures quoted in the report last week a total of &euro;320 million not being recovered from patients using public hospitals, a contract initially valued at &euro;2 million costing &euro;97 million, and millions of euro were spent on electronic voting, it is no wonder people are disillusioned and are losing faith in politics and government.  What assurances can the Leader give the House that lessons have been learned from these reports?  What changes are taking place in government to ensure better economic management of taxpayers&rsquo; money?</P>
        <P>Doubts are increasing about NAMA and individuals are asking why more than &euro;30 billion or 40% of the total NAMA bonds should be diverted to two broken financial institutions &mdash; Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  How will these broken financial institutions provide credit in the future?  What is it like for individuals who are told this enormous amount will go to these institutions while they struggle to access money for their businesses or to pay their mortgages?</P>
        <P>I oppose the Order of Business because of the refusal to take Private Members&rsquo; Business, which is an Opposition motion.  I would like to move an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to explain his comments earlier this year when he cut provision in schools for children with mild disabilities.  He stated he would guarantee that where additional teachers were needed, they would be provided.  Fine Gael found out today in a reply to a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 that 200 additional support teachers would be needed to meet the needs of these children in mainstream classes.  This is completely contrary to the Minister&rsquo;s statement earlier this year.  Many parents have found the supports are not available in their children&rsquo;s classrooms but we were told by the Minister that the decision would have no impact on children and their families.  However, the Department says 200 additional support teachers are needed to support the children in mainstream classrooms.  I would like the Minister to explain this to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we have an opportunity to discuss the economy later.  However, I would like to refer to the issue of public sector bashing, which is giving pleasure to some of the people who got us into this trouble.  IBEC was first in the queue.  Has the media forgotten that the six largest members of IBEC &mdash; our large banks and financial institutions &mdash; got us into this mess?  IBEC and the media seem to have forgotten all about that.  IBEC, sitting atop a &euro;60 billion brass neck, is now talking down to the rest of us about how we should do our business and about how something in which they had no hand, act or part should be taken out on teachers, nurses, postmen, firefighters and civil servants.  If health and education services could be supplied at a cheaper rate than is the case currently, Ryanair schools and clinics would pop up all over the country.  We should realise that.  The CPSU is the largest public sector union and the average pay of its members is &euro;29,000 a year.  I do not have a problem with the Government addressing the public sector but it better do so in a refined and understanding fashion, otherwise people will be unable to stand back and take it.</P><Col N="5"/>
        <P>I generally support NAMA but it will lead to an extraordinary imbalance in the sense that it will not deal with mortgage holders and others.  We cannot surely countenance a scenario long term where, on the one hand, most of us will have to work hard to keep the necessary banking arrangements going in the economy while, on the other, supporting those who will foreclose on decent people who through no fault of their own can no longer meet their mortgage repayments even though this was caused in the main by the same people who will take their property.  That is unacceptable.  The matter is dealt with in other countries.  In France, for example, if the mortgagee is genuinely under too much pressure, the mortgage period is lengthened or other changes can be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>I have listened today to farmers and the problems of small businesses.  It may well be that the Government will have to look again at the issue of price controls.  Fair play to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, for what he said, but he has been saying it for six months.  What is he doing about the matter?  There is no point in saying what Tesco and others should be doing.  If they are not doing it, we should be taking action to make sure they do.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In the meantime, I would like us to have a discussion on the public sector and what it is contributing to the economy in order that those working within it would see there is respect for them in some parts of public life.</P>
        <P>During the summer the Leader of the House issued a statement on Seanad reform.  Is he ready for it?  We know about the University Senators and will go along with it.  What about the next reform?  There has been no word about it.  The media hopped onto it and it is the one issue on which everyone is agreed.  A House in respect of which every citizen of the State does not have a vote in its construction is no longer acceptable in a democracy.  The McCarthy report is correct.  The Seanad either needs to be reformed or abolished.  That is the end of the matter.</P>
        <P>I would like the House to note, with some sadness on these benches, that we have lost one of our illustrious Members who has moved slightly forward and to the right.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In so far as Senator O&rsquo;Toole is allowed to express his sadness at the loss of Senator Bacik to the Labour Party benches, I note with great pleasure that she has joined us on them.  I am sure she will impress and prosper as much as she did on the other benches which, I notice, have been augmented by another Senator.  We were not informed about that before the House met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, we were informed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent Senators well in the forthcoming session.</P>
        <P>Before we went away for the summer we were told three major reports would be published during the holiday period to which we should all pay attention, which we should all read, understand and be ready to debate when we returned to the House.  They were the report on the outline of the legislation on NAMA which has been published, the report of the McCarthy <Col N="6"/>commission and the report of the Commission on Taxation.  These three important documents which were flagged at the start of the summer were to form the basis of the debate we would have in the Houses and the broader community on the future of the economy and the country generally.</P>
        <P>It has been made clear to the people in the NAMA report how serious, fundamental and historic the exposure of taxpayers will be to the wrongdoing of others.  Every time an issue was raised in the Houses about taxation or taxation policy we were told by Senator Boyle and others that it was a matter for the Commission on Taxation.  If I heard that once, I heard it 50 times in my two short years in the House.  I will go further than Senator Fitzgerald and say it is not just that the Taoiseach appears to have sidelined the report, rather it has been abandoned.  The report of the commission has been jettisoned by the Government and we are now asked to accept that it will play no part in forming policy, but that the Government will pick one good proposal from it, namely, the proposal on carbon tax, and abandon the rest.  When we ask whether it is a good idea to have a debate on taxation and public services, Senator Boyle will not be able to say the answer will be found in the report of the commission or that the report will form the basis of our discussion because it has been jettisoned.</P>
        <P>I will also go further than Senator Fitzgerald regarding the McCarthy report and what happened today.  Two things were said by Ministers about the report.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said it would form a key part of budgetary strategy, while the T&aacute;naiste said large parts of it did not make sense.  Can anybody explain which of those two positions is the Government&rsquo;s?  Does the report not make sense, as the T&aacute;naiste has said?  Should we take it seriously, as the Minister for Finance has suggested?  At the start of the summer, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said the Opposition would have nowhere to hide when the report was published.  His own colleagues have spent the summer looking for somewhere to hide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ministers, Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Cullen, do not like the report.  The T&aacute;naiste does not like it.  When people come into the Gallery of this House, they wonder how Senators on the Government side very often make speeches that disagree with Government policy.  I remind them that senior Ministers are making a laughing stock of their own Government.  They are contributing further to what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, quite correctly described a couple of weeks ago when he bemoaned the complete breakdown in trust in this country&rsquo;s Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Senator Boyle will agree that it will be sorted out when the programme for Government is renegotiated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>He cannot comment.  He is muzzled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Members not to make Second Stage speeches on the Order of Business, especially as 22 Senators have indicated they wish to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the summer recess, I asked the Leader to arrange a debate on the report that was compiled by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government following its visit to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland to examine the manner in which the electoral register for that jurisdiction is compiled.  I am sure we will hear the usual barrage of complaints about this country&rsquo;s register in the aftermath of the upcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the matter <Col N="7"/>as soon as possible, so Senators on all sides can make positive and welcome suggestions about how our register of electors can be improved.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention, in the context of the forthcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty, that a former Member of this House, Mr. Des Hanafin, has issued a statement on the position on abortion that is held by certain groups.  The comments of the former Senator, who is a long-standing champion of the right to life of the unborn, should clarify in the minds of everyone that this referendum will not facilitate abortion.  Just as there is none so blind as he who will not see, however, there is none so deaf as he who will not hear.  It is important that the former Senator Hanafin has made his statement and that a Catholic bishop has made similar comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Leader about the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) (Amendment) Bill 2009, which has been on the Order Paper since before the summer recess.  We are well aware that this country&rsquo;s legislation on the investigation of corporate conduct is hopelessly inadequate.  Disturbing revelations about the conduct of Irish Nationwide Building Society emerged over the summer.  The Bill I have mentioned is needed because the Director of Corporate Enforcement has no role in such matters, as we know.  I suggest that a full and complete investigation of corporate conduct at Irish Nationwide Building Society is required in the public interest.  We are aware that the ongoing investigations into Anglo Irish Bank are covered by the existing legislation.  The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) (Amendment) Bill 2009 has been prepared to address the fact that building societies are not covered.  The acceptance of the Bill by the Government would represent a signal of its firm resolution and commitment to a new era of corporate governance in Ireland, which is urgently required in the public interest.  I ask the Leader to comment on the legislation in question, which I would like to be accepted in Government time at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not intend to discuss the other shenanigans at financial institutions.  The institution I have mentioned should be a priority.  I accept that representatives of the Government have spoken about the possibility of removing certain directors of banking institutions, some of whom are still serving, who steered the ship onto the rocks.  I suggest it is more important for people at top management levels within this country&rsquo;s retail banks &mdash; those who made the front-line decisions &mdash; to be sidelined.  Many good officials in banking institutions are ready and willing to serve.  These people are having to suffer because of those who made the wrong decisions on retail banking in our recent past.  I would like to hear the Leader&rsquo;s opinion on this issue.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my request for a debate on the fishing industry.  This is a particularly important issue given that we are renegotiating the Common Fisheries Policy.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate in early October in view of these negotiations.</P>
        <P>Despite the desperately bad deal that fishermen received when we joined the EEC in 1973, I acknowledge, as should this House, the magnanimous decision by the Federation of Irish Fishermen to support the Lisbon treaty.  Unlike the farming community which benefited from Europe, fishermen and coastal communities were not allowed to fulfil the potential they offered in the 1960s and 1970s, with the result that they have suffered since.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This time last year, I introduced the Human Body Organs and Human Tissue Bill 2008 to this House.  The Minister for Health and Children accepted the point of the legislation but wanted to undertake discussions before acting on it.  The Bill deals with presumed consent in regard to organ donation.  However, I am bothered by the length of time taken by State organisations to get things done.  Frank Deasy, who many people heard speak on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, died last week because he was unable to get an organ transplant on time. <Col N="8"/> He fully supported the principle of presumed consent, that is, the assumption that unless one has opted out, one&rsquo;s organs can be used after death.  The Minister has stated that she will introduce her own Bill on the same issue as soon as discussions are concluded.  However, a full year has passed already and every week people are dying because they cannot get organ transplants.  I urge her to make a decision to introduce a Bill and we can then tweak it to make it more acceptable.</P>
        <P>I received documentation the other day, I believe in the post but I am not sure, which related to voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Lisbon treaty referendum.  To the best of my knowledge, this material was sponsored with money from outside the State.  I understand that in the United States it is a criminal offence for an American to use funds from outside the state to influence political opinion.  If it is the case that this money which was used to advocate a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, part of which I believe came from the United Kingdom Independence Party, came from outside the State, then those responsible for distributing it, and to the best of my knowledge it may be An Post, have committed a criminal offence.  I am not sure if the Minister, the board of directors of An Post or individual postmen are responsible, although perhaps An Post is not even involved.  If it is the case that a criminal offence has been committed because funds from outside the State were used to influence political decisions in this country, we should do something immediately before more damage is done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Further to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point, I resent the actions of the UK Independence Party and Mr. Nigel Farage in particular.  The party&rsquo;s avowed aim is to withdraw from the European Union and basically to destroy it.  It is making efforts to influence the electorate into voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 2 October which is against the best interests of the Irish people.  These are the people who want to stop immigration and want a white Britain.  They are interfering with our campaign and I fully agree with Senator Quinn that an immediate investigation is needed of their activities.  If anyone needed a reason to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, it is that the UK Independence Party wants us to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is an anti-Irish and anti-Europe party composed of a discredited bunch of individuals.  Liam Cosgrave, the former Taoiseach, would have something to say, and a famous speech he made in May 1977 could apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Margaret Cox stood over there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to some of the people who are coming over here to try to influence the Irish people in this regard.</P>
        <P>Finally, this is the most defining moment in Irish politics.  The point about the referendum is that it is everyone&rsquo;s individual right to vote on 2 October and each vote is equal, whether from the President, from every member of the Government or from every individual.  That is a special role for all of us and I hope that in the next week we will get that message across.  This House could play an important role by even discussing this matter today.</P>
        <P>The interference of the United Kingdom Independence Party will swing the referendum very much for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 2 October because it is the most intolerant group within the European Union.  If we do not get a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 2 October, this is the last time we will have an opportunity for reform of the European Union if the British Conservative Party gets into office after the next general election because it is committed to holding a referendum.  If, however, we sign up &mdash; the rest have signed up already &mdash; and 27 countries agree this, then there will be no going back in this regard.  That is why it is so important on 2 October we all enthusiastically go out and do our utmost to get this.</P><Col N="9"/>
        <P>I commend all the major parties which are working so hard to convince people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  They are putting it above party political issues.  It is above party political issues because whoever runs this country in the future will rely on a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 2 October.</P>

	<P>I call for a full debate, separate to any debate about the economy, on the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.  It really is 450 pages on eye-watering waste by the Government over the years and it warrants a separate debate on how this could have happened.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader for a debate on the Lisbon treaty so that we can update this House on the campaign.  On some of the comments that have already been made, it might be important to point out to the United Kingdom Independence Party that by passing the Lisbon treaty we give them a clear exit clause to get out of Europe with no hassle whatsoever, and of course that will be of assistance to the conservatives in the United Kingdom if they want to get out of Europe.  We should raise with the conservatives the point that by passing the Lisbon treaty we give them an opportunity to get out of Europe without having to make matters too difficult for them.</P>
        <P>I was also impressed overnight with how posters have sprung up in my county with pictures of the Union Jack and military tanks on them.  I thought it was a recruitment poster for the British Army or for the United Kingdom Independence Party, and I was quite surprised to find it was from a political party in this country which neither encourages nor supports the British Army.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come before the House and give an update on dissident activity in the Six Counties and in the entire Ulster region.  I must commend those who found the 600 lb bomb and those who reacted to the pipe bombs in Donegal town recently.  However, I ask that the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence be brought before the House to give us an assessment of the present position and to ask the Minister for Defence specifically to bring the bomb disposal unit back to Finner Camp because when the activity took place in Donegal town it took four hours for the unit to arrive from Athlone.  We are facing a situation where even the mayor of Donegal has received death threats, as has his wife and his young baby.  It is important that if these threats are serious &mdash; we must take them seriously &mdash; there is the power to react to them.</P>
        <P>I also want an opportunity for us in this House to condemn again the move back towards military activity by whoever and we must use every opportunity to advocate a peaceful process of moving forward.  In that context, I would outline that these are the years where the Council of Europe is looking at &ldquo;The image of the Other&rdquo;, and I wrote a report on how to teach history in areas of recent conflict.  I would ask that we meet with the Minister for culture to outline how we can encourage the generations coming through to be tolerant of the other because the reason the mayor in Donegal received a death threat is that he suggested a memorial to the Mountbatten murders, a significant anniversary of which is being commemorated this year.  It is very important for us to be able to embrace difference if we want a 32-county Ireland of mutual understanding and respect or even a peaceful island where we co-exist as we do as present.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators Alex White and O&rsquo;Toole for their kind words.  Although I have made a small physical move forward and to the right, of course, I stay politically exactly where I was before, which is firmly on the left.  I have the privilege of having been elected by the graduates of Dublin University to represent them in the Seanad and I will continue to work hard to do so.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on NAMA.  While I know we will debate the economy this evening, there is an enormous and growing public anger about the extent of the bailout to bankers that NAMA represents.  Anyone who saw Fintan O&rsquo;Toole on television on Monday night will have seen him memorably describe Anglo Irish Bank as a zombie bank.  Many people are beginning to realise that NAMA will represent us breathing life with taxpayers&rsquo; money into a zombie bank that does not deserve to be resuscitated.  There will be immense anger when the scale of the money being put into Anglo Irish Bank, in particular, is realised.  We need to debate the matter in the House.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments about the Lisbon treaty, many of us would sympathise with him about the fact that UKIP is advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and it is yet another reason to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Of course there is a very positive reason to vote for the treaty apart from that which is that it will incorporate for the first time the Charter of Fundamental Rights into EU primary law.  I, for one, am passionate about supporting the treaty for that reason alone.  I urge colleagues on both sides of the House who are supportive of the treaty to look at the website of the charter group in which I am involved.  It is a group of trade unionists and activists from the left who are urging a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote because of the importance we attach to this charter, which will provide citizens here with another parallel system of human rights protections to add to our own Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  That is a significant positive reason to ask people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  On doorsteps that has been received very positively when I have been canvassing.</P>

That would encourage criminals to become involved in transporting carbon fuels across the Border.  They will take the opportunity to put a veneer of political aim on their activities and start supporting the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA as part of this cover.  We should ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance to ensure carbon taxes are exactly the same in both jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s request for a fitting memorial to the Mountbatten murders that took place just off the Irish coast.  It is interesting to note that Mountbatten wrote that he wished to see a united Ireland.  It is one of those strange anomalies that turns up in life.  It is somewhat like the UK Independence Party and Sinn F&eacute;in supporting a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote together.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn is promoting the notion of presumed consent for organ donation.  We have been waiting a long time for such a system which works well in Spain because there is full support for families.

	<P>I would like to speak about the Lisbon treaty.  Whatever about NAMA and the state of the economy, this is the issue we must prioritise as we head towards the referendum on 2 October.  As mentioned, the UK Independence Party has entered the debate in Ireland, which is entirely inappropriate.  However, it highlights the informal alliance between the ideas represented by UKIP and those on the far right and those of Sinn F&eacute;in on the far left.  If anything, this curious alliance shows the absurdity of the position Sinn F&eacute;in has taken in the referendum campaign and why its arguments should be rejected.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Alternative Guide to Lisbon 2 and the UKIP document on the treaty both contain the same untruths about what the treaty really means.</P>
        <P>This alliance between two extreme points of view which are based on falsehoods and lies is the best message as to why people should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the Lisbon treaty.  It is important to get that message across.  We have had an informed public debate on the treaty and have had the benefit of clarifications from the European heads of state and government, as well as legally binding guarantees, including on the retention of the Commissionership.  Fine Gael has been calling for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to ensure the country is put first.  The effect of the campaign by these two organisations &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in and UKIP &mdash; would be to create an impoverished, politically isolated Ireland on the periphery of Europe.</P>

	<P>We should have a debate soon on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on bioethics, specifically the issue of advanced care directives.  There is much to welcome in the report of the commission.  However, as with many such reports, it is important we do not see it as an automatic template that we follow slavishly in legislation, but that we have a full and searching debate on the recommendations made.  I am particularly concerned about the need to revisit, in cultural and legal terms, the question of artificial feeding and hydration.  It is important that would always be seen as basic ordinary care and not as artificial or extraordinary care.  The Law Reform Commission seems to suggest that such artificial nutrition and hydration should be seen as treatment rather than as basic care.  It seems to be of the view that the question of the person&rsquo;s likelihood of recovery should be the determining factor in deciding whether to give such care.  It is good that the Law Reform Commission has indicated its proposals but we need to have a careful debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>In that context, we should reflect on an excellent article by Breda O&rsquo;Brien in last Saturday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> in which she described a situation of a man who was suffering from locked-in syndrome.  When people finally managed to communicate with him, which was a tortuous process of asking him to respond to the question of whether he wanted to live, his response was gradually expressed that &ldquo;I demand to live&rdquo; and he added an expletive.  When we are talking about advanced care directives, it may well be that a person, perhaps an elderly person who is worried about being a burden, will express one kind of wish when he or she is well but who when ill would not want his or her life curtailed.  We need to focus clearly on the need to respect that life is always a good thing and even where there is suffering, there is massive human potential for hope and dignity.</P>
        <P>In that context, we should also reflect on the so-called clarification of laws on assisted suicide published in England and Wales today.  It is important to be careful that we would never undermine the essential point of our culture that life is always a good thing.  The act of a person who assists somebody else to die should always be prosecutable.  The particular circumstances can be taken into consideration in mitigation when it comes to sentencing, but by issuing clarifications suggesting in what circumstances the Director of Public Prosecutions might bring <Col N="13"/>a prosecution and in what circumstances he or she might not, I would be concerned that it would involve giving a green light to people to make decisions that they should not take.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are all in dialogue with people on different sides of the debate on the Lisbon treaty who are sincere and well-informed people.  One point on which we would all agree is that people should be able to vote.  I received correspondence on this matter, on which I also seek a debate, from Mr. Richard Pearse, a pilot, who indicated that the issue of the Lisbon treaty is now one of interest for him rather than one of action.  He indicated that his job will have him out of the country on 2 October so he will be unable to exercise his vote.  He indicated that we have an extremely absentee voting system here.</P>

        <P>I support the calls by Senator Fitzgerald and others for a debate on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He gets a lot of credit for some of the reports his office publishes, but we are only touching the tip of the iceberg with regard to moneys that could be saved.  Billions could be saved without impacting either on individuals working within the public service or on the services we are charged with delivering purely by being more efficient and cost effective.  We should debate that issue.  It is a retrograde step if the publication of such important reports are not debated in these Houses.  I am aware the committees will debate them and I fully support that.  The ESRI report, which is interesting in terms of wage levels in the public service, should also be debated in this House.  These are important fundamental issues which go to the core of how we are to extricate ourselves from the fiscal and economic difficulties we are encountering.</P>
        <P>I support Senators who stated that our priority this week and next week should be the Lisbon treaty.  Whatever else we do, if we fail in having it passed, all efforts to bring about recovery of our economy will be in vain.  I share the concerns expressed by a number of Senators in regard to the spurious and disingenuous arguments being made in this regard by various groups, many of whom purport to represent the fundamental side of the Catholic religion.  Their impact and influence on many of those people who share their convictions and concerns is being weakened by the manner in which those spurious arguments, in particular in regard to abortion and other ethical issues, are being propagated.  I agree with Senator Glynn&rsquo;s sentiments in this regard.  I believe former Senator Des Hanafin&rsquo;s article is exceptionally good.  He has great credibility in the area of pro-life protection.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Catholic</i> which is unequivocal in terms of its commitment to ensuring that not alone abortion but other ethical issues ploughed by the liberal agenda within the European Union and elsewhere at Commission level and here within the public service establishment will be for the Irish people to decide, which is precisely as it should be.  The impact of the arguments being made by some of these groups is having an effect.  I have been out canvassing and have been confronted on these issues by people who are genuinely concerned.  I do not mind anybody opposing on the basis of strong genuine arguments but latching on to untruths and promoting them in order to get a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to satisfy another agenda is wrong.</P>

	<P>Three years ago, Fine Gael introduced a Home Defence Bill which was voted down by the Government.  The Government acknowledged that legislation would have to be introduced to address some of the issues that arose in the Bill and stated it would introduce its own Bill at a later stage.  Three years have passed and the Government continues to await the final report of the Law Reform Commission.  I do not believe this is acceptable.  Three years is too long to wait for necessary legislation in this regard.</P>
        <P>Last week the home of a constituent of mine, Mr. Paddy Barry, was broken into.  Sadly, Mr. Barry has since died.  I knew Mr. Barry well.  I am a friend of his son, Brendan Barry.  Mr. Barry was a respected member of the community and the parish of Ballybricken where I come from.  Breaking into the homes of elderly people is a despicable crime.  In my opinion, the punishment in this regard does not in many instances fit the crime.</P>
        <P>I am sure everybody in the House will join with me in sending our condolences to the Barry family.  We need action of the type suggested in the Home Defence Bill, which could be amended to ensure this issue is properly dealt with.  Waiting three years for legislation which the Government stated at the time was necessary is totally unacceptable.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to allow a debate on the report published last week by the United Nations on the situation in Gaza.  One of those involved in this investigation was Colonel Desmond Travers, a retired Army officer.  The report concluded that the Israeli forces engaged in war crimes and human rights abuses in Gaza.  The European Union has a preferential trade agreement with Israel, Article 2 of which specifies that the latter must observe human rights within its jurisdiction.  Some 80% of Israel&rsquo;s trade is with the European Union.  If the Union is not willing to uphold clauses within its own treaties, it cannot expect others to respect those provisions.  The need to uphold such principles is especially acute where a body such as the United Nations, one of the most respected institutions in the world, has stated that human rights abuses took place.  As such, the European Union should suspend all preferential trade with Israel.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the House to discuss the siting of mobile telephone masts?  A clause in Kerry County Council&rsquo;s development plan, supported by all councillors, stipulates that masts should not be located close to schools or hospitals.  However, notwithstanding the rejection by Kerry County Council of a planning application for the erection of a mast at Annascaul and the subsequent inspector&rsquo;s report upholding that refusal, permission was ultimately granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This has led to a stand-off, including a boycott by all Kerry concrete suppliers in an effort to prevent the base being erected.  We must have a national policy in regard to the siting of mobile telephone masts.  The European Environment Agency has advocated caution given the growing evidence of mobile telephones and masts causing a potential threat to human health.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate with the Minister which should include consideration of a nationwide provision similar to Kerry County Council&rsquo;s 1 km rule in respect of the siting of all masts but bearing in mind the need to provide broadband.</P>

	<P>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom cur leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole ar maidin.  There is often talk on the first day of a new term about Seanad reform.  It seems significant additional work has recently been done in this area notwithstanding the 13 reports already published on Seanad reform, none of which has thus far been implemented.  I and my party, along with other party leaders in the Seanad, made detailed submissions on the type of reform we envisage.  I was pleased to hear Senator O&rsquo;Toole make the case for genuine reform or, in the absence of such, the abolition of this House.  This is a point I have made repeatedly.  To clarify, my party does not favour the abolition of the Seanad but rather meaningful reform.  However, if it is merely a case of tweaking around the edges, which seems to be what the Minister is proposing, then there can be no function for this forum in the manner in which it is currently constituted.  The report by an bord snip nua got it right in this regard.  While most of us are arguing against front-line cuts which affect the most vulnerable in society, we cannot ignore the fact that it costs &euro;25 million per annum to run this establishment which, in many respects, merely duplicates the roles and functions of the Lower House.  The function and administration of this House must be subject to the same serious examination as every other aspect of the running of the State.  There must be genuine dialogue <Col N="16"/>and, more important, effective action.  The time for talking may well be over and it is time to take the bull by the horns.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year I welcomed a debate which took place in this House prompted by a report I produced for the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the difficulties faced by rural communities, particularly in the west.  In recent months the McCarthy report and other reports have proposed changes in various aspects of policy which, if introduced, would have a serious impact on rural areas.  Some have already been implemented, such as the withdrawal of the rural transport service at off-peak times, with proposals to end the scheme entirely.  My report shows that more than half of Garda stations are manned by only one garda or are manned only on a part-time basis, and the McCarthy report proposes that a substantial number of these should be shut down.  There are also proposals to shut down smaller schools.  If implemented in full, the McCarthy report proposals could mean the closure or amalgamation of 115 out of 173 schools in my county.  That is the degree of peril for rural Ireland.  We are all aware of the impact of the reductions in home help hours and other supports for vulnerable members of society.</P>
        <P>I heard the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, comment earlier today that there is much in the McCarthy report that makes no sense.  It is important to recognise that the report is not merely the creation of Mr. Colm McCarthy and his team but was evaluated by senior civil servants in the Department of Finance.  Their thinking absolutely bewilders me.  One of the programmes they were asked to evaluate was CL&Aacute;R, a programme which offers support to communities in the most isolated rural areas in the State.  Its expenditure is less than &euro;20 million per year invested in locations throughout the State.  The response from senior civil servants in the Department of Finance was that investing in areas with very low populations cannot be seen as a priority in the current economic climate.  If that is the thinking of those currently devising the budget to be delivered in December, there must be serious concern for the future of rural Ireland.  There must be a proper debate, stepping back from all the cuts, juggling and attempts to balance the books, to ascertain what we want to achieve and the type of Ireland we are shaping for the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I submitted an issue for discussion on the Adjournment today, which was not selected, relating to the cuts facing the Irish language community.  A glance at what McCarthy proposes, which again comes from civil servants within the Department of Finance and from within other Departments, which information is on the Department of Finance website, shows a proposed reduction in funding for programmes under the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs of 58%, while the average proposed reduction in other programmes is 10%.  What type of Ireland will emerge from this recession?  It will undoubtedly be centred on the hubs and major towns and there is a danger it will have no language and no heart.</P>

        <P>I take issue with some of the comments made by Senators in regard to the Lisbon treaty.  The forthcoming referendum represents the greatest challenge the State will face in the weeks, months and years ahead.  I welcome the various farmers&rsquo; groups, trade unions, women&rsquo;s groups and community organisations which are actively campaigning for a rejection of the treaty to ensure Ireland remains at the heart of Europe and gets a better deal.</P><Col N="17"/>
        <P>There have been accusations that those on the No side, particularly my own party, have been peddling untruths.  I refute that accusation.  Those campaigning for the treaty during the previous referendum warned that its rejection would result in a withdrawal of foreign direct investment.  That has proved to be incorrect.  On the contrary, the IDA recently confirmed there has been a 14% increase in such investment in the period since the rejection of the treaty last year.</P>
        <P>When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, says a second rejection of the treaty will be tantamount to our withdrawal from Europe, he is putting forward an absolute untruth.  <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, a prominent and influential publication, has described such comments by the Minister and his Government colleagues as &ldquo;patent absurdities&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my Donegal colleague, Senator Keaveney, in calling for a debate on the North of Ireland.  I have discussed with various groups and individuals in the North the issues that have emerged over the summer, namely, an underlying growth in dissident activity on all sides.  None of us, from any party, is willing to accept that and it is important that we zone in on the causes of this problem.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for a serious debate on the situation as soon as possible after the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  We must also liaise where necessary and possible with our colleagues north of the Border.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other issue I wish to raise, and it has been mentioned earlier, is the banking sector in Ireland.  Let us leave NAMA aside for the moment.  It will take care of itself in the weeks to come and is currently being discussed in the Lower House.  At issue is the report produced by the European Commission on the banking sector in the member states.  That report has thrown up a number of matters in respect of the misleading information which the Irish retail banking sector has been promoting at consumer level.  That is unacceptable and disgraceful.  An example of some of its products is bogus non-resident accounts, whereby bank managers were aiding and abetting the establishment of non-resident accounts by facilitating addresses outside of the State for elderly individuals, including farmers and pensioners.  If we are to proceed on the basis that NAMA will support our banking sector, and we need a strong and vibrant banking sector, some of the people who cultivated that environment over the years must be sacked and taken out of circulation in that sector so the public can have confidence that we will have a formidable banking sector in the future.  I hope we will have the opportunity to discuss this during the debate on NAMA.  However, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the banking sector as it exists at present before the NAMA legislation is brought before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear it.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on Ireland, as a matter of urgency?  Since the Seanad last met, 174,000 more people have joined the dole queue and net emigration is once again exceeding immigration.  That causes a brain drain and skills deficit.  Perhaps the largest skills deficit we have is in the Government.  In light of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comments this morning in the D&aacute;il, what will shape the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy in December?  Will it be the McCarthy report or the report of the Commission on Taxation, or does the Government even know?  I notice that the spokesman on hardship, the Deputy Leader of this House, is missing.  We heard him throughout the summer speaking from the plinth and everywhere else, waxing lyrical about what he intended to do.  However, he has not come here today to face the Members of this House.  What is happening with the McCarthy report?  The Government commissioned that report but we now hear from a combination of Ministers, backbenchers and Senators that it is all a bottle of smoke.  Will the Leader explicitly state what will shape the Government&rsquo;s strategy in the December budget?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, in the context of the debate on the economy later, I join Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in calling for a debate on the banking sector before the House debates the NAMA legislation, assuming it passes all Stages in the other House.  Is the Leader aware this issue does not just affect business?  Ordinary citizens who bought houses at inflated prices are now unable to pay the mortgage because they have lost their jobs.  The banks are threatening repossession.  More importantly, people have committed suicide or are on the verge of doing so or have reached the end of their patience with life.  It is an appalling vista.  There has been nothing from the Government to help the ordinary person who is in trouble.  I am not referring to the developers who can huff and puff in the Supreme Court but to the ordinary person who has a special needs child whose class size has been increased or who has had their social welfare payment or their rate of pay cut and who is struggling.  We have heard nothing from the Government.  Perhaps the Leader will respond on that point.</P>
        <P>Finally, could the Leader arrange an urgent debate on sport in Irish society?  I have made this request previously and repeat it now.  We must have a debate on the role of sport.  Senator Daly should be humble in victory.  I know he cannot really be humble but he should try just once.  I congratulate Kerry on its victory; the team deserved to win.  However, the Senator should be a little gracious.  Anybody can play with the big ball but it is the small ball that counts.</P>

	<P>I come from the county with the most All-Ireland titles in Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comments on the need for a debate on the recent Law Reform Commission report regarding advanced care orders.  The concerns voiced by the Senator raise the inhumane prospect of a person being starved and parched to death rather than treatment being withheld.  There is a difference between treatment and basic care.  I am sure colleagues will recall the distressing situation that arose approximately 18 months ago when a decision was made to withhold nutrition and hydration from a young lady <Col N="19"/>who had been in a coma.  It is a terribly inhumane way to die.  It is important that this House debates advanced care orders.</P>
        <P>Second, will the Leader invite the Minister of State with responsibility for children to the House to discuss the proposed bilateral agreement with Vietnam on adoption?  Two reports were prepared over the summer, one by UNICEF and the other by the Vietnamese.  Many parents are suffering dreadfully and are anxious to know the position with their proposed adoption of a Vietnamese child.  I am aware from meeting and communicating with them that their only intent is to offer a loving and safe home.  They do not wish to be part of anything wrong but they want to know where they stand so they can move on with their lives.</P>
        <P>Finally, could the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, to the House?  There have been anecdotal accounts, particularly in the last couple of months, of a dramatic rise in the number of suicides as a result of the economic situation.  I congratulate the HSE on the supports and pamphlets it made available over the summer which give people practical advice on how to support their mental health and well-being.  However, it is important to establish whether there has been an increase in the number of suicides and what role the Oireachtas can undertake to support people in these difficult times.</P>

	<P>Sometimes I wonder why we are here.  I do not know how many people watched the proceedings in the D&aacute;il last week and heard the Ceann Comhairle read a list of Bills which he had received from the Seanad.  What was notable was that every Bill was received without amendment.  It stood out as an indication that we are not allowed to do serious work in this Chamber.  What sort of work are we being asked or permitted to do or are we, as many who have mentioned Seanad reform have indicated, becoming a rubber stamp that badly needs reform?</P>
        <P>This afternoon we are due to debate a broad issue, the economy.  I hope to God the Minister for Finance is coming to the House for the debate and that the Leader will not wheel in another political eunuch to sit in the Chamber and take no notice of what anybody here has to say.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see who comes to the debate.  I might be maligning the Leader but I will bet that the Minister for Finance will not be here this afternoon for any length of time, if at all.  There is no point having people present who are just going through the motions and not listening to anything Members say.  Perhaps the Leader will indicate which Minister will come before the House.</P>
        <P>I endorse the comments of Senators Walsh and Twomey on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Why is the House not debating it?  I do not know whether the Leader or his party are aware that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment received the report, the contents of which with regard to F&Aacute;S are dynamite, on 12 June.  Ministers are required to release reports within 90 days of receiving them.  The T&aacute;naiste sat on the report for 90 days before releasing it, coincidentally, I suppose, on the same day the legislation on the National Asset Management Agency was introduced.  As a result, the report did not receive the coverage it deserved.</P>
        <P>Today, the House could give the report on wastage in F&Aacute;S due coverage and attention but it will not be allowed to do so.  I am not blowing anyone&rsquo;s trumpet in pointing out that for years my requests for a debate on F&Aacute;S fell on deaf ears.  While I do not understand the reason, it is suspicious that the House cannot debate this organisation which has a budget of &euro;1 billion per annum, most of which is wasted, or have the T&aacute;naiste come before us to illuminate us on <Col N="20"/>developments because the subject is politically sensitive.  Why are those who sat on the board of F&Aacute;S this time last year still on it and drawing fat salaries?  Each time I ask this question in the House I do not receive an answer and we are prevented from holding a debate.</P>
        <P>There is more than a suspicion that F&Aacute;S is a Fianna F&aacute;il-protected, semi-State agency which has been politicised by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the social partners, all of which have their snouts in the trough.  The organisation spends &euro;1 billion each year, of which a large amount is wasted, but the House which is supposed to be an accountable Chamber of Parliament is not allowed to debate the issue.  Instead, it is proposed to debate the economy in a vacuum when no one will listen to a word we will say.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct but we should go further and ask whether we are being insulted by the agendas with which we are being presented in the House.  Are we talking ourselves into irrelevance when the Seanad could be relevant?  What is taking place is a disgrace and shame and the House does not emerge from it with credit.  Let us discuss issues that matter rather than ones that do not.  Let us not put window dressing on what we do.  Let us be relevant rather than irrelevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>During the summer months all Senators will have received a significant number of representations from various groups which fear they will be affected by the recommendations of the McCarthy report.  I look forward to an early and substantial debate on the report to enable us to ascertain what precisely is the Government&rsquo;s position on it.  The case made by two specific groups, the rural transport initiative and Family Support Agency, struck a strong chord with me.  Senator Doherty and others referred to the role of the rural transport scheme.  Under the scheme which costs approximately &euro;11 million per annum, tens of thousands of people are facilitated, on a weekly basis, to see the outside world and engage with their friends, neighbours and local communities.  The scheme must be retained. </P>
        <P>It is safe to say the Family Support Agency does what it says on the tin, that is, it supports families through providing counselling, support and advice on matters such as housing and social welfare benefits.  The agency does outstanding work in virtually every town and many villages and townlands with a budget of only &euro;40 million.  People are genuinely afraid that the possible reduction in its services will cause them grave difficulties.</P>
        <P>I could list group after group which could be affected by the recommendations of the McCarthy report.  Given the social capital benefits generated by the rural transport groups and Family Support Agency for relatively small sums, it is imperative that these organisations are supported.</P>
        <P>While I do not expect the Leader to respond to the specific issues I raise, the House must urgently debate the McCarthy report, certainly in advance of the budget.  We cannot stick our heads in the sand and hope the report will go away or argue, as the T&aacute;naiste did this morning, that it basically does not matter.  It has been published and much of it may be implemented.  This must be done in a careful and planned fashion.  For this reason, the House must debate it as soon as possible.  Let us act like politicians rather than shouting from the sidelines.  Let us go through the report line by line and page by page, express our views and, where we see fit, put forward alternative proposals and objections.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children put the fear of God into people when she stated significant health cuts would be required.  Having considered her comment in the context of my constituency, I note, for example, that on Wednesday of last week 12 people were waiting on trolleys in Portiuncula Hospital.  I challenge the Minister&rsquo;s assurance, given to Senators on one of her previous appearances in the House, that cuts would <Col N="21"/>not impact on the sick and most vulnerable in society.  Bed closures have occurred.  In Portiuncula Hospital, for example, 35 beds, including St. John&rsquo;s ward, have been closed.  The hospice unit in Athlone is not open and many other facilities in Mullingar General Hospital will not proceed.  I will not labour the point.  Instead, I ask that the Minister come before the House to state categorically what cuts she intends to make.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have other questions for the Minister.  Will she explain what she means by the term &ldquo;premium payments&rdquo;?  Will Professor Drumm who will retire this year be replaced?  What is the function of the Department of Health and Children and how much does it cost?  I do not believe it does much.  What is the current position on the national children&rsquo;s hospital?  I wish to raise a plethora of other issues with the Minister.  She cannot pluck a figure of &euro;3 billion in cuts from the air without informing us how these cuts will affect those who are sick.  I ask the Leader to arrange to have the Minister come before the House at the earliest possible date &mdash; perhaps next week &mdash; to discuss the issue of health.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators&rsquo; calls for a debate on the legislation on the National Asset Management Agency.  I note, in particular, Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s remark that there has never been a property crash which did not result in property prices subsequently appreciating by 88%.  Is the real Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party plan for the economy to sort out the banking crisis by making homes unaffordable again for ordinary families and workers?  Senator Ross referred to the relevance of the House.  If this House is to be relevant, issues of this nature must be discussed and clarified.</P>
        <P>Senators referred to the role of the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, in the Lisbon treaty referendum.  Given that the free movement of labour and capital are benefits of the European Union, I do not take issue with members of other political parties coming to this country.  However, I have a problem when members of a party led by people who do not live here come to Ireland to warn us about immigration.  The leaflets distributed by UKIP and the posters the party has erected show a degree of despicable hypocrisy that debars it from making a contribution to the debate.</P>

	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business asking the Minister for Education and Science to come before the House immediately to address the appalling disservice he has done to 500 children with mild learning disabilities.  We have fought hard for these children to ensure their classes are maintained.  Senators from all parties described the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on this issue as a bad move.  Some of the children in question cannot speak or use the toilet alone.  We now learn that 200 posts must be filled if they are to be given an appropriate education in mainstream classes.  The policy of inclusion adopted in this country requires that appropriate resources be provided to enable these children to be educated in a mainstream classroom.  When will those 200 posts be filled?  </P>
      
        <P>I was delighted with the global economic recovery debate that David McWilliams had at the weekend at Farmleigh House.  I was particularly pleased by the emphasis on the importance of education on research and development to help us move forward and become strong again as a nation.  It is time for the Minister for Education and Science to come clean with the people and tell us his plans for funding third-level education.  Will he bring back fees?  I am being lobbied, as I am sure others are, because there is great concern about whether parents will be able to afford third-level education for their children.</P>
        <P>I wish to compliment Mr. Justice Frank Clarke on his work in clarifying facts concerning the Lisbon referendum, but he still has a lot more to do.  He must find a way to counter false claims that are currently being made so that people will have the facts before 2 October.  I refer in <Col N="22"/>particular to worrying information on euthanasia, which is being placed in churches in novena-style leaflets.  An old woman attended a public meeting and showed me such a leaflet, which incites fear.</P>
        <P>Equally, there are false claims by Sinn F&eacute;in that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will crush family farms.  I happen to live on such a farm and but for Europe and the single farm premium we would not survive.  Sinn F&eacute;in claims that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will lower wages when in fact we are protected here by the minimum wage legislation.  Many other scare-mongering techniques are being propagated at the moment.  The Leader should ask Mr. Justice Clarke to examine the range of misleading claims that are appearing on &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign posters with a view to correcting such misinformation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is an horrendous chronicle of wanton waste.  It is an indictment of Government and the system of governance over the years in question, as well F&Aacute;S itself.  In reading the report we are reminded of the biblical injunction to fill barns in the years of plenty.  Rather than doing so, however, we emptied barns, sold the timber rafters and sold some of the stonework as well.  As we approach the years of need we find that we have wilfully emptied barns in a wasteful manner.</P>
        <P>While it is a disgraceful indictment, it is incumbent upon us not to correct that error on the backs of the weak and needy, or on specific schemes that were cost-effective &mdash; or can be made so, in so far as they are not &mdash; and can deliver an important service to ordinary people.  No scheme stands out more in this context than the rural transport scheme.  As someone representing a rural constituency, no scheme has brought more change to the lives of ordinary people in isolated situations.  It has meant a lot to women in rural areas, the older generation, people in need and those with various levels of disability.  The scheme allows those living alone to shop and have other social contact, thus affording them basic human dignity and a decent quality of life.</P>
        <P>It is not an argument to say that because we have a large number of cars such people do not need the rural transport scheme.  They need the scheme because many of them cannot drive and have no one to take them from isolated areas to the nearest town.  Many such people have nobody to look after them.  It is a fallacy to put forward this Darwinian theory &mdash; that because there are cars, which they cannot drive or access, then buses should be withdrawn from them.  The rural transport scheme is cost effective and must be maintained.  The Leader should give a commitment to ask the Government not to correct wanton waste on the backs of the needy and underprivileged, including those who for years built up this country.  We should not correct the ills of our society on the backs of those using the rural transport scheme.  They need a vision for change in terms of social services.</P>

	<P>I join with the leader of Fine Gael in the House, Senator Fitzgerald, in opposing the Order of Business on the basis that no Private Members&rsquo; time has been allotted this week.  When Opposition Members raise issues the Leader frequently says they should be discussed in Private Members&rsquo; time.  In my seven years here I cannot remember a week when Private Members&rsquo; time was not provided for.  Given the fact that there are only three items on this week&rsquo;s schedule, I do not see why Private Members&rsquo; time could not have been included.  </P>
        <P>As I asked in the last session, is it not possible that when the schedule is delivered by e-mail or otherwise to Members on Thursdays or Fridays, the times of debates could also be included?  There was a time in the House when Senators did not have specific time slots to contribute and speaking time was not curtailed.  In that context, it may have been more difficult to schedule <Col N="23"/>the business of the House, but in my first five years as a Member of this House it was possible to indicate when debates would actually take place.  I ask the Leader to examine doing that in future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to mention NAMA briefly in passing, although I know we will be discussing that legislation at a later date.  It is arguably the most important legislation the Houses of the Oireachtas will ever deal with. Senator Hanafin spoke about the Government borrowing from the Central Bank at 1.5% and lending at a higher rate.  It is quite clear, however, that we will not be borrowing from the European Central Bank at 1.5% for much longer.  In fact, interest rates could increase significantly over the next number of years.  In all his calculations to do with NAMA, the Minister for Finance has refused to accept that that increase is inevitable, whenever it comes.  It could be very substantial indeed, although it has not been sufficiently included in any of the Government&rsquo;s calculations so far.</P>
        <P>I join with Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White and others who referred to the report of the Commission on Taxation.  Every time a taxation issue was discussed in the previous session we were told to await the outcome of that report.  Now, however, we are told by the Taoiseach that it is a long-term project, not a short or medium-term one.  We should have a debate with the Minister for Finance, not one of the junior Ministers, in the House as soon possible.</P>
        <P>I agree with previous speakers who referred to issues concerning rural areas.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about prices to suppliers and producers, and we should have a discussion on those.</P>
        <P>For a long time, Senator Doherty has raised the removal of services to people in rural Ireland, such as the rural transport initiative.  However, I disagree profoundly with Senator Doherty&rsquo;s views on the Lisbon treaty.  In particular, he mentioned a line from the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>referring to the Government &mdash; which I dislike as much as he does &mdash; preying on fears to get the Irish people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>

Elderly people in urban and rural areas are concerned about proposed cuts and barriers to accessing basic services to which they are entitled.  These people built our country and we should not forget them, even in recessionary times.  It is a debate well worth having.  I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on services for the elderly.</P>
        <P>I concur with the comments of my colleague, Senator Cummins, and I offer my condolences to the Barry family in Waterford on the sad passing of Paddy Barry.  We all have to ask ourselves whether mandatory sentencing or another provision should be introduced to deal with criminals who break into the houses of vulnerable elderly people and what is the role of the Government, the Garda and society in supporting our elderly people.  Every Member could make a proper contribution to such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the call for an immediate debate on special needs education.  A cull of special needs assistants, SNAs, has taken place over the past number of weeks.  Most parents of children availing of special needs services were not aware that the cull <Col N="24"/>had taken place until they presented with the children on the first morning of the new term.  I spoke to two or three sets of parents over the past few weeks who are seriously traumatised by what has happened.  Where along the way did we lose our perspective?</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s only consideration seems to be to savagely impose cuts across the board without considering the human cost.  I acknowledge the State is losing &euro;400 million a week and we need to take stock of where we are going as a nation but we have rightly always prided ourselves both nationally and internationally on how we care for the vulnerable.  I was contacted by one parent whose eight year-old daughter has special needs.  She was a social recluse on entering school in rural Galway but she was transformed into a happy pupil.  She returned to school three weeks ago to find the SNA with whom she had built a close relationship was no longer employed because a special educational needs officer deemed the SNA was no longer necessary.  The child is not attending school and her parents will find it difficult to get her back to school.  This human cost of the Minister&rsquo;s decision is being replicated throughout the country.  I urgently ask the Leader to examine the issue of special needs education.  Surely we have some priorities left as a nation.</P>

	<P>Before I respond to the Order of Business, on behalf of the House, I congratulate everybody concerned, including the Taoiseach, Ministers, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and other organisations, on their achievements at the forum in Farmleigh House last weekend.  I sincerely hope something good will come out of it in helping and assisting the Government in formulating the budget.  It was of enormous help and benefit and I congratulate everyone on behalf of the Seanad for their hard work, foresight and endeavour, including those who came from the four corners of the world and who hold the diaspora close to their hearts and want to know what they can do for Ireland, the home of their father, mother, granddad or grandma.  It was a shining example to all of us who were present.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Twomey and John Paul Phelan asked various questions about the Seanad vacancies.  It is my understanding they will possibly be filled in the early part of this session and I assure Senator Fitzgerald we, on the Government side, are very much looking forward to it.</P>
        <P>It was Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time tonight.  Following discussions with the leader of the Independent group, with whom Senator Ross does not seem to have communicated, on two occasions, I decided to forfeit Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s time tonight to allow all Members to make statements on the economy and I understand this was welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I am being misrepresented.  On no occasion did I offer a view or was I in favour of getting rid of Private Members&rsquo; time.  Private Members&rsquo; business should be taken this evening.  I said that consistently to the Leader.  I acknowledge I asked for a debate on the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had an open ended Order of Business and it is now 4.15 p.m.  The Minister will not introduce the Bill until 4.30 p.m.  I wish to get Second Stage taken before midnight and I do not wish to have the staff present while Private Members&rsquo; business is being discussed at 2 a.m.  Staff have been co-operative with the House regarding the banking legislation and other important Bills.  Legislation is the No. 1 priority on the Order of Business.  Legislation will be taken later but to facilitate a debate on the economy, I forfeited Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time, which is a good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I was told by the Leader that Fine Gael would be first to have Private Members&rsquo; time this session.  I do not know why he is saying it <Col N="25"/>was Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s turn for Private Members&rsquo; time this evening.  I was told by him that Fine Gael would have the first Private Members&rsquo; time, which I understood would happen the first week we returned, which is tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also understood that to be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a complete misunderstanding.  I indicated to the Fine Gael leader that on the recall of the first full session, I would give Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; time.  The House sat an extra week in July and we have returned a week earlier in September and therefore, the first full sitting week of the session will be the week following the Lisbon treaty referendum.  Fine Gael will have Private Members&rsquo; time that week.  I do not break my word for anybody and I make that commitment on behalf of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Leader saying this week will not comprise the routine work of the Seanad and we are not putting on the Order Paper what we normally put on it for a working week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il was next in line for Private Members&rsquo; time at the conclusion of the previous session.  It was due to have that time tonight and we will start a new session with Fine Gael&rsquo;s time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader was not asked that question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not usual to have to respond to 40 Senators on the Order of Business.  The Minister is waiting to come into the House and I would appreciate it if I could continue.</P>
        <P>The requests for a debate on education are timely and I will endeavour to have the Minister for Education and Science before the House to update us on, and to clarify, the many urgent issues highlighted by Senators Fitzgerald, Healy Eames and Cannon.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole called for an urgent debate on the public service, value for money and the work done by hard-working, dedicated public servants.  I can accede to that request.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Buttimer and John Paul Phelan sought a debate on NAMA.  The legislation is before the D&aacute;il and I expect it to come to the House at the end of October or in early November.  As I will not guillotine the Bill, I anticipate the House will sit for a good many days to tease out the pros and cons of the proposed legislation.</P>
        <P>With regard to hard pressed mortgage holders and the limited credit being provided by the banks, this urgent matter must be addressed by every Oireachtas Member.  We are being told by the banks that credit is available but we know from our constituencies that this is not the case.  Many people are in extreme difficulty and it is up to us to ensure the Minister for Finance makes money available from the first tranche of NAMA funding to mortgage holders who are rearing families and trying to keep going day to day to ensure they are protected and their mortgages are extended if they must be because these are unprecedented times.  I look forward to the debate on the economy and to Members outlining the difficulties they are hearing about in their constituencies from many of their friends and from those who for generations have been decent people and who have made their repayments and honoured their obligations to the financial institutions down through the years.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Doherty and Ross all inquired about the up-to-date position on Seanad reform.  Submissions have been received from the various parties and the Minister is very anxious to bring the Bill before the House.  We look forward to debating it.  For Senator Ross&rsquo;s information, in relation to amendments, I heard the Ceann Comhairle outline the Bills from <Col N="26"/>the Seanad.  As we all know, Bills came from the D&aacute;il in the last week of the session.  While it is true there were no amendments to the Bills concerned, I remind the Senator and the House that in 2008, 1,201 amendments to various Bills were made in this House and accepted by Ministers of the day, which speaks for itself.  One of the longest serving Members of the House will appreciate this information which will give him heart regarding the long-standing future of the Seanad.  We look forward to real reform when the Minister brings the Bill before the House for our consideration.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, Walsh, Ross, Bradford and O&rsquo;Reilly spoke about the three reports published.  It is my intention that we will discuss each of them in the House.  I will discuss how this can take place with the leaders on the next sitting day.  I fully agree with the requests made to have the reports discussed and teased out at length.</P>
        <P>Senators Glynn and Walsh called for a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the issues Senator Glynn correctly raised regarding the registers.  He also congratulated and welcomed the statement from former Senator Des Hanafin on abortion, on which we can all agree.  I also note the Taoiseach&rsquo;s letter and statement in <i>The Irish Catholic </i>this week, which demonstrates balance and common sense, unlike the other publication, <i>Alive!</i>, which we have to endure in our churches on a Sunday.  One wonders if one is living in the same country when one sees such a publication which the church allows to be placed in front of one&rsquo;s eyes when one is trying to have a word with the good Lord for an hour on a Sunday morning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan, the respected representative from the south of the country, referred to item No. 14 on the Order Paper.  I will make inquiries of the Minister and come back to the Senator in the next day or two.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan again called for a debate on the fishing industry, a request to which I acceded in the last session.  I fully agree with his request and will endeavour to arrange for it to take place in early October.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn and Hanafin spoke on the issue of presumed consent for organ donations.  I will again make this request to the Minister and ascertain when the legislation which is long overdue is due to be brought before us for consideration.  We all fully support the request made by the Senators.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn, Leyden, Bacik, Regan and Healy Eames expressed serious concerns about the forthcoming elections.  Senator Quinn asked if the Minister or the board of directors of An Post had responsibility for the distribution of material by UKIP.  I will have inquiries made to see what the situation is.  At this time in our history when we need to show how seriously we take our membership of the European Union, it has never been more important that we do the right thing.  We all know in our hearts that the right thing to do is to protect every part of our society, as most of the good people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, who are Irish, certainly know.  It is one time in our history when we must say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  It is up to every one of us to do whatever we possibly can to highlight the facts to those who may be hearing untruths and are confused.  Quite a number of our citizens are confused as a result of the outlandish information given to them by the other side.  It is up to every Member of both Houses, members of local authorities <Col N="27"/>and public representatives in general to let the general public know what is before it for its consideration.  If that happens, the result will be a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney, Hanafin and &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the serious situation in which the people of County Donegal find themselves, in particular the mayor and his family, as a result of threats to their lives and the threat of bombings, events which we thought were long passed.  I intend to have the Minister present in the House and allow colleagues to make their statements to ascertain the up-to-date position in his Department.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Hanafin and Donohoe referred to the debate on NAMA.  It was very uplifting to see the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the new Pat Kenny show on Monday night.  I wish Mr. Kenny and all his staff well.  It was a breath of fresh air&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when the general public witnessed someone being asked a question and being allowed to respond without being interrupted.  It was a new Pat Kenny.  On the general line of information the Minister gave, the people were uplifted by the response&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not worried about Pat Kenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because they want to hear something positive to lift them out of the depression and recession in which they currently find themselves.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin referred to a carbon tax and having the same costs North and South.  It is a very good suggestion which I will pass on to the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely, Cummins and Coffey made their points.  I offer our condolences on behalf of the House to the Barry family on the tragic death of Paddy Barry.  I have been a personal friend of his son, Ken, as most Members of the House know, for a number of years.  It is appalling that people, especially senior citizens, are not safe in their own homes.  We will do whatever needs to be done.  I understand the 1997 legislation covers this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators Cummins and Coffey know, coming from Waterford, it is unacceptable in this day and age that this could happen to any person in his or her home.  I will have the Minister, Deputy Ahern, come here.  I thank him because I have made many calls on this issue to him, whether in his constituency in Louth or in Brussels on Monday morning.  We fully support the family and will see what we can do in the coming weeks as a matter of urgency.  As Senator Cummins said, the Law Reform Commission is due to report.  However, senior citizens want immediate action because it behoves us to protect them in their own homes.  It is a right everyone should have.  I, therefore, fully support the call made by all colleagues today.  I have no problem with the report of the commission being discussed in the House.  We also offer our condolences to Kathy Sinnott on what appears to be the sad loss of her son.  </P>
        <P>Senator Daly called for a debate on Gaza.  I gave a commitment in the last session that a debate would take place.</P><Col N="28"/>
        <P>I also want the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come before the House to clarify the position on mobile phone masts.  He quite correctly outlined the position on the development plan of Kerry County Council and what had happened regarding An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty outlined a number of issues.  The proposal by an bord snip nua to close 50 Garda stations, which would save &euro;1 million, does not represent common sense and will not happen.  I remind Senators who spoke about rural transport that the proposed cutbacks in that sector would save just &euro;11 million.  Every Member of the House knows the value of rural transport.  Under no circumstances will we stand by and allow rural transport services to be taken away for the sake of &euro;11 million.</P>

	<P>I thank the Chair for his protection.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill called for a debate on the residential banking sector report.  I can agree to such a debate, which would be very timely.</P>
        <P>I am sure all Members will agree that it was very big of Senator Buttimer to offer his congratulations to the Kerry football team.  He also called for a debate on Ireland.  I would have no difficulty with such a debate, which would be timely as we approach the budget.  He emphasised the importance of the retention of the sport portfolio within the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  We all know from last weekend that sport and tourism are worth &euro;11.8 billion to the Irish economy each year.  One of the uplifting features of the Farmleigh discussions was the importance placed on Irish culture.  Successful Irish people throughout the world can be great ambassadors for our tourism industry and for every other facet of life in Ireland.  I will arrange for a debate on the matter to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan called on the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the Seanad to update Members on the procedures that apply to the adoption of Vietnamese children.  One of last weekend&rsquo;s newspapers drew my attention to a publication on this matter. <Col N="29"/> The Senator also asked me to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to inform the House of what is being done to address the ongoing serious challenge of suicide and to assist the unfortunate people who are affected by it.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden suggested that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, should be asked to address this House on the subject of the challenges being faced in this country&rsquo;s health sector.  The Senator was also keen to get information on what will happen in the health portfolio in the lead-up to the budget.  I will make a request so that such a debate can be facilitated.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to bring the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 before this House for its consideration and, moreover, to have the debate on the Bill initiated in this House.  I propose to offer some general observations on the rationale and general principles informing the content of this amending measure, and then to proceed to summarise the provisions of the Bill.  I appreciate that Members will have a fuller opportunity to explore the provisions in more detail on Committee Stage, something to which I look forward.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, the Government and the social partners had agreed to the implementation of a series of measures on aspects of employment rights and compliance.  These included, in particular, the introduction of legislation to strengthen the arrangements for the making of employment regulation orders, EROs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, that have been features of our legal system for more than 60 years and to provide for their continued effective operation.  I am pleased to say that this commitment is being met within the framework of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The joint labour committee, JLC, and registered employment agreement systems have been the subject of a number of recent legal challenges that have gone to the High Court.  As well as raising issues specific to particular EROs or REAs, these challenges also related to the constitutional propriety of the legislative provisions under which they were made.  This Bill will provide for a number of amendments to the existing legislative framework surrounding the JLC and REA systems, including improved procedures and clear principles and policies to be taken into account by JLCs when formulating proposals for EROs.  The Bill also provides that EROs and REAs will be given legal effect in future by ministerial order and that a perceived gap in the scope of parliamentary supervision will be filled by providing for Oireachtas scrutiny of these instruments.</P>
        <P>Joint labour committees are independent bodies composed of representatives of employers and workers in a particular sector with a chairman who is appointed by the Minister.  There are currently 13 JLCs in existence.  The committees meet periodically to discuss and agree rates of pay and conditions of employment to apply to workers in a particular sector.  JLCs operate in areas where collective bargaining is not well established and wages tend to be lower than other sectors of the economy, for example, in the hospitality sector, hairdressing, retail groceries and contract cleaning.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that many firms operating in sectors covered by EROs are experiencing considerable difficulties at present.  I appreciate that these issues, along with the impact of strengthened arrangements for enforcement and inspection, have also been of concern to Members of this House and have been debated here in recent months in particular with my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  These difficulties have been to the fore throughout a series of meetings I have had since I took office as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs during which I have met representatives of employer organisations and of those employed in these sectors.</P>
        <P>In my view the parties represented on a joint labour committee are best placed to address the impact of the economic crisis on employment levels and the viability of services in their sectors.  They are the ones who must discuss and reflect on the new realities in the context of the downturn in the economy.</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P>At national level the social partners have co-operated in developing a range of improvements designed to modernise the JLC system as envisaged under previous social partnership agreements.  These reforms have facilitated the amalgamation and abolition by agreement of a number of JLCs, and the strengthening of their operational arrangements through the standardisation of the content of EROs.  They have resulted in a closer alignment of the variation of EROs with the cycle of adjustments of the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say this shared capacity for co-operation has also been demonstrated by the representatives who comprise the membership of particular JLCs.  This is reflected in the agreements reached on the adjustment of the Sunday premium rate from double time to time plus one third that have already taken effect in hotels and catering establishments over recent weeks.  That same realism has informed the successful efforts made by both sides within the agriculture and retail sectors to reach agreement on the deferral of increases in minimum rates that would otherwise have fallen due later this year.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is exactly 100 years since bodies empowered to set minimum wages were first established in Britain and Ireland under the Trade Boards Act 1909.  As part of the major reform of the Irish industrial relations pioneered by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Se&aacute;n Lemass, in 1946, these bodies were given the new title of joint labour committees and their competence was expanded beyond the fixing of minimum wages only so as to cover the regulation of conditions of employment as well.  Se&aacute;n Lemass decided to amend the powers of the original trade boards and to transfer the supervisory and order-making functions that had been exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the years after the foundation of the State to the new, independent Labour Court.  Under the provisions of the 1946 Act, when a JLC agrees terms and conditions, it makes proposals to the Labour Court on foot of which the Labour Court can make employment regulation orders, EROs.</P>
        <P>Today I am proposing a change that will restore the position whereby the Minister makes the order giving effect to these proposals.  At the same time, I am proposing to strengthen the manner in which the functions delegated to joint labour committees are supervised by the Labour Court and to ensure that the statute sets out a clear set of procedures and principles within which these delegated functions are to be discharged.  I am also proposing that the standard legislative provision dealing with the laying of statutory instruments before the Houses of the Oireachtas will apply henceforth to these orders.</P>
        <P>The Irish system of registered employment agreements, REAs, has been in force since 1946 and reflects the European tradition of labour law support for autonomous collective bargaining.  In most other EU countries similar provisions apply in employment law facilitating the general enforceability of certain collective agreements, through either legislation or other administrative measures.  Collective agreements can be presented to the Labour Court for registration.  Where the Labour Court is satisfied that the agreement presented satisfies the statutory requirements, it registers the agreement.  The effect of this is to make the provisions of the agreement legally enforceable in respect of every worker of the class, type or group to which it is expressed to apply and to his or her employer, even if such worker or employer is not a party to the agreement.  In line with the arrangements I have already mentioned in the case of employment regulations orders, I am proposing an amendment that will ensure that henceforth such orders confirming the terms of a new or varied agreement will be made by the Minister rather than simply under the authority of the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; under section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Access to the dispute settling agencies &mdash; Labour Relations <Col N="33"/>Commission, Labour Court and Rights Commissioner Service &mdash; is governed by the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in section 23.  At present, vocational education committee officers do not have access to these agencies, as they are specifically excluded from the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.  Up to now these officers have been served by a scheme of conciliation and arbitration, but they now wish to be able to access the dispute-settling agencies like workers generally.  This amendment would allow officers of VECs, other than teachers, access to the dispute-settling agencies.  Teachers in VECs would continue to be served by a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
        <P>I also intend to follow the evolving best practice in parliamentary procedure with regard to the use of delegated powers by deleting the provision that had enabled the Government to amend the definition of worker simply by order.  This will ensure that future changes in the definition of worker will be made only by means of primary legislation.  To avoid any doubt in this regard, a ministerial order of 1998, giving local authority staff access to the dispute-settling agencies, is also being confirmed by a proposed amendment of the statute.</P>
        <P>In addition to proceeding with legislative proposals to strengthen the existing JLC system and the operation of REAs as outlined in this Bill, I am also considering introducing an &ldquo;inability to pay&rdquo; mechanism so as to rebalance the existing statutory wage-fixing mechanisms.  The current demands of both trade unions and employers to modernise and streamline the JLC system and to strengthen the legal status of REAs should be complemented by the introduction of an amendment to alleviate the serious difficulties that employers in some sectors currently experience under both systems.  My officials are engaged in consultations with the social partners on this proposed addition to the Bill.  I intend to bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage in light of the outcome of these consultations.</P>
        <P>Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the definitions associated with the Bill.  Section 3 provides for a new definition of &ldquo;registered employment agreement&rdquo; to differentiate those made before the commencement of this Act, which were registered by the Labour Court, and those made after the commencement of the Act, which will be confirmed by ministerial order.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for the confirmation by order of a registered employment agreement by the Minister.  Following receipt of a copy of an agreement, the Minister shall make an order confirming the terms of the agreement.  The standard legislative provision dealing with the laying of the order before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister will apply.  Section 4 also provides that the introduction of the new procedure will not detract from the validity of an existing REA made before the commencement of this Act.  Sections 5 and 6 provide for the same procedure as under section 4 in respect of an order to vary an agreement or to cancel an agreement respectively.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides for a new definition of &ldquo;employment regulation order&rdquo; to differentiate between those made by the Labour Court before the commencement of this Act and those made by ministerial order after the commencement of this Act.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for the &ldquo;principles and policies&rdquo; to which a joint labour committee must have regard when formulating proposals to submit to the Labour Court for employment regulation orders.  In this context, a JLC must have regard to the following: the legitimate interests of the workers; the legitimate interests of the employers; the prevailing economic circumstances; the prevailing employment circumstances of the workers; the prevailing commercial circumstances of the employers; and the terms of any national agreement relating to pay and conditions, for the time being in force.  Section 8 also provides that where an employment regulation order has been in force for less than six months, a joint labour committee may submit proposals for revoking or amending the order where it is satisfied that the order contains an error, or exceptional circumstances exist which warrant the revocation or amendment.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>Section 9 provides for the making of an ERO by the Minister.  Following adoption of a proposal for an ERO by the Labour Court, the proposals will be forwarded to the Minister who shall make an order giving effect to the proposals.  The standard legislative provision dealing with the laying of the order before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister will apply.  Section 9 also provides that the introduction of the new procedure will not detract from the validity of an existing ERO made before the commencement of the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; under section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to allow officers of VECs, other than teachers, access to the dispute-settling agencies.  Section 10 also provides for the deletion of sections 23(2), 23(5) and 23(6) of the 1990 Act.  Section 23(5) provides that the Government may by order amend the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in section 23(1) and may by order revoke or amend any such order.  Section 23(6) deals with the laying of such orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The effect of these amendments is to remove the power to make changes in the definition of worker by ministerial order and to ensure, in line with the decision in the case of Mulcreevy <i>v</i>. the Minister for Environment and Local Government, that future changes in the definition of worker will be made by primary legislation.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Definition of &ldquo;Worker&rdquo;) Order 1998 amended the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in section 23(1) of the Industrial Relations Act of 1990 in order to give officers of local authorities, including health boards, access to the Labour Relations Commission, Labour Court and rights commissioners.  Since it is considered unsafe to rely on changes made to statute by secondary legislation, it is now proposed to make the amendment in primary legislation.  The definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; contained in section 23(2) of the 1990 Act should be deleted in consequence.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for improved procedures to be followed when formulating proposals for an ERO.  The current legislation merely requires that, when proposals for the making of an ERO are being forwarded to the Labour Court, the JLC chairman must submit a report to the court on the circumstances surrounding their adoption by the JLC.  The Bill provides that, in future, the chairman of the JLC shall forward to the Labour Court, in addition to a report on the circumstances surrounding their adoption, copies of all written submissions and any other documentation considered by the JLC in formulating its proposals.  The Labour Court will consider the material forwarded to it in considering the JLC&rsquo;s proposals and may hold a hearing where there are objections to the proposals.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides that the term of office of a chairman of a JLC shall not exceed five years and he or she shall cease to hold office on attaining the age of 65.  An existing JLC chairman shall hold office for no longer than three years following enactment.  Section 13 provides for consequential amendments to the Employment Permits Act 2006 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, the statutory minimum terms and conditions applicable to workers in vulnerable sectors covered by EROs, along with our system of universally applicable, legally enforceable collective agreements represented by REAs, together have their origin in the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  Senators will be aware that these provisions have taken on new significance in the light of recent controversy about the European directive on the posting of workers and the implications of the recent European Court of Justice rulings in cases such as Laval and R&uuml;ffert.  I commend the recent report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on the Lisbon treaty and workers&rsquo; rights for confirming that the disputes which gave rise to those cases could not have happened in Ireland.  Since EROs and REAs have been enshrined in our domestic legislation and now qualify &mdash; along with our national <Col N="35"/>minimum wage &mdash; as core employment standards under the EU directive, they are automatically applicable to and can be enforced against contractors based outside Ireland.  These instruments ensure foreign service providers cannot undermine the competitive position of Irish contractors or displace Irish workers.</P>
        <P>The overall purpose of this Bill, together with the Employment Law Compliance Bill, which has completed Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is now awaiting further consideration on Committee and remaining Stages before coming to the Seanad, is to secure greatly increased public confidence in the system of compliance and to strengthen and uphold the established employment rights bodies against legal challenge.  With the publication of this Bill and this debate, the Government is continuing to meet commitments on core elements of the range of employment rights measures agreed with the social partners and is again demonstrating the benefit of structured social dialogue as an enabler of economic and social progress.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him and his officials for their help to members of the Opposition prior to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
        <P>There are a number of issues I would like to address in my contribution.  I am glad the Minister of State, in the context of the upcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty, referred in the last part of his speech to the Laval judgment.  Some rather spurious allegations have been placed on posters throughout the country about the potential impact of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on the minimum wage.  We have known for some time that the Lisbon treaty has nothing to do with our ability to determine our own national minimum wage but it is important those bogus arguments be blown out of the water.  In this regard I concur with what the Minister of State said in his contribution.</P>
        <P>This Bill is relatively small legislation which addresses a number of specific issues that have arisen over recent years.  That is one of the primary reasons we in Fine Gael have some difficulties with it.  We feel it is an opportunity for the Government to address the way the JLC structure operates and we regret it has failed to use this opportunity to introduce uniform measures throughout the country.  However, I will deal with that later.  I have no difficulty with the extension, as mentioned in the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution, of the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to include VEC staff.  The current position which pertains as a result of a Labour Court decision with regard to county council and HSE employees is now enshrined in primary legislation, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been introduced on foot of an impending High Court case, probably to be heard in the early months of next year, which follows on from a number of similar cases over recent years, including one involving the Irish Hotels Federation and the Burke case in 1979 in which Mr. Justice Henchy pointed out that there may be a constitutional difficulty with the arrangement resulting from the 1946 legislation, to which the Minister of State referred, whereby the final decision on EROs and REAs rested with the Labour Court rather than the Oireachtas and the Minister with responsibility for labour.  I have no difficulty with correcting that anomaly, but I question the fact it has taken 30 years to follow up on the judgment of Mr. Justice Henchy when I was one year old in 1979.  It is welcome none the less.</P>
        <P>I will spell out clearly the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s position on JLCs.  We are adamant that their role in protecting the most vulnerable workers in our economy should be upheld.  Often, people covered by JLCs are among the lowest paid and, as the Minister of State said, many of them are not members of trade unions.  In addition, many are younger or migrant workers.  It is important the JLC structure of protection remains in place in some form into the future.  It is also important to point out that the JLC system as it currently stands does not just refer to <Col N="36"/>wages and direct payments but also to the conditions under which people work.  Fine Gael has a clear position on protecting the lowest paid people in our economy.</P>
        <P>This Bill gave the Government an opportunity to correct the anomalies that exist under the current JLC system.  Our system stems from the introduction in 1909 of trade boards across Britain and Ireland, as well as the old age pension and a number of other measures, by the Liberal Government.  This was reformed by the then Minister, Se&aacute;n Lemass, in 1946, as mentioned by the Minister of State, when the trade boards were replaced by JLCs.  It is important to note that in the UK the trade boards do not exist any more.  When minimum wage legislation was introduced in 1997, the old system of the trade boards had already been dismantled.  It is regrettable the Government has failed in this opportunity to ensure we have uniform treatment of workers and employers in different sectors of the economy.  It is not acceptable that in certain sectors of the economy a separate JLC will operate in Cork, Dublin or elsewhere in determining wage rates.  The Government has missed an opportunity to propose a uniform mechanism throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I made an observation when reading some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  I do not wish to attack him personally.  I am delighted he has been made a Minister of State because he brings to the job a clean pair of hands and he has good ideas.  However, he mentioned shortly after his appointment that he would consider a significant reform of how JLCs operate at present.  Despite this, in his first Bill it seems he is passing up this opportunity.  The current method of operation of JLCs is that four representatives of employers and four of employees sit in committee, with an independent chair, as the Minister of State pointed out.  However, the independent chairperson has a casting vote.  In most situations in which a vote is called, the employers will be on one side and the employees on the other, and Fine Gael believes the chairperson should not have a casting vote.  There should be real agreement between employees and employers and the Labour Court can then make its decision.  It places the role of the independent chairperson in question if he or she were to cast a vote on the ultimate outcome of the deliberations of the committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to the inability to pay a clause that exists under the minimum wage legislation.  Such a clause is not contained in the Bill under discussion but the Minister of State indicated that such a clause is being considered and will be introduced as a Government amendment on Committee Stage.  In the current economic depression it is imperative that such a clause would be included in this legislation.  I would welcome its inclusion, provided employers can show clearly that they have an inability to pay under the current economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting the JLC mechanisms in the catering and hotel sectors, as the Minister of State mentioned, have ensured the Sunday premium rate has been reduced from double time to time plus one third.  I welcome that because, economically, it is more sustainable in the current climate.  I also welcome it from a practical point of view because the previous Sunday premium rate was having a detrimental impact on services provided at weekends and on bank holidays in small and large towns throughout the country.  The current premium rate is more in line with what can be sustained into the future.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned agreements reached in the agricultural sector and other sectors in recent months to postpone increases in payments under the JLC system to workers in those sectors.  That mechanism was too slow.  We have been in an economic downturn for a considerable number of months, yet in May of this year increases under decisions of JLCs across the country were still being paid while employers were experiencing economic hardship arising from our current economic difficulties.  The system, as it currently operates, is too slow.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement concerning an inability to pay a clause.  However, this Bill represents a missed opportunity to introduce a more fundamental reform to ensure the protection of the weakest and most vulnerable workers in our economy, the sustainability of existing jobs and the creation of jobs in those sectors in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill and the opening comments of the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs in introducing it.  In the context of a point raised by the previous Opposition spokesperson, we must be clear that part of the necessity for this legislation, in the first instance, has been the ongoing legal situation.  As a Member of this House and when I was a Member of the other House, I criticised the fact that too often impending court decisions or actual court decisions have made us revisit legislation which in the first instance we did not get right.  An attempt has been made with several Bills to introduce a shell of enabling legislation, the meat of which came through by secondary sources, mainly through ministerial order.  I especially welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in not only addressing the anomaly that exists in the primary legislation that we are amending but his intention to allow further amendments to this legislation, by way of ministerial order, which will involve the Houses in a right and proper way.  I believe we will avoid such mistakes in the future.  That is the first ground for the introduction of this legislation.</P>
        <P>This Bill is part of a suite of measures, one of which, the Employment Law Compliance Act, is in place.  The Government announced, through the social partners, its intention to draft other legislation which will result in creating a clearer picture in terms of this area.  On that ground, I hope the main Opposition party will revisit its position.  This is necessary amending legislation.  It should be addressed in the spirit of trying to bring about these changes to the law as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>We are talking about a system that has largely suited us well.  The existence of the joint labour committees is evidenced by one of the most recent decisions concerning the hospitality sector, the addressing of premium rate for Sunday work.  We have missed the opportunity to have a debate on the wider issue of the prevalence of commercial activity on Sundays, but given the nature of the need to stimulate any economic activity, that is a debate that has passed us by.  We have become an Americanised economy and the need to have people working seven days a week almost 24 hours a day is something we have built into our economic model.  Severe competitive pressures existed in regard to the premium rate for Sunday work in the hospitality sector.  The joint labour committee has reached a sound and wise decision in the constraints of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  It is a system that works and it is informed by how employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements are reached.  It is important that we can use the existing structure, modulated to the extent that it needs to be, and build on the sound aspects of social partnership, of which we probably need more at this stage in our economic history than we did at any other time.</P>
        <P>I noted the Minister of State&rsquo;s reference to the former Minister and former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, in his role in the 1946 legislation.  We are approaching the 50th anniversary of probably his best political achievement, while working with T. K. Whitaker, namely, the formulation of the economic plan which took Ireland from being a doldrum economic State and gave it a new economic future.  A recent forum was held on Se&aacute;n Lemass&rsquo;s contribution.  It focused very much on the theme that the economic climate at the end of the 1950s has parallels with the current economic climate.  We need to look at how we can readjust our economic parameters to make sure the leap we need to make can be taken in the most effective and most competitive way possible.</P>
        <P>The context of getting that competitive balance right and giving entrants to the labour force equal opportunities and a fair means of engaging their labour is something we as legislators <Col N="38"/>need to get right.  The Minister of State in his early weeks of taking office raised the question of a debate on the minimum wage.  It is right to have debate on such an issue at any time.  He got a negative media reaction to raising that issue.  Our minimum wage affects a very small proportion of our labour force, some 2%.  While it is a high rate in terms of other European countries and our economic competitors, it has been set in the context of our having a cost of living that is higher than that in those countries.  Even while we are in a deflationary situation, the public mood and public debate is informed by the fact that while we have wage rates that are exaggerated throughout our economy, a tolerance for changing the rates, especially at the lowest level, cannot be seen until the wages at the highest level begin to be tackled.  We in this House and in the political system have a role to play in that respect.  We have not done it very effectively in the 18 months during which our economic circumstances have changed.  In terms of the upcoming budget, we need to be realistic about who gets paid what before we can talk about what those paid the least receive.  I hope the debate as it proceeds will progress along those lines.</P>
        <P>Another important aspect of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, as mentioned by Senator Phelan, is the context of Irish industrial relations and labour legislation as opposed to other European countries and the use of spurious argument in the debate on the referendum on the Lisbon treaty in regard to whether we have good industrial standards in this country and whether they will be affected by a positive vote on the Lisbon treaty.  It is clear from the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution, and augmented by Senator Phelan, that that is not the case.  We do provide a measure of protection in our labour law system that goes beyond what exists in other European countries and this will be maintained through legislation such as this.</P>
        <P>It is hoped, rather than the downward pressure of lowest common denominators some of the opponents of the European Union and Lisbon treaty argue, this will be part of our contribution towards strengthening those standards in Europe.  The experience of Ireland in other aspects of employment law, namely, women and equality and upward wage rates, would seem to confirm that when we were lagging behind in many areas we were forced to meet higher standards and where we have higher standards, equally we, as good members of the European Union, should be making our argument for better European standards in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the spurious arguments relate to the minimum wage.  The C&oacute;ir poster, which is appalling, claims a minimum wage of &euro;1.84 will pertain if people vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  The Bill, though slight in content, is part of a package of measures that will result in improvements in this area.  It will build on the strength of the existing infrastructure and will remove any doubt about the role of this and the other House in terms of ensuring any further changes, in particular in regard to definitions, how the constitution of the JLCs are made and how we will further change EROs and REAs in the future, will be such that there should be no legal doubt that we are doing our work in a proper manner and, as a result, are bringing about better legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Our world changed last year and not for the better.  The financial crisis is not understood in this country.  While I am aware we will have an opportunity to speak about the economy in approximately half an hour I want at this stage to touch on how our world has changed.  The crisis affects everything.  Many of the topics upon which the Minister of State touched, which appeared normal and assumed criteria in the past, no longer <Col N="39"/>apply to the same extent.  We no longer have that luxury.  We now have to borrow &euro;400 million every week and I do not know whether we will be able to continue to do that.  We must cut expenses and find a way to become more competitive.</P>
        <P>I touch on these issues having just read the National Competitiveness Council document on the competitiveness of our nation.  I do not believe this matter is understood.  I would like to touch on this subject in so far as it relates to this particular issue.  Approximately six or eight months ago, Senator Ross and I were contacted by O&rsquo;Briens Sandwich Bars who wished to employ people on a Sunday and could not do so because they could not afford the rates of pay agreed between employers and the unions.  They found that although there were people who were willing to work at the rate they were willing to pay, they could not employ them on that rate because they would be in breach of the ERO regulations.  While this may have made sense three or five years ago &mdash; I do not believe it did &mdash; it no longer makes sense.  The Minister of State mentioned that some of these figures have been adjusted.</P>
        <P>We pass regulations and rules to legitimise agreements made between employers and employees.  I am concerned we are still living in the past and do not recognise that the employment regulation orders in place are far too difficult to maintain.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment met yesterday with a deputation from the newsagents and independent grocers who said they could employ more people but could not pay the agreed rates and as such would be in breach of the regulations.  It is time to acknowledge that the EROs were good in the past but that that is no longer the case.</P>
        <P>I have made the point in the past that some jobs do not exist at a certain rate.  I was involved in the supermarket business.  There was a time when we were able to employ people to pack bags for customers or to take their trolleys to their cars.  They were not highly paid jobs but they were the first step on the ladder.  In later years, we were unable to do that.  I am not suggesting they were great jobs.  Mr. Bill Cullen&rsquo;s book, <i>It&rsquo;s a Long Way from Penny Apples</i>, a book everybody should read, tells how when he started work in a garage his job was cleaning windscreens and so on and how when times were tough and people were being let go he was kept on because he was enthusiastic about his job.  We must be careful to ensure we do not, with the best will in the world, put in place restrictions or legitimise agreements between employers and employees that in effect hinder or stifle the opportunity to create jobs that may be first steps on the ladder.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that consumers are not taken into account in this legislation.  Long before the Minister of State was born, back in the late 1960s or early 1970s, I fought a case in the Supreme Court against early closing legislation that had been enacted in 1938.  That legislation stated that if employers and employees in a certain business agreed on certain closing times or early opening hours they had to apply to everybody.  That legislation was in operation from 1938 to 1969 when I found a loophole in it and challenged it in the courts.  I mention this because it relates to two groups, employers and employees, who entered into an agreement which was in their interests but ignored the interests of the consumer.  The same is happening here.</P>
        <P>A few months ago, when in Dundalk to say goodbye to some staff who had worked for years in a supermarket that was closing, I suggested to some of the butchers that they might find work in Newry and they told me they would not work there because they would be paid only one third of what they earned in Dundalk.  I am not suggesting this is based on any agreement between unions and employers.  However, if we remain uncompetitive we will lose business, be it to Northern Ireland or somewhere else.  We will lose the jobs we would have had ourselves.  If we institutionalise by agreements between employers and employees that apply to everybody else, there is a danger we will become even more uncompetitive than we are.</P><Col N="40"/>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to our high minimum wage rates and almost excused them by saying that the cost of living here is high, which is chicken and egg.  Our cost of living is high because of high rates, which are to a certain extent institutionalised by the agreements we are speaking about.  One of the chief arguments used by employers who challenged the pay deals in court was that they were not sanctioned by the Oireachtas.  This Bill will address that issue.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that this legislation is an example of how the Oireachtas controls the national minimum wage and the sectoral pay rates agreed through registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders.  I am concerned that while such arrangements may be the right approach to take in the long term, in a time of crisis such as this &mdash; unfortunately, as a nation we have not recognised its full extent &mdash; the priority must be to take action to contain employment costs and make ourselves more competitive.  These types of agreements between employers and employees are fine when they apply only to the parties concerned, but a more general application is not the correct approach to take.  Therefore, I question the entire objective of what we are seeking to achieve in this legislation.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Gabhaim leithsc&eacute;al leis toisc nach bhfuil m&eacute; ach ag teacht agus ag imeacht, mar t&aacute;im ag freastal ar chomchoiste ag a bhfuil Conradh na Gaeilge i l&aacute;thair.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  </P>
        <P>The background of the Bill is the uncertainty regarding the status of registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders, both of which set wage levels and often other obligations such as those relating to sick pay, pensions and overtime in a particular industry.  The wage levels thus agreed are referred to as the joint labour court or JLC rates.  This mechanism, dating from the 1940s, was effectively an embryonic means of setting a minimum wage for particular categories of workers.  It is interesting to note that the equivalent system in the United Kingdom was abolished in 1993 by the Conservative Government with the support of the trade unions which were of the view that such arrangements hindered collective bargaining.  Given that these agreements set a level of pay in excess of the minimum wage, they are understandably resented by employers.  It was for this reason that in 2008 their constitutionality and human rights aspect were challenged in the courts, with mixed success.</P>
        <P>The Government promises to rectify the situation by way of this legislation which obliges the Minister to confirm the decisions of the various joint labour committees and the Labour Court and proposes that such decisions be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas which will have the power to annul them.  IBEC has proposed an amendment to the effect that businesses be given a mechanism to opt out of JLC rates, similar to the opt-out clause afforded under the minimum wage legislation.  According to a briefing from William Fry, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, in bringing forward this legislation, reiterated his previous comments that it may be timely to consider bringing the JLC and REA systems into line with the procedures already established under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 which allows employers to submit inability to pay claims to the court in order to obtain a temporary exemption from the minimum wage obligation.  In other words, there was an indication that something along the lines of the IBEC proposal would be introduced.  The Minister of State may be able to enlighten me as to his intentions in this regard, but no such provision is included in the Bill presented to us today.  Obviously, the unions will oppose any such provision and we must be mindful of the requirements of social partnership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are all aware that the extent of the economic difficulties we face is forcing us to question some of our most cherished assumptions.  It is beyond dispute that all public policy in this area, as in many others, should start from the point that the dignity of the person must be the highest priority in all initiatives we propose and support.  It is beyond dispute that when wages are too <Col N="41"/>low, the dignity of the person is at risk and there is potential for abuse and exploitation.  Historically, we are very aware of the suffering of people on low wages and such suffering remains in evidence in many parts of the world where people endure outrageous working conditions in return for a pittance that barely keeps body and soul together and is entirely insufficient to support families.  On the other hand, recent experience in this State shows how wages that are too high can damage competitiveness, a consequence that will ultimately be to our social detriment.</P>
        <P>While we all wish to see workers not only survive but thrive in terms of the wages they receive for the good work they do, we are also aware that high employment costs can have a negative impact, particularly in the very competitive and dangerous situation in which we currently find ourselves.  That is why we should discuss and give careful consideration to the IBEC amendment.  If we are minded to advocate such a change, whereby businesses would have a mechanism to opt out of JLC rate agreements in the same manner in which they can do so under the minimum wages legislation, I am confident there would be a beneficial effect for many of the businesses which provide employment throughout the State.  For example, I am aware of a restaurant in a tourist location in County Clare which has opted not to offer Sunday lunch because of the astronomical staff costs involved.  The closure of business premises and the associated loss of employment or services to communities is a far more detrimental outcome than any difficulties associated with a mechanism allowing employers to make the case that they should only pay a portion of JLC rates.</P>
        <P>It is important that employers and employees know about their rights and obligations.  Many employers are unaware of what they are required to do and consequently tend to get caught for arrears.  On the other hand, many staff, especially young, foreign or non-unionised workers, are unaware of their rights.  A potential solution might be to issue a booklet with the necessary information as each new PPS number is ascribed.  The number of inspectors working for the National Employment Rights Authority is very small.  This is something that should be reviewed once the recruitment freeze in the public sector is lifted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 10 of the Bill which amends section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act allows officers of VECs, other than teachers, to access dispute settlement agencies, including the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  This is welcome.  Section 11 provides that in deciding whether to accept the recommendation of a joint labour committee, the Labour Court will have access to all submissions made by interested parties to the committee, not just the report of the chairman, as is currently the case.  This too will be of assistance to both employers and employees. Mar achoimre ghairid, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh muid praitici&uacute;il agus go dtuigeann muid go bhfuil s&eacute; pr&aacute;inneach go mbeadh c&oacute;imhe&aacute; idir ceart an duine tuarastal ceart a fh&aacute;il d&aacute; chuid oibre, de r&eacute;ir d&iacute;nit an duine sin, agus ag an am ch&eacute;anna go dtuigeann muid gur ceart, m&aacute; t&aacute; r&aacute;ta&iacute; r&oacute;-ard &aacute; &iacute;oc, go mbeidh &aacute;iteanna &aacute; dh&uacute;nadh agus nach mbeadh sin ar mhaithe le leas an phobail, na heacnama&iacute;ochta n&aacute; na t&iacute;re.

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, as he presents this important legislation to the House.  The issue of workers&rsquo; rights has been extensively debated in the last year.  The combination of the most challenging economic crisis we have ever faced and the forthcoming Lisbon treaty referendum has succeeded in placing it centre stage.  In addition, several legal challenges have put the existing legislation under the spotlight.  The purpose of <Col N="42"/>the Bill is to strengthen the existing scheme for making both employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  It has come about because of High Court challenges to the operation of EROs and REAs.</P>
        <P>Both REAs and EROs represent minimum pay systems for certain categories of workers.  Following several legal challenges, this legislation is being introduced to deal with the flaws in the system.  New measures introduced by the Bill will see clear and transparent policies taken into account by joint labour committees when setting out proposals for EROs.  The legislation enables joint labour committees to take account of the economic and commercial circumstances of employers when setting out proposals for EROs.  This is extremely important given the financial pressures facing all small businesses at present.  The legislation also sets out a series of principles that must be taken into consideration by a joint labour committee when submitting its proposals to the Labour Court.  This includes the legitimate interests of the workers and employers as well as the economic circumstances of the employers and the workers.  At present, there are 67 REAs maintained by the Labour Court &mdash; only four of these have wage rates that have been updated in the last four years.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons this legislation is being introduced is that both EROs and REAs have their own limitations.  They can be complex and in many instances can be obsolete as they often set wage rates similar to the national minimum wage.  A recent industrial relations journal found that 80% of joint labour committees&rsquo; rates, which govern EROs, were only 10% above the national minimum wage, which is currently &euro;8.65 per hour.  Also, these agreements can be complex and time consuming to negotiate.  Another anomaly is that joint labour committees predate the introduction of the minimum wage in 2000.  In the past, JLCs have been criticised for being selective and not covering many areas of low paid work.  In a recent survey, the overall majority of trade unions and independent members still believe JLCs are necessary.</P>
        <P>Given the extent and the scale of the economic problems we are now facing, small and medium sized businesses are finding it very difficult to survive.  Business people face huge pressures.  Competitiveness is key to our economic recovery.  Some people have used the current financial climate to suggest it will result in a race to the bottom for employers.  I do not believe that is correct.  The issue of workers&rsquo; rights has been grossly misrepresented by some people in the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  Nobody who cares about workers&rsquo; rights can honestly call for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum.  If anything, the Lisbon treaty realigns the Union&rsquo;s fundamental law in favour of workers.  In my view, there are two big winners if the treaty is implemented &mdash; national parliaments, whose powers are greatly increased, and workers, whose interests get robust treaty protection.  I urge people not to believe the statement on posters displayed throughout the country claiming the minimum wage will be &euro;1.84 per hour.  That will not and cannot happen.  The Members of this Parliament cannot allow it to happen.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights contains a host of other new protections for workers&rsquo; rights, which will be given treaty status for the first time if the treaty is ratified.  They include a right to information and consultation with the employer, Article 27, a right of collective bargaining and action, Article 28, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, Article 30, the right to fair and just working conditions, Article 31, and rights surrounding parental leave, among others, in Article 33.  In terms of increased protection of workers&rsquo; rights, consider, for example, the Lisbon treaty&rsquo;s &ldquo;horizontal social&rdquo; clause.  For the first time, the Union would be obliged to consider the social consequences of decisions in making its policies.  This is entirely new in the Union&rsquo;s basic law.  Economic or free trade considerations will have to be weighed against workers&rsquo; rights considerations if the treaty is implemented.  How can the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign oppose that?</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>In addition to the treaty&rsquo;s advances in this area, our European partners have all endorsed, at the Government&rsquo;s request, a solemn declaration on the importance the EU attaches to workers&rsquo; rights.  This sets out in a single place the importance the European Union attaches to a social Europe.  Growth and competition are not ends in themselves but are the means to achieving the social market economy which we, as Europeans and Irish citizens, support.  The claim that the EU could introduce a minimum wage of &euro;1.84 is simply false.  The national minimum wage and the sectoral pay rates agreed through REAs and EROs are the key assets in our national legislation which ensure there can be no race to the bottom.</P>
        <P>I welcome many sections of the Minister&rsquo;s speech, particularly the reference to the shared capacity for co-operation which has been demonstrated by the representatives who comprise the membership of particular JLCs.  This is an important part of the legislation.  Under section 10, the Government may, by order, amend the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in section 23(1).  It can effect those amendments through ministerial order.  I also welcome the provisions relating to workers in VECs.  The Bill proposes to introduce an inability to pay mechanism.  The Government has decided to bring forward a mechanism to enable employers to seek a temporary exemption from the strict application of the EROs and REAs under certain conditions.  There were many meetings with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor at parliamentary level dealing with the difficulty employers had employing people on Sundays and so forth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, and wish him well with his portfolio, which deals with labour relations, the labour market and labour in general.  I wish to comment on a point Senator Carty raised about the Lisbon treaty referendum, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign and its posters claiming there will be a minimum wage of &euro;1.84 per hour.  It is unbelievable that people would, in this day and age, use posters in a campaign to claim that the minimum wage will be reduced to &euro;1.84 per hour if the treaty is passed.  That is absolute balderdash and is unsubstantiated in any way.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation.  The Minister outlined the various issues it covers.  I also welcome the decision to reduce the rate from double time for weekend work to time and one third.  Our tourism industry is very important but it has become very uncompetitive.  As Senator Quinn said, it is something of a chicken and egg situation.  We have a high minimum wage and a high wage economy.  How does one go about rectifying and reducing that to compete with other economies?  High minimum wages are required to pay for the provision of goods and services so people on the lower rung of the ladder are not disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>Our tourism is very important but when one visits countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy and compares the cost of services, eating out, groceries and so forth with the costs in this country, one can see a huge difference.  We cannot compete with the likes of Spain and Portugal in terms of the cost of food and eating out.  It is therefore a help that the Minister has reduced the overtime rate on Sundays from double time to time and one third.  However, there is another issue the Minister should consider and it relates to pensions.  Undoubtedly, people who work at weekends deserve to be rewarded for working unsociable hours.  We have contributory and non-contributory pensions.  A new pension should be introduced for those who work unsocial hours and weekends.  Under the new pension scheme, such employees should pay a different rate of PRSI.  The Government should consider this proposal as it would benefit those who work unsocial hours.</P>

	<P>Since last September Ireland has been caught in and particularly badly affected by the severest global economic and financial crisis of the post-war years which has cost an estimated 59 million jobs worldwide.  Domestically, it has had grave consequences for employment, living standards and the public finances, as well as for a now vulnerable banking sector which has only been sustained by radical State intervention.</P>
        <P>The causes and responsibility for the effects felt in Ireland will be hotly debated for a long time to come.  Some causes arise because this is a globalised country dependent on external trade.  The country was in a rapid catch-up phase which, in certain respects, overshot.  We became, if not over-ambitious, certainly over-extended and underestimated the risks.  As more than 30 academicians in Britain stated in reply to a royal question, the optimism worldwide about light regulation, incentives for short-term financial profit-making and the belief this was a new financial world order, together with the feel good factor for households, businesses and government from ready credit and overflowing revenues, all contributed to the disaster.  No one properly understood the effect of a series of interconnected imbalances.</P>
        <P>For some 15 years Ireland headed the international growth tables and was one of the countries which benefited most.  Many benefits will be lasting and survive the current crisis.  This is not to claim that all moneys were well spent but until 2008 most of the pressures on the Government from the Opposition and the media were to spend more and tax less, rather than for greater prudence and restraint.  The country has critical choices to make with respect to our economic and political future in the coming weeks.  I welcome the opportunity on behalf of the Government to contribute to the statements in the Seanad on the economy.  The referendum on the Lisbon treaty, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency to address the issue of confidence in the asset quality of the banking system and the framing of the next budget are all major and immediate challenges.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is impossible to overstate the fundamental importance to our economic recovery of resolving our banking crisis.  This is the reason the Government, like governments and central banks across the globe, has provided substantial support for the financial sector and broad economy in the current crisis.  In all our actions in the past year our overriding concern has been the best interests of the wider economy.  Credit remains the lifeblood of any economy.  It allows business to source funding for productive developments and foster creativity and innovation in order that we can become a more competitive, export oriented economy.  It allows individuals to access mortgage funding and finance the purchase of consumer goods.  The only way to restore the flow of credit is through a cleaned up banking system.  In the past year the Government&rsquo;s priorities in this sector have been, first, to secure the liquidity of the banking system; second, where necessary, to maintain and rebuild the capital position of our systemically important banks and, third, to address the issue of confidence in the asset quality of the banking system through the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The National Asset Management Agency Bill is the centrepiece of the Government&rsquo;s plan to solve the problems that have beset our financial and credit system.  The decision to establish NAMA was taken following expert advice from at home and abroad.  The asset management approach has a proven track record internationally.  Our proposal has received the backing of the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.  The proposal has credibility in the financial markets, since the cost of borrowing by the State has fallen as bond spreads above the German ten-year benchmark for Irish sovereign debt have halved from almost 3% to just 1.5%.  Last week&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Economist </i>takes the view that &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s toxic-asset <Col N="45"/>plan makes a good fist of a bad situation&rdquo; and compares the plan favourably to American and German initiatives.</P>
        <P>The National Asset Management Agency is not a bailout for those who have operated irresponsibly.  In relation to those who took out development related loans, the agency will treat them as borrowers who continue to owe the full amount of their loan.  The agency has a duty to maximise taxpayer returns and the Government expects it to use the range of powers available to it.  The National Asset Management Agency Bill includes a risk sharing mechanism with the banks that will protect the taxpayer from overpaying for the assets to be transferred to the agency.  In due course, the House will have an opportunity to discuss the NAMA legislation much more fully.  The Government is determined to re-fashion the financial and banking system and address and correct regulatory and governance shortcomings.  The sole purpose is to get our banks back to what they should be doing, namely, underpinning and encouraging much needed sustainable activity.</P>
        <P>The sharp decline in economic activity has led to a chasm of &euro;20 billion opening up in the public finances.  The April supplementary budget projected tax revenues in 2009 between the 2003 and 2004 levels.  Fortunately, Ireland&rsquo;s public finances entered the current economic difficulties from a relatively strong position.  We ran general government surpluses in ten out of 11 years and reduced our general government debt ratio to one of the lowest in the European Union, at approximately 25% of GDP in 2007 or even less if calculated net.  However, continued borrowing on the current scale is simply impossible.</P>
        <P>April&rsquo;s supplementary budget was the latest in a series of measures commencing in July 2008 designed to stabilise and then bring sustainability to the public finances.  These measures which amount to almost 5% of GDP in 2009 are spread between both expenditure and taxation and include the introduction of an average 7.5% pension related pay deduction for public servants.  A pay round due under the social partnership Towards 2016 transitional pay agreement was postponed, estimated in 2010 to achieve up to &euro;1 billion in savings on the pay bill.</P>
        <P>The April supplementary budget set out a multi-annual consolidation plan for the public finances to bring the general government deficit to 3% of GDP by the end of 2013.  This plan has been welcomed by the European Commission but requires difficult decisions.  In addition to adjustments made in 2009, the supplementary budget set out targets for adjustments to taxation and current expenditure in 2010 and 2011.  While the specifics are still being formulated, the overall policy areas for examination have been announced.  As part of this process, the Government established the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes to examine critically every area of Government expenditure to identify potential savings.  The group&rsquo;s report was published in July and will be taken into account by the Government in making future spending decisions.</P>
        <P>The Government also established the Commission on Taxation as an independent group, charged with providing an assessment of how the tax system can be reformed.  The report of the commission, published earlier this month, will contribute to the medium to longer-term framework within which tax policy will be set over the next decade.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has stated that the balance of the corrective action in the 2010 budget will have to come from the expenditure side.  We cannot tax our way out of this recession.  Resolute action will restore confidence to the wider economy and help Ireland towards recovery.</P>
        <P>Next week, the Irish electorate will vote on the referendum on the Lisbon treaty in light of the guarantees obtained to meet previous concerns.  Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political future <Col N="46"/>requires full participation at the heart of Europe.  We cannot allow ourselves to be consigned to the margins, in the shadow of the UK.  We should reaffirm our pro-European policy that underpins our real independence and that has served us well since the 1960s.  We fight our battles from within.  EU membership with access to an integrated market of 500 million people has brought immense economic and political benefits.  A positive vote will be a critical step towards restoring our economic fortunes.  In the recent difficulties in the banking sector, membership of the European Union and of the eurozone in particular has been vital &mdash; the real difference between Iceland and Ireland.  The European Central Bank has been highly supportive of this country.  We need to take this into account when voting on 2 October.</P>
        <P>We also need to identify new opportunities and be ready to take advantage of these when international economic recovery resumes.  The lesson from previous downturns is that while the immediate concern is to address short-term issues, countries also need to reorient their economies towards taking advantage of emerging growth opportunities.  In this regard, the Global Irish Economic Forum, which took place at Farmleigh last weekend, was attended by members of the international Irish family and friends of this country from across the globe.  Distinguished participants from a variety of fields shared their insights on the economic and related challenges confronting us.  A number of innovative, constructive ideas came from the forum and provide the basis for follow-up action.</P>
        <P>The publication last year by the Taoiseach of Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal sets out our agenda of reorientating and reprioritising the business of Government to achieve the goal of building a more competitive economy which will help underpin our future.  The Government is pursuing policies to facilitate the development of a smart, green economy with high productivity across all sectors, both private and public.  The Government remains committed to implementing measures that continue to support the smart economy through investment and incentives to increase research and development expenditure to reach a target of 2.5% of gross national product by 2013.  Ireland has already trebled economy-wide research and development expenditure over the past decade to around &euro;2.5 billion.</P>
        <P>From a medium and longer-term perspective our future pattern of growth will, by necessity, be predicated on a more sustainable, export-led economic model.  This will require continued focus on improving our competitiveness.  Our economy remains flexible and resilient and this will facilitate an adjustment to reflect the prevailing environment.  There is evidence of wage flexibility in both the public and private sectors, a significant achievement, which many countries would wish to emulate.  Adjustments in work practices have taken place and other labour market costs are being addressed to safeguard as much employment as possible.  Our labour force continues to be highly skilled and flexible.  We have made significant investment in education at all levels to ensure we have the skills demanded by our increasingly knowledge intensive economy.</P>
        <P>The Government has introduced a number of measures to support the competitively exposed sectors.  An enterprise stabilisation fund has been established.  This fund has a total budget allocation of &euro;100 million over two years to provide targeted support to indigenous companies to assist them in the current exceptional business environment.  A temporary employment subsidy scheme has also been set up by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This is a &euro;250 million scheme which will protect up to 27,400 vulnerable jobs in the productive sector.  The scheme will provide a subsidy of &euro;9,100 per employee over 15 months to qualifying exporting enterprises.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>We are facing tough challenges and to succeed we must continue to pursue appropriate policies to position the economy to benefit from the global recovery when it eventually emerges.  The Government is acutely aware that businesses, families and almost everyone in our society is affected by the deterioration in economic conditions.  We are attempting to ensure the burden of adjustment is spread evenly and fairly.  The economic, budgetary and banking sector issues we confront as a country are very important to resolve.  They will benefit from the debate and scrutiny they receive here in the Seanad and elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In his reply, perhaps he can indicate where Government policy is going.  The overall economy is seriously distressed but the Government portion of the economy is completely in tatters.  As regards the overall economy, there is an 8% reduction in GNP.  In discussing the economy we should use GNP rather than GDP, much of which is just repatriated profits from multinationals.  The situation facing the Irish workforce is incredibly serious.  We talk about 440,000 or 450,000 people being on the live register at the moment.  In addition, we are talking about an unemployment rate of 11.8%.  In reality, however, 440,000 people represent 20% of the workforce.  So 20% of the workforce is on short-term work to the degree that they need unemployment assistance of some sort.  That 20% must survive on what is roughly the equivalent of the unemployment allowance.  Approximately 100,000 people must live on disability benefits or allowances of some sort, which means that 25% of the workforce is surviving on very little at the moment.  There is little scope for taxing those one in four people in the workforce, which is a serious situation when one reflects on where we were just a few years ago.</P>
        <P>These figures are now showing up in the social welfare budget.  People wonder why the Government has not made many reductions in the &euro;56 billion it spends annually.  The problem arises from the rapidly increasing number of people who are on short-term work or are fully unemployed which is having seriously detrimental effects not just on the Government&rsquo;s finances but also on the lives of those concerned and their families.</P>
        <P>We were told that two reports would form the basis of Government policy for the next couple of years: an bord snip nua and the Commission on Taxation.  We would like to see some uniformity of opinion from Cabinet members on this matter.  Either an bord snip nua and the Commission on Taxation form part of Government policy or they do not.  The Taoiseach does not seem to think the Commission on Taxation is part of Government policy while a number of other Ministers do not seem to think that an bord snip nua is part of Government policy.  These mixed messages have a negative effect.  When the Opposition criticises the Government we are told that it has an effect on what investors think.  Nothing will have a greater effect on investors, however, than watching the Government in total disarray sending out mixed policy messages.  They clearly do not support either report, yet we are told there are two ways out of this problem: more taxes or expenditure savings, which are cutbacks.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said we cannot tax ourselves out of recession, although this may or may not be Government policy.  We are not really supporting tax increases at this moment in time, which means we have to make more cuts.  The scale of the cuts needed to bring our economy back to a manageable level is of the magnitude of somewhere between &euro;5 billion and &euro;6 billion.  That is the sort of figure involved, so I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could outline how that scale of cuts can be implemented.</P>
        <P>We can see from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report the waste of money that occurred over the years and the cavalier attitude to millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money, often at the behest of Ministers.  They clearly did not know what they were doing in their portfolios except <Col N="48"/>that they were happy to waste money.  The Minister for Health and Children announced yesterday that she will make a 10% cut to the health budget, but who will pay for that?  Will it be through reduced pay scales for those working in the health services?  I presume that if it affects people in the health services, it will affect all civil and public servants.  Will it be applied to health service staff or patient services?  The Government will have to stop talking in general terms and address the issues.  A 10% reduction in the health budget is substantial and will seriously affect patients or health workers.  The Government needs to be honest in the messages it sends.</P>
        <P>The social welfare budget is approximately &euro;18 billion.  The cost of unemployment benefit has rocketed from &euro;3.5 billion last year to an estimated &euro;6 billion this year.  The estimated increases in the cost of payments relating to people with a disability, the elderly and families with children who receive a benefit are not major.  However, the social welfare budget is not funded entirely by taxation.  Much of the funding is generated by PRSI which has two functions.  The first is to cover day-to-day costs, while the second is to supplement the social insurance fund, an investment account, when PRSI revenue is in surplus.  Between 2006 and 2008 this investment account contained in excess of &euro;3 billion.  At the end of July only &euro;500 million remained; therefore, the Government had taken &euro;2.5 billion out of the account to fund current spending.  I do not know how many kitties the Government has to raid but it has raided one or two and taken substantial sums.  This is in addition to the funding required for NAMA.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State outline the Government&rsquo;s policy on the social welfare budget?  The Government cannot repeat its raid on the social insurance fund in the past 12 months because that money is gone.  Many businesses, particularly those run by the self-employed, will pay less in taxes at the end of next month because their trade contracted in 2008 and will contract further this year.  Trade for a number of these businesses has contracted so much that Revenue will probably have to make refunds to them because they will probably have overpaid their taxes for 2008.  Since it is the Minister of State&rsquo;s business to understand the figures, he must know how serious is this issue.  He made his contribution in the same way he would have done in 2007 before we were hit with a sledge-hammer because of incompetence at national level and a crisis at international level.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should refer to NAMA because I am frightened by the proposal and was not filled with confidence by the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s comments in recent weeks.  The valuation of loans at &euro;47 billion is made up and not accurate.  Approximately 30% of this money will be used to take on loans relating to land, 36% for those relating to development, while 34% is for commercial loans that are supposed to generate cash flow.  The land will not generate cash unless it is rented to farmers to grow barley.  The developments will not generate much cash because many of the properties are not finished and the residential property market is slow.  That means commercial loans are expected to generate most of the cash flow, yet the Minister did not give a clear indication about how solid the loans were and the potential risk to the businesses involved.  They may well be hit by the economic downturn in the next year or two.  In other words, the income generated by NAMA could reduce significantly, while interest rates have the potential to increase.</P>
        <P>The Government must outline the operating costs of the agency and the cost of interest payments.  The banks, developers and others involved in this sector before the collapse will be paid to manage the loans and the Government needs to be honest with the people about the cost.  The market potentially has not bottomed out yet and prices could drop further.  The State&rsquo;s exposure may not be the &euro;7 billion referred by to the Minister but a substantial portion <Col N="49"/>of the &euro;47 billion.  That would have a huge impact on Exchequer finances in the future, in addition to the refinancing of the banks which the Government will have to undertake and the billions that have to be borrowed to meet current spending.  How will the Minister control these unbelievable costs?  Will the Minister of State be more honest about how the Government will deal with NAMA?  How much is needed to recapitalise the banks?  From where will the money come?  Billions of euro will be necessary.  While many do not understand what this is about now, they will understand the consequences in ten weeks when the budget is announced.  If the Government does not get that right, we will be in the stew by the end of 2010.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the economy continues to contract and nothing gives me confidence that it will improve next year.  The Government is not facing up to the crisis.  If the economy is to pick up, radical surgery will be required, not tinkering around the edges.  Our competitiveness, cost base and so on must be restored, yet the Government has done nothing to address these issues in its recent budgets.  The Minister of State should give an honest appraisal when he responds.  The economic crisis is so bad that the Government parties are damned if they do and damned if they do not.  That is how bad is the situation in which they have landed us.  They might as well be damned for doing the right thing for the country and start making the hard decisions they have been expected to make for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of the State.  It is good that the House is back in session in order that diverse points of views can contribute to debates such as this.  We will have many such debates as the budget preparations take shape in the weeks and months ahead.  It is important that we have differences because otherwise we would be faced with only public administration, of which we have had enough during the years.  I hope, as we all seek to do the best thing by the country, that we can be innovative and positive in our contributions as the House tries to make a contribution to the recovery of the nation.</P>
        <P>We have experienced unprecedented difficulty in the past year.  Given the surpluses that were available, it is difficult to understand where all the money has gone.  One can absolutely understand the public&rsquo;s palpable anger.  I am angry that we are in this situation and, like everybody else, would like my pound of flesh.  I am confident due process will give us the pound of flesh we seek.  In the meantime, it is vital the Minister for Finance, who has provided leadership, and the Government take the appropriate decisions and correct actions to put the nation on the correct course, adjusting the sails to their optimum position in order that we can capitalise on the mild shoots of recovery internationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we look to the past we can see how exports declined in the early to mid-1990s and were replaced by what we have all seen, that is, an unsustainable level of transaction-based taxes fuelled by a property boom.  Circumstances are very much changed.  All of us would have liked to have predicted the changes accurately at the time, but if we go back through the statements in this and the other House throughout that period we can see, as the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, mentioned, we all fought for lower taxation and increased expenditure.</P>
        <P>Other issues include the fact that 2% money was available at rates of 8% growth.  It is probably true to say that all aspects of society and all quarters, to some extent, jumped on the gravy train and we are paying a dear price for that.  I am confident, however, that many of the innovative steps that have been taken so far will prove to be the correct ones.  The Government is completely committed to stabilising and restoring our public finances.  Difficult decisions have had to be taken in that regard already in terms of some &euro;5 billion in proposed cuts.  A <Col N="50"/>further &euro;4 billion will be required later this year and there is no question it will require pain and contribution from all aspects of out society, except, I hope, for one.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is vital we do everything that is necessary to protect the most vulnerable in society and ensure those who are less well off, such as unemployed people who are currently struggling to make ends meet, are looked after at all costs, whatever pain has to be taken by those who are better placed.  There is no question; many toes will be stood on between now and when the budget is revealed in the House in early December.  It is important we ensure the toes that are stood on are the ones that are best placed and best able to take the pain.</P>
        <P>I am confident that through informed debate and contributions in this and the other House the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, will take the appropriate decisions.  It will be difficult.  When one considers the magnitude and level of cuts and the commitment the Government has in stabilising our financial situation, it will be difficult to get a consensus on issues, but I am confident we will.</P>
        <P>Recently published reports &mdash; Senator Twomey mentioned this &mdash; by the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the Commission on Taxation have brought forward a wide variety of suggestions.  An bord snip nua, as it is more commonly referred to, suggested a stark number of very severe cuts, with some of which many of us on all sides of the House would have a difficulty.  Far from a lack of unity in the Cabinet, as Senator Twomey would have us believe, there is absolute unity in focusing on doing what needs to be done.  It was important that an independent grouping, headed by Mr. McCarthy, would come up with a full menu of suggested cuts for the public and Legislature to digest so that the correct decisions could then be made.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach on his first day in office said we should not be obliged or restricted by independent reports.  I wrote it in my diary that day because I felt if anything was going wrong in Sligo or the north west as a result of an independent report, I could remind him of it.  In the context of an bord snip nua I am pleased he said that.  When the T&aacute;naiste and others say there are things we have difficulty with, that did not make common sense and did not appear to be in the public interest, she was absolutely correct and I support her on that.  It does not mean that difficult and unpopular decisions will have to be made.  They will and will have to be made for the good of the many rather than the few.  It is vital we ensure those who are less well off and are most vulnerable in society are protected at all costs.</P>
        <P>In terms of restoring our competitiveness, our economy remains flexible and resilient.  Price level and wages are beginning to fall.  Obviously public sector pay is an issue that may have to be looked at.  I hope if it is, it is done exclusively in partnership with public sector unions because that will have to be the case.  We must take on board that, effectively, a 7.5% levy has meant a reduction in public service pay.  The expenses regime in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in the public service as a whole must be dealt with in a robust fashion because it cannot be so out of tune with the private sector which has effectively corrected itself given the changed economic environment in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>It is vital, as the Minister for Finance said, that we restore the banking sector.  It is my categoric view that whatever price needs to be paid, it is important that developers and bankers take first place in the queue for any hit that will be taken by the risk which NAMA will give us.  I will come back to this point.  At a  fundamental level, the banking system is at the very core of any functioning economy.  We need money and credit to operate &mdash; that is a fact.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the financial crisis has at all times been structured and considered, with it demonstrating in the form of the guarantee scheme its commitment to <Col N="51"/>prevent the failure of any systemically important financial institution.  It secured the liquidity of the banking system by doing that.  Where necessary, the approach will maintain and rebuild their capital position.  We saw what was done in terms of Anglo Irish Bank and the capital provided for the other major banks.  The approach also includes the establishment of NAMA.</P>
        <P>With NAMA we have found the ideal template to get credit flowing to our economy again.  Those who have read the legislation in detail will have highlighted that there is no guarantee within it to say that credit will flow again.  It is important, as the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said that, given that the money involved has a rate of 1.5%, it would be in the banks&rsquo; interests to lend again and put the money they will get from the ECB to work.  I hope further mechanisms can be found to ensure families and viable businesses can seek and acquire the credit they need.</P>
        <P>We should not be flath&uacute;lach about the provision of credit.  It should be underwritten in a robust fashion and not just handed out.  Many of us will recall throughout the boom years of the Western world the advertisements of finance companies on the television which would say all one had to do was call up and one would be sent &euro;20,000 in the post, which was ridiculous.</P>
        <P>It brings me on to another point about the banking sector generally.  As we have seen the slight hints of international recovery, one of my worries is the international financial regulatory regime.  After we have considered our own failings, there is no question that the absence of a proper international financial regulatory regime contributed in a major way to the difficulties we currently have.  I would like to see a basic set of rules agreed at European level if not globally through the UN, IMF or the World Bank &mdash; I do not know the appropriate forum for it &mdash; so the focus is not on, as a banker once put it, new ways to lose money when the old ways were doing just fine.  Another banking matter we need to consider is the kind of independent advice people are seeking.  It is an ideological impossibility to get objective advice from anybody working in an institution with sales targets.  It is simply impossible.  These are some of the things I would like to see dealt with.</P>
        <P>In terms of trying to boost our economy and being innovative about getting ourselves to work, I salute the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, on the forum that was put together last week.  It was a grouping of people I would like to see kept together and expanded upon, and we should consult them continually on their views on certain issues.  It would be positive.  These are people who are leaders in their fields throughout the world and that they are prepared to give of their time to their nation of origin is positive.</P>
        <P>As we prepare the budgetary process over the next few weeks, I hope the views of this House can be taken on board.  Over the summer months I was involved with a group who prepared a set of proposals which I presented to the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, and which involved the prevention of the repossession of family homes.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, can impress upon him the need to look favourably upon the implementation of those.  The proposals stated that we all acknowledge that as the eurozone recovers, interest rates will inevitably rise at a faster pace than the employment levels will recover in this country.  As a result, people will find it very difficult to meet their repayments.  I refer to those who were pushed to the pin of their collar in the past to get mortgages, for example.  I appreciate that all the financial institutions, including those not covered by the Government&rsquo;s guarantee, have signed up to a protocol under the leadership and guidance of the Irish Banking Federation.  I suggest we should legislate against the serving of court orders seeking the repossession of homes in the absence of a clear distinction being drawn between those who cannot pay and those who can pay but refuse to do so.  I refer to what is known as wilful neglect.  We took <Col N="52"/>similar action in the case of private credit when we introduced the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Bill 2009 to prohibit the imprisonment of a person for the non-payment of a debt.  We should offer those who cannot make repayments a variety of potential solutions, such as an increase in the term of the mortgage, all of which borrowers would have to pay for.  That is just one of the suggestions I would like to make in this respect.  I am pleased to have had an opportunity to make a few points on the economy.  I look forward to the many debates we will have on the matter in the months to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I am glad we are having a general debate in advance of our consideration of the important Bill that will establish NAMA.  My tendency is to support NAMA, although I would like certain changes to be made to the legislation.  I certainly believe this can work.  A great deal of the nonsense surrounding it needs to be cleared up.  It is not unreasonable for the Minister for Finance to work on the basis of an expectation that property will rise in value by 10% over the next ten years.  Any ordinary person would go along with that.  It should be explained to some members of the Minister&rsquo;s party that selling bonds in Europe is not like selling cars.  They are like loans in the sense that they have to be repaid at the end of a certain period of time.  I assure the Minister of State that there is a complete misunderstanding of that point among certain people in his party.  I have spoken to some Members of the Lower House who do not seem to understand what bonds are.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention another crucial point that is not fully understood.  I refer to the tier 1 requirements of the banks.  Many people have asked why the banks are not releasing credit.  As Senator MacSharry said, it is not a question of turning it on like a tap.  People believe credit should be made available as long as it is a good or appropriate risk, but that is not happening.  A banking agreement that was reached two or three years ago increased the tier 1 capital requirement to approximately 7% or 7.5%.  Since then, however, the market has determined that the requirement should be closer to 10%.  The banks are putting every bit of profit they can make into their reserves, in effect as part of their effort to build up to the 10% level.  We should be straight and honest with people by telling them that until the banks reach the 10% level, everything we put into them will go into a black hole and will not come out again.  Therefore, Fine Gael is quite correct to make the point that the money we are providing could be simply locked up.  There needs to be an understanding that things might not change until we get over that level.  I would like the Minister of State to respond to that suggestion.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that much of what is going on at the moment is hard to take.  Many of those who are complaining about the decrease in the price of houses were celebrating not that long ago when prices increased by between 10% and 20% over a couple of years.  There is a huge element of hypocrisy out there.  I agree with Fine Gael that we should not forget some of the economic decisions which were taken over the past ten years.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach acknowledge that too.  Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that everybody can make mistakes.  When people in leadership positions admit they are working on that basis, it gives people a sense of confidence.  We have learned other things as well.  We have learned that we were being screwed into the ground left, right and centre.  I refer not only to the price of houses but also to the price of cars and eating out, etc.  When one considers the manner in which prices <Col N="53"/>have dropped over the past year, one has to ask who was driving the high costs of previous years.  We need to examine that aspect of the matter.</P>
        <P>It is important to clarify where NAMA is coming from.  As almost all Senators have said, it is a source of anger among the public.  If one can get people to listen for long enough, one can explain the importance of NAMA to them.  They might agree or disagree with it, but they can accept that it might work even if they conclude that it will not.  However, they cannot accept the one-sided nature of the NAMA proposal which does not contain anything to meet the needs of ordinary people.  As I said on the Order of Business this morning, it is a vicious circle.  I may be at risk of boring my colleagues.  The banks gave huge sums of money to developers and speculators who caused the price of land to increase beyond a reasonable level by bidding more than it was worth.  When they built houses on those lands, they had to drive the prices up to ensure they got their money back.  The same banks that were giving money to the speculators were also giving mortgages to people to buy the houses the speculators had developed.</P>
        <P>Now that the banks have gone bust, we have to support our banking system in some way.  The banks are turning their backs on the people whom they got into this mess in the first place.  The banks are closing in on them, but they cannot be allowed to take their property from them.  It is not as if we have not seen similar problems in the past.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will agree that the same thing happened in the 1970s, when the banks shoved money at farmers to build milking parlours.  They offered other moneys in similar circumstances in the intervening period.  It is irresponsible, unjust and inequitable that working people who did everything right &mdash; they saved, skimped and put everything together to get themselves a home &mdash; now find themselves in negative equity.  I am not too pushed about negative equity for its own sake but I am pushed about people who are not able to meet their repayments.</P>
        <P>I spoke this morning to a man in the Swords area who has been in the taxi business for approximately 30 years.  He said he does not owe anyone anything because he has always repaid his loans.  He was off the road recently because he had to go into hospital for a short period of time.  When he went into his building society to ask for a two-month holiday from his repayments, he could not believe how well he was treated.  The officials in the building society agreed to give him two months of respite, which made a huge difference because his wife had lost her job a couple of months earlier.  He then contacted his bank to discuss the repayments on his car, which is the basis of his business.  He explained that he had to go to hospital for a couple of weeks and would be recuperating for a further couple of weeks.  When he asked the officials in the bank for a break of one month from his repayments, they said that under no circumstances would they agree to it.  It is absolutely appalling.  He told me he has done business with the bank in question &mdash; National Irish Bank &mdash; for 30 years without ever owing a penny more than he should.  He has repaid every loan, generally ahead of time.  While I do not blame the Minister of State for such problems, there is on onus on politicians and leaders to do something about it.  I want the Government to state that this should not be allowed to happen.</P>
        <P>The Government should support what the President of France, Mr. Sarkozy, has said about bonuses that are earned in a certain way.  He has said he will walk out of the G20 summit if international agreement is not reached on huge salaries and bonuses.  Bankers&rsquo; rewards have to be dealt with internationally.  It cannot be done in any one country.  I would like our Government to come out in favour of that.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing his time with me.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will be pleased that I do not intend to talk about the past.  I will not comment on who was at fault or where mistakes were made because there has been too <Col N="54"/>much of that.  I will speak about the future.  We have a truly serious crisis.  According to a recent newspaper article, the State is spending &euro;20 billion a year over our income.  That is just huge money that I can see.  The article continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland is overspending its income, and having to borrow at a rate of &euro;17 million an hour.  This public deficit crisis is more serious than the &euro;30 billion worst case scenario for Nama; the deficit will run up &euro;30 billion of new debt in 18 months and continue to add debt thereafter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As my former colleague, Mr. Vincent O&rsquo;Doherty, wrote in the article in question:</P>
        <P LI="1">In many respects, we are living an Alice-in-Wonderland existence.  We are like a household that takes out an additional mortgage every week from an indulgent lender to meet its excess spending.  We continue to live in an artificial comfort zone in which we can ignore reality.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The situation is not understood by the nation as a whole.  The Government has to spell out what the problem is and how serious it is.  Mr. O&rsquo;Doherty continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">The situation in which we find ourselves is extremely serious, but it is not complicated.  Volumes may be written about the complex story of how we got where we are [I will not talk about that] but the solution to how we get out of it is, in principle, quite simple.  The state must cut its expenses and raise its income through taxes to eliminate &euro;20 billion of unsustainable over-spending.  A country living so far beyond its means cannot expect renewed growth in the economy and the new investments essential to a fresh start, until it puts its own house in order.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The most recent Department of Finance monthly bulletin sets out the Government&rsquo;s planned reduction in spending over the next five years and estimates, based on IMF calculations, that debt will amount to 80% of gross domestic product by the end of 2013 if we continue what we are doing.  Given that the Government proposes to spread the corrective measures over a further four years, the debt is even higher than necessary.  The figure of 80% of GDP, or more if the banks need further funding, is comparable to the depressed conditions of the late 1980s when debt reached 100% of GDP.  I do not think individual citizens quite understand all these millions and billions but an 80% proportion of debt suggests that 20% of tax revenue will be expended on interest payments rather than health, education or social welfare.  Most of this money will go abroad because we are largely supported by foreign lenders.</P>
        <P>This is effectively a permanent reduction in the nation&rsquo;s income which we will all experience through increased taxes and reduced living standards.  People will say it is not fair but I recall the times when, as an employer, I had to tell a store it had problems.  It was not fair but that is the way we were.  I have had to decide to impose cuts on my businesses to survive.  I was usually able to convince people because they saw the figures.  We have to explain the situation to our public.  In 1982 I had to close a shop because it could not survive.  That hurtful experience is etched in my memory.</P>
        <P>We have to return to the standard of living we enjoyed in 2002.  If we are willing to accept the social welfare and standards of living we had seven years ago, we will be able to get on top of this crisis.</P>
        <P>Will Ireland&rsquo;s populist policies continue with decisions delayed and watered down under pressure from interest groups until the slow progress, the surge in debt and interest and the waning of investor confidence bring in the IMF?  I remind Senators of the story of Churchill during the Second World War.  He is not someone who is regarded as a great hero in Ireland <Col N="55"/>but he spoke about blood, sweat and toil.  We have to take hard decisions now because we are responsible to the next generation.  Let us act sooner rather than later and convince the public it is the correct thing to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four cornerstones to the Government&rsquo;s strategy for recovery, the first of which is closing the gap in our public finances.  Our deficit, which currently stands at &euro;20 billion, is being met through borrowing.  Prior to the downturn, we enjoyed significant surpluses of &euro;22 billion during the years 2005 to 2007.  It makes sense for the Government to ease cuts and taxes into the economy in recognition that the world economy will pick up and that, for our size, we are a major trading and exporting country.  Even this year, in what might be called the eye of the storm, exports have increased on last year&rsquo;s figures.</P>
        <P>Further to what previous speakers have said about Ireland as a flexible economy, we are in a good position for the future because we were well placed to meet the current crisis.  People predicted a slowdown or a soft landing in property prices but nobody can claim they foresaw that the world economy and the financial system would totter at the precipice last year.  The most important reasons for this crisis were the instantaneous availability of credit to people who were not in a position to make repayments and a total lack of regulation in the international sector.  These factors nearly brought down the financial system, which in turn would have destroyed economies.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has no brief for the banking sector; our brief is for the economy.  The way to keep the economy vibrant is to ensure a proper banking sector.  We have succeeded in this task.  We ensured Ireland&rsquo;s banking sector continued through the eye of the storm by means of a Government guarantee.  How much money might have left this State or how many banks might have failed in the absence of this guarantee is unknown.  Had one of the major banks failed, we would be facing a depression scenario in which one third of people were unemployed.  Sadly, we were not supported by everybody, especially in regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  One Opposition spokesperson even said we were bailing out our developer friends.  Nothing could have been further from the truth because we hold no brief other than to do what is right for the country.  It is not as if all the political wisdom held by Fianna F&aacute;il went out the window and we decided instead to look after the better-off while forgetting about everyone else.  That never happened but, unfortunately, such are the claims made against us.</P>
        <P>One of the main reasons the international banking sector almost collapsed was greed and a &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; attitude toward finances.  The bonus system played a major part in this.  Had the managing director of Lehman Brothers received a bonus of $1 billion in 2007 rather than $500 million, I do not doubt we would now be looking at a 1929 style depression.  It is incumbent on us to add our voice to the G20 and at the EU and UN to ensure this never happens again.</P>
        <P>Our other remit is to protect jobs and restore competitiveness.  There is no doubt that competitiveness is returning in the private sector by virtue of necessity.  We had priced ourselves out of manufacturing and the property bubble did nothing to help.  We would have been in a worse situation had that continued but we appear to be regaining our competitiveness.  No job is safe if it is not competitive.</P>
        <P>As people have seen the danger of bank failures and a recession, they are not spending.  The only way we will get people to spend is by assuring them we will continue to introduce policies that ensure the stability of the Irish economy.  At present, large sums of money are deposited in Ireland banks which would normally be circulating through the economy.  In other words, people are saving or paying down debts and this money is not available for the type of ordinary <Col N="56"/>spending which contributes to tax revenue.  However, people will start to spend again because they will see the commitment of the Government to putting our economy on a solid footing.</P>
        <P>The last point I wish to support &mdash; there are other points I wish to make for which, unfortunately, I do not have time &mdash; is the question of the repossession of houses.  One of the most difficult things to hear is that this has happened to a family.  It has a special resonance for the Irish people, in particular, when we think about the evictions during the days of the struggle with landlords.  In particular, I am aware with 17 years with a building society, First Active, that there must be a change in legislation, not only to protect the home owner but to protect the lender.  My suggestion is that the Government would look seriously at allowing the lender, which heretofore had no recourse other than the courts, to take an equity interest in the property if the money has not been paid back willfully by the borrower, in other words, that we would allow the bank or building society to take an equity interest on an ongoing basis and any income surplus to requirements by the person who is not willfully paying could be sequestered and garnered from his or her income.  In that way we would ensure there would not be repossessions, which are so unnecessary, in the marketplace.</P>

	<P>Seven minutes and five minutes, respectively.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister.  It is a long time since we were last here and as the motion is wide-ranging, I will limit my comments to the general economy.  I do not intend to speak on banking policy other than to state that my party does not think NAMA is the most efficient way of sorting out the current crisis.  I also do not intend to speak about the Lisbon treaty referendum other than to state that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would send a clear message to international investors that Ireland is open for business and is at the heart of Europe, and as a result, it will be a positive development if we vote for the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to make general comments about economic policy and Ireland&rsquo;s current state.  The squandering of the boom by the current Fianna F&aacute;il Government has led to a significant loss of confidence in its ability to manage effectively its way out of the current crisis.  I refer to instances such as the PPARS fiasco, the amount of money spent on voting machines and general wastage.  We heard only yesterday that the Minister is still spending &euro;120,000 on the security of a field in north county Dublin.  Thornton Hall, which no longer will be a prison, is just a field.  We really need to concentrate on tackling waste.  The people have little confidence in the ability of their Government to tackle the current economic crisis and to work back from the brink.</P>
        <P>There has been little economic analysis in the Government&rsquo;s approach so far.  It appears it is just an approach of cut, cut, cut, and of slash and burn, but this is not always the best option.  We all are aware the country&rsquo;s finances are teetering on the brink and extremely precarious.  Where there is wastage we need to cut it, where there are excess levels of expenditure we need to cut them and where there are inefficiencies we need to do likewise.  Earlier Senator Twomey mentioned inefficiencies in the health services.  We heard today that Irish general practitioners are getting five times the rate of payment for the flu vaccine that the Labour Government in the UK is giving its general practitioners.</P>
        <P>We need to tackle inefficiencies and waste in all areas of public expenditure.  When we are doing this, however, we need to ensure we do not blame the poor for the greed of the rich, <Col N="57"/>that we do not price people out of the education system, that we do not restrict medical care for those who cannot afford private health care and that we do not cut off our nose to spite our face.</P>
        <P>We need to invest in areas that offer a clear return on investment &mdash; schools, green energy schemes, projects such as public infrastructure &mdash; and we need to invest in areas where we have a unique selling point.  I will highlight two potential areas where Ireland has performed well historically, namely, in attracting people to our shores both in tourism and in new industry.  However, we need to have the necessary infrastructure to attract tourists.  I was appalled that over the summer the Government cut back in areas of tourism investment.  In my area of Meath, the Kells heritage centre is under threat.  What kind of a message is that to potential tourists when the Government is closing heritage centres because of a lack of funding?  We need to ensure that in areas of tourism we retain sufficient funds to operate the system.  I would also ask the Government to look again at the airline tax which is discouraging people from coming to the country.  Other countries, most recently the Dutch Government, have reviewed their attitude toward the airline tax and recognised that it is better to remove it.</P>
        <P>The other area where historically we have been very good is in attracting jobs to the country.  Some have asked whether our wages are competitive.  I ask whether Government regulation in the area of jobs is competitive with that of other countries.  For instance, do we offer sufficient research and development credits to companies which set up here?  Should we review our capital gains tax exemptions and see how they compare to those of other countries?  Do requirements such as withholding tax provisions and frequency of VAT payments make it more difficult for businesses to operate in this country?  We need to review issues such as these to ensure Ireland is an attractive and easy place from which to operate a business.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk about the issue of public debt.  Lord Thomas Macaulay, the 19th century British historian, once stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">At every stage in the growth of the debt it has been seriously asserted by wise men that bankruptcy and ruin were at hand.  Yet still the debt went on growing, and still bankruptcy and ruin were as remote as ever.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He was speaking of public debt in the UK in the 19th century but he could have been speaking about the public debt in Ireland today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to take a step back when it comes to the issue of the public debt ratio.  I am sure no country, perhaps apart from China, is running a government surplus at present.  We are running a debt of less than 50% of GDP.  This will rise to approximately 70% by the end of the year, according to experts.  At worst, NAMA will probably raise that to 130% or 140% of GDP, and it will probably rise again the following year and the year after that.  Let us put that in context.  The IMF stated in June that the debt of Japan, for example, is set to rise from its current level of 220% of GDP.  In Italy, the ratio is currently well over 100%, and it is due to rise further.  By 2014, the IMF stated, the debt of all the advanced G20 countries will be over 100% of GDP.  Therefore, we need to put the matter in perspective.  Senator Quinn worries about the IMF coming to Ireland&rsquo;s door; its officials might be busier in Rome or Tokyo before they make it to Dublin.</P>
        <P>We need to consider carefully the issue of Government debt.  The debt of the US is currently at 100% of GDP and some eminent commentators, such as Robert Reich who won the V&aacute;clav Havel Prize for Economics and was a United States Secretary of State for Labor under former US President Bill Clinton, pointed out that although the debt is high in the US, it is not as <Col N="58"/>high as it reached in 1945, but yet ten short years later that debt was virtually wiped out by growth in the economy, not because of government cuts.  That is what the UK and the US have always done.  They have grown the economy as opposed to cutting expenditure.  We need to learn that lesson.</P>
        <P>Now is the time to set the seeds for economic growth.  We can do that by investing in the green area through creating new jobs in wind or wave power.  We need to invest in proper schools for our children to study in, update our public transport network and road networks and tackle the appalling crisis in the water systems.</P>
        <P>There is a herd mentality on this in Government that cuts are the only way out.  This is largely unquestioned by the media.  We need to be extremely clear that it is not merely a matter of cuts across the board.  We need to be looking at better efficiency and cutting waste, but at the same time we must ensure we invest in key areas which can generate jobs and get us out of this economic mess.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Hannigan as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.

Finland experienced an exceptionally deep recession in the first half of the 1990s.  Within four years output was reduced by more than 10% and the unemployment rate quadrupled to almost 17%.  The collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union in 1991 and also a sharp downturn in the West combined with a domestic banking crisis led to a collapse in consumption and investment spending.  The Finnish Government was forced to take drastic measures to improve its competitiveness and to consolidate public finances at the same time as costly measures were needed to revive the banking sector &mdash; we can see the comparison.  Public expenditure was cut almost across the board and some taxes were raised.  The only exception was that research and development spending was increased rather than cut.  In its analysis the OECD pointed out that the counter-cyclical support of Tekes, the Finnish funding agency for technology and innovation, proved very important in reducing the depth and length of the downturn in business research and development which in turn helped to lay the ground for a strong rebound.  The Finnish Government decision to complement macroeconomic stabilisation measures with sustained investment in infrastructure, education and incentives for structural change helped to put the Finnish economy on a stronger more knowledge-intensive growth path following the crisis.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the Government here must make steep cuts in public expenditure in the months and years ahead.  However, today we must make a plea for education.  We must be careful that in cutting into the fat from public expenditure we do not cut deep into those muscles that we will need to rebuild our economy.  Education is not a cost for Government it is an investment.  The courageous decision by the then Minister for Education, Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, to provide free secondary school education was one of the fundamental building blocks of the Celtic tiger as we all know.  In that regard I was very struck by what the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, had to say yesterday at the mass to mark the opening of the school year on the subject of education.  He acknowledged that our expenditure on education was below that which would be desirable.  However, he said:</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P LI="1">At the same time we have to recognise that education is different.  Education is not just part of the problem of our expenditure but education is an irreplaceable part of the answer.  It is people with their creativity and talent who are and will be the backbone of economic recovery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He also said we needed to ensure that young people were not &ldquo;held hostage to purely economic decisions in such a way as to create long-term damage for them...  We owe our children the best even in leaner times.&rdquo;  Those were very wise words.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we are to build this smart economy we will need a cohort of smart and well trained researchers to act as pathfinders for our new economy.  We must invest in fourth level education and PhDs if we are to aspire to be centres of research.  However, we must continue to invest in primary and secondary education.  It is a sobering thought that it costs more to keep a person in jail for a year than it does to educate a person up to graduate level.

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Just as Zhou Enlai said when speaking of the French Revolution, it is a bit too soon to tell about the international crisis and our own particular variant of it.  However, there are some hopeful signs.  We do not know yet whether the international crisis will be a V-type recession or a W-type recession.  We have seen encouraging signs that France and Germany, two of our main trading partners, are coming out of recession.  As both are eurozone countries, it gives us some hope and confidence.  We have also had a relatively positive report today from the Irish Exporters Association showing that Ireland is one of the few countries in the developed world that has an increasing amount of exports with a 5% increase in the past year alone.  Having listened to the previous speaker refer to Finland, it is interesting to note that the decrease in Finland in the last recorded year was 40%.</P>
        <P>While there are reasons to feel hopeful for the future, we have less control over other factors, which will have a serious impact on the social as well as the economic outlook for the country.  Chief among those is unemployment, which is far too high and unfortunately will grow higher until it comes back under control.  To restore an economy we need appropriate amounts of hope and confidence.  Recession breeds the opposite; it breeds fear and uncertainty.  The challenge for the political system and not just for Government is to build on what is good and what we can go forward with and build upon further.  This week&rsquo;s global economic forum touched upon some of those themes.  While we often take an industrial approach to the economy, what the country has going for it as a tradable commodity in which we can take a great deal of pride and from which we can get an economic value are issues like our cultural identity and how that translates into the wider world.  That could be manifest in how we structure our tourism industry.</P>
        <P>There are continuing imbalances in our economy.  Our export-led growth comes largely from foreign direct investment companies.  We lack an indigenous economic sector.  We really need to develop that in the future.  One of the main gains from the Celtic tiger era was the sense of self-confidence that never existed at any other time in our economic history.  If we are to recover we need to tap into that again.  We cannot allow it to be dispirited and disappear from the fragile place from which it seems to have come.  If we believe in ourselves as a people we can achieve.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has referred to other parallel events in his opening statement.  Getting the financial engine of the economy is key to that.  There are ongoing debates among Govern<Col N="60"/>ment and Opposition parties as to whether the right approach has been taken.  As someone who has been involved in the ongoing internal debates on this matter, I believe the Government is taking the right approach.  NAMA is still a developing animal.  From the original publication of the draft Bill as a consultative document earlier in the summer to the figures the Minister released on an indicative basis to the stock market&rsquo;s reaction to that in the subsequent rise in the value of bank shares, I believe continuing balancing needs to be done.  While NAMA exists to make our financial services viable, it does not exist to profit the owners of the banks and those who work with the banks at the expense of the taxpayer.  We need to complete that balancing.  I encourage Members in this House from all parties to consider that exercise from that point of view.  Even if we were so minded, I do not believe there are models we could put in place now that would achieve that.</P>
        <P>Living in a deflationary cycle in our economy at this stage brings about the demands over where we stand in terms of public expenditure.  This is open to misinterpretation.  The Government&rsquo;s approach puts public expenditure cuts in a secondary place.  The main instrument in dealing with our budgetary situation continues to be borrowing, which will amount to &euro;20 billion this year alone.  The plan for the period up to 2013 will require additional borrowing each year until we can try to get down to 3% over and above our annual budget to meet the criteria for membership of the euro.  That will still be quite difficult.  We are borrowing &euro;20 billion now with possibly &euro;16 billion next year and &euro;12 billion the following year.  In a sense we are lucky that our debt has become so low as a proportion of GDP.  Even after this year the &euro;20 billion we are borrowing and the money we will be putting forward towards NAMA will only put us at the average debt level of all European countries.  Having had the lowest debt, we have come up to the average.  Even at the end of this year, our nearest neighbour will have a higher level of debt than us.  Although we are talking ourselves down, we must remember our economic standing and statistics are still quite favourable in international comparisons.  If we use that as a platform, we can overcome our current problems.  The challenge for the political system and, I accept, the Government is to make sure that platform can be reached in the quickest possible time, that it is done in the fairest possible way and that the benefits of the economic strength we achieve through improving our economic indicators are shared among all our citizens.  There will be plenty of debates and initiatives.  However, despite the catcalling and finger-pointing, my party is part of a Government which is trying to achieve this and, despite the circumstances, achieving it to the greatest extent possible.  I am confident, given the timeframe we have set ourselves and the policies being pursued, that we can come through.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State for this important debate.  I listened with interest to the previous contributors.  It is essential for the country and the people that we maintain hope and optimism.  However, we need to pass on that hope because people are confused, angry and hurt and need direction.  That is what they are crying out for.  We have just experienced the greatest deterioration in the history of the public finances over a very short period.  It would be remiss of those of us in government and opposition not to consider how we have arrived at this point.  We must consider the background and context and learn from our mistakes if we are to have any chance of recovery without experiencing further problems.</P>
        <P>From the mid-1990s the economy was growing well.  Export business was up, employment levels were rising and we were still competitive in the manufacturing sector.  Agriculture was also doing well.  These were sound foundations for strong economic growth.  Unfortunately, however, as we entered the early 2000s, Government policy seemed to focus too much on <Col N="61"/>property development.  It is obvious that this was the case.  There were tax incentives for developers and everything was being forced into the construction sector.  The majority of the large rise in employment was in the construction sector.  It was welcomed to a large degree, but it was unsustainable.  We were building more than 90,000 houses per annum at one stage.  Meanwhile, we were beginning to neglect manufacturing, especially with regard to competitiveness.  We also neglected agriculture to an extent and can still see how that sector is suffering.</P>
        <P>I do not like to see the Government in denial and not accepting any responsibility for the current economic mess.  I remind it that it was quick to claim credit when the economy was doing well.  Now it needs to show responsibility.  If it showed such responsibility and honesty to the people at this time, it would gain more credibility and at least we could draw a line under it and move on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unemployment is rising rapidly.  In 2001 it stood at 4%, which was to be commended.  However, much of this was due to the strong construction sector.  We are now at a figure of 12.5%, which is predicted to increase to 15% or more.  There are major challenges.  People are hurt and angry and looking for leadership.  In particular, the 25 to 40 years generation are seriously exposed to financial pressure.  They are the ones who have large mortgages and are in negative equity.  They are the ones in the family formation age group; they have young children but are losing their jobs.  They make up middle Ireland &mdash; the ordinary people on whom we are hoping to rebuild the economy &mdash; and are crying out for help.</P>
        <P>I can name multitudes of companies which are going to the wall, including marquee names such as Waterford Crystal, Bausch and Lomb, Honeywell and Teva Pharmaceuticals, which announced more than 350 job losses only two weeks ago.  These are not low-end manufacturing jobs.  Teva was one of the industries I hoped would see us through the recession.  Highly qualified people working in the pharmaceutical industry are being laid off.  There are serious concerns in this area.  We must not forget the spin-off industries which serve the areas in which these companies were located.  The reason for these closures, we are being told by the people running these companies, is our loss of competitiveness.  The costs of energy, labour, overheads and services are too high.  That is all stacked up in the recent Forf&aacute;s report, Costs of Doing Business in Ireland, 2009, which repeats what the business leaders are saying.</P>
        <P>We need to ask ourselves why this happened.  Yes, international factors played a role; so too did the banking crisis.  However, the failed policies of the Government were also important.  I recall, as do many others, a former Taoiseach saying to those who questioned the economic policies of that Government that they should go and commit suicide.  I hate to repeat it, but it is a fact.  He was applauded at the ICTU national congress.  Now we know the reality: when people were questioning things, they were right.  I know hindsight is great, but we should take cognisance of what some people, who are academics or otherwise, are saying.  If the Government will not listen to the Opposition, it should listen to the academics.  The economy was overheated and we were uncompetitive.</P>
        <P>The social partnership model brought benefits to Ireland from its inception in 1987 under the Programme for National Recovery.  It is now time for new negotiations and a new programme for national recovery.  I am trying to be positive when I say we need to be up-front and honest with the people.  We need to engage with the trade unions and workers and business and clearly spell out the difficulties and challenges facing us.  Let us put everything on the table and try to work our way out of this.  The Government needs to show us a plan for recovery and a roadmap out of this economic crisis.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P>We are getting conflicting messages from the Government, which is causing confusion.  We have the report of the Commission on Taxation and the an bord snip nua report.  One will be proposing ways of raising taxes, while the other will propose cuts.  The Taoiseach says one thing and the T&aacute;naiste says the opposite; other Ministers are saying different things.  This is not the way to govern a country through an economic crisis.  We need to see strong leadership in government.  That is what the people expect.</P>
        <P>I compliment those who were involved in organising the think-tank in Farmleigh last weekend, to which the Diaspora came with new ideas and means of investment.  Similar events should be organised at local and regional level with the universities and institutes of technology.  Let us get the academics and business leaders, as well as workers, trade unions and community representatives, sitting around the table with State agencies to identify our problems and promote solutions.  This may be possible through the county and city development boards, although they are too formal in their structure.  They could be developed into a more informal structure to bring good ideas from the grassroots up and involve the various pillars in society.  That would be a positive way of engaging with the people again.</P>
        <P>We need to give the people hope.  I was speaking with business people last week and they said they were really struggling but that if they could see hope, they would work that bit harder.  That is what we need to give them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the economy because much has happened over the summer, both good and bad.  Some of the signs are a little better.  However, I will talk first about NAMA which is a necessary evil in that we needed some mechanism to provide liquidity in the banks.  It was a case of having to call a price at a certain time in order to lance a boil, in a sense.  Because the key to a sustainable economy is a good banking system, it had to be done.  The solution arrived at by the Government is commendable.  If the Government misses its projections by 10% up or down on the figures it calculated, and it may have over-valued the assets by 10%, even if that transpired to be the case in five or ten years, it was a risk worth taking by the Government for the nation.  What we have had up to now has been utter and total stagnation.  The economy cannot sustain that.  We had to come to a point where a price was called and we moved on.  Hopefully, transactions and business will be conducted again.  What is proposed is a necessary evil that had to happen given the circumstances in which we found ourselves.  I hope we will have a constructive debate as the legislation goes through the D&aacute;il and comes to this House and that Members recognise that this is the solution we have because the Government is proceeding with it.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of whether one cares about the economy, what the international markets think of the solutions the Government comes up with is vital for this country.  I found it lamentable to listen to the Leader of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il last week deplore the fact that bank shares went up the day following the introduction of the legislation.  This is a man who wants to present himself as an alternative Taoiseach and he deplored the fact that bank share prices increased.  I found his reaction confused and disgraceful.  If banks shares had gone down, there would have been a run on the banks and we can imagine what would have happened.  Is that what would have made him happy?  People need to be careful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It was demonstrated extremely carefully in his approach how the putative next Taoiseach reacted to that position.  We can imagine what signal that sent to the markets abroad.  A man in his position needs to be extremely careful how he reacts here.  Confidence is a fragile flower and confidence is what we need.  Everyone is talking about the beneficial impact of the conference in Farmleigh last week.  It was a simple gesture, it did not cost anything but it generated good ideas and was about restoring confidence.  The nation was pleased that new ideas and initiatives were put forward.  We benefited from that.  It is more of that we need, rather than the blame game as to how we got here.  The point is we got here.</P>
        <P>We need solutions to move on to the next considerations.  The next important step is the Lisbon treaty and then the budget, the critical measure for Government of its commitment to keeping balanced finances.  We will all have to be honest and open about how that will be done.  It will be an interesting time.  Hopefully, in the lead-in time to the budget, as the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance prepare the finances, we will have a reasoned debate.  I listened with interest to what previous speakers said about the solutions they would put forward in allowing the debt ratio to rise by so much.  Regardless of what happens, we must contain public expenditure and whatever that means.  I am glad the Minister indicated he is not keen to increase taxes on labour as that would be counterproductive.  That is an important message to send out.</P>
        <P>There is only one other element to consider, namely that of public expenditure and how cuts or greater efficiencies in it can be achieved.  A report in today&rsquo;s newspapers demonstrates how we lost the run of ourselves when we had too much money.  Everyone of us in all walks of life needs to examine how we can change the practices which might release finances.  I refer specifically to a report that revealed that GPs in Ireland will get four times the amount GPs in the UK will get for administering the flu vaccine.  That payment level is not sustainable.  Frontline services will not be affected if we bring those kinds of prices back into line.  That example illustrates only one area where we could contain expenditure without diminishing the quality of services.  We need to encourage medical and other professions throughout the country that are receiving public moneys to examine how the same service can be delivered for less money.</P>
        <P>A critical issue is what we can do to help the unemployed.  Senator Coffey misquoted the figure of 12% in terms of unemployment, as the number unemployed has not yet reached that percentage, but unemployment is a worry for every family.  We need to focus on the unemployed.  That is the reason I regret the arguments made by some of the public sector unions when the Minister and the Taoiseach indicated we must examine the issue of public pay.  We must show solidarity with the people who no longer have a job.  That must be our priority.  We must look after those people, not lose sight of the community and show solidarity to ensure we all come through this difficult period.  We must not just look after our own interests but the interests of the community at large.</P>

It is <Col N="64"/>important, therefore, that this issue is debated in the Seanad.  I hope those in a position to bring about policy change are listening to what others are saying.  Sometimes it is a case of reading the Official Report because much of what is being said was said previously but has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
        <P>I want to make a number of points because every time the Government talks about the economy it mentions the Lisbon treaty, which Senator O&rsquo;Malley mentioned earlier.  I raised the issue on the Order of Business because some Senators have spoken about Sinn F&eacute;in peddling untruths and they mentioned our party&rsquo;s posters.  The reality is that our posters are the only posters which cite the articles in the Lisbon treaty that refer to the issue, whether it is crushing family farms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the World Trade Organisation talks or lower wages.  All those issues are dealt with in the articles referred to on the posters but I refer to one of the myths peddled in the previous debate.  I call it a myth because I knew it to be a lie on the basis of France&rsquo;s experience.  It is that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon treaty would result in foreign direct investment being withdrawn from Ireland.  The IDA has come out and said that in 2008 foreign direct investment increased by 14%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>We should stop saying that foreign direct investment would be wiped out if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It did not happen in France when it rejected the EU constitution.  Foreign direct investment increased to a level of 10%.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has said that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would be tantamount to a signal of withdrawal from the European Union.  That is a lie.  It is untrue and it is scaremongering.  I am not the only person saying that.  An editorial in an influential newspaper, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, on 16 September, stated that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was &ldquo;peddling phantom terrors to scare the Irish people into voting Yes&rdquo;.  It further stated that the chief strategy of the Government is preying on fears.  That is what <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> stated about this Government&rsquo;s attitude to the Lisbon treaty and to it trying to link it to the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an indication of what is being said in that influential newspaper.  Let us be clear and have a proper debate on the issues.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred to NAMA as a necessary evil.  I agree with her that NAMA is absolutely evil.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a rare occasion that Senator O&rsquo;Malley and I can agree, even on half a statement.  I agree with her that NAMA is evil.  The fact that ordinary people, including young children, are paying up to &euro;54 billion to bail out the banks is unbelievable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is Senator Doherty calling it a bailout of the banks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier on a Government party Senator referred to an experience in most banks in this country that was especially acute in Donegal.  I have raised this issue before.  Many people in Donegal held what were known as bogus non-resident accounts, in <Col N="65"/>particular people in my own parish who cut turf for a living, sold the turf to the turf burning station and who, when the turf burning station closed, were made redundant.  Many of these people were elderly and did not have much education having left school at primary level.  They went to their bank manager, were given an address and told what to do with their money.  Years later this turned out to be illegal; it was tax evasion.  The Government came after those people not alone in respect of the money they had offshore but with serious financial penalties.  The pressure resulted in some of them &mdash; we heard the stories at the time &mdash; taking their own lives.  Others had to sell their homes and so on.  The pressure by Government on those individuals who were directed by bank officials to do what they believed was right was unbelievable.  Today, those people who cut turf in Donegal and other people who believed that what the banks were telling them to do was legal are bailing out those banks to the tune of &euro;54 billion.  It is absolutely evil that the Government is putting the country in this position.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, called last week in the D&aacute;il for an apology from the Taoiseach in regard to the untruths he is telling when he says time and again that nobody shouted about the warning signals.  Sinn F&eacute;in shouted time and again about the warning signals, which is evident from the Official Report and in parliamentary questions.  We told the Government that the property boom was overheating and that the bubble was going to burst.  We are the only party, who in the 2007 election, only two years ago, said the Government should not reduce taxes because the bubble was going to burst and the country needed money.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised to reduce taxes and did not give a damn about the reality, namely, that the property bubble was about to burst and there was too much dependence on fair weather taxes.  It was election time, however, and parties say whatever they want during election time.  The reality is that this Government did know about the warning signs.  Not alone did Sinn F&eacute;in identify the problem to the Government but so also did other economists.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach should apologise because he screwed the economy and he is screwing the working people and future generations with this NAMA evil.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no accountability in our system.  We heard earlier Senator Ross speak about the board of F&Aacute;S.  The Minister held on to a report on F&Aacute;S for 90 days before publishing it, an issue on which I made a statement.  The board of F&Aacute;S remains in place.  Many of the people who advised ordinary people in Donegal and other places to put money offshore remain in position in the banks.  Some of them are in influential positions in politics but all is forgiven.  The reality is that there is no accountability in our system and there needs to be a proper sense of accountability.</P>
        <P>The event which took place in Farmleigh is to be welcomed.  It is important to hear other people&rsquo;s opinion.  We proposed to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There has been much talk about a 12% unemployment rate.  We had that years ago.  During the boom time, the Celtic tiger era, unemployment in Donegal stood at 18%.  When we called for the setting up of a forum like Farmleigh, nothing happened.  There is no strategy.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will outline how many tax exiles were at the Farmleigh event.  Some of the people who were there, the greatest brains in Irish society, do not pay a penny in tax in this country.</P>

The Government has wrecked our economy and if it gets away with implementing NAMA, it will be the worst evil perpetrated on the people since the foundation of the State.</P>

        <P>We are bailing out the banks to the tune of &euro;54 billion to restore confidence in the banking sector.  This no doubt will be good for the banks &mdash; I acknowledge we need a functioning banking system, but there is no guarantee it will be good for the economy or jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the reality for people in trouble?  I received an e-mail which I am sure everyone received today.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Myself and my partner have been out of employment for over one year and have been struggling with our mortgage payments since the mortgage relief has been stopped.  Can anybody please explain why Fianna F&aacute;il are doing nothing to protect homeowners in arrears in the NAMA proposal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no such guarantees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We had to return twice to Europe to get legal guarantees in regard to the Lisbon treaty.  If, as we are being told, NAMA is the only game in town, why do we not have legal guarantees built into it?  I am not convinced about NAMA.  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell me what is in it for the people.  I am concerned for the people.  I, too, am experiencing problems; this is my reality too.  People entered into loans in good faith based on their ability to pay.  Many people, including everyone in this House, has taken wage cuts by way of levies and so on which makes it difficult for them to pay their loans and mortgages.  In <Col N="67"/>this regard, one has only to look at the facts on personal indebtedness.  Middle income families are in serious and deepening debt.  There has been a 110% increase in the past year in those with overdrafts who are seeking debt counselling.  The boom sparked the credit frenzy.  In 1995, the ratio of household debt to income was 48%.  The figure for the debt mountain is 176% of the income of all households, largely because of mortgages.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are bailing out the banks.  Who is going to bail out citizens whose first duty is not to themselves but to the State because of the mess created by Government, in particular Fianna F&aacute;il?  I would like an answer to the question of how the Government will help the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for sharing time with me.  We are putting aside &euro;54 billion for the banks, developers and Fianna F&aacute;il, a cosy cartel.  The Minister of State, when on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; last night, had an opportunity to apologise to the people for the mistakes made by his Government but he did not do so.  Senator Healy Eames is correct that today there are many hard-pressed families in negative equity, who are unemployed and are struggling to pay bills.  The hours provided to children with special needs have been cut, as have home help hours, leaving many carers in trouble while this Government continues to live a champagne lifestyle and makes no apology for its actions.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste withheld a report on F&Aacute;S for 90 days.  Why is that?  Banks are knocking on the doors of hard-pressed mortgage holders demanding keys and money.  I regret I have only one minute to make my contribution.  Where was the control in the growth of public services expenditure?  Senator O&rsquo;Malley spoke about the economic policies of the Progressive Democrats.  To borrow an American phrase, we were subject to voodoo economics and are all now paying the cost.  Will the Minister of State say who will bail out ordinary citizens who are suffering because of the decisions made by Fianna F&aacute;il in government?</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators who contributed to what has been a mainly constructive debate.  I will try to answer as many as possible of the questions raised within the time available.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey asked about the status of the reports by an bord snip nua and the Commission on Taxation.  Both reports offer recommendations to the Government.  Decisions on the matters raised will be made by the Government in due course.  In the case of the report of the Commission on Taxation, decisions will be made on a rather longer time scale.</P>
        <P>Government waste is certainly something about which we should be concerned.  It is an eternal struggle to ensure value for money.  Comptroller and Auditor General reports have contained criticisms of Government spending since that office was established a long time ago.  However, I accept Senator Twomey&rsquo;s point that when revenues were overflowing into the Exchequer, it was not always the case that the same care was taken as must clearly be taken today.  To that extent, I accept a degree of criticism.  The Senator also referred to raiding reserves.  In general, the purpose of the latter is precisely and rightly to meet critical and emergency situations.</P>
        <P>In so far as Senator Twomey is asking me to pre-empt budget decisions, that is obviously something I cannot do.  I refer him to any statements that have been made or will be made by the Minister for Finance.  The Senator also raised questions about NAMA and how it was to <Col N="68"/>be financed.  The Minister for Finance has estimated that 40% of the relevant loans are cash flow producing and that the cash flow produced will be sufficient to cover interest payments on NAMA bonds and operating costs.  The Minister expects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance has said he expects the institutions which require additional capital to explore all available options for raising such capital.  The Government&rsquo;s preference is that private market solutions be found.  The banks and building societies benefiting from NAMA are expected to increase the equity component of their capital as the NAMA asset transfers are implemented.  The Exchequer has invested &euro;7 billion in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland by way of recapitalisation this year.  These moneys pay a coupon of 8%, which pays a total of &euro;560 million per annum to the State.  The State also holds warrants in both institutions and these shares have, as has been pointed out, increased in value.</P><Col N="69"/>
        <P>Senator MacSharry is correct that it is often difficult in the polemics that rage to obtain objective assessments.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has pointed out that much nonsense is talked in the midst of serious debate.  Like the Senator, I am quite an admirer of the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, who has a good deal of chutzpah.  I listened with interest to his comment that we were not part of the G20 and would not directly participate in that forum.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn was right to highlight, as I did, the Exchequer deficit of &euro;20 billion and the interest payments associated with servicing that debt.  Interest charges may not be too onerous in the early years as one builds up debt, but if we keep going as we are, the associated interest payments will create a huge burden for the next generation.  Senator Hannigan addressed the same topic but seemed to suggest we should perhaps not take the required borrowing too seriously.  He referred to Lord Thomas Macaulay&rsquo;s comments on the ruinous effects of debt and the rhetoric about this in the early 19th century.  I would go back a century earlier to Dr. Johnson who observed that there was a lot of ruin in a nation.  It is no accident that one of the bases and foundations of the prosperity of the Celtic tiger years was that we managed to drive down debt and associated interest payments to very low levels.  We are fortunate that we did so, given the crisis that has since hit us.</P>
        <P>While I agree with Senator Mullen on the value of educational investment, it does not mean to say of that or any other area that there are no conceivable economies to be made and that nothing can be done more efficiently.  No area, however important and valuable and however great a priority it is, can be immune from action in securing better value for money and achieving more for less.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle is correct to be cautious about what have been referred to in other countries as the green shoots of recovery.  It is uncertain whether such signs of recovery will be sustained bearing in mind that stimulus packages are due to be withdrawn by various governments.  Only time will tell.  I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of restoring confidence.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey made a very constructive contribution.  The question of how social partnership may function in the future is worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley is absolutely correct regarding the importance of the view of the markets.  The danger at the end of last September was that, regardless of objective realities, the markets could have brought the entire banking system crashing down.  The Senator is also correct in her observation that professional costs and fees, including those of the medical, legal and dental professions, are in many cases out of line with those in other countries.  This is an issue that must be addressed, but it is open to question whether market forces alone will be sufficient to achieve this.</P>
      
        <P>The reasons advanced by Senator Pearse Doherty as to why it is quite okay, economically, to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum were totally unconvincing.  I believe it would be a huge mistake.  He referred to certain investment figures.  It must be borne in mind that most foreign investors are hoping, assuming or assessing that the Lisbon referendum will be passed and are making their decisions on that basis.  If, on the other hand, the vote goes in the other direction, I believe it will have serious consequences.  People such as Senator Pearse Doherty and other members of Sinn F&eacute;in really must pay some attention to people who have experience of business and decision making.</P>
        <P>It is richly ironic to hear requests for apologies coming from Sinn F&eacute;in.  For about 30 years, a very long time, there were as few apologies from that organisation as there were condemnations, and real evil was involved in many of those instances.  Before making such calls, people like Senator Doherty should look at themselves in the mirror.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators Healy Eames and Buttimer made broadly the same point, that is, who will look after people under pressure?  Practically everybody in this society, with some limited exceptions, is under pressure or certainly under a great deal more pressure than heretofore.  Some people are in a position to adjust their habits; they would probably include most Members of the Oireachtas and others who are on relatively good incomes.  However, others are under very serious pressure.  There are various forms of assistance for employment and there is, of course, the social welfare system, which is being called on to a hugely greater extent.  It is not possible for the State either under this Government or any alternative to be able to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In 1985 a public consultation was carried out in Bantry, my home town, on a new regional water scheme.  In 1989 the council had carried out significant works for that scheme in terms of acquiring land and was about to carry out damming in Drumbro, but an underwater lily was discovered by environmentalists and the then Minister of State, Deputy Mary Harney, decided not to proceed with the scheme.</P>
        <P>Twenty years later, despite that Bantry is a developing town, I am deeply concerned.  A new hotel was built in the town a few years ago and it is difficult to believe that water is drawn from Skibbereen by tanker to facilitate that hotel during peak times.  If it happened in another area, there would be mayhem.  While the recent cryptosporidium outbreak in part of the water scheme is a matter of deep concern, I am seeking answers on the broader issue of how it is intended to proceed.  There were some objections to the regional water scheme.  In my view, the local authority made some tactical errors in proceeding with the current scheme.  There are court cases pending and certain MEPs brought people to Europe to object to the scheme.  However, in 2009, 24 years after the public consultation process took place in Bantry, the water scheme has not been provided for Bantry or the surrounding region.  What is the position with it?</P>
        <P>I probably would not have raised this issue were it not for the fact that I received a briefing from the local council when it expressed its concern about the cryptosporidium.  A particular section of the town&rsquo;s water supply has been cut off and people must queue with bottles and cans for drinking water for domestic use.  The situation is probably not as serious as that which <Col N="71"/>occurred in Galway but any incidence of cryptosporidium in drinking water is a major concern.  I have not gone public on the issue at local level but answers must be given, especially with regard to when the people of Bantry and the surrounding area can expect the new scheme to be put in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the recent issues with water quality in Bantry.  As Senators will be aware, the operation and maintenance of water supply infrastructure is the responsibility of the local authority concerned, in this instance Cork County Council.  Under the drinking water regulations, local authorities are obliged to ensure any failure to meet quality standards in a water supply is investigated immediately to determine the cause.  The authority is required to consult the HSE to determine whether there is a potential danger to human health and, if there is, to agree the appropriate action, including the prompt notification of consumers.  In the case of public supplies, a local authority is also obliged to inform the Environmental Protection Agency promptly and the EPA can issue such directions to a local authority as necessary to prevent or remove any health risk.</P>
        <P>I understand Cork County Council has taken the necessary steps under this supervisory framework.  The council has contacted the HSE and the EPA about the cryptosporidium contamination of the Bantry water supply and is following both agencies&rsquo; instructions in the matter.  The council has issued a &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; notice to affected consumers, has made tankered water available, has established a dedicated contact number for consumers and is carrying out ongoing monitoring of the water supply for quality purposes.  I understand the most recent results show the water supply to be free of cryptosporidium.</P>
        <P>There are longer-term proposals to upgrade the water supply infrastructure in Bantry and its hinterland.  Two separate schemes, Bantry water and Bantry regional water supply, are included for funding in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2007-09, at a total estimated cost of more than &euro;24 million.  I understand that the council is preparing contract documents for the proposed Bantry water supply scheme but cannot finalise those documents until the legal action in the Circuit Court against the council&rsquo;s abstraction and impoundment proposals, being brought by a local landowner, has concluded. The court action has been ongoing since May 2006.</P>
        <P>The delay with the Bantry water supply scheme has also delayed the planning phase of the regional scheme which would extend the scheme into the hinterland of Bantry town.  The Department awaits the council&rsquo;s design brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report setting out the scale, scope and estimated costs of the regional scheme.  Pending eventual delivery of the Bantry water and regional water supply schemes, the Department has provided funding to the council to facilitate a programme of interim works to improve the quality of the Bantry water supply, involving works at the two treatment plants currently serving Bantry.  This includes &euro;22,500 for works at Millenacoola, which was the source of the recent contamination.  This funding supported the installation of additional water quality monitoring instrumentation and other remedial works at the plant.</P>
        <P>Funding has also been approved, as an advance on the Bantry water supply scheme, for the upgrading of the existing treatment plant at Derryginagh, for which tenders will be sought shortly, the provision of a new water treatment plant at Cahernacrin and related works to improve the supply.  I understand the Cahernacrin plant will become operational next month and when fully operational the Millenacoola plant will be decommissioned and maintained on <Col N="72"/>a stand-by basis.  The new plant will operate with a full cryptosporidium barrier using ozone and UV treatment.  Once commissioned, the council expects the &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; notice to be lifted shortly thereafter, subject to the agreement of the HSE.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;3.14 million has been provided to date by my Department under the water services investment programme for these interim works pending the advancement of the main scheme.  I hope this helps to clarify the matter for the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for explaining the position.  As someone with a legal background, I am concerned about the proposed court case that is causing delays to the scheme and may last for three or four years.  I acknowledge, however, that the issue is beyond the control of the Minister and Department.  It is a pity that after 24 years the scheme is being held up.  If it had proceeded, the current problem would not have arisen.</P>
