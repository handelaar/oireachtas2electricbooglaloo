	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the current regulations in respect of dangerous dogs and whether the animal welfare legislation will embrace change in supporting those at risk from such dogs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when construction of an extension for Baylin national school, Athlone, will commence and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Bill 2009 &mdash; all Stages, and No. 2, earlier signature motion.  It is proposed that No. 1 shall be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and that on Second Stage spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes.  Senators may share time by agreement of the House.  No. 2, shall be taken at the conclusion of No. 1.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>On 3 February, through a motion in the D&aacute;il, the Government formally corrected the public record to state that there was no evidence that the Stardust fire of almost 29 years ago was started deliberately and that the cause of the fire is unknown.  This happened as a result of a report by Paul Coffey, Senior Counsel, which recommended that the Government should consider correcting the public record of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  When is it intended to introduce a similar motion in this House and why has there been a delay in addressing the matter here?  I seek an assurance from the Leader that the matter will be addressed within the next week or so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>A half debate took place recently on the ownership of Catholic schools.  Many people are of the view that he who is not with us must be against us and believe that <Col N="168"/>those who support State ownership of schools are in some way anti-Catholic, but that is not the case.  We need a full debate on this matter so that people&rsquo;s views are put on the record.  A classic example in support of such a debate arose on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business, when my colleague, Senator Mullen, brought to the attention of the House a Red C poll, conducted about a year ago, which indicated that 47% of parents were in favour of Catholic schools whereas 37% preferred mixed religion education and 11% said that religion should have no part in education.  However, the difficulty with this kind of half information is that it is undermining, as is shown by the finding in the same poll that 72% of parents, in other words the majority, would prefer primary schools to be run by the State with equal status and opportunity given to all religions.</P>
        <P>I raise this matter because my colleague, Senator Norris, has on two occasions in the past three weeks sought a debate on the question of equal status.  The Leader raised the issue with the Minister for Education and Science but he cannot get the Government to support it.  The people of Ireland are calling for equal opportunity and status for all religions, and that is very important.  The recent D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, which brings young people together to learn about democracy, came to the conclusion that while the doctrines and beliefs of various religions should be fully respected and tolerated, they should not be a barrier to appropriate sex education for young people.  These issues can be debated in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Let people express their views.  It is not anti anybody to seek equality and tolerance.  These schools were built with State money on land donated to the churches by local farmers or community organisations.  This is the people&rsquo;s money.  State ownership of schools does not affect Catholic control.  Of course there should be parental choice and if parents want Catholic education they should have it.  As taxpayers we should own the buildings we fund.  It is that simple.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I await with interest the outcome of the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels.  If reports are to be believed, at least some of the concerns expressed by Irish citizens in the last Lisbon referendum will be addressed.  As someone who campaigned vigorously for the treaty, I was concerned about the issues raised with me on doorsteps and in supermarkets about taxation, neutrality and the loss of a full-time Commissioner.  If the reports are true, the meeting will go a long way towards addressing the worries of many citizens.  It is important that the information is disseminated clearly, preferably before the debate begins, because during the last referendum we were constantly chasing the fight in convincing people and countering misinformation.</P>
        <P>As a new customer of Bord G&aacute;is, I was very angry and disappointed to learn that my details and those of 75,000 other customers may have fallen into criminal hands because they were held without encryption on stolen laptop computers.  It is not acceptable in this day and age that unencrypted data can be held on portable devices, but it is not the first time this happened.  In April 2008, 10,000 records held on Bank of Ireland computers were stolen and last August a computer containing the records of 100,000 social welfare recipients was stolen from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Last weekend we heard that 15 computers containing HSE data, two of which were unencrypted, were stolen in County Roscommon.  Encrypting data does not take a lot of time or money, yet private sector organisations, semi-State bodies and State agencies are sloppy in their procedures for protecting data.  If these organisations cannot get their act together, it is time for the Government to step in with fines or compensation.  I call for a debate on this issue so that we can hear what the Government <Col N="169"/>plans to do in terms of cajoling or requiring companies to protect sensitive and confidential information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise an old chestnut by asking whether a date has been arranged for a debate on issues pertaining to the North and North-South co-operation.  As we are approaching the end of the session, I suggest that we hold regular debates which would allow for formal feedback from the North-South Ministerial Council.  Although those meetings take place very regularly, we do not have the opportunity to contribute to the discussions.  </P>
        <P>The closing date for the all-Ireland choir of the year competition is 3 September.  Senators should encourage their local schools to enter the competition because RTE will cover the regional heats and the final, which will take place in Belfast.  The competition is an example of how the arts can offer opportunities to reach hands across the Border so that young people can get to know each other.</P>
        <P>I questioned on previous occasions the use of names such as that in &ldquo;The Town I Loved So Well&rdquo; &mdash; at this point it appears to be &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo;.  Maps were issued in the recent leaving certificate geography examination containing the name &ldquo;Londonderry&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Derry&rdquo;.  If we must have &ldquo;Londonderry&rdquo;, we should also have &ldquo;Derry&rdquo;.  As far as I am aware, the City of Derry Airport and the City of Derry Council are located in Derry and it is offensive and insensitive to the majority of people to use &ldquo;Londonderry&rdquo; at the total exclusion of &ldquo;Derry&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator Cummins regarding the Paul Coffey report.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas passed a resolution establishing the inquiry into the Stardust fire.  Mr. Coffey made clear in his report that the families concerned were wronged and left under a cloud.  The report recommended that both Houses should correct the public record.  It is lax of us not to have not done so given that the other House passed a motion to this end last February.  I would like to hear the Leader&rsquo;s opinion on how we should address the matter.</P>
        <P>What is the House&rsquo;s legislative programme between now and the end of this session?  We are led to believe that we will be dealing with some important Bills.  I refer in particular to the proposed National Assets Management Agency Bill, which is very urgent.  The delay in producing this legislation is causing confusion and the ensuing volatility in the markets is not good for stability.  Given the considerable amount of misleading information that has issued in regard to NAMA, perhaps the Minister for Finance will make a statement to the House.  Some of the best information on the matter comes from independent analysts who know what they are talking about.  The Minister should give a lead on this and he might make a statement outlining the legislative programme and remaining sitting days for this House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister, Deputy Gormley, the leader, has apparently been moderately successful in assuaging some of the doubts of those of us who opposed the Lisbon treaty.  I think I was the first person in this House to come out against the Lisbon treaty.  I did so because of the military situation.  I raised a series of questions that have never been answered and for that reason I welcome the fact that the heads of the European Defence Agency Bill have been prepared.  Can the Leader tell us when that Bill will come before the House?  It is a most important Bill.  I very much welcome that our participation in defence measures will be limited to matters under the programme of the United Nations but the central point concerned the use of the European Defence Agency, formerly the Western European Armaments Group, for the development of the munitions industry for export in Europe.  I look for that to be discussed and answered and then perhaps I can come on board and support the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader contact the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and ask him to take an interest in the fate of Dublin Bay?  There is a deadline of 7 July for submissions on the proposal by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to infill a very large section of the bay with a potentially disastrous impact on the coastline, wildlife, the natural ecology and the enjoyment of the citizens of Dublin.  It is important that we get the Minister&rsquo;s report before the decision is made, and the Minister should request a delay until he gets his own full report.</P>
        <P>This is a very sad day because it is the day on which the final report of the Combat Poverty Agency is launched.  The independence of this body has been completely and ruthlessly extinguished in the middle of the worst economic circumstances this country has seen.  It is a shameful day in that we, as an Oireachtas, have presided over the dismantling of the very agency that supports the poor.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the opposition of my colleague, Senator Norris, to the Lisbon treaty.  He claims he was one of the first against it on military grounds.  I also note, in the same spirit and along the same seamless robe of bad politics, that he is going to a press conference after the Order of Business where he will give substance to the incredible claims of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I hate the cliche that I did not heckle you, but heckle away.  The point is that the Senator is going to a press conference after the Order of Business at which he will give substance to the claim of Pat O&rsquo;Donnell, who claims his boat, the <i>Iona Isle</i>, was sank off Erris Head by a group of masked men at 1.40 a.m. who stayed three hours in the area and then departed, with six miles of visibility.  When the garda&iacute; came out in their boat and the Royal National Lifeboat came out they could not see anybody of any sort and conveniently, one of Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s relatives was standing by when the boat sank to take him off at the same time as Shell protestors were leaving in kayaks to attack the Shell installation.  If the Senator believes that, he would believe anything.</P>

	<P>The up-market <i>The Sunday Times</i>, which I reckon is one of the newspapers the Senator reads, quotes the garda&iacute; as saying the sinking story is fishy.  The Senator is a close reader.  He reads <i>Ulysses</i>&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important question.  I would have to blame the Leader because he went public on this issue about the Seanad nomination.  It is important to this House because the question is whether the Green Party Members are operating an empty chair policy.  Is it simply about this nomination or is it more fundamental about whether the Green Party is supporting the Government, be it on the Lisbon referendum, the next budget or whatever legislation will be forthcoming over the remainder of this period?  This is important.  I ask the Leader to respond and clarify the position because it is rather odd that during this entire week no Green Party Member has been in this House.  Will that continue?</P>

	<P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Transport on organising National Bike Week, which I hope will be a tremendous success.  I encourage everybody to cycle a little more this week.  That follows the previous speaker&rsquo;s comments about the absence of the Green Party Members.  This measure was done by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to indicate the success or otherwise of the cycle to work scheme introduced in the last budget.  Will he put to the Department of Finance the view that the abolition of VAT on bicycles might encourage people, other than those who use them to go to work, to increase their use of bicycles?</P>
      
        <P>Another issue about which I am concerned is bus services.  My understanding is that Bus &Eacute;ireann is considering making alterations to 100 routes.  I ask the Leader to obtain information as to the impact of these alterations on services.</P>
        <P>As it is in my area, I have a particular interest in the Stardust motion, which I have been pursuing and following and which I understand the is being prepared and will come to the House.  I ask the Leader to ensure it does so before the summer recess.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Professor Kevin O&rsquo;Rourke of Trinity College, Dublin has just produced a paper comparing the current global recession to the Great Depression of the 1930s.  The conclusion he draws is stark, namely, that globally we are tracking even worse than during the Great Depression.  Professor O&rsquo;Rourke makes two points, essentially that the collapse of world trade in the past year has been greater than that experienced in the first two years of the Great Depression and that the decline in stock markets in recent years is greater than anything experienced in the Great Depression.</P>
        <P>I make this point to emphasise what I said yesterday on the Order of Business.  With a global outlook such as this, our small open economy is facing a number of decisions that are simply vast in the effect they will have on the people we serve.  In the context of the debate we had on the emergency budget and the budget that preceded it, this country is facing at least two to three budgets of equal severity in the coming years.</P>
        <P>I want to re-emphasise the call I made, namely, that in the September review of the salaries paid to senior figures in the public service, the Government would take this as an opportunity to reduce dramatically the salaries paid to Ministers to give Government and all politicians the credibility to lead the country through the huge difficulties we are in.</P>

I cannot help but feel that if the people who founded our country, <Col N="174"/>from all political parties, were present and saw the way Ministers are treated now, they would wonder how everything went so wrong.</P>

Last night we were treated to what I can only describe as a sermon from the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on the progress the Government is making on cloud computing, where quantities of data are held on the Internet as opposed to laptops.  If even a fraction of this work was being done, the crimes being talked about earlier would not be happening because the information would not be on laptops.</P>

	<P>I express my sympathy on the death of Mrs. Sadie Walsh, the mother of the very respected Seanad reporter, Mr. Jimmy Walsh.  She died yesterday in her 91st year and is being reposed from today until her burial on Saturday.  The notice is in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I draw attention to the report by Carl O&rsquo;Brien in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> headed &ldquo;Severe literacy problems persist despite 25 years of programmes&rdquo;.  Almost one third of children who live in disadvantaged areas and one tenth of children nationally have severe literacy problems.  Despite the Celtic tiger and all the money we have had, we have not got to the bottom of this issue.  It is shocking to think of one tenth of our little children not being literate.  Ms Maureen Gaffney describes being literate as being like the oxygen for engaging in society.  The researchers at the National Economic and Social Forum state that children who do not read, write or communicate effectively at primary level are much more likely to leave school early, be unemployed or in low-skilled jobs and more likely to end up in poverty and in our prisons.  Every child born into this world, no matter what social class he or she is in, starts off with the same dreams and aspirations.  Sadly, along the way, these change owing to income inequality, and all the international research shows that this country has severe income inequality.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of my colleagues to a book called <i>The Spirit Level</i> by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett.</P>

        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call, and the calls we have made in recent days, for an urgent debate on the ownership of our so-called national schools.  The State cannot afford not to take national schools into ownership &mdash; that is the reality.  Currently, the State is paying for the salaries of the teachers and the maintenance and physical upkeep of the schools, yet it does not have real control over the governance and governance standards within the schools or the retention and recruitment of teachers.  We have enshrined in the equality legislation an exemption for schools and other institutions run by religious orders from certain aspects of the non-discrimination obligations, which is a scandal.  Senator Norris has been very active in raising this issue and I have supported him on it.  It is vital we have this debate with a view to changing matters.</P>
        <P>I have examined the full Red C poll to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred and I found it very interesting.  It states not only that 72% of parents would prefer to see schools run by the State with equal status and opportunity for all religions, but the question was specifically asked whether parents want a school managed by and promoting the faith of a particular religion for their children and only 25%, or one in four, said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding that, I agree that the issue of public sector pay should be examined.  Between an bord snip nua and the various considerations of public sector reform, this issue is being dealt with.  However, I am fundamentally opposed to any gimmickry or tokenism whereby we focus on Ministers, senior TDs or otherwise and set to cut their pay.  I agree that we should look at the entire area of public sector pay and, through partnership only, let us seek to reduce that pay in line with the renewed world in which we live, where inflation is in a downward trend.</P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on the provision of energy options on an equal basis throughout the island of Ireland.  As people will be aware the north west is not provided with gas currently.  Anyone who has listened to me in the past seven years will be aware this is a pet issue for me and we seek equality in that respect as soon as possible.  It is very important the Corrib gas resource, which effectively belongs to the people of the west and north west, is brought ashore in a safe and agreed manner.  We have been through many procedures to ensure it can be brought ashore safely, the last of which followed from the Cassells report, is being adjudicated upon by An Bord Plean&aacute;la at present and the results of which I look forward to in September.  I trust that works undertaken in the coming months can be done in a way which upholds the rule of law and which respects the right to peaceful protest which is neither obstructive nor obtrusive in the interests of the people of the west because, as all Members will agree, the good of the many far outweighs the good of the few or the one.</P>

	<P>Let us imagine a meeting some months ago in either the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism or the Department of Transport at which Ministers and officials were deciding how to tackle head-on the challenge of diminishing tourism numbers.  If someone had suggested the idea of charging everyone &euro;10 extra to come and visit, one would assume that person would have been smacked down immediately.  However, that is exactly what we are doing.  The announcement by Ryanair today that it plans to cut flights further to a point where only three of its aircraft will operate from Shannon indicates what a nonsensical and utterly absurd decision it was to impose a travel tax.</P>

	<P>Some 44 flights per week will be removed from Dublin and 36 from Shannon.  It is not as if these aircraft are being taken out of commission.  They are being moved to other locations in Europe in which there are governments with a little more vision and sense.  Perhaps they are being moved to Belgium where the Government has scrapped the passenger tax, to Greece where the regional airport tax has been reduced to zero, to Holland where the &euro;12 air passenger tax has been removed, or to Spain which is announcing a zero rate of tax for airlines which sustain or maintain traffic in particular locations.  Something similar must be done immediately in this country.  Will the Leader call on the Minister for Transport to come to the Chamber to explain this nonsensical decision and perhaps to take the enlightened route of removing the tax immediately before it impacts further on tourism numbers in the upcoming season?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would welcome very much a debate on the management of our schools and whether they should be State-oriented or under the domain of the religious.  I have no difficulty with holding such a debate and the jury is out on which is preferable.  There should be a detailed analysis of the boards of management which control schools and of whether they should be controlled by teachers or parents.  There are many issues which must be teased out.  I have scanned articles in the newspapers related to the percentage that seek State control but I do not take that view.  The debate is very serious because many issues must be taken into consideration.  We should not decide flippantly that this is the way the system should be run.  A debate in this area is very important.</P>
        <P>The matter of reform of the public service has been aired and whether there should be cutbacks in pay.  I seek an examination of the terms of reference for the work of those concerned, how it is performed and whether it should be nine to five or take-home work.  All such issues must be examined in terms of reform and I would welcome a debate on these two issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always pleased to see good ideas taken up and I compliment Fine Gael and, in particular, Deputy Denis Naughten, for his comments on the need to criminalise the purchasers of sexual services from people in prostitution.  As Members will be aware, last week I brought forward this idea as part of a more wide-ranging Private Members&rsquo; motion on the needs of victims of human trafficking.  I am very pleased it is now Fine Gael Party policy and that we would see such legislation in this country following the model pursued successfully in Sweden, Norway and Iceland to help make the country a cold house for traffickers of human persons by tackling demand in the area of prostitution.  I give credit to Fine Gael on this issue.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the remarks of Senator Bacik on the ongoing debate on education.  There are rumours that Senator Bacik might think of getting even closer to the Labour Party, if that can be imagined.  If she does so she may wish to note Labour&rsquo;s very sensible statement on the matter, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, that &ldquo;Labour is committed to the establishment of a genuine pluralism in our school system that would enable parents to make the choice they want for their children in so far as that is possible&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wonderful to have such harmony because this is what Archbishop Martin was rightly getting at when he suggested it would be untenable for there to be such a predominance of Catholic schools in circumstances in which the same percentage of people did not wish for it.  We must examine honestly and carefully at the issues of parental choice.  I note and recommend to Members the comments of Archbishop Martin yesterday in which he warned of moving to a new education system by &ldquo;single-issue plebiscite, a panic reaction or a <Col N="178"/>managed strategic action by one grouping ... Decisions based on the &lsquo;polemics of the moment&rsquo; are less likely to be successful&rdquo;.  If we take a view that respects parental choice, recognises that national schools are good but nationalisation might not be so good and might not represent parents&rsquo; best wishes and desires, then we will arrive at the right answers to the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on education which should take place in an informed and non-partisan way.  If there is a perception abroad that the present debate regarding the Catholic church&rsquo;s involvement in education has its roots in anti-Catholicism then we should ask ourselves why that perception is abroad.  One reason may be that the question is generally raised at a time when the Catholic church, for one reason or another, is coming under the spotlight.  We do no justice to the children of this generation or future generations by conducting a debate in that manner.  Only for the Catholic church in this country we would not be in the position in which we find ourselves, that is, in which we can realise our full potential.  Many people in the House would not be able to enunciate views, as they do, but for the excellent free education which we received from the various religious orders.  I suggest we step back a little at this time and hold a debate for its own sake.  There is not a single person in the House who is not committed to providing the best possible education system in the country.  However, we contaminate the debate each time we try to link it to some other debate or issue.  The Leader would do us all a favour if he could bring forward that debate at the earliest possible time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to address two specific questions in his reply on the Order of Business.  Given that we are celebrating the 90th anniversary of the first D&aacute;il, have Members on the Government side adopted a new abstentionist policy to the House?  When does the Government propose to hold a by-election for the vacancies arising in the membership of the Seanad?  Is it the intention of the Leader and Senator Boyle to kiss and make up and to have an agreed candidate?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the issue of social partnership?  Never in the history of the State have we required social partnership more.  I agree with Senator Donohoe, who is spot on.  It is absurd that Ministers are paid exorbitant sums of money, well in excess of what they deserve.  The Senator is correct to say we should cap the salaries of Deputies because we cannot afford to pay some members of the Government who are under-performing.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on tourism?  He is involved in tourism and the industry is in great decline.  We have an airport tax which is unjust and is a barrier to people coming to this country.  Senator Cannon referred to other countries which have got rid of the travel tax whereas we have done the exact opposite and put a levy on people coming to Ireland.  I hope the Leader will be succinct in his reply to the questions I asked at the beginning of my contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am cognisant of fact that Archbishop Martin has spoken on church-run schools, I am very conscious of the fact that in the current climate it is not the best time to have a balanced and reasoned debate and this might even be a time to remind ourselves how in other countries people are flocking to faith-run institutions.  In the fullness of time and <Col N="179"/>in the clear light of day, the balance will be struck and it will be seen how much good has also been done in faith-run schools.  It will be seen how necessary it is to keep them and how fortunate we are to have so many.</P>
        <P>I wish to support my colleagues who have spoken about the pipeline from the Corrib gas field to north Mayo.  This is a question of national sovereignty.  The process has been completed, the planning procedure has been correctly performed, the planning requirements have been agreed to so why are people still attempting to stop a legally enforceable contract between the State and Shell?  Why are people attempting to stop what is badly needed by the whole State which is our gas supply off the west coast?  It has become quite apparent in recent weeks that there is the possibility not only of oil but the finding of oil indicates further gas deposits.  We need this pipeline and when the laws of the State have been complied with, no individual group has the right to prevent it in any way it so chooses.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a two-day debate at the earliest opportunity on how all the parties in this House intend to deal with the &euro;20 billion deficit through cuts and taxation.</P>

	<P>Senators Cummins, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan and Coghlan asked about the motion on the Stardust fire tragedy which is to come to the House.  I am pleased to inform the House that will be taken on Wednesday, 8 July in the presence of the Minister and the relatives of those who lost their lives tragically on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day, 1981, which was one of the darkest and saddest days in the history of Dublin and I remember it well.  The reason for the delay in dealing with this motion was to ensure we would be able to facilitate the next of kin and relatives of the deceased so that they could be present in the House when the motion is taken.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Leyden, Bacik, Ormonde, Mullen, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Hanafin asked for a debate on education, with the Minister for Education and Science in attendance, to deal with the subjects of equal status and respect for parental choice and the challenges facing our schools.  I have already made that request to the Minister&rsquo;s office.  I have asked if the debate could take place before the summer recess but if that is not possible, it will be held in the first or second week in the autumn term.  I join Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Senator Leyden in expressing our gratitude for the work of the religious orders in educating us all down through the generations.  Fifty years ago, a total of 75% of all students leaving primary education went no further in education.  That was the education in total they received and I can speak from experience about the years 1958 and 1959.  This shows how much we have progressed in our country in the past 50 years.</P>
        <P>I wish to acknowledge the great work done by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole in particular who has given a lifetime of commitment to education.  Every time he utters a meaningful sentence about education I know he is speaking from vast experience in this area.</P>

	<P>The Stardust tragedy occurred in Senator Callely&rsquo;s constituency and he has been asking me over recent weeks and months to endeavour to have the motion dealt with before the summer recess.  I know this has been a very difficult time for anyone living in <Col N="180"/>the Artane area and especially in that constituency.  Politicians of all parties have done their utmost to help and assist since the tragedy occurred in 1981.</P>
        <P>On the EU Council of Ministers meeting and the Lisbon legislation, it is my intention to take the legislation in the House on Thursday, 9 July and the Taoiseach will be in attendance.  Colleagues should put that date in their diaries.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan outlined to the House his serious concerns regarding data protection and the mislaying or robbery of data.  He referred to the importance of having data encrypted.  I fully agree with him.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney outlined many issues relating to cross-Border matters.  She asked that the House discuss the progress of the ministerial conferences.  I know that all parties are in favour of such a discussion.  The Fianna F&aacute;il proposal for Seanad reform deals with this and the proposal will be given to the Minister in the next few days. The Senator also spoke about art, music and festivals and I completely agree with her.  She referred to the song, &ldquo;The Town I Loved So Well&rdquo; and the name of Derry or Londonderry and all these issues that have been in existence for generations.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the legislative programme up to the end of this session.  I will inform the leaders of the groups before the House sits next Tuesday and inform the House on the Order of Business on Tuesday.  There are eleven or 12 Bills which the House must pass before the summer recess on 10 July.</P>
        <P>I will pass on to the relevant Minister Senator Norris&rsquo;s strong views about the precious coastline of Dublin Bay and about the Combat Poverty Agency in the context of its report which is being published today.  Senator Regan expressed his concerns about our colleagues in the Green Party.  Senator Boyle is in the House today.  He is attending a committee meeting now but he will be in the Chamber deliberating and assisting the House as he is a very enlightened person with regard to the finance portfolio.

        <P>Senators Donohoe, MacSharry, Ormonde and Buttimer expressed their views on financial matters.  The Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) 2009 is before the House today.  I know Senators will be eager to make their contributions on Second Stage with regard to public sector pay reform.  We should not fail to acknowledge that Ministers and Ministers of State have taken a reduction in their pay.  Politics is not a 40 hour week, or even a 70 or 80 hour week, profession.  Public representatives work for more like 100 hours per week and give a service to the public on all seven days.  They are appreciated for it.  No one I know in any political party is in public life for the remuneration.  Politicians are prepared to play their part if everyone else does so too.  Ministers and Ministers of State have already taken a reduction in pay, and this should be acknowledged and appreciated.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White referred to the education of children in disadvantaged areas.  Senator White is doing all she can to help those who suffer the torment of losing loved ones through <Col N="181"/>suicide.  This House should do everything we can do assist in that.  The report she mentioned, to which Senator Keaveney and colleagues in the D&aacute;il contributed, will be considered by the Seanad in the next session.</P>
        <P>I join in commiserating with Mr. Jimmy Walsh and the Walsh family on the loss of their mother, Mrs. Sadie Walsh.  Mr. Jimmy Walsh has been a trojan worker in journalism, reporting on the work of the Seanad on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Senators MacSharry and Hanafin highlighted the challenges and opportunities presented by energy options.  Last evening, I was very impressed by the contributions of colleagues during the debate on sustainable economic opportunities and how they can help to turn the economy around.  I hope to make time available during the next session to hold Ministers, Ministers of State and Departments to account on making opportunities available in this regard.  Senator Larry Butler has been very vociferous in this area on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Cannon and Buttimer raised tourism issues.  I welcome the announcement by Aer Lingus of the &euro;80 one-way fare from the United States to Ireland.  This is a tremendous opportunity to boost the tourism industry, which is going through a very tough time.  As we all know, it is one of the principal creators of employment in services at present.  We must do everything we can to help the tourism industry.  It needs all the help it can get.</P>

        <P>I will pass to the Minister the views of Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen regarding the need for legislation on prostitution.  Senator Buttimer referred to the 90th anniversary of the first D&aacute;il.  We congratulate all those who made that happen.  Our forefathers put their lives on the line so that we could express our views openly and independently without fear or favour in this House.  I salute everyone who made this possible.  There is a one-liner &ldquo;If you do not know where you came from you do not know where you are going&rdquo;.  We appreciate the men and women who gave their lives for the freedom we have in our country today.</P>
        <P>Senator John Hanafin asked for a two-day debate on the challenges facing the economy and the &euro;20 billion which must be found.  I have already agreed to allocate time to this matter.</P>

    <Title>Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Bill 2009: Second and Subsequent Stages. </Title>
        <P FLI="0">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Bill is one part of a two-stage package, the other being a complementary statutory instrument, which the Minister will make as soon as the Bill has been enacted, to amend and update the Irish deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, in line with the Government&rsquo;s announcement of 20 September last.</P>
        <P>The main provisions of the Bill are to empower the Minister to make regulations prescribing the amount payable to an eligible depositor of a credit institution which fails and to empower the Minister to prescribe by regulation the contribution to be made by credit institutions to the Central Bank to fund the scheme.</P>
        <P>The follow-on statutory instrument to be made by the Minister will increase the statutory limit for the DGS for banks and building societies from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 per eligible depositor per institution; abolish the requirement for the depositor to bear the first 10% of his or her loss; extend the coverage of the scheme to credit union savers; reduce the minimum payout period within which duly verified depositor claims must be paid from three months, which can be extended by a further nine months in exceptional circumstances, to 20 working days and with the possibility of an extension of a further ten working days in exceptional circumstances; and make various other amendments, mainly of a technical nature, to update the 1995 scheme.</P>
        <P>It is a very short Bill and almost half of its sections consist of provisions lifted from the existing 1995 statutory instrument, which is the basis for our deposit guarantee scheme.  The provisions in question are being switched to primary legislation so as to give them a more secure legal basis.  While the Bill itself is short, its importance lies in the fact that it gives the Minister the power to extend the provisions of our deposit protection arrangements to the 419 credit unions, which are currently outside the scope of that scheme and to give effect to reforms required by the EU, such as ensuring a quicker payout in the event of a credit institution failure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I might briefly touch upon the background to deposit protection arrangements.  The guaranteeing of deposits was pioneered in the US, with the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1934 in the aftermath of the Depression. In Europe and other developed countries, despite some precedents dating from the 1930s, it was not until the 1970s that deposit protection schemes started to become a feature of the institutional framework.  Ireland came relatively late to this type of facility.  The Central Bank Act 1989 established a deposit protection scheme involving the Central Bank setting up a deposit protection account and transferring to that account 0.2% of deposits of the licensed banks held by the Central Bank.  This was repealed in 1995, when a new EU-wide scheme was established under the 1995 regulations, which I mentioned earlier.</P>
        <P>The basic intention behind a deposit protection scheme is to reassure small and relatively unsophisticated depositors that there is a safety net that will enable them to recover all, or at least most, of their savings in the event of a failure of a credit institution.  This reassurance, in turn, helps to reduce the likelihood of a run on an otherwise solvent bank, and thus helps to contribute to the stability of the financial system.  A deposit protection scheme is not, of course, intended to cope with a systemic financial crisis.  In such a scenario, Government intervention to restore confidence might be necessary, as we have seen both here and in other countries over the past year.  Thus, deposit protection schemes are seen as just one part of the financial safety net, but they can be helpful in protecting an otherwise solvent institution from failure.</P>
        <P>In the wake of the turmoil that has affected the global financial system over the past two years or so, there is a general acceptance that deposit protection needs to be enhanced, and also that information, funding and immediacy of payment are important factors in ensuring the <Col N="183"/>effectiveness of a deposit protection framework in supporting confidence in the banking system.  No doubt, economists and financiers will say the soundness of the financial system rests upon effective regulation and supervision by independent supervisors, together with adequately high levels of institutional development covering corporate governance, transparency, accountability and deterrence.  Whatever about having robust systems of financial regulation in place, developments over the past few years have also highlighted the risks to financial stability if deposit holders are not assured of timely access to their funds in the event of their bank failing.</P>
        <P>The EU directive which gave rise to and still underpins our current deposit protection arrangements specifically prohibits state funding of such schemes on state aid considerations.  The industry itself is required to bear the cost.  In Ireland, the scheme is funded by a contribution by credit institutions of 0.2% of bank deposits.  These contributions are maintained in a deposit protection account at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, CBFSAI, and the current total in the fund stands at &euro;670 million.  Should a compensation event arise subsequent to the failure of a credit institution, and if the funds in the deposit protection account prove to be insufficient to meet the required payout costs in full, then the Exchequer would have to step in on a temporary basis to ensure prompt payment of depositors.  However, it would then have to recover the cost concerned from the industry as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>All institutions authorised by the Financial Regulator to carry on banking activities here are required to become members of our deposit guarantee scheme and to hold a balance in the deposit protection account at the CBFSAI.  There are currently about 50 such institutions which have been so authorised by the Financial Regulator.  To sum up, what the Irish deposit protection scheme guarantees is to compensate eligible depositors up to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per depositor, per institution.  It covers deposits held in current accounts, demand deposit accounts and term deposit accounts with banks, building societies and, as of last September&rsquo;s Government announcement, credit unions also.</P>
        <P>The Government decision last September to increase the guarantee limit from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 was prompted by a number of factors.  First, there was the significant uncertainty in international financial markets at that time, and which had begun to play on some people&rsquo;s fears regarding the security of their savings in Irish financial institutions.  Second, given the passage of time since the guarantee limit was last changed almost ten years ago and the very substantial growth in the number and value of deposits, the case for raising the payout ceiling of &euro;20,000 had been clear for some time.  Finally, the case for an increase in the limit had been made by various Members on both sides of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The decision to remove the co-insurance requirement, whereby the depositor carried 10% of the loss on his deposit, was a necessary amendment because of the public&rsquo;s heightened sensitivity to the broader savings protection debate and, in particular, people&rsquo;s fear of losing even a small portion of their savings because of a credit institution becoming insolvent.  It was important to remove any incentive for people to withdraw their deposits from credit institutions and to reassure those with relatively small deposits, in particular, that all of their savings would be protected.</P>
        <P>As regards the extension of the scheme&rsquo;s coverage to credit union savers, this was based on the need to provide a level playing field for all depositors.  In this connection, it should be noted that the Irish League of Credit Unions has, since 1989, operated on an all-island basis a savings protection scheme, or SPS, for credit unions.  The SPS has to date operated on the basis that it stood ready to provide financial support to any of its member credit unions that got into difficulty.  Fortunately, it has never been necessary for the ILCU to carry through on that promise, as no credit union has become insolvent and no member of a credit union has experienced any loss of shares or deposits.  Nevertheless, last autumn there was a genuine concern <Col N="184"/>that any difference in treatment of depositors could potentially have been very damaging for any class of credit institution which was considered by the public at large to have had inferior deposit protection terms, thus explaining why the decision was made to apply this scheme to credit unions.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that this legislative package complements the more comprehensive guarantee made under the credit institutions financial support scheme in October 2008.  That wider guarantee scheme provides a State guarantee for all deposits and certain liabilities of the guaranteed institutions to the extent these are not covered by existing deposit protection schemes in the State or any other jurisdiction.  In short, depositors must first claim from the deposit guarantee scheme and then move on to claim any balance from the credit institutions financial support scheme.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, notwithstanding the wider scheme to safeguard the banking system, this reform must still be progressed in its own right, given the legal requirement for a compensation claim to be made first upon the deposit guarantee scheme.  It is also important to emphasise that, whereas the credit institutions financial support scheme applies to the seven covered credit institutions, the deposit guarantee scheme applies to all credit institutions authorised in this State, and this now includes credit unions which did not previously benefit from statutory deposit protection.</P>
        <P>Before I describe in detail the provisions of this Bill, I will explain why there has been some delay in bringing forward this legislation to confirm the reforms announced last September.  The primary reason for that delay is that, just as we began to draft legislation to give effect to our own domestic reform, the EU Commission published its own proposal to amend the 1994 deposit guarantee schemes directive.  The main elements of the Commission&rsquo;s reforms were, as with our own proposed changes at that time, an increase in the ceiling on pay outs and the abolition of the co-insurance requirement option.  Other critical reforms announced by the EU in October related to the deadline within which compensation has to be made.  As our deposit protection arrangements were based on the original 1994 EU directive, it made sense to cover our own domestic changes and the EU&rsquo;s reforms in the one legislative package.</P>
        <P>The Government was of the view that its decision of 20 September 2008 on our own domestic changes to our deposit guarantee scheme provided a sufficient safeguard in the interim period.  However, once the EU directive was finalised and published on 11 March 2009, steps were taken to finalise drafting of the necessary legislative amendments and to get the Bill published as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I will now describe the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations prescribing the amount of compensation payable to a person maintaining deposits with a credit institution.  Its purpose is to give effect both to our own protection ceiling increase and to the recent EU amending directive on deposit guarantee schemes.  It provides the power, however, to prescribe a higher level of coverage up until 31 December 2010 than that set out in the directive <i>- </i>the directive requires countries to increase coverage to &euro;50,000 immediately, with a further increase to &euro;100,000 from 31 December 2010.</P>
        <P>Section 3 confirms the establishment of the deposit protection account in the CBFSAI, and was already catered for by Regulation 4 of the existing regulations.  However, this is an example of a provision which is being incorporated into the Bill to ensure that it is safe from any legal challenge.  Section 4<b> </b>empowers the Minister for Finance to prescribe by regulations the amount of the deposit which a credit institution shall lodge to the deposit protection account in respect of its participation in the scheme.  It also enables the variation by order of the amount payable by a credit institution or credit institutions or a class or classes of credit institution.  The current <Col N="185"/>level of contribution is set at 0.2% of a prescribed deposit base.  It is not proposed to change that figure at this time, having regard to the significant charges already being levied on credit institutions participating in the separate, wider bank guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 and 6<b> </b>deal with annual recalculation of the amount of deposit and charges on the deposit protection account respectively.  They are being transferred from the existing regulations in order to strengthen the scheme.</P>
        <P>Section 7 permits the payment of aggregate contributions on behalf of a group or groups of credit unions, and is being incorporated to facilitate the existing structure of the movement, and the administration of the scheme itself by the Central Bank, as it will facilitate a bulk payment in lieu of a plethora of small payments by individual credit unions.</P>
        <P>Section 8<b> </b>is being introduced to cater for a situation where, in the event of the insolvency of a credit institution and the funds available in the deposit protection account which funds the DOS not being sufficient to meet the required payout, the Central Bank might cover the shortfall with its own resources on a temporary basis.  However, as ECB rules prohibit such monetary financing other than on a short-term and urgent basis, this section provides that the Exchequer will recoup the Central Bank for any outlay within three months.  In turn, the remaining credit institutions would, over time, as the deposit protection account is replenished, repay the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Section 9 deals with offences and penalties and is currently set out in regulation 27 of<?oasys _jy ?>S.I. No. 168 of 1995, but is being switched into primary legislation so as to give it greater legal certainty.  The text of the provision is also being updated.</P>
        <P>Section 10 is a standard provision about the laying of regulations before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 11,<b> </b>Amendments to Central Bank Act 1942, signposts some technical changes listed in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 12,<b> </b>as well as setting out the Short Title, provides that section 4 of the Bill, namely, the amount to be maintained in the deposit protection account in so far as it applies to credit unions, shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Finance may appoint by order.</P>
        <P>Clearly, it will be necessary, after the passage of this legislation and the follow-on statutory instrument, to have further discussions with the credit union movement for its admission into the scheme from an administrative perspective.  Lest there be doubt in anybody&rsquo;s mind, credit union savers now are and will continue to be covered up to the &euro;100,000 compensation limit which the Government announced last September.</P>
        <P>Once again, I emphasise the importance of having this Bill enacted in sufficient time to enable the follow-on statutory instrument under the provisions of this legislation to be made.  Those regulations, in turn, must be commenced in law by 30 June to meet the EU&rsquo;s deadline for the transposition of its amending directive.  The co-operation of Senators across the floor in helping to meet this deadline is fully acknowledged and is greatly appreciated.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  Long before this country was engulfed in its unique tsunami, concern was raised on both sides of the Houses of the Oireachtas about the need to update our national deposit protection scheme.  As the Minister of State pointed out, the figure of &euro;20,000 provided for in that scheme was hopelessly out of date as both the number and the value of deposits had increased significantly since the guarantee limit was established over ten years ago.  For that reason, the update of the scheme provided for in this Bill was going to take place at some point, but last September we were faced with the imminent collapse of our banking system and a much more urgent intervention <Col N="186"/>was required.  Although we on this side of the House support the general thrust of this Bill and what it sets out to achieve, we must recognise also that it heaps another significant burden of responsibility on the hard-pressed taxpayers of this country.</P>
        <P>The relationship between our taxpayers and our banking system is changing on an almost daily basis.  To date, all the traffic seems to have been one way.  We continue to pay up and the banks continue to refuse to pay out to struggling Irish businesses and mortgage holders.  In a recent article outlining the banking crisis in the United States, Paul Krugman stated that what we have now in our global banking system is no longer private enterprise but is what he terms &ldquo;lemon socialism&rdquo;, in which banks get all the upside but taxpayers bear all the risks.</P>
        <P>In Ireland we have a particularly bitter brand of lemon socialism.  Intervention after intervention has taken place and the workers of this country have been asked &mdash; I argue the correct word is instructed, or commanded &mdash; to dig deep into their pockets to bail out a sector that has spent the past five years shamelessly immersed in the most criminal and costly gamble this country has ever witnessed.  The same taxpayers must continue to dig deep for many years to come.  Although the Government guarantee, put in place on 30 September 2008, is due to expire in September 2010, the guarantee scheme which is the subject of the Bill is permanent and entirely open-ended.</P>
        <P>Any Member of the House who campaigned during the recent elections must agree that our people are angry and utterly disillusioned.  That was very obvious to me when I spoke to people during the campaign.  They now realise that for a number of years a very small, privileged and totally self-interested group of people succeeded in running our country into the ground.  The activities of these people were inadequately policed because those required to do the policing often moved within the same social circles and in some cases were often former colleagues of those who were gambling away our money.  The alleged response from one such guardian of our financial system, when informed that a bank was about to engage in what they euphemistically described as &ldquo;balance sheet management&rdquo; was to say, simply, &ldquo;Fair play to you, Willie&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Nine months after the September guarantee, when our public should be witnessing sweeping reforms of our banking and regulatory systems and when our taxpayers should see those who perpetrated this disaster being brought to justice, we are presented instead with a completely different vista.  There is little or no sweeping reform of our banking system and no real punishment meted out to those who got us into this mess.  Indeed, a number of them rode off happily into the sunset with their golden handshakes intact.</P>
        <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, that our people are disillusioned?  Most of our taxpayers are more than willing to fulfil their patriotic duty in ensuring our banking system does not go under but they are being asked to do so in a very real information vacuum.  How much more will they be asked to stump up?  Does anybody know?  Does the Minister for Finance know?  Does anybody know the true cost of our September guarantee?  What is the total value of all the deposits guaranteed by this legislation?  Do we know that figure?</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is another very worrying aspect to both this guarantee and that initiated last September, namely, the licence it might give to our less scrupulous bankers to continue the sort of risk taking that got us where we are today.  The people who engaged in such risk taking in the past did so in the full knowledge that if matters went badly wrong we would be there to bail them out, and they were right &mdash; we have done so.  To prevent such reckless risk taking taking place in the future, guarantees of this nature should be accompanied by stringent and effective regulation of our banking system.  I am not so sure we are yet at a point where we have such regulation.  </P><Col N="187"/><P Just="Left">Even though our credit unions were already covered under the September scheme, I welcome their inclusion in this guarantee.  It is only fair there should be equity across all depositors and the equity this legislation brings removes any fear the public might have about inadequate deposit protection in particular types of financial institutions.</P>
        <P>When we discussed NAMA in this House, I asked the following question and I believe I should continue to ask it until such time as we get a satisfactory response.  Why must all the traffic be one way?  Why can the taxpayer not see any real benefit for his or her investment?  For example, why can Irish banks not allow all borrowers on fixed interest rates the option of moving to a variable rate with little or no penalty, or perhaps the option of having the penalty spread out over the lifetime of the mortgage?  I asked this question of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, the last time he was in the House and in his response he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">People entered these arrangements.  There were pros and cons to the arrangements at the time and it is not possible for the Government to convert them however desirable that might be from a social and environmental point of view.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am grateful the Minister of State admits that such a move would be desirable from a social point of view.  However, neither he nor the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, see fit to move in that direction.  Therefore, the people who entered into these arrangements are to be asked to take their punishment on the chin, stoically, while those who got us into the current mess seem to get away scot free.</P>
        <P>Only a few days after the Minister of State made that statement in this House, his colleague and member of Cabinet, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, issued a press statement stating that the problems facing mortgage holders who were locked into a fixed rate were &ldquo;undoubtedly an issue that should be addressed&rdquo;.  The headline over the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> was: &ldquo;Hanafin wants action on mortgage penalties&rdquo;.  That is exactly what fixed-rate mortgages have become &mdash; punitive and totally unjustified penalties on an already over-burdened Irish public.  Is it too much to ask for one small gesture of appreciation for the taxpayer?  Is the Minister even concerned enough about the plight of people on fixed mortgages to seek to establish what the likely cost of this intervention might be?  I suspect it would represent only a tiny fraction of our recent investment in our banking system.  Is it possible some traffic might head in the opposite direction or is the one-way street here to stay?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am glad of the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  By way of rebuttal, as someone who was involved in the recent election and who did many a doorstep canvass I too experienced the palpable anger of people that the world economy is in the situation it is in.  I share that anger and am frustrated by the difficulties that have come to bear.  There is no question there was an over-reliance here on a tax base that came from a property boom.  We were all a party to that.  While some people say we told you this or that, I would say a stopped clock is right twice a day.  We still face these difficulties.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The fatal flaw of a single currency is that a country does not control its own fiscal policy and cannot adjust interest rates when it wants.  The time we had 2% interest rates and 8% growth led to an overheating of the economy with which it was difficult to cope.  If I remember correctly, the Opposition was critical at the time and wanted us to pay more to teachers, to spend more on public and capital sector expenditure and to spend in various other sectors.  There was lobbying from all sides of the House to have stamp duty reduced, when we should have used that tool and increased stamp duty to begin to cool things off.  However, we are where we are &mdash; in a difficult situation.</P>
        <P>I regret we are in this difficult situation, but we are and must take the appropriate steps to get out of it.  I am pleased the Minister for Finance and his colleagues have taken some decisive <Col N="188"/>action since last September, with the guarantee scheme, the part-capitalisation of some of the banks, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of NAMA, which is at an advanced stage.  It is not proposed to let people get away scot free for any crimes they have perpetrated on the people, taxpayers included.  However, there must be due process.  I too would love my pound of flesh and to set up the guillotine in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green where we could line them up.  However, in the real world that does not and should not happen.  This is not Iran; this is the Republic of Ireland and we have laws.</P>
        <P>There are three separate investigations going on into Anglo Irish Bank and we will await their outcome.  If it is found that people have broken the law, they will receive the full rigours of the law and whatever punishment our laws prescribe.  That is what will happen.  Therefore, this is not a case of looking after those who got us into the mess or anything like that, but about ensuring we provide the leadership and thoughtfulness to get us out of it, as best we can.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to NAMA, we have much more information on the proposal following the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which was attended by Dr. Peter Bacon and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, who told us how they intend to go about it.  NAMA will deal with the issue over a long period.  NAMA will not operate like the Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States, which in the savings and loans fiasco gathered all the assets as quickly as possible and sold them off for whatever price was available.  NAMA will be about working things out and will aim at achieving the maximum return for the people.  Perhaps in ten, 15 or more years down the line we will end up making a profit out of it.  Those are the facts.  I believe the principle behind NAMA will be replicated throughout the eurozone in various ways &mdash; the principle of pooling all of the difficult debt, paying for it through government bonds redeemable against the European Investment Bank for capitalisation of the banks.  I agree with that and think it is a good approach.</P>
        <P>There is no question that the regulation system in this country has failed us over recent years.  As the Senator said, the light touch approach carried out by many people who had worked in the same industry and done the same jobs was not healthy and did not serve us well.  It did not serve any country well.  What we need are agreed global principles to try and deal with the financial services industry.  Yesterday, we saw President Obama came forward with a rewriting of the entire regulation system of the United States.  We need to make improvements here.  That is being done and that work will continue with the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the welcome step taken by the Minister in September to guarantee small deposits.  It is particularly welcome because it deals with the concerns of consumers about their bank savings.  The guarantee is one of the many decisive steps taken by the Government to ensure we have a stable banking system.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, said, the Bill will give legislative effect to the amendments to the Irish deposit guarantee scheme announced by the Government on 20 September 2008.  The reason for the delay in the Bill was that the European Commission issued a discussion document on updating the EU directive on deposit guarantee schemes.  The European Council and Parliament passed Directive 2009/14/EC and the changes made in the new directive are incorporated in the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Bill 2009 and its associated regulations.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mansergh mentioned there are two parts to the Bill and has explained them.  I will not delay the House by going into the specifics of it.  Senator Cannon said Fine Gael broadly welcomes the Bill.  I know Fine Gael has highlighted the changing shift in the relationship as between the taxpayer and the banking system for which we must cater, which I believe is being and will continue to be done.  The Labour Party also welcomed the Bill in the D&aacute;il, but commented that our regulation system was not up to scratch in recent years.  I mentioned my views in that regard.</P><Col N="189"/>
        <P>I welcome this legislation as a further step along what will be a long and difficult road to economic recovery for the nation.  We hope indeed that this is a step towards global recovery, which is out of our jurisdiction.  On the Order of Business today, Senator Paschal Donohoe mentioned that tough budgets lie ahead, and I agree.  Painful steps must be taken by all.  That is highly regrettable but is due to the unsustainable system we had, even though many on all sides thought it might last and thought we might only have an easing-off in the property market.  We did not and I regret that.  I wish matters were different, but they are not.  Therefore, we need to take appropriate steps.  We are doing that and I have confidence in the Minister and Minister of State and their colleagues that this will continue to be done.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is important legislation.  The last time I had an opportunity to debate matters of this nature with him, I raised the issue of the accountability of banks.  Given the fundamental change in the relationship between taxpayers and banks, what are we going to do to ensure banks are held accountable for the guarantees and support that will now be afforded to them by the taxpayer?  I also asked whether our banking system had reached a point where no bank was ever too big to fail.  The Minister poured scorn on my comment and said that was an unfeasible or utopian situation.</P>
        <P>I note with interest what Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, said earlier this week.  He made some points that are very relevant to this discussion.  In his speech at the Mansion House &mdash;  with Alastair Darling, Chancellor of the Exchequer beside him &mdash; he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then in the words of a distinguished American economist, &ldquo;they are too big&rdquo;.  It is not sensible to allow high street retail banking with risky investment banking or funding strategies, and then provide an implicit state guarantee against failure.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He went on to say that those guarantees to retail depositors should be limited to banks that make a narrower range of investments and that banks which pose greater risk to taxpayers and the economy in the event of failure should face higher capital requirements.  He concluded with a comment about the role of the Bank of England and said:</P>
        <P LI="1">To achieve financial stability, the powers of the bank are limited to those of voice and the new resolution powers.  The Bank finds itself in a position rather like that of a church whose congregations attend weddings and burials, but ignore the sermons in between.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If the Governor of the Bank of England made such points about how banks will be regulated in the future and we are having a discussion today about the deposit guarantee scheme we will extend to the banks, this raises questions to which I would like to hear a response.  An OECD report published in 2008 on deposit guarantee schemes acknowledged that such schemes play a vital role in ensuring the banking system functions properly and serves the broader economy.  It also noted, however, that guarantee schemes do not address the root cause of the crisis in the banking system.  Of even greater concern than the lack of consumer confidence in the system is the lack of confidence banks have in each other.  It was this loss of confidence that caused the liquidity crisis at the end of last year, the consequences and cost of which have become clear to us all.</P>
        <P>While the Fine Gael Party supports the legislation in principle, it raises a number of questions which I propose to ask the Minister of State.  The Bill will have important consequences for taxpayers and the country, providing as it does for a guarantee of deposits of up to &euro;100,000.  Will the deposit guarantee scheme encourage banks to engage in further irresponsible behaviour which is not in the interests of the broader economy?  While this question may appear <Col N="190"/>absurd in the current circumstances, if we have learned anything from the banking crisis, it is that the unthinkable is plausible and banks engaged in behaviour we hoped would not occur.  What will the Government do if a bank uses its deposit base, which the State has guaranteed, to indulge in the type of behaviour that got us into the current unholy mess?</P>
        <P>The legislation states that responsibility for the deposit guarantee scheme will reside with the Central Bank.  This gives us an early glimpse into the type of new regulatory system the Government proposes to establish.  Making the Central Bank as opposed to the other institutions involved in financial regulation responsible for the operation of the scheme is a noticeable departure from the current position.  Will the Minister of State outline Government thinking on what type of regulatory system will emerge from the ashes?  Who will have responsibility for ensuring there is no repeat of the systemic crisis in which we find ourselves?</P>
        <P>It has become clear from recent events that the design of the institutions involved in financial regulation, in other words, the responsibilities devolved to them, the overlap in such responsibilities and the lack of co-ordination among these institutions, created a gap or hole which allowed risky behaviour to emerge.  We are now dealing with the consequences of the problem.  How will our banks be regulated in future and which institutions will be responsible for their regulation?</P>
        <P>To take the nightmare scenario, if, despite this legislation, a future Government is forced to respond to a run on a bank by implementing the terms of the scheme and raising money to support depositors in danger of losing their deposits, where would the money be found?  Would more responsible banks participating in the scheme be asked to stump up money to cover the cost of risky behaviour by another bank?  Alternatively, would the European Central Bank provide this money, as it does at present, by injecting liquidity into the economy in exchange for Irish Government bonds?  While it may appear slightly pointless to ask such a question given how unlikely this scenario appears, we must, as I stated, assume the unthinkable is possible.  The position in which we find ourselves was considered unthinkable in the past.  If the questions I ask were raised several years ago when earlier legislation was being introduced, we may not have found ourselves facing our current problems.</P>
        <P>This has been a busy week for banking regulation.  It has also been a disappointing week in that the major players, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, have chosen to focus their efforts on different areas.  The US has focused on banking regulation and consumer protection while the EU has focused on hedge funds.  The UK, on the other hand, has started to fight a strong rearguard action against the EU proposals, arguing that they are too heavy-handed.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Darling, has chosen instead to focus on corporate governance as a solution to the current problems.  His approach is in marked contrast to some of the solutions proposed by the Governor of the Bank of England.</P>
        <P>Only months ago, politicians all over the world argued they would never allow the problems in the financial sector to be repeated.  In seeking to prevent such a scenario they have, however, produced different plans.  This is important because it could result in what is known as regulatory arbitrage where different banks move to countries or areas where the regulatory environment suits their particular needs.  It would be a great pity if we do not have a global response to the global crisis that has engulfed us.  While this matter is clearly not addressed in the Bill, it is vital nonetheless that action is taken to address the consequences of the recent crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Bill 2009 which complements important legislation enacted some time ago, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  The Government&rsquo;s speedy intervention in introducing the latter Bill late last year may have saved the entire Irish banking system and prevented a major run <Col N="191"/>on the banks.  A collapse of the banking system would have caused much greater economic problems than those we are currently experiencing. </P>
        <P>While banks are not supporting small businesses, the lifeblood of the economy, the relative strength of our banking system has been achieved as a result of heavy investment provided by taxpayers through the Government.  We must ensure the banking system considers the interests of the taxpayers who support it.  Many people with fixed interest mortgages are concerned about unreasonable conditions being imposed by the banks on those seeking to switch to a variable interest rate.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue.  In light of the use of taxpayers&rsquo; moneys to support the banks, it is important to have a social dimension to the banking system.</P>
        <P>The penalty for switching from a fixed rate to a variable rate mortgage should be reduced to a reasonable level.  Rather than having money change hands between banks and their customers, these penalties should be added to the mortgage.   This would have the effect of safeguarding people who are now on a fixed rate of 4.5% or 5% and who, assuming they are not able to break their fixed rate, may find themselves in difficulty in two or three years&rsquo; time when they move to the increased variable mortgage interest rate.  No doubt interest rates will go up because at present they are at an all-time low.  It would be in the interests of the banks and the Government to ensure such people were able to fix at lower rates so that they would have less trouble in years to come when homes could be repossessed because of very high interest rates.  I ask the Minister of State to look at options in that regard.</P>
        <P>While many say the Government is bailing out the banks, we have decided consciously to make an investment in the banks.  Let it not be forgotten that there is a payback to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  We must bear in mind that this is an investment.  In the long term, it will be a good investment and a much better one than those made overseas by pensions funds in the past year or two which lost between 45% and 52%.  We are better off investing at home where we get a reasonable return on our money and the banking system is a good place to invest our money.</P>
        <P>At present there is a major liquidity problem between the banks and small businesses.  Conditions should be laid down in return for our investment in the banks.  The latter must look at how they will provide liquidity to small businesses.  Restocking is a major problem being encountered by small business people who come to my clinics.  There was never a problem before when they went to the banks seeking to restock or upgrade certain parts of their businesses, but they are finding it very difficult now.  It is often the difference between letting some of the staff go or closing the business.  That is how seriously small businesses are being affected.  The Government should have leverage with the banks at this stage.  I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure this is seen to soon because it is affecting small businesses.</P>
        <P>I can understand that banks will have more leeway once the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is set up and non-performing debts are taken from them.  The purpose of NAMA is to ensure there is a lending system in banks and to look after the long-term non-performing debts over ten to 15 years.  NAMA will be important and it will help the banks return to normal lending.  I note that more than &euro;55 billion of the &euro;90 billion considered to be bad debt is performing very well and interest is being paid on it weekly or monthly.  Even though it is approximately 2%, it will give NAMA working capital when it starts up.  While I do not suggest the Minister of State should rush the legislation &mdash; we must get it right &mdash; we should get NAMA up and running as soon as possible because it will help small businesses.</P>
        <P>Small businesses employ 440,000 people.  That is a significant number and we do not want to see any more people joining the dole queue.  By helping these small businesses we will keep them in business and in some cases they will expand.  There has to be a credit system that <Col N="192"/>works for the banks and for small businesses.  While I would not suggest the banks should lend to businesses that do not have the capacity to repay, it is unfair of banks not to look after small firms with a good track record of loan repayments over many years, especially when Government has invested so heavily in the banking sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>While it is perfectly reasonable for us to comment on the wider context of this Bill, including the Government&rsquo;s proposal on NAMA and the background to the development of this crisis, we must remind ourselves that this Bill deals with just one discrete element of what is described by the Government as a strategy for dealing with this crisis.  While one could query whether the Government&rsquo;s approach constitutes a strategy, it is in any event a sort of drip-feed strategy in terms of its revelation to us as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Obviously, the Bill is important and the Labour Party welcomes this deposit guarantee scheme, the extensions to it and the placing of it on a statutory footing.  The increase in the amounts capable of being guaranteed, the question of minimum time limits for payout and the inclusion for the first time of credit unions are all advances to be welcomed.  While I have questions on one or two of the details and will make some comment, it is important for us to be clear that this is just one discrete element of dealing with this overall crisis in the banks and financial institutions.</P>
        <P>I am always struck when I hear Senator MacSharry and others seek to have us either set aside or forget what occurred in the past in favour of looking to the future.  Looking to the future rather than the past is always a laudable objective and is what we all want to do because we want a bright future and to ensure it is brighter than it currently looks.  That said, in response to Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s remark that we are where we are, I have said previously, perhaps to the point of repetition because when speakers on the Government side repeat their points, it falls to us to make the same responses, that the Government, and the Senator&rsquo;s party in particular, cannot seek to offload the substantial responsibility it holds for our being where we are.  I am bound to suggest to Senator MacSharry, the Minister of State and others that it is not a question of us being where we are as if we had suddenly been carried here on a wave in a manner which suggested we had no influence on where we were going.  Clearly, we did and to suggest otherwise can only be to suggest that governments have no influence or power to intervene or regulate, which of course cannot be the case.</P>
        <P>I understand people arguing for and pointing to the need for more rigorous and robust regulation.  Regulation of financial institutions and of the banking system is not a new concept.  It has been around for many decades.  It is simply absurd to seek to persuade people that now we will be good, now we will wake up to the need for regulation and now we will have all these measures, constraints etc. when it has been at the heart of the proper and prudent management of the banking and financial system worldwide, and certainly since the 1940s, that there should be strong and robust government regulation of banks and financial institutions.  It is not good enough for Senator MacSharry or anyone else to say that everyone participated in a great party for ten years.  It is part of the rhetorical attempt to spread the blame around by saying we all got something out of it, we were all involved and we all had a great time.</P>
        <P>The lives of individual citizens and families do not work that way.  People make economic decisions.  People in a household or a family who sought to take out a mortgage, or a young couple who wanted to buy a house, were presented with the possibility of a 100% mortgage and in some cases higher than that.  They availed of the opportunity presented to them, an opportunity which was sometimes pressed in their face and often included not just a 100% mortgage but also a car.  People are rational decision makers in terms of the information available to them.  It is not acceptable for us, as part of our so-called analysis, to say people who <Col N="193"/>made those decisions, which now look as if they were not good decisions, were somehow part of the problem.</P>
        <P>The economic and financial systems, including the availability of mortgages, needs to be regulated from the top.  We have a Central Bank and a Financial Regulator, which supposedly backs that up.  The Government cannot simply stand back and state it has an institution in place to deal with the situation.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, asked a perfectly good question in the other House yesterday on regulation in the future.  He asked who will guard the guardians?  He posed it as a perfectly legitimate question for the future and asked what kind of accountability the regulatory system will have to the Oireachtas or the Government.  It is a reasonable question, but it is not new.  That is the problem I have with the Government, namely, the suggestion that we will now look at the measures we will put in place to ensure we guard the guardians.  The notion that the situation is new or we need to invent something new is not correct.  I accept the system must be reformed and made more robust, but people should not be fooled or persuaded that this problem has only recently emerged and must be dealt with.  It should have been dealt with all along  and faced up to throughout the so-called splurge.</P>
        <P>I apologise I did not have an opportunity to hear the Minister of State speak in this House.  I had an opportunity to examine what the Minister for Finance said in the other House and he made some interesting points on regulation and the persons charged with it in the past.  We know there have been some personnel changes, resignations and retirements in that regard.  The Minister emphasised the question of who the persons were rather than the regulatory measures themselves.  He emphasised the importance of ensuring the correct people are in place, and I agree with him on that.  Where was that approach, policy and viewpoint when certain persons were appointed to the positions in question?</P>
        <P>There was a less than oblique reference to a problem by the Minister in his speech to the other House.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The far more important issue is that of the personnel who staff the entities because it is decidedly a question of men and women rather than measures.  We must ensure that whoever takes over the position of regulator is a person who can ensure the regulatory system will be robust and can command confidence in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That was a requirement of the Government at the time it appointed the persons previously appointed to such positions.  It has not now become a requirement that the State should ensure the correct people are put in place, as the Minister now appears, from that comment, to believe.  I invite the Minister to comment on whether my interpretation of those remarks is unfair in some way because that is what it appears to mean to me.</P>
        <P>I understand proposals on regulation will be outlined this week by the Government.  Will the Minister of State enlighten us on that?  I understood from the remarks of the Minister for Finance that he would make an announcement later this week on new proposals and measures regarding regulation.</P>
        <P>The Government, particularly the Fianna F&aacute;il Members, become very exercised when the point is made by people on this side of the House that we are told Anglo Irish Bank is of systemic importance.  This may not be the time to do so but I would like closer scrutiny of the word &ldquo;systemic&rdquo;.  I understand what the word means and we do not need to have it explained to us, but how or in what manner is Anglo Irish Bank believed to be a bank of systemic importance?  We need detailed information.  An answer that says, &ldquo;It is pretty clear&rdquo; is not an answer.  I want demonstrated to the Oireachtas and the Irish people how and in what manner it is a systemic bank, through more detailed information.  If one looks at the often-quoted <Col N="194"/>example of Sweden in the 1990s, one interesting thing that happened was that the Government, instead of going straight to the floor of Parliament with all its proposals, which is what happens here, went to the Opposition parties first and sought, as far as it could, their agreement on the measures it proposed to take and then brought the proposals to the floor of the Parliament.</P>
        <P>That has never happened at any stage in the discussions or crucially important debates we have had in these Houses in the past seven or eight months.  There have been meetings with Opposition spokespersons but there have been no meetings of a satisfactory nature where real and detailed information is imparted to them.  There should be clarity on what the Government is aware of regarding the exposure of the State to Anglo Irish Banks and the guarantee extended to the covered institutions, and what it believes the exposure and liabilities are.</P>
        <P>There are sensitivities and confidentiality provisions, but the Government could impart far more information to the Oireachtas and the public about what is going on, which could make for a far more helpful public debate.  It could assist in what Members opposite often look for, that is, a greater level of bipartisanship across the board on such a fundamental issue, namely, the future of the country and the banking system.</P>
        <P>One cannot expect people to agree to proposals of which they are not aware.  One cannot expect Opposition parties to simply nod through proposals of significant importance and seriousness if information is not shared with parties, politicians and representatives in advance.  Senator Boyle referred to a wider level of political co-operation on these issues in the past.  However, co-operation can only occur among serious politicians if information and clarity is made available to people whose agreement and support the Government is seeking.</P>
        <P>The Bill and the extension of the deposit guarantee scheme are appropriate.  It is appropriate to put it on a statutory footing.  It is welcome that credit unions are included in the measure.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and research service, which is very helpful in providing information on our discussions, particularly the more complicated ones, for putting together a digest.  I note from reading it a comment by former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, in 1989 when the scheme we are discussing was first set up under the Central Bank Act.  He queried whether it was appropriate or right that there should be the same level of risk across the board.  Each of the institutions must pay 0.2% of deposits towards this level of protection.  I wonder if what he suggested in 1989, some 20 years ago, might still be case. I am thinking in this regard of a comparison between the position of credit unions and banks.  Credit unions are required to pay the same amount as the banks.  Is it appropriate or fair that credit unions have to pay that level of cover and are some of the banks being asked to pay a sufficient amount for it?</P>
        <P>The point former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, was making was whether people could forum-shop or consider placing their money in more risky institutions, thus gaining higher returns from their deposits and investments, in the knowledge they would still have this protection at the end of the day.  Surely there should be some risk spreading in relation to the different types of institutions that are availing of the cover.  The Minister of State might consider this question if he has the opportunity.</P>
        <P>The broad thrust of this measure is to be welcomed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Alex White asked, in respect of Anglo Irish Bank and the option taken by Government in September-October last year, whether that institution was of systemic importance to the Irish economy.  Taken on the level of whether it was run competently and whether those involved in it were offering a useful service to its customers and the State, it would be difficult to argue that.  It has been an institution with a deposit base greater than the annual spend of this country in terms of its current expenditure.  In terms of its overall asset <Col N="195"/>base, had a run occurred on its accounts this would have had a significant impact on this economy.  There was already the lesson, such as it was, of the effect of Lehman Brothers in the United States.  Given the need to make quick and decisive decisions I believe the right decision was made.</P>
        <P>It is often forgotten that in addressing the deposit guarantee put in place then, and that which we are enhancing through this legislation, that a deposit guarantee already existed.  If even that had been exercised in September-October of last year, the cost to the Irish taxpayer would be already many times the amount expended trying to resuscitate and retrieve Anglo Irish Bank in its current incarnation.</P>
        <P>That said, I hold no brief for the individuals who ran that institution into the ground and is now represented as something tawdry in the commercial and financial life of this country.  I find inexplicable and continue to seek explanations as to why it is the case that an individual, a former chairman and CEO of that institution, continues to receive pension payments from an institution that is now State owned.  If we cannot address that question now, it will need to be addressed either by way of ministerial action or through other legislation.  I am not prejudging any decisions that will be made by other agencies or individuals.  Given that this institution was run into the ground and was seen to benefit such a small coterie of individuals, I cannot accept that the payments being made to such individuals can ever be acceptable.  Decisions need to be made in this regard and need to be made quickly to ensure public confidence in the future of our financial system.</P>
        <P>The Bill is welcome in that it is another progressive step in terms of our moving away from the events of September-October 2008 in respect of which Government decisions had to be necessarily reactive, decisive and quick.  We are now getting a better understanding of the scale of the problem and the degree to which the problem exists in particular financial institutions.  There is no doubt that we continue to face a huge problem in terms of trying to resuscitate our financial institutions.  Proper acts of due diligence have been done in relation to our two largest financial institutions and others are ongoing in regard to some of the smaller ones.  In terms of ensuring public confidence here and internationally in our financial institutions, it is important this legislation is enacted thereby ensuring the commercial health and financial stability of these institutions can be achieved in the quickest possible time.  That said, this is only another step in the process.  Further questions need to be asked about the organisation of financial institutions in this country.</P>
        <P>A welcome aspect of this Bill, subsequent to a promise made by the Minister for Finance, is its inclusion of credit unions and the question of social finance.  While deposits in credit unions are not as large as deposits held in most financial institutions, and are possibly not as great a risk, they are the type of deposits that might have a particular impact on local communities and individuals in such communities.  It is right and proper that such a guarantee be given.  The legislation is vague in terms of how the guarantee can and should apply to credit unions.  I am hopeful that the regulations, when released by the Minister for Finance, will clear up that ambiguity.  I believe particular treatment should be given to credit unions and I acknowledge the point made by Senator Alex White in this regard.</P>
        <P>Another aspect that needs to be addressed, in terms of the type and number of institutions we have, is the question of mutuality in our remaining financial institutions.  We have two mutual societies, the Educational Building Society and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I have been extremely critical of the activities of those involved in Anglo Irish Bank and I believe what we are learning on a daily basis in terms of what went on at Irish Nationwide Building Society, while not in terms of scale, are also beyond belief.  The extent to which the State must pick up the pieces for the activities of that particular organisation is something the people will <Col N="196"/>find hard to justify.  I suspect, in looking at the future of these institutions, given that Anglo Irish Bank has been nationalised and that Irish Nationwide Building Society is probably the most weakened of the remaining five institutions, that this is an issue the Government will need to address quickly.  I again accept the point made by Senator White that this is an issue that needs to be addressed with the widest degree of consultation and co-operation within the political system given we are talking about our financial systems and public confidence in it.</P>
        <P>We need to know the health and viability of our two main banks and what is happening in regard to mutual societies and social finance, micro-financing and community finance through the credit union movement.  This Bill is helpful in our taking another step in that regard but it is only another step in what will be a long and difficult process in which all within the political system need to be engaged.  This is not an issue that will be easily resolved.  However, I am confident that the right decisions have been and are being taken and that they will eventually be viewed as the right decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and thank him for his attendance.  He has always been one the better performers from the Seanad&rsquo;s point of view.  He also did great work when a Member of the Seanad.  I thank the Minister of State for his overview of the Bill, which we welcome.</P>
        <P>Some interesting questions have been posed by colleagues from all sides of the House.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the questions posed by my colleagues, Senators Cannon and Donohoe.  I welcome the main provision of the Bill which is to increase the deposit protection guarantee from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000.  We are all agreed the latter figure is outdated given the changes in values and so on.  The removal of the provision which requires that depositors must bear the first &euro;10,000 of any loss and the extension of this guarantee to all credit union depositors, is also welcome.  Credit unions are utilised by so many it is unbelievable we did not have in place this necessary protection, although I accept they had their own scheme in place.  Given self-regulation has been abolished it is only right and proper credit unions should be covered by the State guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>I welcome the transfer of responsibility over this area from the Financial Regulator to the Central Bank.  We have seen in the recent past that the regulator was not fit for purpose and performed disastrously.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us deals with a guarantee scheme for deposits but what about the ability of banks to raise finance through inter-bank lending?  Legislation provides for a guarantee in this regard until September 2010.  Given that bonds will be rolled over, it is important that the guarantee is extended.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the matter.  Banks could run around a short corner with bonds of up to &euro;5 billion coming up for renewal.  I am sure the Government intends to extend this guarantee beyond 2010 given the State&rsquo;s preference shareholding in Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Confidence is intangible but it is vital for our future that we nurture it.  The delay in producing legislation on NAMA has triggered profit taking in the markets, which is perhaps a natural reaction among investors.  According to the Minister for Finance, we will be more lenient than the UK on capital ratios.  Perhaps the State&rsquo;s preference shareholdings is intended to offset this leniency.  I understand the legislation for NAMA will be approved by the Cabinet on 23 June and published on 4 July, although we will not take it before the recess.  Given the urgency of the matter, surely it is preferable to deal with the legislation before we rise for the summer.  Any slippage would be unhelpful because we need certainty to build confidence.  We might not like the way in which the markets perform but we must recognise their effects on confidence.  NAMA is at present working in shadow form and is seeking to recruit people of the utmost <Col N="197"/>probity.  Major decisions will have to be made but I do not know how much can be set out in legislation regarding discounts on the book value of the properties taken over by the agency or valuations on the assets behind impaired loans.  I accept this matter is not relevant to the Bill before us but I would be grateful if the Minister of State could throw light on it.</P>
        <P>All Senators have heard stories about how the lack of credit and working capital is squeezing small businesses throughout the country.  These businesses are the lifeblood of financial institutions and the economy and I do not want to see them disappear.  I recently outlined for the Seanad a case involving a bank which reneged on a deal despite having a written undertaking from a solicitor.  We should not allow people to act in this manner.</P>
        <P>The correct decisions were made on Anglo Irish Bank and I recognise that an orderly write-down will be required.  The bank was badly run by a small number of people but I wish the Director of Corporate Enforcement well in his ongoing investigation.  I am saddened, however, by the cross-transactional nature of these events, particularly given that the Office of Corporate Enforcement lacks the power to investigate Nationwide Building Society.  I have proposed legislation in that regard which the Government might consider including in law.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Bill 2009 and thank the Minister of State for his continued support to this House.  </P>
        <P>The Government has been berated for failing to predict our current difficulties.  However, I recall the debates held in this House on what was called at the time the soft landing for the economy.  We knew the property market would slow down and we naturally made provisions on the basis of what was before us.  Up to 70,000 job losses were predicted in the building industry, many of which would involve people who could take up new opportunities in their home countries in eastern Europe.  The economy was powering along at an exceptionally high annual growth rate of 7% and it was believed that export led growth would allow for a very soft landing.  The pretensions by members of the Opposition that they knew what would happen to the world markets simply do not stand up to scrutiny.  During the 2007 general election campaign, every Opposition party called for substantially increased public spending.  If a downturn was coming it would have been impossible to substantially increase spending.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When the difficulties arrived, certain parties took a politically expedient view and made statements that were harmful to the economy.  I refer in particular to the Labour Party&rsquo;s finance spokesperson, who accused the Government of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank to save Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s developer friends.  That claim, which went around the world, is untrue.  The head of Anglo Irish Bank told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that no developer would be bailed out and that he had not experienced any political interference regarding the bail out of individual developers.   We are faced with a crisis, and how we deal with it is how we will be judged in the long term.</P>
        <P>I heard an interesting story on the radio recently about a Louisiana politician.  This person beat both the Democrats and the Republicans but only served one term.  A journalist with him was watching how this politician operated and found it was a very simple operation.  He basically told people, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tax you.  Don&rsquo;t tax me.  Tax the guy behind the tree.&rdquo;  That means we could agree with everyone and tax no one.</P>
        <P>Consistently in this House we have asked for a two-day debate in which every political party would produce an account of the way they would deal with the &euro;20 billion budget deficit and indicate the taxes they would increase and the cuts they would make.  They have been asked to have those figures audited independently.  That will never happen because the Opposition would like to pretend it need tax no one, increase public spending and let the Government take the blame for everything that happens.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>We are in difficult economic times, yet I am very hopeful.  This Government has taken the correct action.  It has not been palliative.  I know it is difficult to sugar-coat necessary cuts but this Government ensured, at a difficult time, that our banks are solid and secure.  We have been through much more difficult times.  I am conscious that we were able to repay our debts when debt levels were 130% of gross domestic product, inflation was 18%, unemployment was near 20%.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing to see our credit rating affected, especially by companies like Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s which gave fine credit ratings to sub-prime mortgages for Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs.  In the changes it might have changed its own name to &ldquo;poor standards&rdquo;, which might be more appropriate in the context.</P>
        <P>The deposit guarantee scheme is essentially an enabling measure which empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations to amend the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations 1995.  We have extended that statutory instrument already in place but it now gives the Minister the power to increase the amount to &euro;100,000 on deposit and to forgo the first 10%.  That guarantee is essential in ensuring we get stability in our finances.</P>
        <P>Yet again this morning there were calls, which there are consistently despite this question having been answered on many occasions, for people on fixed-rate mortgages to be released from them.  If cases can be found where super normal profits were made, I would agree with changes being introduced, but having worked in a financial institution for 17 years, I am aware that in many cases when a fixed-rate mortgage is given and set out in a tranche of mortgages, a fixed-rate deposit is guaranteed by the bank at the other side, and the bank makes the margin in the difference.  In other words, it guarantees to pay 3% for ten years if it is lending out a mortgage at 4% for ten years.  If the guarantee of the 4% to the bank is broken, one will also have to deal with the people who are receiving guarantee of 3%.  In other words, one is breaking the legal contract of the depositors.  Will the Opposition explain that to the depositors?  If they intend to break the fixed-rate mortgages, they believe the old Louisiana story: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tax you.  Don&rsquo;t tax me.  Tax the guy behind the tree.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Inevitably in a debate on a Bill such as this, which is relatively narrowly focused, as Senator White pointed out, it is easy to be invited to go down many highways and byways, and I will not entirely resist the temptation.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon asked if there was any estimate of the level of deposits guaranteed.  The answer is that there is a rough estimate by the Central Bank of the value of deposits covered by a deposit guarantee scheme where there is compensation at a rate of &euro;100,000.  Its estimate is based on the total value of deposits surveyed for the 11 institutions which were potentially eligible for the Government guarantee, approximately &euro;170 billion, and the bank indicates that these form the vast majority of the deposits covered by the deposit guarantee scheme.  It estimates that approximately 40%, or &euro;70 billion, of these deposits would be covered by the <Col N="199"/>deposit guarantee scheme.  On top of that we can add the &euro;12.4 billion of deposits held in credit unions thus giving an overall figure of approximately &euro;82 billion covered by the deposit guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon laid some emphasis on the burden on the taxpayer and made the point that the traffic was one way.  It is worth pointing out that most of the moneys deployed to support the banking system have been drawn from taxpayers&rsquo; money put aside in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, in other words, not taken out of this year&rsquo;s taxes.  Because the Government had the prudence to establish the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which has been done by very few other Governments, that has given us a means of addressing a crisis of this sort.  While the traffic may seem all one way at this stage, if things go according to plan further down the line a significant benefit could accrue to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>There is general frustration, which we all feel, that the wheels of justice turn slowly, but as the saying goes, they do grind exceedingly small.  I would have a firm expectation that we will see developments in due course if crimes and offences have been committed.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue raised on both sides of the House of fixed and variable rate mortgages, to which Senator Hanafin responded, when a bank enters into a fixed-rate mortgage agreement it takes out a swap agreement with the market to cover that liability.  Breaking that swap carries a cost which must be borne by the borrower.  The current situation is tough on a great many people but I do not see that a softening on that is a real option for the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry made a strong speech, but I pick him up on one word.  He referred to the fatal flaw of the single currency, but to use the word &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; implies we should not have gone into the single currency, which is not something to which I would subscribe in any way.  However, this requires a major adjustment in behaviour and expectations.  Last night I read a supplement from last week&rsquo;s edition of<i> The Economist</i> on the eurozone, which made the point, while not understating any of our difficulties, that Ireland was adjusting and adapting relatively rapidly.  While this might surprise us and we may have thought we lived in a more rigid and less adaptable framework, the degree of willingness and adaptation is a credit to all parties involved, and I am not talking about political parties.  I note that the staff of Senator Alex White&rsquo;s former employer, RTE, voted yesterday to accept pay cuts, which is one small illustration of this willingness.</P>
        <P>Senator Paschal Donohoe had a number of questions.  The Bill is not, nor was it presented in the speech as being, a complete answer to all possible problems.  It is one instrument among others, one part of the financial safety net, but it can be helpful in protecting an otherwise solvent institution from failure.</P>
        <P>The Senator also referred to the question of risky behaviour and queried whether this might encourage a revival of irresponsible risk-taking, if not in the short term then further down the line.  The Minister has the option of introducing a risk-based system if he deems it appropriate and, if introduced, this could act as a deterrent to banks engaging in risky behaviour.  I personally take the view that it will be some time before that sort of behaviour becomes a risk again but, equally, anybody who knows history knows that, with time and given the assumption that we get out of the current situation, confidence grows.  There is a certain cycle in human affairs and I suppose the idea that we will be able to prevent for all time risky behaviour by banks that cause financial problems is on the utopian side.</P>
        <P>I remember debates in this House on an issue in which the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, took a deep interest.  A few years ago the idea of regulation was to separate as far as possible the prudential functions of the Central Bank from the regulation designed to protect the consumer so that, while still under the one umbrella, the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority had a certain <Col N="200"/>arm&rsquo;s length relationship.  That has all had to be revisited in the restructuring of financial regulation in Ireland and the Minister for Finance has indicated that a Central Bank commission will be set up, for which details are still being worked out.  The Cabinet has not finalised its decisions on this reform yet but the changes will be significant.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of liquidity, which was raised by a number of Senators, particularly Senator Larry Butler, the National Assets Management Agency Bill will be very complex and will probably run to over 60 sections.  Hopefully, when the institution is fully operational, the commercial banks will be in a position to offer increased lending to small businesses.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan said that this legislation should be before the Houses before they rise for the summer recess.  The Taoiseach dealt with this matter yesterday on the Order of Business.  While he did not tie himself down absolutely in terms of timing, he did not think it would be ready for discussion before the recess and thought it more likely to involve a recall of the Houses in September.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Alex White, I am a sometime historian so I never have a problem in looking back.  While I would not spend my whole time looking back, I would strongly defend it and feel it is important to gain perspective, to learn lessons as to where things have gone wrong and sometimes to draw inspiration from options that were considered at a particular time, which was perhaps not right for them, but for which the time is now right.  I have no problem whatsoever in looking back as well as looking forward &mdash; I very often find looking back is a help to looking forward.</P>
        <P>As I said on another occasion, although I cannot remember in which House I said it, there is an interesting debate with regard to the influence of a government in a social market economy.  I made the comment that during the boom years, parties opposite in both Houses were disinclined to give too much credit to the Government and attributed the boom to many outside factors and other forces in society.  I would not in the least claim, and I did not claim then, that the Government was mainly or wholly responsible for the boom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues claimed it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>However, while it would be odd to say the Government deserves no credit for the boom, suddenly, when things go wrong, it would be equally odd to suggest it is entirely responsible for everything that has gone wrong.  Particularly as we are discussing banking credit and financial institutions, there is a huge global dimension in this which is absolutely undeniable.</P>
        <P>Last October at the IMF a senior US treasury official admitted that the decision on Lehman Brothers had triggered the global financial crisis.  The way in which that affected individual countries depended on their position and what decisions had been taken.  I admit freely that we are not the worst affected, but among the worst affected, a reasonably objective way of putting it.  The mantra was repeated, not only by the Labour Party but the newly elected Deputy for Dublin South, with whom Senator Alex White competed, that the country was awash with money until a year ago.  That was always the premise and it followed that, because the country was awash with money, the Government could afford to do A, B, C and D.  There was no real sense in most political debate that resources were constrained or that they should be used prudently.  We believed we were operating within a much greater margin of safety than <Col N="201"/>was the case.  There was either a surplus or we operated underneath a 1% deficit in government borrowing when the ceiling was 3%.  This is not only our experience.  I suspect the list of countries still adhering to the Maastricht criteria for government deficit is rather short.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s compliment of the Leinster House research system.  I was a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission when a decision was made to expand the service considerably.  The Senator raised the question of whether Anglo Irish Bank was a systemic institution.  A principle underlying the Bill is that confidence in not necessarily rational-based.  It may be possible to put forward a rational argument that Anglo Irish Bank was not or should not have been systemic.  However, if confidence in the banking system was to collapse by letting it go to the wall, the rationality or otherwise would not really have mattered.  Much of the purpose of the Bill relates to credit institutions in which there may be non-rational loss of confidence and which remain solvent institutions.  Were such a loss to take place, a given bank could argue until it is blue in the face that it is solvent but it will not prevent a serious situation from arising.</P>
        <P>I dealt with the risk differential question and it is something the Minister for Finance may act upon if he sees the need.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to the pensions of former senior executives of Anglo Irish Bank.  Needless to say, this matter is not the subject of the legislation.  I presume the payments are being made on very strong legal advice, but the appropriate redress is to ensure whether people acted within the law through investigations and, if they did not do so, to take the appropriate action.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to credit unions, which are utilised by so many people.  They play a very important function in our economic life and are relevant for many people.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate in which all parties would put their cards on the table, including detailed plans of what they would do.  He expressed an equally realistic expectation that this would not necessarily take place.  To be fair, the roles of Government and Opposition are different.  A major part of the role of the Opposition is to play devil&rsquo;s advocate.  It is the existence of democratic opposition that distinguishes democratic government from any other form.  I recall when we were in opposition and the conditions applied as much then as they do now for the parties opposite.  Oppositions take up positions that they would not necessarily take up in government but simply because part of its job is to represent the other point of view.  In the case of a general election there would be an onus on parties, in their own self-interest and not because of any preaching from this side of the House, to set out in more detail their approach to problems.  There have been instances in which things were going so much in one direction that Opposition parties had to put very little on the table in that regard.  While general abstract statements have been made about taking tough decisions and cutting expenditure, in terms of detail the approach has been very soft-focus.  All the emphasis has been on positive suggestions on taxation and expenditure which would cost money in the context in which there is already a very significant &euro;20 billion gap, as Senator Hanafin remarked.  I expect the debate will intensify in the coming two or three years in one form or other.  I trust I have addressed as many questions as possible.  I thank Senators for their contributions and for their support for the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter yet again.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Finneran, for coming to the House to answer the matter.  He has responsibility for housing.  I do not know if that includes kennels.</P>
        <P>Last weekend, a three year old child was attacked by a Japanese akita. I do not raise this issue in the light of that attack but it is pertinent to what I will say.  I wish the child and her family well for her recovery.</P>
        <P>Animal welfare legislation has been promised for some time and I believe there has been consultation on it.  I am an animal lover and have always interacted well with various types of animals.  There must be strenuous implications for owners who do not look after their animals or treat them well.  There must also be an onus on owners to take responsibility for the actions of their pets.  I hope the promised legislation will be balanced between protecting animals from abuse and ensuring they behave safely.  I hope I do not seem to trivialise an important matter when I say the forthcoming legislation reminds me of the Children Act which obliges parents to be responsible for the actions of their children.</P>
        <P>Another Japanese akita had to be put down following an attack on a teenager in County Down and a court ordered the destruction of a Japanese akita which had bitten two people in Strabane in 2008.  An increasing number of people are acquiring dogs to stand out from the crowd.  Do they know the background of these breeds and the danger they pose?  The public must be informed about the characteristics of various breeds.</P>
        <P>The public must also be made aware of the legislation and regulations relating to dog ownership.  Legislation in the Republic of Ireland requires a Japanese akita to be kept on a short lead, muzzled and handled by a person over the age of 16.  That is not the case in Northern Ireland.  Legislation is being reviewed in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The same regulations should apply on both sides of the Border.  In Border areas, people from one jurisdiction often take their dogs for walks in the other.  For that reason, the same level of restraint should be required in both jurisdictions.</P><Col N="203"/>
        <P>In Denmark, a parliamentary majority was secured last week for the introduction of stricter measures for the estimated 20,000 dangerous dogs in Denmark.  In that country there is a move to ensure all dogs are kept on a leash in all public areas because an animal or human is attacked by a dog every two weeks in Denmark.  In 2007, Waterford County Council estimated that there were 169 dangerous dogs in the county.  There were two American pit bull terriers, two bulldogs, one bull mastiff, eight doberman pinschers, eight English bull terriers, 65 German shepherds, 11 Japanese akitas, three Rhodesian ridgebacks, 32 rottweilers and 37 Staffordshire bull terriers.  This increase in unusual breeds makes it important that we are aware of the characteristics of each breed and how it needs to be handled.  The County Waterford dog warden does considerable work in ensuring dogs are licensed and dog owners know how to look after them.</P>
        <P>People have a right to own dogs but ownership brings responsibility.  The same applies to ownership of all animals.  I hope we will see animal welfare legislation very soon and that it will strike a balance between rights and responsibilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this issue.  I share her concern on the matter of dangerous dogs and assure her the Government takes a very serious view of the risk posed to the public, and in particular to children, by these dogs.</P>
        <P>Section 19 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, as inserted by section 8 of the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Act 1992, provides that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may, by regulations, make provision for the use and control of dogs.  These regulations may make provision for the prohibition of the ownership, keeping, purchase, disposal, breeding or importation of specified classes of dogs which in the opinion of the Minister have such characteristics as to cause them to be a danger to the public.  Regulations were introduced in 1998 on the leashing, muzzling and control of 11 specific breeds of dog and every other strain or cross of those breeds.</P>
        <P>Article 5 of these regulations states that the article shall apply to every American pit bull terrier, bull mastiff, doberman pinscher, English bull terrier, German shepherd or alsatian, Japanese akita, Japanese tosa, Rhodesian ridgeback, rottweiler, Staffordshire bull terrier, every dog of the type commonly known as a ban dog or bandog, and every other strain or cross of every breed or type of dog described in the article.  The provisions are quite clear in respect of these dogs.  A person shall not permit a dog to which Article 5 applies to be in a public place unless it is securely muzzled and being led by a sufficiently strong chain or leash, not exceeding two metres in length, by a person over the age of 16 years who is capable of controlling the said dog.</P>
        <P>Section 22 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 enables the District Court, on complaint by any interested person that a dog is dangerous and not kept under proper control, to order that the dog be kept under proper control or be destroyed.  This applies to all dogs considered dangerous by the court, not just the breeds I listed.  The Act further provides that the owner of a dog is liable for damages caused in an attack on any person.  This is a matter for the courts and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any specific case.  However, I wish a speedy recovery to the child mentioned in media reports in the past few days.  Enforcement of existing legal requirements in respect of animal welfare and dog control has been recommended by many people and organisations promoting responsible animal ownership.  This is the best approach and I strongly encourage local authorities and dog owners to ensure compliance with legal requirements in the interests of public safety.</P>
        <P>With regard to dogs in general, my Department is preparing a Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill 2009<b>, </b>which is at an advanced stage and should be completed shortly.  The primary objective <Col N="204"/>of the Bill is to strengthen the control of dogs legal code so as to provide for the regulation of dog breeding establishments or puppy farms.  Regulations will be based on the majority recommendations made by the working group which was set up to review the management of dog breeding establishments and make suitable recommendations.  In tandem with this revision to the control of dogs legislation, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is preparing an Animal Health and Welfare Bill which will address animal welfare issues for all animals, including non-farm animals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  With regard to the enforcement of existing legal requirements in respect of animal welfare and dog control, I hope the forthcoming Bill will take account of the fact that an animal in a neighbouring household can be more than a nuisance, it can be a threat when it is not properly controlled.  It is difficult to enforce existing legal requirements because the dog must attack the child, leaving the child practically in hospital or dead, before the garda&iacute; can deem it a dangerous dog.  In drafting the legislation people should take into consideration how easy it is to enforce existing legal requirements.</P>

        <P>Baylin national school, Athlone, currently has 127 pupils.  In September 2009, the number will increase to 131.  Half of the pupils, 63, will be in junior and senior infants and first class.  The school building is 60 years old; it was built in 1949.  It is badly in need of an extension to cater for the growing number of students.  The extension the school has applied for will provide two new classrooms, a general purpose room, a utility storage area, a general office and a multipurpose room.  There is an urgent need for this extension.  The existing two classrooms are severely substandard in terms of size, measuring 36.6 sq. m.  This falls far short of the Department&rsquo;s guidelines.  It is impossible for a teacher to teach his or her class properly in so little space.</P>
        <P>As a result of the current budgetary constraints, class sizes are increasing.  It is enraging that the children in Baylin national school must spend their days in under-resourced and overcrowded classrooms.  The Department&rsquo;s guidelines state that schools with more than a certain number of children must have a general purpose room and proper toilet facilities.  Baylin national school does not have these facilities.  There is no general purpose room and no adequate indoor space for indoor activities.  Now more than ever there is a need for proper sporting and exercise facilities for school children, given their unhealthy lifestyles.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The state of our national schools is an appalling indictment.  In the past ten years, when there was so much money and growth in the country, it is a shame these basic and necessary facilities, which are recommended by the Department, were not provided at Baylin national school.  The guidelines provide that a school should have a multipurpose room of 20 sq. m.  The school does not have a multipurpose room for learning support, medical inspections, visiting psychologists, music lessons and so forth.  This means the learning support teacher must constantly move the classes for these vulnerable children to temporary places.  That is unacceptable.  It can have a severe impact on children who are already a little embarrassed and, perhaps, vulnerable because they have this little inadequacy.  There should be a secure, comfortable environment for them.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is probably more aware of the need for these facilities than I am.  The school does not even have an office.  I hope he can give me a favourable reply.  I wrote to the <Col N="205"/>Minister for Education and Science at the end of May seeking a meeting on this matter and he replied last week to the effect that he will contact me in due course.  Perhaps the Minister of State will shed light on when I or the school&rsquo;s representatives might be able to meet him.</P>

	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for<?oasys _jy ?>Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position with regard to an application to the Department of Education and Science from Baylin national school, Athlone, for large-scale capital funding.</P>
        <P>In April 2008, Baylin national school applied to the Department for an extension and refurbishment project comprising two classrooms, a general purpose room, a multipurpose room and storage facilities.  The school has a current staffing level of a principal and four mainstream teachers.  It also has the services of a resource teacher.  Its accommodation consists of four mainstream permanent classrooms, one prefabricated mainstream classroom and some ancillary accommodation.  The school&rsquo;s enrolment at 30 September 2008 was 127 pupils.  While enrolments at the school have increased modestly over the past five years, the school is not experiencing the rapid increase in enrolments that have occurred in other schools in the county.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department against published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the education partners.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of accommodation needed based on population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for pupil places.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under the prioritisation criteria already mentioned.  There are four band ratings in all, with band 1 being the highest and band 4 being the lowest.</P>
        <P>A band 1 project, for example, refers to the provision of schools where none currently exists but where there is a high demand for pupils places, while a band 4 project refers to the provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to them.  In other words, a building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it and as it is ready to proceed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The application from Baylin national school has been assigned a band 2.1 rating, reflecting the fact that the standard of its existing accommodation is such that it needs to be extended and refurbished.  The Senator will be aware that in February the Minister for Education and Science announced details of 43 major building projects to proceed to tender and construction and 25 high priority projects to commence architectural planning.  The project for Baylin was not included in this announcement and, therefore, it will not be proceeding in 2009.  The project will, however, be considered for the Department&rsquo;s 2010 capital programme.  The Senator will appreciate that the extent of the demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget is enormous, providing, as it does, accommodation for new communities, additional accommodation for the unprecedented number of extra teachers the Government has put into the system and the modernisation of existing schools.  However, great inroads have been made into addressing these needs and under the last national development plan 7,800 school building projects were delivered.</P>
        <P>The Senator will appreciate also it is not possible to advance all the projects needed at the same time.  The Minister wishes to assure her, however, that all school building projects, including that for Baylin national school, will be advanced incrementally through the system over time and as funding is available.  I thank the Senator again for allowing me the opportunity to <Col N="206"/>outline the Department&rsquo;s position on this matter.  I shall bring the points she raised to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Educate Together schools seem to have a template whereby their schools can be built very quickly.  Perhaps this might be highlighted.  As I know, and the Minister of State outlined, Baylin has a pre-fab which must be costly.  I wonder whether the cost of supplying the pre-fab might equal the cost of building the two new classrooms and the general purpose room.  One might consider how efficiently and quickly some schools can be built. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Some schools have taken the opportunity to provide an extra classroom instead of a pre-fab but the project for Baylin is larger than that, being a major capital project.</P>
