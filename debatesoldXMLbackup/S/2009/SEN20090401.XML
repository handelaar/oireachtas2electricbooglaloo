	<P>I have notice from Senator Mary White that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to reverse the decision to delay construction of the new ward block at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and to fulfil the promise of having the cystic fibrosis unit operational in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital by 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to implement the non-financial aspects of the national carers strategy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide the up to date position in relation to the construction of a new school for Summercove national school, Kinsale, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to contact her counterparts in the North and the Scottish Parliament to exchange ideas on how to curb the abuse of alcohol and its associated health and economic costs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the dermatology services at Mullingar hospital remain for the people of Longford-Westmeath.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to exempt fishermen who do not target cod, or who have caught less than 1.5% from the days at sea scheme, and to ensure that the polyvalent entitlement of these fishermen are safeguarded.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators White, Buttimer and O&rsquo;Donovan and they will be <Col N="856"/>taken at the conclusion of business.

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Adoption Bill 2009 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourned not later than 5.30 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 24, motion 37 regarding a new economic and recovery authority, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 but not later than 5.30 p.m., and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to explain the decision not to proceed, in the short term, with a unit for cystic fibrosis patients and with the isolation units promised.  This is a complete breach of faith with these people.  It is a life and death issue for patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis.  Treatment in this country falls far behind that in other countries, including Northern Ireland.  The life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients here is less than it should be because we do not have the facilities.  It is an absolute disgrace that, while we had ten years of the Celtic tiger and billions of euro went through this economy, we have not been able to provide basic facilities for these families who are among the most vulnerable in the country and are the most needy in terms of medical care.  Anybody who heard Orla Tinsley speak on the 6 o&rsquo;clock news recently must have been heartbroken listening to what she, her family and all the other patients face on a daily basis.  It is an absolute disgrace and I ask the Leader to bring this request to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children immediately and to give us the opportunity to discuss this issue in the House today.</P>
        <P>The following issue touches on budgetary matters.  Contrary to what we have heard Ministers state on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; and other programmes, the Opposition has not been given the information it needs from Government.  We have had no up-to-date forecasts for the economy from Government and no forecasts of tax and expenditure.  We have had no information on the spending options being presented by Departments or the McCarthy group and no information on the costings of tax options being considered by the Government or the tax commission etc.  There is a huge amount of information which we want from Government but which we have not received.  What the Ministers have said is simply inaccurate.  It is not the full picture.  The Opposition is not getting the information that the Government is implying it is giving to us.  We have asked for detailed information but we have not received it.</P>
        <P>I raise the decision by the Minister for Finance on tax on cigarettes.  Many of the organisations working with cancer have been giving information on this topic today.  It is inexplicable that the Minister has ruled out an increase in the tax on cigarettes.  Will the Leader come back to the House on this matter?  Public health issues should be predominant in this decision.  There is a major problem with smuggling, but it accounts for approximately 15% of the market and it should not be the reason not to increase tax on cigarettes.  That issue should be dealt with in its own right and action should be taken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Will the Leader ask the Department what action is being taken on foot of the findings in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme two days ago on the smuggling of cigarettes and the use of children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>While listening to a report this morning about a golf club on the north side of this city which has wasted the time of the court in an attempt to prevent women from joining, I assumed it was an April fool&rsquo;s joke, but I found out later in the morning that it was an actual court case.  The court&rsquo;s time is being wasted by some elderly types who cannot handle <Col N="857"/>the women in their lives or who wish to keep them outside the door.  This requires a certain amount of discussion to, at least, ridicule these people and, at most, educate them about equality.  There is a serious issue in our society when people go to such lengths on such an issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I believe that case is ongoing and I am not sure Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct to comment on it in the House.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected.  It is a very fair correction.  I withdraw everything I said and will put it all on hold until the result is given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot prejudge the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a more serious issue, we should all support the representations made by the Irish Cancer Society regarding the impacts of smoking on cancer.  We should not be facilitating people who smoke to smoke more at the cost of their health and the public health as well as the cost to the health service.  We should make representations to the Minister for Health and Children on that issue.  Next week&rsquo;s budget should increase the excise duty on tobacco products for a variety of reasons some of which have been touched upon by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>While there is not an immediate rush on this matter, I would like a discussion in the House on the question of energy independence, to include when the Corrib gas field will come on line, how we can ensure it will come on line and the difficulties of being 95% exposed to foreign sources of energy.  There is a lack of doctoral research in our third level institutions on alternative energy.  They are now only being carried out in very few of our third level institutions.  The Government should intervene to ensure that happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Next week the Government needs to deal with the crisis in the public finances and address the question of the deficit.  I accept that is an urgent matter for it to attend to.  We are all being conditioned to expect very serious decisions and very severe measures to be taken next week.  I hope that in addition to a budgetary book-balancing accountancy exercise next week, we also have some real proposals &mdash; visionary proposals one would hope &mdash; from the Government on turning around the economic situation and getting people back to work, which is vital.  It is a pity that policy seems to be so dominated across the board by the notion that if we fasten our seat belts and, as it were, keep our heads down and brace ourselves, things will improve internationally and when they do, everything here will be fine again.  It is a pity if that is the extent of our policy making in this regard.  We have a real opportunity to make decisions in this country about this country rather than simply deciding to sit back and wait in hope for the international crisis to pass.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Fitzgerald said about the Government&rsquo;s lamentable lack of serious engagement with the Opposition parties on the exercise that is going on at the moment.  We in the Labour Party have had precisely the same problems that Senator Fitzgerald outlined Fine Gael had.  That is clearly a decision the Government has made.  We cannot change that decision.  The Government has indicated that it will make the decisions.  Of course it is a matter for the Government to make these decisions.  When Government Members talk about engagement with the Opposition, whether on television, in these Houses or elsewhere, it is very difficult to take them seriously when the basic information is not being shared with the Opposition for it to participate meaningfully in this exercise.  I characterised it a few weeks ago when the Minister for Finance initially said that he was inviting the Opposition to come forward as being akin to placing a suggestion box at the bottom of the stairs in Leinster House.  That is as far as it has gone.  It is that absurd.  It has not gone any further.</P><Col N="858"/>
        <P>This is further exemplified &mdash; Senator Fitzgerald could have made the point because it is a Fine Gael motion &mdash; by the Private Members&rsquo; motion to be taken later today.  Once again the Government amendment proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  Last week some Senators on the Government side said they agreed with some elements of the Fine Gael proposals.</P>

	<P>We can debate it on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with some and disagree with others.  However, the notion of deleting everything seems to take away any kind of serious debate.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We can debate it on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree entirely with what has been said in respect of the price of cigarettes.  Clearly there is a compelling argument that only a significant increase as pointed out by the Irish Cancer Society would encourage smokers to quit and discourage young people in particular from starting.  That should certainly be addressed in the budget.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader clarify for the House either today or some time soon the thinking of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of his revival, as it has been described, of the Privacy Bill?  His predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, indicated that this Bill would not be proceeded with unless and until the new mechanism set up under the Press Ombudsman or the Press Council would be given an opportunity to work.  They made their report yesterday and, while the Minister attended the launch of that report, he said he was going to revive the Privacy Bill.  However, precisely the opposite was said by his predecessor, namely, that this Bill would not be brought forward and that opportunity and space would be given to the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman to do their work.  What exactly is going on in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that there have been a number of announcements this week by Government that fall squarely behind decisions taken on reports by previous Oireachtas committees, which vindicates the work of those committees.  One such decision is bringing alcohol under the substance misuse strategy which will take over the national drugs strategy for 2009 to 2016.  While I was Chair of the committee, we carried out a report on the inclusion of alcohol in the national substance misuse strategy.  It is very heartening to see that the Minister has used the exact same phrase when bringing it before Cabinet and that the Cabinet has accepted it.  I wish its advancement God speed.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson and I brought before this House another issue of concern.  During the period when we were considering this report, we were in New Zealand where the big problem in regard to drugs at that time was the party pill.  I acknowledge that the Minister brought this matter before Cabinet and it now effectively has been banned.  I ask that we would ensure this ban is policed.  I recognise that the matter was raised at committee, reports were made to the Minister and, on the back of that, there has been a reaction.  Similarly, we drew up a report on cigarette smoking out of which came the smoking ban.  What also came out was the issue of price being the biggest deterrent to smoking.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss a number of issues in regard to sentencing?  I know we are supposed to keep away from issues that concern justice but, by the same token, there is a very strong need to consider the issue of sentencing, repeat offending and such issues.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.  However, someone at some stage must stand back.  We watched a programme last week which highlighted that cigarettes are being illegally imported into this country but a 13 cent fine was given for a major breach of the law.  To have illegal cigarettes coming into the country and for an offender to get a 13 cent fine is wrong.  Regardless of whether it is the role of the House, it is my role to say someone needs to examine sentencing, re-offending, the implementation of the Children Act, making parents responsible for juveniles who are out of home and the issue of who looks after people on curfew.  Perhaps we should have a debate on the Garda reserve and the increasing role it could play in our policing needs.</P>
        <P>I offer my sympathy and empathy to the family of Garda Robert McCallion, a native of Mayo with very strong Inishowen connections.  He was mown down by a stolen car in the course of his duty and is fighting for his life.  His family and garda&iacute; deserve our thoughts and prayers at this particularly difficult time.  We should be looking to strengthen the forces of law and sentencing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business which calls on the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss her plans for the cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  There is a serious need for discussion on this issue because it is Government policy to not invest in the long-term development of the Irish health care service but instead to rely on the private sector to provide additional hospital beds and services.  This has been Government policy since 2005 yet not a single bed has been added to the health service under this initiative.  Therefore, the fact the Minister and Government policy state the Government will rely on the public sector for this development means it is unlikely to happen in the next four to five years.  Such talk from the Minister in regard to the private sector is misleading patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis and who will die at an increased rate in this jurisdiction in comparison with patients in Northern Ireland.  People there with cystic fibrosis live ten years longer than such people in the Republic, which says more than enough about our Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like also if the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment were to come to the House to discuss the increased rate of unemployment, for which a number of Ministers bear responsibility.  The Government response to the fact that 11% of the population is now unemployed and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s acknowledgement that this figure will increase rapidly require us to debate this issue urgently.  In excess of 100,000 people will lose their jobs before we return after the summer recess, which is unprecedented in the history of this State.  We need to wake up and ensure these matters are urgently debated in this House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for accepting my matter for discussion on today&rsquo;s Adjournment.  Members should come to the House this evening to hear the reply from the Minister for Health and Children in response to my question in regard to patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>

	<P Just="Left">During this time of recession, cash flow is the life blood and oxygen of companies and families.  Companies and families cannot survive unless they have cash.  I draw attention to ineptitude on the part of the State whereby the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not paying employer redundancy rebates until six months after a person has been made redundant.  Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003, a person on completion of two years in a job is entitled to two weeks&rsquo; full pay tax free plus an extra week&rsquo;s bonus.  A company is entitled to recoup 60% of the amount paid from the social insurance fund into which the company pays by way of employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions.</P>
        <P>People, unfortunately and sadly, are being made redundant.  However, the Department is not paying employers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the downgrading of Ireland&rsquo;s AAA credit rating by Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, which is a commercial firm and rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s was at the centre of the mess which caused the international financial collapse.  It was among those rating firms and being paid for it by the firms they were rating.  It joined the race to the bottom and, as a result, missed some of the toxic elements in the bundles being provided to international financial institutions.  It was heavily involved in the mess involving sub-prime mortgages.  I see Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s as an essential element of the economic catastrophe facing America and the rest of the planet.  It decided to amend Ireland&rsquo;s credit position by moving us away from our AAA rating.  There might well be good grounds for that &mdash; I do not know.  While I am not in a position to comment on that, I would have thought that it would have been intelligent for Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s to have waited for the Government to make its budget day proposals before it popped out its little nose in this respect.</P>

	<P>When I heard that Mr. Frank Gill, who is one of Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s senior executives, was apparently suggesting that regime change was needed in Ireland, I thought it was an April fool&rsquo;s prank.  It takes a hell of a cheek for someone from such a discredited agency to make such a comment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that a serious interpretation was placed on the words of Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s in the other House yesterday.  I refer to the comments of Deputy Enda Kenny, who asked the Taoiseach if he agreed with Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s &ldquo;that there is no confidence in the Irish Government, that the Taoiseach has failed to deal with the economic challenges of the country, that he has presided over a disastrous banking system, that we have had a calamitous loss of competitiveness and that the Taoiseach should go&rdquo;.  I do not think I have ever previously heard a senior representative of an international financial group calling for the removal from office of a democratically elected prime minister.  While I have difficulties with some of the Government&rsquo;s policies, I understand that we need a certain amount of democracy.  It is outrageous for a person from such a background to call for regime change, which is apparently what an official from Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s has done.  We need a fully independent and non-commercial rating agency.  Perhaps it could be a function of the European Union.</P>
        <P>When Senator John Paul Phelan and I previously raised the fate of the residents of Bethany House in Carlow, we were given various undertakings to the effect that the elderly and vulnerable people in question would not be disadvantaged or moved without consent.  I was not the only person to argue that moving quite functional elderly people into a hospital where they would be bed-ridden for almost the entire day would be like imposing a sentence of death on them.  We were assured that this would not happen without consent.  I have in front of me signed forms making it clear that consent was not being given.  I understand that ambulances started to arrive at the front door of Bethany House a few days ago to remove casualties.  These were not casualties.  These were unwilling elderly people who were forcibly removed from the nursing home.  Will the Leader transmit to the Minister for Health and Children our continued interest in and our grave concern about this matter?</P>
        <P>While he is doing that, he might inform the Minister, Deputy Harney, that I strongly support my colleagues who have appealed for urgent priority to be given to the cystic fibrosis patients who avail of the much-needed facility at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  I do not intend to reopen that debate now, as I have contributed to it on enough occasions in the past.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s.  It appears we are in a new economic war.  On this occasion, the war is not with the English Government but with the English media and financial institutions.  On 26 February last, I mentioned in this House that Sky News had reported that mismanagement in Allied Irish Banks, rather than Anglo Irish Bank, had caused frustration and brought about that day&rsquo;s one-day stoppage and strike.  When I contacted Sky News to inform it of its error, the report was corrected in the next news bulletin.  In that instance, Sky News was following up on a report in the previous day&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i>, which had said the exact same thing.  I suggest that when a director of the European sovereign rating division of Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, Mr. Gill, said there should be new faces in the Irish Government, he was calling for regime change in this country, in effect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My colleague, Senator Alex White, referred to the fact that on budget day we want to hear from the Government some initiatives on job creation.  Has the Government some initiatives to deal with the issue of what we will do with our graduates, which is becoming a significant problem?  There simply are not placements or job opportunities for many of them.  Their options are limited.  I would like to see some form of innovation from the Government so that we do not end up in a situation where these graduates do not get to practice what they spent years learning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I visited Cork Institute of Technology in recent days.  It provides a course in renewable energy in which the Green Party, if its Senators were present, may have much interest.  There are 35 or 36 students enrolled in it, only three of whom can find placement.  How will they progress?  There are all these initiatives on new forms of energy of which Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke.  How can they progress when these companies are not even taking these students on, where there are no opportunities for them and none of them can find work?</P>
        <P>I have encountered also a number of people working in information technology across a number of colleges who want to start businesses.  Fair play to them.  However, they cannot afford to do so in large urban areas because the start-up costs are so high.  Many of them are from rural areas.  We are all in favour of spatial planning and think it would be great to have companies in rural areas.  However, especially with the new plans of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, the only broadband capability with which they will be able to work will be social broadband.  It will be broadband for Facebook and Bebo.  It will not be broadband for starting companies because it will not be large enough, stable enough and substantial enough for them.  I hope those are two areas the Government will address.  If we are to get out of the quagmire we are in, these will have to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I must inform the House that from Monday next Nenagh and Ennis hospitals will lose their 24-hour accident and emergency services unless something changes in the near future.  This is a disgrace.  At this late date, I call on the Government to consider seriously reversing its policies on small, regional acute hospitals.  It is a disgraceful strategy which is driven by consultants who are very well paid.  It is orientated more around them than around patients.  The money is not available to deliver on these strategies and I remind the Leader that numerous Ministers stated these strategies would not be put in place and these hospitals would not lose their services until the new buildings and facilities and all the new infrastructure was in place.</P>

	<P>I welcome the roll-out of the home energy saving scheme by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  In excess of 200,000 applicants have been approved and 700 contractors have been approved to carry out this work.  It involves an allocation of approximately &euro;50 million.  Jobs will be created the <Col N="864"/>length and breadth of the country as a result.  I note our colleague, Senator Larry Butler, has been pushing for this for some time and it is becoming a reality.  That is an example of we in this Government taking decisive action to create as many jobs as possible in the economy in rural areas.  There will be a saving of approximately &euro;700 per year to each householder because he or she has the insulation installed in his or her home.  It is also being worked on in an efficient manner.  People apply on-line, which is efficient.  Work has begun and this is an indication of progress by the Government on schemes of this nature.  A total of 94,000 inquiries have been made.  I spoke to a contractor earlier and there was a pep in his step.  Contractors are delighted with the Government for bringing forward this initiative to maintain and create jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come to the House to discuss this scheme and my proposal for the provision of hot water in 2,000 national schools?  Only 18% of schools have running hot water and solar panels could be used to generate the energy to provide warm water in schools.  Alternative energy projects could be used to deal with other issues in public buildings.  The insulation scheme is one way forward and it is a tremendous indication of what we are doing in government.  I welcome Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals.  It is about time the party came up with suggestions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I used my time well because the House was not sitting, through no fault of mine.  I visited a manufacturing facility in Athlone where the workforce has reduced from 193 to 143.  Staff sometimes work three days a week but company management is doing everything in its power to retain jobs.  It is important to the managing director to keep jobs.  Each lost job costs the Exchequer &euro;20,000 a year.  He spoke about the frustration he experiences because nobody is listening to people such as him on the ground.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should meet these people to find out what are the issues.</P>
        <P>The most significant issue faced by the managing director of the facility I visited is energy costs.  He depends entirely on the ESB for surges in power at various times during the day.  He said nobody is listening and he is totally and utterly frustrated by county enterprise boards.  Every proposal must be supported by a consultant before it is entertained.  Why does this company need to retain a consultant when it has been in business for 30 years?  Will the Leader investigate the exorbitant spending on consultants by State bodies and the issue of energy prices, which is costing jobs?  A total of 371,000 people are unemployed and this number will escalate.  There is no point in crying when the milk is spilt.  Let us try to save existing jobs.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of cystic fibrosis recently.  We lost a dear young man in Westmeath, aged 15, from this disease.  On the day of his funeral, I was assured in the House by the Minister for <Col N="865"/>Health and Children, who, unfortunately, is still in office, that an isolation facility would be provided for CF sufferers so that those who have this disease would not have to sit in a waiting room full of people with infections.  The recent announcement makes absolutely no sense.  There is no point in the Leader nodding.  I feel strongly about this.</P>

I call on the Leader to have a debate here on the national drugs strategy, with particular emphasis on the head shops that are springing up under various names in towns and villages all over the country.  They facilitate the purchase of equipment that encourages the use of illegal drugs and substances.  I call on the Leader to hold that debate urgently.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to ban the party pill, we have a long way to go in respect of these shops.  I compliment my colleagues, Senators McFadden and Keaveney, who, like me, have raised this issue here several times.  I congratulate them on their work in bringing about this ban.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the need to advance the promised isolation facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.  No area of public expenditure is more important than the provision of such facilities.  It is shocking to think that people in another part of this island might have better outcomes because we have not made the necessary investment here. </P>
        <P>The Irish Hospice Foundation has been making the point that we should not neglect our health care buildings.  If a patient in hospital accesses facilities of poorer quality than those available in a hotel, that is an indictment of our system.  We know that is the reality.  We must not take the foot off the pedal in reforming our hospital buildings.  We need to reach a point where patients are in single bed wards.  Many other changes are necessary too.  Despite being in a difficult economic situation, we absolutely have to continue to plan for the future and improve hospital conditions soon.</P>
        <P>I am very surprised that, while the Government is coy about aspects of the budget, it is willing to say what is not in the budget.  I understand that the Minister ruled out adding &euro;2 to the price of a packet of cigarettes.  The argument is made that the tax would increase smuggling, but that is a matter of enforcement.  We must not turn our backs on the need to enforce the law.  I asked Combat Poverty this morning, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, what it thinks of the proposal and it said that there is a regressive dimension to the idea because it might disproportionately affect poorer sections of the community.  That can be addressed, however, by investing the revenue of &euro;420 million in the com<Col N="866"/>munity in cessation programmes and so on.  I ask the Government not to be so quick to rule out a good idea that would generate revenue and carry a significant public health benefit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>The unemployment situation is becoming catastrophic, with jobs being lost every day.  Some initiative must be taken in this regard.  While we regularly talk about the economy here, we should allot the same amount of time to discussing unemployment.  Among our unemployed are people from all walks of life, including accountants, architects and solicitors.  The Minister should consider putting together a directory of the skills they offer.  After she does that she should examine the &euro;1 billion spent on F&Aacute;S and take some of that money away because such people do not need upskilling but job creation.  Jobs could be created by the entrepreneurship of two to five of these people getting together and creating a way forward out of the unemployment situation the country now faces.</P>
        <P>I suggest we do this regularly in the House and that a plan be put in place to deal with the situation.  Not only does it cost a fortune to have people unemployed but the people I describe have significant ability to create wealth.  This is one way to do it.  We could dovetail these people into the smart economy and into different businesses that require further people on their books.  There are still some jobs available but we do not know how to dovetail the people with the jobs.  For argument&rsquo;s sake, if we took it to its full conclusion and created a proper directory using technology, we could find out what kinds of jobs are available in Australia, New Zealand or Canada instead of having skilled people going there only to discover there are no jobs for them in those countries.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs should take initiatives such as this.  When one considers that &euro;21 billion is involved, it is time for us to put some money into ensuring we have an initiative for these people who do not want to be unemployed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to the question.  It now seems to be Government policy to blame the officials.  Senator Daly blames the media.  However, last weekend the magazine section of <i>The Sunday Times</i> carried a very good analytical piece on the Irish economy and Irish banking institutions.  It did not blame the Government but condemned it on its policy and lack of regulation.  Has the Government now abdicated its role in governing and is it now apportioning blame to the civil servants, the spin doctors and the media?  Does the Leader concur with this viewpoint, namely, that it is not the Government&rsquo;s fault but rather that of all the people I mentioned?</P>
        <P>Might the House have a debate on sport, as a matter of urgency?  I raised this matter on numerous occasions.  The Gaelic Players Association had a briefing today with Members of both Houses.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has abandoned the sports capital programme and there is internal rivalry between the Irish Sports Council and the Olympic <Col N="867"/>Council of Ireland.  It is desirable, therefore, that we would have a debate on sport as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the economy, with specific reference to competitiveness.  This week Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s commented on the Government and on Irish finances, awarding a downgrade of our AAA status.  I am conscious also that the same agency gave AAA ratings to the very item that almost brought about the collapse of the world economies, namely, sub-prime lending.  In light of that and because of its interference in a local and national issue, I suggest that Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s has gone from being reliable to being very unstable.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate on the possibility of including an increase of up to &euro;2 on the price of cigarettes.  I am particularly cognisant of the fact there are also possibilities in the area of drink where if minimum pricing orders were to be simultaneously implemented in the North and here, it would cut out any of the cross-Border smuggling but would give both areas an opportunity to gain significant revenue with added health benefits to the community.</P>

	<P>I will be brief.  The first time the European Commission issued a warning to the Government was back in 2001 with regard to the budget of that year when Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance.  Again we got into a huff.  The Commission told us then that the spending of the Government, despite the surplus in our public finances, was unsustainable and again we rejected that because we knew better.  We should not be so sensitive <Col N="868"/>when Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s gives the rating which is reflected in the market and draws a fairly logical conclusion from it.</P>
        <P>It is the refrain not only of Senator Terry Leyden but also of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and various Ministers, that when they are criticised about their economic management of this economy, they say, &ldquo;Well, what would you do?  What are your proposals?  You have no proposals.&rdquo;  The Opposition has come up with proposals over the past year, starting last July when Deputy Richard Bruton and Fine Gael came up with the programme for recovery through reform.</P>

	<P>The Senator should ask the Leader a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a specific question for the Leader.  Fine Gael made proposals of how to save &euro;2 billion when we were asked.  The Minister asked for pre-budget submissions or views from the Opposition and Deputy Richard Bruton and Fine Gael have done so today.  This is a unique, specific, Fine Gael perspective on the public finances.  I ask the Leader to confirm that the Opposition has engaged and Fine Gael has engaged with the Government by coming up with alternative economic strategies.  It is about time in this House and in the other House, that the Government engages with the Opposition and acknowledges that it is sucking ideas from the Opposition, relying on the Opposition for ideas and it should acknowledge the merit of those ideas for managing the economy.</P>

        <P>I want to ask the Leader for a debate on censorship and freedom of expression, not in the context of the debate we have been having recently about the Government&rsquo;s gross over-reaction to the satirical portrait of the Taoiseach, although I share the concern of many about the heavy-handed tactics of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating where no criminal offence, it seems to me, had been made out.</P>
        <P>I want to ask for a debate on a different aspect of censorship, one of growing concern to a large number of people in this country, although it has gone under the radar politically, that is the censorship imposed by Internet service providers on their customers, even when they are accessing websites that are not illegal and not in the context of any criminal offence.  This is in the wake of a High Court case which was settled in January in which Eircom agreed to take the e-mail addresses of its subscribers from record companies which alleged that those subscribers had been accessing certain websites where they could download music.  Eircom agreed to do this on the basis of a &ldquo;three strikes and you are out&rdquo; principle, whereby it would remove its subscribers from their subscription thereby ending their Internet access if they were found to be accessing certain sites.  There is much concern about this and last week the European Parliament adopted by an enormous majority a report rejecting this sort of surveillance and the idea that there should be penalties for this sort of thing.  In the context of what we saw with Google in China, we must be very wary of the sort of censorship Internet service providers are being asked or in some cases are agreeing to impose on their subscribers.  I ask for a debate on this important topic.</P><Col N="869"/>

	<P>Will the Leader respond to No. 8 and provide Government time for it?  He will understand the urgency as I had a word with him about it outside the Chamber.</P>

	<P>I have called the Leader to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Twomey, Mary White, McFadden, Mullen and Buttimer expressed their strong views on inviting the Minister for Health and Children to the House regarding cystic fibrosis sufferers and on the Minister and the Department providing buildings and services for patients.  I agree with all the sentiments expressed today on having the necessary investment put in place.  Yesterday I heard the Minister on the radio explaining very strongly and forcefully her commitment to doing whatever she possibly can, particularly given the strict economic climate in which we find ourselves.  I saw Ms Orla Tinsley on television and I, too, believe that we should do everything we possibly can to assist.  I fully support the calls made here today and I will pass them on to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald called for an update on the events of this week.  I will come back to the Senator on that after the Order of Business.  Senators Keaveney, Hanafin and Norris joined Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White on increasing the price of cigarettes in the budget and introducing smuggling deterrents.  I agree with the sentiments expressed and will pass on the Senators&rsquo; strong views, particularly regarding sentencing.  The point made to the House was that sentencing makes a farce of the law.  There is no fear of the law and we must address this as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I will pass to the Minister Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s views on equality matters.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole also spoke on energy independence and said we are in an ideal position to source our energy, being an island economy.  Senator Leyden called on the Minister regarding the matters she outlined to the House.  We are in an ideal position to sell our energy, whether wind or any other form.  Many colleagues, including Senator Butler, who is a pioneer on these matters, referred to this.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White asked for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s views on the Privacy Bill.  The Privacy Bill will be before the House this year and we can discuss and deliberate on the merits and demerits of it when it comes to the House.  Senator Keaveney spoke on substance misuse, the strategy in the committee report, which has been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and which has received support.  Senators Wilson, Keaveney and McFadden spoke out very strongly on the party pill.  Senator Wilson referred to the committee report and the drug strategy report.  I congratulate the committee on all the good work it has done on this.  I suggest in future, to get value for money for the taxpayer, instead of paying <Col N="870"/>millions of euro to consultants, the committee system is used as it has been proven to be most successful.  Members of both Houses who come from various professions are the experts in terms of the membership of those committees.  They are answerable to the public and the taxpayer for the advice they give to Departments and Ministers.  I see no need for consultants in future once we go through the committee system.  The committee system gives the best value for money and in terms of accountability.  I strongly congratulate the committees on the report, which has been welcomed here by members of those committees and by colleagues who have worked hard to bring forward this report and get the Department&rsquo;s support for it.</P>
        <P>I join in the comments of Senator Keaveney on Garda Robert McCallion who had an unfortunate, dreadful accident.  He is fighting for his life and we wish him well and send him our best wishes for a speedy recovery.  Senators Twomey and Butler called on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House regarding job creation and to discuss where the best value for money can be got for the &euro;1 billion that is being spent through F&Aacute;S.  Senator Butler is a captain of industry with wide experience in this area.  The strength of the Seanad is highlighted by the amount of expertise available to the Government, Departments and Ministers from those who have been in positions to advise and make recommendations to the House.  It has been said here that the smart economy is one where jobs will be in the future.  However &euro;1 billion is a huge amount of money to be spent and I have given an undertaking to the House to have an all-day debate in the very near future on job creation and the &euro;1 billion budget for F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Senators Mary White, McFadden and Buttimer expressed their concerns about employment.  Senator Mary White referred to cash flows and the fact that it takes up to six months to recover money from the Department for those who are being let go &mdash; up to 60%, we are told, must be returned to employers.  In times of difficulty we have to see what we can do in this regard.  Senators Norris, Daly, Hanafin and Regan spoke about Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s.  Senator Regan made his usual marvellous contribution.  I wish him luck as a substitute in the European Parliament.  I was there for 25 years and I hope he is luckier than I was.</P>

        <P>Senator Kelly raised the issue of job creation.  I have taken his views on board.  I am uplifted by the announcement of the investment by our nearest neighbours in Intel of &euro;1 billion in job creation.  It is surely one of the greatest companies in the world at present.  Its investment of a further billion euro in Ireland is a huge vote of confidence in our smart economy of the future.</P>

        <P>Regarding Senator Kelly&rsquo;s view of the Health Service Executive, we have requested the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House from time to time to discuss and deliberate on such matters.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden congratulated the Minister with responsibility for energy &mdash; remarks with which I want to be associated &mdash; on the 700 new contractors who will be engaged in the new energy saving schemes and on the &euro;50 million that will invested in them.  It will assist small contractors in particular to retain their one, two or three anchor people in employment, whether they be carpenters, plumbers or electricians, who have been loyal to them over the years and long may that continue.</P>
        <P>This issue was raised previously by Senator Butler and it was pointed out that 94,000 inquiries have been made about these schemes.  That shows there is a commitment to avail of the opportunity to apply for them.  I hope the number who do so will increase.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator McFadden raised the issue of energy costs and I agree with her sentiments.  However, I welcome the announcement of the &euro;600 million interconnector project from Wales which will of major assistance to us here.  It will result in a further reduction of 10% in energy costs within the next three years.  On the day I took over as Leader of this House I said that reducing energy costs must be our challenge and that lack of competitiveness was our enemy.  I am not satisfied with the reduction in energy costs of Bord G&aacute;is or the ESB in terms of facilitating job creation.  Any place that provides employment, whether it be a factory floor or a hotel, should receive the same reductions in energy costs as those that have been received by domestic users.  Those suppliers are fooling us because they are not reducing energy costs in places of employment which facilitate job creation.  I call on parties on all sides of the House to use their influence, including at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis at the weekend, to highlight this issue concerning places of employment.  The ESB and Bord G&aacute;is are not playing their part.</P>

	<P>Senator Buttimer supported the GPA and the players.  We all met the stars in Buswells Hotel today and we fully support them.  They are role models for future generations and for young people in terms of keeping alive our Gaelic games.  They are an example to everyone and I was delighted to meet those young men today who are making a major contribution to the Gaelic Athletic Association.  I fully support them.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on the media.  I look forward to such a debate taking place.  I am delighted to be able to confirm we have no difficulty whatever in that regard.  We should have a debate once a month in the House on the subject.  I will avail of the opportunity to put it in the diary as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins called for an urgent debate on the current plight of taximen.  One&rsquo;s heart would go out when one sees the rows of taxis outside establishments waiting for hours to try to get one fare.

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 56, before section 81, but in Chapter 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;81.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall make a report to both Houses of the Oireachtas six months prior to the expiration of any bilateral agreement as to:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) whether it is proposed to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the steps taken to date to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country,</P><Col N="874"/>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the steps proposed to be taken to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) the date it is hoped that a new bilateral agreement will be in place.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) The Minister shall make a further report to both Houses of the Oireachtas one week prior to the expiration of any bilateral agreement on the progress in relation to its renewal outlining:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) whether it is proposed to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the steps taken to date to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the steps proposed to be taken to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) the date it is hoped that a new bilateral agreement will be in place.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) On the conclusion of any new bilateral agreement, or the renewal of any bilateral agreement, the Minister shall make a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas and, as soon as practicable after the conclusion of any such making or renewal of a bilateral agreement, cause to be lodged a copy of the agreement and a report of the Department of Health and Children on that agreement in the library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to bilateral adoption agreements.  Obviously, the Minister of State is aware there is concern in regard to bilateral agreements, especially in respect of Vietnam.  Perhaps he will bring us up to date on that agreement and whether it is ready to be signed off.  What is the timeframe in regard to other bilateral agreements on which he said he will start to work once that one is agreed?</P>
        <P>The intention behind this new section is that the Minister of State will make a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas prior to the expiration of any bilateral agreement outlining in detail whether a new bilateral agreement will be entered into, what steps have been taken with the relevant country and the date it is hoped the new bilateral agreement will be in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is aware that many parents who have adopted children from Vietnam are very keen to know the status of the bilateral agreement and would like to have had it agreed and concluded before this legislation was taken.  There is concern that there is uncertainty for them, given that this legislation will be passed presumably before the bilateral agreement is in place.  Perhaps the Minister of State will inform the House of the situation.  This is a straightforward amendment and I am interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s reaction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The position in regard to Vietnam is that the agreement expires on 1 May.  The Government decided in December that we would pursue a new agreement which would be improved and based more rigorously on the principles contained in the Hague Convention.  The drafting of that agreement was not a simple affair.  We went through some of the details of that on the last occasion in the House.  Nevertheless, we sent a draft of an agreement to the Vietnamese authorities and we intend to go to Vietnam in the next few days or weeks to sign an agreement.  That is our intention, but as I said the last day, we cannot anticipate what the Vietnamese authorities will say about the draft agreement we sent them.  That is the state of play.</P><Col N="875"/>
        <P>I am keen to keep the parents informed.  Members of the Oireachtas are getting a lot of representations from anxious parents and anxious prospective adoptive parents in regard to where we are going with this.  I reassure people that we are very keen to sign an agreement and we will be guided at all times by the protection of children, both in Vietnam and here.  They are the guiding and central principles in terms of how we approach this.</P>
        <P>We have put a lot of time and resources into this to get this far.  There have been some comments in the media that we have been dragging our heels and that we are somehow or other not interested in doing this, but nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
        <P>I oppose the amendment.  The experience I have had in the past few months in trying to negotiate bilateral agreements, agreements between two sovereign states, is that very often other sovereign states look at what is going on and many non-governmental organisations take a great deal of interest in it.  It is not something that happens in isolation.   There is little to be gained by placing before the Houses of the Oireachtas one&rsquo;s opening position or bottom line or negotiating information which might be better not put on the public record thereby preserving for oneself a strong negotiating position.  I would be inclined not to do that.</P>
        <P>The motivation behind the amendment is right.  It is to try to ensure that these things are done in a timely fashion.  However, that cannot be guaranteed by such a provision.  The key is transparency.  We will lay any new agreement before the Houses of the Oireachtas where it can be duly debated.  However, it is important that my office and the Department of Foreign Affairs are given the right to negotiate this agreement in the normal way in which international agreements are concluded.  The provisions in the Bill in regard to the laying of agreements before both Houses of the Oireachtas are adequate so I do not believe the amendment is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State said, many parents are very concerned that the agreement with Vietnam has not been signed.  What is the position if it is not signed?  The Minister of State said there is some doubt there but that he hopes it will be agreed.  What will the legal position be if it is not agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Fitzgerald said.  Unless it is necessary, nobody wants to hold the Minister of State to precise dates and so on.  However, this is a very urgent matter and one of huge concern to many people.  The Minister of State indicated that he hopes there will be contact with the Vietnamese or that there will be a trip to Vietnam within days or weeks.  Will he indicate which will be the case so that we can give some measure of clarity to people who get in touch with us and, I am sure, with him?  There has been a serious delay, although I am not accusing anybody of foot-dragging in this regard.  The bottom line is that there has been an inordinate delay in resolving this matter about which there is grave concern.  The draft has been sent to the Vietnamese.  Has the Minister of State considered any leverage that can be brought to bear?  What is likely to be the next stage?  He mentioned that there would be contact and perhaps a trip there.  We are not asking the Minister of State to reveal any specifics of the draft.  What does he envisage happening next?  What steps, if any, does he intend to take to try to avoid further delay or any delay at the Vietnamese end?  As it is a bilateral agreement, both sides need to want to make an agreement.  It is not possible to have one that is just pushed by one side.  What sort of leverage is available and what does the Minister of State believe he might be able to do to push the matter along at the other side, as it were?</P>
        <P>I do not find persuasive what the Minister of State has said in opposing the amendment.  He stated that he did not believe it was appropriate that the negotiating position of our Government would be revealed publicly.  I have just re-read the amendment and it does not propose <Col N="876"/>that that would occur.  The amendment states that the report should indicate whether it is proposed to conclude an agreement and the steps taken to date to conclude an agreement.  While it might touch on the contents of the agreement it does not really comprehend the contents of the agreement.  The amendment also states that the report should indicate the steps proposed to be taken to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country, which is the same point again, and the date it is hoped that a new bilateral agreement will be in place.  Section 81(2) refers to another report outlining whether it is proposed to conclude a new bilateral agreement with the relevant country, the steps taken to conclude an agreement and the date it is hoped that a new bilateral agreement will be in place.  None of those points relates to the contents of an agreement but simply to the fact of an agreement or whether one is to occur.</P>

	<P>I remind Senators that we are in a very sensitive period in negotiating this agreement with Vietnam.  My experience is that such a measure as proposed in the amendment would not be helpful in negotiating an agreement with another party.  I would like to say many things about how we are trying to conclude this agreement at the moment.  However, it is a very sensitive time.  We are approaching this particular deadline.  I know people want to be completely reassured that we will be successful in negotiation with another country.  I cannot give that reassurance.  It would be wrong for me to give anybody false hope in that regard.</P>
        <P>I assure people that we are very keen to have an agreement.  Staff from both the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs are being sent out to negotiate this face to face with the Vietnamese.  It had been my intention that they would go out sooner -as soon as possible.  That is a matter that is in flux.  As Senators will understand, from time to time these matters are not always nailed down completely.  That needs to be agreed upon as well.  We are very keen to do that.  I do not believe we have dragged our heels in any way on this issue.  It is very sensitive and the core principle is the protection of children.  We want to upgrade the old agreement and stitch into it new elements that are essential to the Hague Convention.  I would like to tell Senators more about it but I am afraid it would be misconstrued.</P>
        <P>Until we get through this period, it is as far as I can go to ask Senators to take my reassurance that we are putting in every effort in.  We are very conscious of the sensitivities involved for prospective adoptive parents.  We are making every effort to do that and we are informed by the principles of the Hague Convention.  We want to get it done.  There are other issues we need to settle.  There are certain times in the negotiation of international agreements when it is better to allow the Government plenipotentiary powers, as it were, to do that job on the basis of trust that it will do the best job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the sensitivities and regardless of whether it was Vietnam or another country, if it was not possible to reach an agreement, what would be the legal position?  What would the next step be?  I do not refer particularly to Vietnam.  Given that this legislation is to give effect to the Hague Convention and that we will also have bilateral agreements, if a bilateral agreement was not concluded, what would happen then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>If a bilateral agreement were not concluded there would be a good reason.  It would mean that after a negotiation process, we would have not been able to be satisfied that all child protection measures were in place and therefore there could be no agreement and no adoption.  That is the way it works.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="877"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying that matter.  That is what I thought and obviously that would be a very serious situation.  I accept what the Minister of State says that every effort is being made to conclude the agreement with Vietnam, which will be reassuring to prospective adoptive parents who are obviously waiting to hear and want it concluded as quickly as possible.  I hope the negotiations are going well.  I also take the point that the best interests of children should be the guiding principle.  When making these arrangements we do not want to compromise on our standards of what is best for children.  Obviously that is core and I am sure is a core part of the Government&rsquo;s negotiations.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless the amendment involves a principle.  Obviously this is not just about the negotiations with Vietnam or Russia.  The principle is that the Minister should be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Having the Minister report back and give information to the Houses about the bilateral agreements is in the interests of the process, the children and the parents.  It is about information and transparency, and accountability to the Houses.  I do not believe the amendment would compromise in any way the Government&rsquo;s negotiations on international bilateral agreements.  We are asking that the Houses be kept informed.  If we have the Hague Convention and also bilateral agreements, the Minister should indicate to both Houses the stage of the negotiations on bilateral agreements and whether he is expecting agreement.  That would be reassuring to prospective adoptive parents who would then know it is in hand.  It also keeps the pressure on the Department to review the bilateral agreements and negotiate new agreements where necessary.</P>
        <P>This is a principled approach in the interests of the prospective adoptive parents and the children.  It would not interfere with the Government&rsquo;s negotiations.  It certainly would not interfere with its current negotiations on Vietnam.  The date for that is 1 May and the Minister of State has given as much information as he is in a position to give, which I welcome.  I understand the sensitivities.  I wish the Minister of State every success in the negotiations in the coming weeks.  Obviously it is in the interests of the families, who have been in touch with us, and their children as well as for future adoptions that this bilateral agreement would be concluded as soon as possible.  The best conditions should be agreed by both sides and written into it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 82 states, &ldquo;. . . not later than 3 months after the date of entry&rdquo;.  Is that an international norm?  I presume this relates to a child adopted from a country with which we have a bilateral agreement or which is a signatory to the Hague Convention.  While 3 months may be a fairly arbitrary period, perhaps the Minister of State will indicate the reason in this regard.  In other words, parents are given 12 weeks to notify the State of a child&rsquo;s entry into the country.  Am I correct that this will be the first indication the State will have that a child is being adopted from a country with which we have a bilateral agreement or which is signatory to the Hague Convention, which are the only countries from which one can adopt?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 51:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 50, subsection (2), line 7, after &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, which shall give consent to that information being given where the adopted person and the person placing the child for adoption have agreed through a tracing mechanism to be established by the Authority that the information can be given&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with tracing and the need to put in place a formal tracing mechanism.  This issue is an integral part of adoption in the sense that a person who in later years wishes to find out who he or she is or to inquire into his or her background and find out from where he or she came has a right and entitlement to do so.  It is a right, within the limits and constraints laid down, that should be vindicated.  I regret the Bill does not address this issue.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 53 seeks to add to section 96 a paragraph (<i>e)</i> which states: &ldquo;promoting the development of services to assist persons who were adopted and persons who have placed children for adoption to trace one another&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 51 seeks to amend section 86 and to add to it.  We all understand that an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir will keep an index to make traceable the connection between each entry in the adopted children&rsquo;s register and the corresponding entry in the Register of Births.  Section 86(2) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Notwithstanding <i>section 85</i>, the index kept under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall not be open to public inspection [which is fair enough] and no information from that index shall be given to any person except by order of a court or of the Authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We want to add to that &ldquo;which shall give consent to that information being given where the adopted person or the person placing the child for adoption have agreed through a tracing mechanism to be established by the Authority that the information can be given&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 53 seeks to include in the activities concerned in section 96 the objective of promoting the development of tracing services.  Amendment No. 51 seeks to facilitate this in the context of the register.</P>
        <P>There is a danger of this being a missed opportunity for us to view adoption as a life-long status for people.  Adoption is not purely mechanical.  We are speaking here of complex issues of law.  However, adoption is not based on legal instrument; it is a reality for the entirety of a person&rsquo;s life.  We should take this opportunity in this good and comprehensive Bill to go further and require the introduction of a form of tracing mechanism that would be supported and managed publicly.  I am sure the Minister of State and other Members have had the experience of meeting persons in their constituencies wishing to trace their birth parents.  We understand the sensitivities and mutuality involved and the fact that it is not often easily done.  Nevertheless, there has been much development in this area in terms of how such matters can be sensitively managed.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will seriously consider including these provisions as an objective and in doing so provide access to the register in circumstances where there is reciprocal agreement between the persons involved and in the context of a tracing mechanism which I hope he will consider introducing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the face of it, Senator White&rsquo;s argument appears to be quite plausible.  I accept the reasons for it.  As they get older, many people who were adopted as children want to acquire information about their natural parents.  This amendment will not prevent those who wish to retain their confidentiality from doing so.  The manner in which it is structured ensures such people will not be affected.  If this proposal is accepted, the court will not need to exercise discretion in cases in which the child and one of his or her natural parents &mdash; the mother, in most instances &mdash; wish to trace each other and make contact.  The point being made by Senator White, as I understand it, is that if both parties agree to such a process, the court will automatically consent to it.  That would make eminent sense, on the face of it.  It is natural for a person to want to get to know his or her natural parents.  It happens quite frequently.  Perhaps our legislation should be amended so that this is not merely a question of judicial discretion.  We should prescribe in legislation the circumstances in which consent is given by the judicial system.</P>
        <P>Many adopted people have concerns about not being able to trace their natural parents.  It is obvious that one cannot trace one&rsquo;s natural parents if one&rsquo;s natural mother does not want contact to be made.  In such circumstances, I do not think adopted people should be unable to get information that could be of importance for them.  I refer, for example, to information on genetic matters that could have consequences for their health.  While we might not be there yet, it is confidently expected that DNA advances will soon give us a clear picture of the prognosis for our health.  If such information can be obtained at the time of the adoption, it would make sense for it to be maintained on the adoption index and made available to the adopted person if he or she requests it at some stage in the future.  I appreciate I am going beyond the point made by Senator White.  I might be getting into a complex technical area.  The entitlements of adopted people should be paramount in all of this.  I agree with Senator White that this legislation is comprehensive and, in the main, very good.  I ask the Minister of State to examine closely the amendment before the House, which would strengthen this Bill, to see if there is any reason it should not be included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator White for proposing these amendments, which I have considered carefully.  The Senator is proposing in amendment No. 51 that in certain circumstances, the authority, having considered the issues involved, should not have the discretion to limit the publication of certain information and restrict access to public inspection of such information.  I am not sure what he is getting at.  I do not oppose the principle of giving precedence to any agreement reached by the adopted person and the person who placed the child for adoption.  However, we need to examine closely the question of how such an agreement can be arrived at.  The amendment refers to &ldquo;a tracing mechanism to be established by the Authority&rdquo;.  How do we go into that?  If the Senator withdraws this amendment, perhaps we can consider the matter more carefully in advance of Report Stage.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 53 relates to the development of services to help people who have been adopted and people who placed children for adoption to trace one another.  I have not changed my view on this matter since the last time we discussed it.  The functions of the authority are set out in this Bill.  A substantial amount of administrative work has been done to assist tracing.  The contact preference register is in place.  I have with me a copy of the standardised framework for the provision of a national information and tracing service, which was launched in November 2008.  The authority administers the framework, which was drawn up in a manner that is consistent with international best practice in terms of tracing, very well.  At this stage, there is no need to put any obligations in that regard on a statutory footing.  Our framework is being piloted and scoped out.  Stakeholders are being consulted to ensure it is a workable and proper framework.  If we subsequently think statutory provision is required, it may be appropriate to do so at some future stage.  I ask Senator White to withdraw amendment No. 51 to <Col N="881"/>allow us to consider the possibility of including a provision of that nature on Report Stage.  I oppose amendment No. 53.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 51 on the basis that the Minister of State is willing to examine the matter in advance of Report Stage.  I thank him for indicating his willingness to do so.  The Minister of State wondered whether I was intending to stymie or alter the discretion of the authority in some way.  I am not hung up on that question.  If the Minister of State wants to maintain the authority&rsquo;s over-riding discretion when it comes to whether to give access, I think I can understand where he is coming from.  If the particular set of circumstances to which I referred could be comprehended in any provision the Minister of State might consider, that might deal with it.  If the Minister of State wants the authority to maintain an over-riding discretion in this matter, I do not have a huge problem with that.</P>
        <P>I was a little disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to amendment No. 53, which advocates the development of tracing services.  The two amendments are being debated together because they are quite closely linked.  One amendment supports the other.  I am familiar with the mechanism or regime referred to by the Minister of State.  I admire and welcome the substantial work that has been done in the tracing area, and the significant developments that have resulted from it.  As we introduce comprehensive legislation to deal with this country&rsquo;s entire legal regime, and the supporting regime, in the area of adoption, it seems a pity not to set out a statutory requirement to provide for tracing services.  The Minister of State acknowledged that the administration of such services is already a function of the authority, but he added he does not want to include it in the Act, which is a pity.  I accept there is often a reluctance to include in statute things that can be left at the administrative level.  It seems to me that people across the board &mdash; professionals and service users, if I can call them that, such as families and adopted people &mdash; will see this important Bill as the bible of our statutory and legal adoption regime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I think the Minister of State appreciates that adoption does not finish at the moment of adoption.  If a person is adopted, that is his or her lifelong status.  It is important to record in the legislation the necessity and importance of tracing services.  When we looked to see how we would put that into the Bill, we thought the best way of doing so was to include it as a function of the authority because then it has a statutory footing.  Otherwise, we would be speaking about introducing separate sections to set out the tracing services and that level of detail would not be appropriate to legislation.  However, it is appropriate that it is stated clearly and put into the heart of the legislation that there will be, and ought to be developed and further improved, these tracing mechanisms.  I do not quite understand why we cannot have this included as a function, if it is already a function.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment.  On Second Stage I spoke about the need for the legislation to deal with the principles of tracing and the move towards open adoption, of which tracing is obviously one part.</P>
        <P>Over the years there have been inconsistencies in practice between agencies, as the Minister of State will be well aware.  I welcome the best practice model and I hope that will be widely implemented because that is what is needed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State looking at this and seeing if there is some way in which he can build it into statute because that is the right way to go.  People have had unnecessary difficulties.  On both sides, whether it is the adoptive parent or the person trying to trace his or her family, there have been difficulties.  This is a good amendment.  I ask the Minister of State to look at both of these amendments.</P>

	<P>Senator White makes a persuasive argument.  The point I made initially &mdash; I cannot really elaborate on it &mdash; is that we are in consultation in terms of international adoption and the effect of tracing.</P>
        <P>Many of the young people who were adopted from overseas are coming of age.  Those adopted from Romania, in that period in the early 1990s, are coming of age and we are beginning to learn a great deal about the significance of tracing.  Because the framework is new as well, we are beginning to learn a great deal about it.</P>
        <P>The decision was made to exclude the post-adoption functions, whether it be as envisaged by amendment No. 52 on the promotion of post-adoption services, or any of these services from a statutory basis.  We have some way to go before we put these functions on a statutory function.  It is at a nascent stage.  We will be in a better position to decide who the correct authority to do that is or whether it needs to be put on a statutory footing in due course.  Maybe we can revisit it on Report Stage but that is my view.</P>
        <P>We are developing these services.  We are providing for a big incremental improvement to this area and we will know a great deal more in the next few years as these young citizens come of age.</P>

        <P>We want this legislation not only to codify the law but, as I stated earlier, to be the &ldquo;Bible&rdquo; of or central important document in our adoption law and adoption practice.  I am not convinced that from the point of view of legislation we can turn our backs on the importance of post-adoption services.  The case for the importance of adoption services has been made repeatedly.</P>
        <P>I repeat the point I made on tracing.  Whereas I understand the reluctance to set out in any kind of detail in legislation what the correct services and best practices ought to be because that is not a matter for legislation, it seems the necessity of post-adoption services and the role of the authority in promoting the development of post-adoption services is a sufficiently clear and important statement of intent by the Legislature that this is an activity which we wish to see happening, which we will promote and which people can expect will be a core activity of our adoption services.</P>
        <P>I am a little disappointed at the attitude, which appears to be that that is for later on.  It is not for later on.  If it will be important in two or five years&rsquo; time, it is important now.</P>
        <P>Nothing in the amendment that my party proposes ties the hands of the Department or the Minister of State on what precisely those services would entail.  I understand that there are <Col N="883"/>developing practices, there are new practices, new ways of approaching this, new studies, new information and new expertise.  I understand all of that but that is not to say the Minister of State should feel precluded from including within the functions of the authority a commitment to the development of post-adoption services.  As I stated, the legislation is a beacon.  It is what tells one what is the law in Ireland on adoption.  One will look to this Bill when it is enacted and we should include in this important legislation a reference to post-adoption services as being at the heart of what we propose the regime would entail.  In those circumstances I am not convinced it is something that should be put off.</P>
        <P>I do not think the Minister of State is saying to the House that these services are not important.  I am not interpreting him as saying that.  However, I merely want him to go that step further and have it stated in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support this amendment.  People have waited a long time for this legislation.  It must be seen to be state-of-the-art legislation, which is what the Minister of State hopes and wants.  It seems that post-adoption services are integral to the process.  The kind of services suggested in this amendment would be really necessary and integral for persons who are in this position, who have adopted or who have been adopted and who want to trace.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the kind of emerging information on children who were adopted from Romania.  Obviously, with increasing international adoption, the demands on the services will be ever more complex.  It is appropriate that the Minister of State would provide in statute that this would be part of the service that the State would want to be seen to give to a high standard.  This is the place to do it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>As I mentioned, this is an area we have discussed previously.  When a child is adopted he or she accrues all the same rights as an Irish citizen and enjoys the benefits of the Child Care Act.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What is anticipated by the amendment is post-adoption services to do with psychological supports that would be individual to somebody who has been adopted.  Such supports are available in the normal way through the HSE.  As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, where a child is adopted into this country, he or she must be notified to the HSE within three months of his or her arrival and, therefore, he or she is entitled to the same health surveillance as a child born in the State.  The adoption authority has a specific role in adoption.  It is the central authority under the convention and post-adoption services should be provided by the HSE, as is the case under the Child Care Act 1991.  All children should be dealt with in the same way.  We are determined that unaccompanied children seeking asylum will be treated in the same way as all other citizens.  We do not want a twin-track approach and, while I appreciate the Senator does not propose that, it should not be a central role of the authority.  We did not set out to do that.  Post-adoption services are provided through the HSE under the Child Care Act 1991.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, who is a regular visitor to his former haunt.  I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the motion.  Fine Gael has published four detailed policy proposals over the past four weeks, despite Senator Leyden&rsquo;s assertion on the Order of Business that the Opposition had no policies.  We are positively brimful of policy over the past number of weeks.  This policy was published last week by Deputy Coveney, our spokesperson on communications, energy and natural resources in the D&aacute;il.  It outlines a plan of action for direct stimulation of a number of key areas in the economy going forward.</P>
        <P>The House has had a number of detailed debates in recent months on our economic position and more will follow in the next few months.  The Government will have to examine two key issues, among others, in the context of next week&rsquo;s budget and its policy going forward.  The first is job protection, to which Senator Butler referred on the Order of Business, and the other is job creation.  Fine Gael considers that the Government needs to focus its attention on these issues over the next week, in particular, in drafting the budget.  This proposal is our effort to unveil a specific targeted policy for job creation in the medium term.  Over the past ten years, expertise was developed in construction, engineering and related fields and we are in danger of haemorrhaging this expertise over the next few years unless the Government makes a serious effort to replace jobs, particularly in construction.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael proposes a new economic and recovery authority under which 100,000 jobs will be created over the next four years in a number of key targeted areas relating to infrastructure such as the provision of broadband, improvements in the national grid, the provision of water and waste water treatment facilities and the provision of renewable energy and bioenergy sources.  A number of detailed proposals are outlined in the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s amendment highlights its difficulty with investing money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, in the Fine Gael initiative.  The NPRF is an investment fund, which invests significantly overseas, and I do not know what the problem is with the fund making investments in the State at this juncture when a cash injection is needed to stimulate the economy to provide jobs into the future and ensure a commercial rate of return is achieved. <Col N="885"/> The last thing Fine Gael wants is the establishment of a new quango.  The new ERA will be a State holding company, which will oversee the existing portfolio of businesses in State control and the establishment of a number of key new businesses in areas not best served currently.  It will not be a new quango or &ldquo;a new HSE&rdquo;, as it was referred to last week.  Its structure will be completely different from that of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The authority will be based on the ideal of achieving a commercial rate of return.  Moneys invested by the NPRF and raised privately or through the new national bond scheme proposed under this initiative will generate a commercial rate of return.  This has the added benefit from the Government&rsquo;s perspective of removing a borrowing requirement from its books in providing a stimulus.  Most countries in the developed world are in the process of implementing a stimulus package.  Our current financial position means we cannot hope to provide such a package from the State&rsquo;s resources but money is available privately, which can be tapped into, and this proposal also seeks the setting up of a national bond scheme through which citizens will be able to invest.  Their money will be guaranteed and they will receive a return on their investment.  That will appeal to many people in a position to invest in such a scheme.</P>
        <P>These proposals from Fine Gael come hot on the heels of proposals for Oireachtas reform, which were made some weeks previously, proposals for reform of the funding of third level education and proposals this afternoon for next week&rsquo;s budget and what Fine Gael would do to bridge the appalling gap in our public finances if it was in government.</P>
        <P>We are undergoing an industrial transformation based on global warming and peak oil.  The public realises that we must do our bit.  Many of the investments under this initiative will be aimed at renewable and bio-energy.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment states that six new State companies would be set up if this proposal were implemented.  That is not the case because the proposal states specifically that several existing companies such as Coillte, Bord na M&oacute;na and the forestry research company would be amalgamated if it were put into practice and that other State companies, such as Bord G&aacute;is, could be sold off resulting in a rationalisation of existing State provision as well as the creation of several new companies aimed at areas that badly need investment.</P>
        <P>We have had a series of debates here on broadband since I came into this House.  One of the companies that Fine Gael proposes to establish would aim to give 90% of the population access to next generation broadband.  In my area there are places that do not have first generation broadband but this initiative is important to stimulate the economy and ensure that small local businesses have access to international markets and ensure the creation of several job opportunities.</P>
        <P>The motion also contains a proposal to establish a new company called Irish water which would be responsible for ensuring the provision of safe, clean drinking water.  I do not need to mention what happened in Galway a few years ago, and the same has happened in other parts of the country.  The company would have responsibility for administering funding for waste water treatment.</P>
        <P>Another initiative is the greener home bank which would help tens of thousands of homeowners to upgrade their energy supply and waste water standards.  A crucial component of the proposal is a company called SmartGrid which would involve the investment of &euro;3.3 billion in the electricity network and take over the role of ESB Networks.  It would be split off from the ESB group.  That needs to happen if we are serious about competition in the energy supply sector.</P>
        <P>There is no reason that Ireland cannot become a world leader in green energy.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke earlier today about the potential for green energy, particularly on the west coast, which holds some of the greatest ocean energy potential in the world.  The Green Party <Col N="886"/>spoke a great deal about this before entering Government and there are initiatives investigating that energy.  It is waiting to be exploited and the Fine Gael proposal would see us embark on an ambitious new plan in that direction.</P>
        <P>Another key component of the proposal is to power our cars with domestically produced renewable energy rather than spending billions of euro importing fossil fuels whose supply is uncertain both because the source is running down and because the supply chain is politically unstable.  The Government should embrace this proposal.</P>
        <P>Most of the potential for job creation in this proposal is in construction, engineering, scientific research, plumbing and electrical technicians, insulation and home energy experts, forestry maintenance and timber processing.  Many of the existing sources of employment in those areas have been badly affected in recent months and it is necessary to provide alternative employment for the people who have lost their jobs in those sectors.  My part of the world is not very different from that of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh.  The Celtic tiger was a myth there, apart from construction-related employment.  It did not exist for other sectors outside Dublin and its environs and other large urban areas.  If we are serious about protecting the fabric of our society and the many people who live in rural communities we must ensure that they are able to get jobs, provide for their families and live in their communities.</P>
        <P>The most worrying aspect of what has happened here in the past few months is that we might return to the days when young people had to leave the country for economic reasons.  I know many people who have already left and many more who are contemplating leaving.  I regret that the Government has not sought heretofore to discuss possible methods of job creation.  We have talked a great deal about what we need to do to bridge the gap in our public finances but have not said enough about what we will do to create jobs in our economy.  That is the only way we can pull ourselves out of the present economic mess, not by massive tax hikes across the board but by expanding the economy which has contracted dramatically in recent months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  It is a most welcome development in allowing us to debate the options open to us in tackling head-on the challenges we face.  The proposal to implement a far-reaching economic stimulus package, overseen by a new economic and recovery authority, is welcome because it is real, tangible, looks past tomorrow and next week, can be implemented and, if it is, could create the sustainable jobs our country so badly needs.  As I mentioned during our statements on the budget last week, we need exactly this sort of long-term planning in our time of crisis.  That would allow our people to have real faith in our ability as politicians to work our way out of our difficulties.  Increasing revenue through tax increases is the unimaginative option but doing so through increased economic activity is the only way we can survive in the long term and is exactly what the motion proposes.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased that this motion sets out the significant potential in green energy technology, a facet of our economy that so far we seem to be intent on neglecting.  Several Members of this House, in particular Senator O&rsquo;Malley, have done very valuable work in setting out how we as a nation could become world leaders in research and manufacturing in this sector.</P>
        <P>We have always looked with some degree of deference to the former economic powerhouses of Japan and Taiwan for indications of where the new cutting edge developments in technology should be.  It is interesting to note that only last week the president of Taiwan insisted that green energy technologies will be the top priority on his Government&rsquo;s list of new industries to promote.  Taiwan is looking for new areas to invest in for the future, and clean environmental <Col N="887"/>technologies have become a popular target.  The US, Germany and Japan have named green energy technologies as key investment areas and have been working to promote the use of energy saving devices, including solar panels.  Clean technology was the third highest sector for investment by venture capitalists in the US last year.  A number of prominent multinational companies located in Ireland are already using new technologies for the management of energy use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the area of green energy we might reflect on what one of our European neighbours has been able to achieve.  Three decades ago, Sweden relied on petroleum for 77% of its energy needs.  Today, that figure has shrunk to 30%.  Sweden&rsquo;s use of renewable energy has increased steadily.  No other European country provides as large a proportion of its energy needs from such sources.  Sweden now has a large number of small power plants serving large towns and some regions.  It is a decentralised but effective system that provides most homes with heating and many with electricity.  Of these plants, 60% are run from biomass.  The community of Enk&ouml;ping, 60 km west of Stockholm, which a friend of mine visited recently, is the first community to provide 100% of its electricity and heating needs by processing wood.  This community of 38,000 people has also managed to solve another problem thanks to its power plant: the sludge and carbon dioxide-rich water from the local sewage processing plant serves as fertiliser for growing more wood fuel.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael NewERA proposal focuses in particular on green energy technology.  Ireland could become a world leader in wind and wave energy technology.  We are a small windswept island on the edge of the Atlantic.  On a daily basis we are bombarded by limitless and powerful natural forces that, if properly harnessed, could lead to the sort of advances that have been made in Sweden and other countries.  With smart electricity metering we could see individual householders selling excess green power into the national grid, as already happens in other countries.  However, our experience to date has been to import the know how and the technology to harness this energy.  I read last week that the ESB is to begin a smart metering pilot project across 60,000 homes in this country.  However, we are importing the technology for that pilot project from the USA and Germany.  With a little ingenuity and commitment we could be the country leading the way in research and development in this area.</P>
        <P>This is the first time in a number of months that such a long-term view has been adopted by any party.  Of course, there are elements of this policy that must be discussed and teased out, but it most certainly provides a starting point that should be entertained by every Member of this House who hopes to play a part in our economic recovery.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the very substantial investment in infrastructure the Government has made in electricity, including renewable energy sources, and the very substantial investment in infrastructure the Government has made in upgrading water distribution and treatment works;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />invites the Government to continue to invest, with due regard to the economic and budgetary challenges facing Ireland, in those infrastructure priorities that will assist economic recovery; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />invites the National Pensions Reserve Fund to continue to manage its assets with a view to making the maximum contribution to the cost of future pension liabilities in a manner that will maintain this country&rsquo;s commitment to long-term fiscal stability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and am delighted to have the opportunity to make some points on this issue.  I thank Fine Gael for using their Private Members&rsquo; time to bring forward these proposals.  It is a positive move for us to debate this matter and that proposals are made.  We may agree or disagree as to their merits but the important point is that we engage and come up with real suggestions that some people believe will make a contribution towards putting us on the road to recovery and laying down a foundation for a sustainable growth path for the future.</P>
        <P>I have read the Fine Gael document and there are points in it that I commend.  There are items I like and others I do not like.  I will begin by being mildly facetious.  The document bears a remarkable resemblance to the one in my hand, namely, A New Governance Structure for State Companies, an ICTU document from summer 2005 which contains the diagram seen in the Fine Gael document.</P>

	<P>They are different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>ICTU issued a statement to the effect that it considers the adoption of its proposals of 2005 to be the ultimate form of flattery.  Perhaps Fine Gael will raise that issue with ICTU.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il acknowledges the substantial investment in electricity infrastructure made by the Government in recent years, including in renewable energies.  No Administration in the history of the State has invested more than this one.  In addition, a very substantial investment in infrastructure was made by the Government in upgrading water distribution, treatment works and networks.  We express concern that the proposed investment under the Fine Gael plan will not necessarily yield a commercial return and would result in a potential depletion of the National  Pensions Reserve Fund.  This is a risk.</P>
        <P>My party believes these proposals would result in the establishment of an additional six State companies.  I take the point that some exist already but the document mentions a holding company as well as some existing and some new companies.  I worry about that.  I will not use words such as &ldquo;quango&rdquo; but we should look for consolidation and the bringing together of people, as do some of Fine Gael&rsquo;s other proposals in respect of Oireachtas reform.  That area needs to be refined further.</P><Col N="889"/>
        <P>As our amendment states, our position is to ask Government, having due regard to the economic and budgetary challenges facing Ireland, to continue to invest in those infrastructural priorities that will assist economic recovery, especially those that will contribute most to our competitiveness.  Concerning human infrastructure I would like to see us increase investment in certain aspects of education as envisaged by the smart economy.  Investment in entrepreneurship should be our approach to the entire educational system, from primary school to fourth-level education and industry.</P>
        <P>I would also like to see further investment, for example, in Science Foundation Ireland, from which body, at a cost of approximately &euro;180 million per year, we see a very substantial return.  We might not read so much about this in the media but I was greatly encouraged at a recent briefing that some of the world&rsquo;s biggest companies, such as Glaxo Smith Kline, engage through Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cannon mentioned renewable energy.  In his constituency, IBM is heavily engaged with the Marine Research Institute off the coast of Galway with sensors in place that feed into IBM&rsquo;s technology.  It is also trying to develop photonics as a method of communication for future telecoms.  These enterprises all came about from awards made under the auspices of Science Foundation Ireland.  I would like some of our investment budget to increase funding to such concerns.  I do not know if this is possible but it is certainly the kind of investment we should prioritise, given the limited resources it is clear we will have.  I would like us to focus on investing to the greatest extent possible in the aspects of our physical infrastructure that will contribute most to our competitiveness.  I will say a little more about green energy presently.  This would also encourage the National Pensions Reserve Fund which continues to manage its assets with a view to making the maximum contribution to the cost of future pension liabilities in a manner that will maintain the country&rsquo;s commitment to long-term fiscal stability.</P>
        <P>Many of the proposals in the Fine Gael document replicate the Government&rsquo;s document on the smart economy, published in December, particularly with regard to investment in energy efficiency and new technology.  We broadly welcome the publication of this proposal and of further proposals from Fine Gael or from other parties concerning ways in which we might tackle the biggest crisis faced by the world economy, including ours.  The Government welcomes this document as an acknowledgement of its positive initiatives in these areas and looks forward to the publication of similar proposals by other Opposition parties.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position is that the Fine Gael proposal is not fully thought out in respect of large-scale borrowing.</P>
        <P>An article in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>claimed it was a good idea to have agencies separated from Government whose expenses, in that way, avoid appearing on the balance sheet.  I am not an accountancy wizard but it seems to me that such is the approach that got the world into its current mess.  The article claimed that no borrowing is made because it does not appear on the balance sheet but of course borrowing is taking place.  That is a personal view.</P>
        <P>The Government has invested significantly in infrastructural improvements in the area of green energy, as my colleague, Senator Terry Leyden, suggested today.  Last week the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced that &euro;50 million would be provided for the home energy savings scheme.  The response has been phenomenal, with 94,000 calls to Sustainable Energy Ireland, which is very welcome.  There is a call for even further contractors to register with Sustainable Energy Ireland and give, as the Minister said, a boost to their businesses. This is a very positive move which shows that green innovations in the smart economy are beginning to work.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is proceeding on target with the east-west interconnector due for completion by 2012.  ESB&rsquo;s strategic framework to 2020 will see a total capital investment of &euro;22 billion by the company with 50% of the overall investment package geared towards investments in renewable <Col N="890"/>energy.  I refer to the issue of water which is contained in the Fine Gael proposals.  Since 2000 a total of approximately &euro;4.8 billion has been allocated to the provision of infrastructure, delivery of water and waste water services throughout every constituency and every corner of Ireland.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to continue to invest in water infrastructure to ensure public water supplies comply with drinking water services and to ensure waste water discharges meet the highest international standards.</P>
        <P>Subject to the fiscal and budgetary position, the Government remains committed to further infrastructural investment which would add to the productivity and capacity, support and maintain employment, increase competitiveness and contribute to our Kyoto commitments and President Obama&rsquo;s proposed follow-on from Kyoto.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that positive proposals are coming and we must all redouble our efforts to come up with the most innovative and productive proposals to meet the great challenges facing us.</P>

Like Senator MacSharry I welcome the fact Fine Gael moves closer to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions position which is a very healthy development and which, no doubt, is threatening to those on the Government side of the House.  It does Fine Gael no harm at all.</P>
        <P>I want to focus on one aspect of what is a very progressive document which is more progressive in its proposals than what the Government has proposed in the areas of energy and energy storage, for instance.  The Green Party might have a good look at it and just make sure the Government moves along these lines.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator John Paul Phelan referred to a conversation we had previously.  I took as an example the case of County Mayo.  It is my belief that County Mayo, properly organised and harnessed, could be supplying Ireland with a substantial amount of its energy needs in a very short time indeed.  First and foremost we need to get the Corrib gas on shore.  This demands and requires political leadership.  There has been too much shilly-shallying about this.  We have gone through the process.  Whether I like it or dislike it, this is a democracy.  We set up a structure and put in place the obstacles and put it through the systems.  We demanded all the health and safety requirements and they have met all those requirements.  Whether I like it or not, that is the end of the matter and we should now decide to get the gas on shore.  Anyone looking at Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements and considering that Kinsale will be going off-line within 18 months, knows that we have to do this.  We should be courageous and tell people that this is the action required and the patriotic action is to bring it ashore.  The position of any supposedly left-wing person in this country should be in support of it, not to mention anybody on the business end of the Labour spectrum who will, I am sure, share that view.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a slight correction to the point made by Senator John Paul Phelan.  I was in fact referring to wave energy rather than tidal energy when I said off the north-west Mayo coast is the most energy-rich wave source in Europe.  The average wave height is an unbelievable 2.5 m for the whole year.  There is no place else in Europe with such waves.  There are people <Col N="891"/>down there tearing their hair out because they are not getting the kind of support they need.  It requires three or four pieces of legislation to be revisited and changed rapidly so that licences can be issued.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security has made proposals which the Government should take and run with.  There is not a proper quantum of research and development on this issue happening in our universities.  Wave energy is being developed very successfully in University College Cork and to a lesser extent in two other places.  I plead with the Government.  I know the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on these issues.  I plead with him to set up a bursary in a number of universities on this island for doctorate-level research on the development of wave energy.  We are close to leading the world on this but Scotland is marginally ahead of us at the moment.  We could be a world leader.</P>
        <P>The second issue is that of tidal energy.  There are places on the west coast such as Bull&rsquo;s Mouth, Achill Sound and the Shannon Estuary and the Blaskets Sound where there is a tidal current of four to five knots. It can also be done down by Wexford and along by north Antrim and off Arklow.  Wind off the west coast is an extraordinary resource.  There is currently a proposal to establish a wind farm of 5,000 MW in Mayo.  These are issues which can be moved forward.</P>
        <P>I have spoken many times in this House about the lack of broadband which is crucial to development and which is mentioned in this Fine Gael document.  Does the Minister of State realise that the Bord G&aacute;is pipeline going from County Galway to north Mayo carries alongside it a conduit for fibre optic which could convey broadband to every town in the west?  The only reason it is not filled with that fibre optic is because there is a piece of regulatory legislation which does not allow it to be carried.  Such a situation brings the country into disrepute.  I compliment Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals about the relationship between storage and the electric car and wind energy.  Three or four pieces of legislation need to be unblocked and small amounts of money invested.  Fine Gael is correct when it states there are many positive actions which can be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for allowing me time to contribute and I welcome the Minister of State.  The Minister of State has been in here before and I do not want to repeat myself.  I have a concern about more quangos and more organisations being set up, the objective of which is very worthy.  However, my real concern is the belief that we can create jobs; jobs will be created by entrepreneurs and not by us nor by setting up a new organisation.  I have a great concern that some of the proposals made in the past will not create wealth.</P>
        <P>When I studied economics in university I was reminded that the country could be likened to a family.  If father and mother are doing the knitting or doing the washing for one another and if the son is selling to the daughter, unless some wealth is brought in from outside, they will not survive.  Many of the proposals made in the past do not give us extra wealth.  We have to find a way of either producing something or exporting something, whether that is intellectual property or whatever.  Some of Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals are very worthy but I have a fear that we believe we can create jobs.  It is not the job of Government or of the Oireachtas to create jobs.  They will be created if we can create the right atmosphere.</P>
        <P>I met the American minister for employment who said that her job was to create the environment to enable entrepreneurs to create the jobs and that should be the objective.  When Senator O&rsquo;Toole talked about the different kinds of energy such as wave, tidal and wind, I agree we should be finding a way but it is not happening nearly fast enough.  We must properly discuss and debate our energy future.  The proposal discusses how we will become self-sufficient in energy but this does not seem possible unless we look at more proven sources of energy.  It <Col N="892"/>is easy to pander to the populist view that nuclear energy is simply bad and almost taboo when green energy has such positive connotations.  It is much deeper than that.  Let us look at what is happening in other European countries.  Senator Boyle will be interested that last month, four of the leading Greens who were opposed to nuclear energy changed their attitude.  The head of Greenpeace and others said they have taken the viewpoint that nuclear energy is worthy of discussion.  We have not taken that first step here.</P>
        <P>Nuclear reactors are to be built in Sweden for the first time in nearly 30 years after the Government there decided to abandon the commitment it made in 1980 to phase out nuclear power.  In this country we still cling to that outdated condemnation of nuclear power through our Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Sweden is just one of a number of EU countries that have chosen nuclear energy under pressure to diversify from fossil fuels and meet tough climate change targets for cutting emissions.  Some two thirds of the world&rsquo;s population live in countries that have nuclear energy.  We may have been doing the right thing back in 1999, but we are not doing the right thing now by excluding nuclear power from our discussion.  Sweden is just one of a number of countries that have done that.  Sweden recognises that renewable sources are not being developed quickly enough to decommission nuclear power sources.  Nuclear energy is seen there as part of an energy solution strategy.  We must find a way to do that.  I am not sure I am right, but I am sure we are right to at least discuss it and I would love to see nuclear power discussed as part of our objective.</P>

	<P>The Government has already put in place new building standards for houses, increased support for research and development into wave energy, increased the tariffs for wind energy and brought about ideas on micro-management.  To claim nothing is happening is politically false.  Fine Gael is trying to attach itself to a <i>zeitgeist</i> that exists despite it.  Fine Gael wants to be part of it because the political reality is that the future is in these ideas and being in Government delivering these ideas is the challenge for anybody interested in political office.  I welcome that aspect of what Fine Gael is saying today.  Although the ideas it articulated <Col N="893"/>are not its ideas or new ideas, we need to pursue them.  On that ground there is much to welcome in the motion.</P>
        <P>Given the economic situation and the need for public sector reform, I am intrigued by the idea that we need a new agency.  The idea of public service reform is that we examine our existing network of agencies, many of which are not performing as they should, and ask how can they be rationalised and reorganised.  The last thing we need is a new body to implement measures that are part of a policy agenda this Government is implementing.  If there is a valid political criticism, Fine Gael could say things may not be done as quickly or as competently as they could or they may not be articulated or formulated as well as they could, but those are not the arguments being made this evening.</P>
        <P>We are hearing that a vacuum exists and that as the main Opposition party Fine Gael alone can fill it.  I cannot accept that, particularly in a political context where we need to address these issues collectively.  I hope that as reality dawns on all of us in political life about the need to develop a new economy, these ideas will become common currency among us all.</P>
        <P>I can articulate in two companies the type of support I already see bearing fruit in terms of our future economy.  OceanEnergy is a Cork-based company doing testing for wave energy off the coast of Galway.  It is already on to a three quarter-size model of a turbine which will turn into a full-size model, which will turn into a nest of turbines, which will generate alone half of what we hope to produce in renewable wave energy.  We have set a very ambitious target that 40% of our electricity will be generated by renewable energy by 2020.</P>
        <P>The other company worth talking about is OpenHydro, a group operating from Cooley in Dundalk that specialises in tidal power.  It is producing a turbine that attaches itself to the sea bed and is testing it off the coast of Scotland, but it is being produced in Ireland.  The beauty of such developments in formulating a new economy is that the investment is going in producing jobs in research and development and opportunities in technology that can be sold elsewhere, not only producing energy here, and that is the experience of OpenHydro.  The ultimate advantage of these technologies is that they require heavy engineering solutions.  The production of turbines for wave and tidal energy give an alternative use to old ship yards and dry docks and could employ hundreds of people working with heavy engineering to produce the new hardware of the future.</P>
        <P>This is where Fine Gael&rsquo;s ideas as it articulates them need to be fleshed out.  We are in an era where we exist with our economic situation and have to deal with our environmental reality that has a global impact, but we also have to flesh out ideas.  We are beyond the time in the global economy and the world environment when we can talk about mere aspirations.  This is about putting one&rsquo;s money where one&rsquo;s mouth is and pledging oneself to long-term goals.  If that is where Fine Gael is coming from it will have my support in helping it flesh out that activity, however it cannot claim to do so in the vacuum in which it operates.  These are not new ideas.  They require new thinking.</P>

	<P>Senator McFadden is seeing it.  Returning to Senator Cannon&rsquo;s vantage point, these things are happening and the fact that Fine Gael is choosing not to see them, not only the reality on the ground but the potential created by their happening, is churlish in the extreme.  I hope that not only through the opportunity of a debate such as this evening&rsquo;s that will become more apparent.  I hope that in future motions such as this will be produced with the critiques needed about time, commitment and energy but more importantly flesh on the bone.  Walter Mondale was the candidate in an American presidential election in the late 1980s and he turned to his opponent when making a political point and said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the beef?&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator John Paul Phelan.  I thank him for bringing it forward for debate.  I also thank and congratulate my Cork colleague, Deputy Coveney, on putting so much work into this Fine Gael policy, which was launched last week and is a major step forward in the sense of an Opposition party presenting a series of options that are well thought out, fully costed and which, if enacted, could make a difference.</P>
        <P>The previous speaker, who has left the Chamber, spoke of vacuums and said there was a vacuum on this side of House.  If there is a vacuum currently in the political process and in the broader political debate, it is a vacuum of hope on the Government side of the House and more pertinently on the Government benches.  Members of the public fully understand the economic crisis facing the country.  There is a clear level of public acceptance and understanding of it but there is a lack of hope among the public because there is no confidence, energy or optimism emanating from Government.  That vacuum of hope needs to be filled and it can only be filled by political parties, and from the Fine Gael Party perspective, by presenting a series of ideas and options as to how this country can be turned around and what types of projects can be presented that can make a difference, can ensure people get back to work and that will work in practice as well as in theory.  The type of thinking behind this Fine Gael motion is pertinent.  It is what the public is demanding of all of political parties.</P>
        <P>There was a time when it was enough for an Opposition party simply to oppose Government measures but now it is demanded of us that we present our own ideas, solutions and suggestions.  We were invited to do so by the Government.  In a sense it was demanded of us.  This document, our proposal to set up a new economic and recovery authority, is part of our package of replies.  It is not only worthy of debate but of acceptance and implementation.  It reflects the type of thinking that is demanded and expected of political parties.  Whether the next election is six weeks, six months or two and half years hence, I hope during that period there will be a battle of ideas between the parties.  It is incumbent on all political parties to present what they stand for, how they would change the State and what proposals they would implement.  We have a solid document in this our policy platform, which we are now discussing.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to some of the issues at the core of this Fine Gael policy.  I believe everybody would accept the need for progress in green energy power generation, electric transport etc., but there has been limited progress in those areas in recent years.  I am disappointed Senator Boyle has left the Chamber.  He has often spoke about the Green Party&rsquo;s aspirations in this regard, but we have seen little action from it in the almost two years it has been in the seat of power.</P>
        <P>From a Cork perspective, in terms of green energy, electric transport, fuel systems etc., we must reflect on the now disused, virtually dismantled, decayed sugar factory in Cork and sugar beat industry in Ireland.  There is still an opportunity to produce a fuel mix of bioethanol, biodiesel etc.  That must be brought back on to the political and economic agenda.  The Govern<Col N="895"/>ment has examined such proposals in the past three or four years.  We have the necessary capacity for such development and a number of recent seminars on this topic were held.  We have the capacity to grow a significant level of fuel crops without impacting on our core agri-food need.  This issue is worthy of urgent Government attention.  It is part of the Fine Gael proposal and it is something that can work.</P>
        <P>Our document covers the rollout of broadband.  It has been discussed in this House on numerous occasions and it is very much part of the political agenda but now we want to make it work.  Far too many areas of the country do not have sufficient broadband access.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, made a number of announcements on it, the most recent being a few weeks ago.  We need action now rather than announcements.  Such provision is very much at the core of this Fine Gael policy document that we will invest significantly in the rollout of broadband to ensure that not only every town but every townland across the length and breadth of the country has access to broadband with the advantages that would bring from a commercial, industrial and domestic perspective.  I fully support our policy in that regard.</P>
        <P>The cost of the measures I briefly outlined and of all the measures contained in the document is substantial.  We recognise that the country is currently economically disadvantaged from a financial perspective.  That is the reason the thinking behind the Fine Gael document is new and novel but it is also realistic in the sense that we present an equation of financial measures which will ensure the whole programme will be funded from a number of sources, including the National Pensions Reserve Fund, additional forms of borrowing by the new ERA and the sale of some current State assets.  The State is investing money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is currently resulting in a loss of value in the fund.  The fund&rsquo;s performance during the past 12 to 24 months, like every other pension fund worldwide, has lost a significant share of its value.  It is appropriate that some of this money would be invested in a series of projects that would work and make a difference.  Our suggestion that we examine State assets, consider the sale of a number of them and plough the resources back into this type of thinking and project is sensible, understandable, workable and can make a difference.</P>
        <P>I express the hope that the type of thinking behind this set of ideas will continue to flow from this side of the House.  There is currently a vacuum in Irish politics.  It is a vacuum of hope and vision on the Government side.  There is a demand on us to fill that vacuum with policy proposals and ideas that are workable and which the public demand of us.  This document and our motion represent a positive step in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for putting a good motion before us on which we have had a good debate, but I will be supporting the amendment to it.  I am delighted Fine Gael has put forward some good ideas with which I could certainly agree.  It is a much more positive approach for an Opposition party to put forward proposals, with many of which the Government can agree and is already implementing.  This Government was the first to devise a Government green energy policy.  This is part of what the Government will do over the course of the next five years.  I am glad Fine Gael wants to dovetail its ideas into that policy and many of the ideas put forward are already part of it.  That is a positive approach.</P>
        <P>I proposed a number of weeks ago when the Minister responsible was in the House that the National Pensions Reserve Fund should be extended.  The Government was prudent to ensure the provision of such a fund.  We are lucky it provided it as it has facilitated the recapitalisation of the banks and such moneys invested in the banks at a substantial return.  That is the way to go.</P>
      
        <P>It is important to realise that while there will be upward adjustments in taxes and so forth to meet present day spending, we need to recognise the significance of the insulation grant and <Col N="896"/>public demand for it.  The public is buying into this and we should extend the initiative, thus boosting job creation.  That would be a welcome investment.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important as well to recognise that nothing needs to be added to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The Government could decide that a dividend payment could be made by that fund to incentivise investments mainly being made in the country.  While we could invest outside the country, one can see from the performance of investments outside the country being made by companies such as Canada Life, Hibernian Insurance, etc. that they are not managing people&rsquo;s pensions funds very well.  Anything between 25% and 50% this year will be lost on pension schemes.  We would be far better off offering a smaller dividend to keep our money at home and have it invested in the economy.  That should be the way forward and Fine Gael seems to be agreeing with that.</P>
        <P>Wind, solar and wave energy were mentioned.  We should be leaders in this regard and I am sure we will be, but this is in its infancy at the moment.  I do not believe wave energy has been developed in any economy.  We are further advanced in that regard than most other economies.  We should be doing more with micro-wind and solar energy in the context of housing.  I believe there is enormous potential in that for investment in renewables.  Smart metering, which the Minister is introducing in a scheme of 60,000 or 70,000 houses, will be a great boost to the economy.  If such houses are producers of solar and wind energy, they will be able to sell it back into the grid.  However, this requires every house in the country to have a smart meter.  I believe this would be a major step forward.  That is part of the policy and this is why the Fine Gael motion is very welcome because it supports that policy.</P>
        <P>It is encouraging that when our backs are to the wall we are not scoring political points.  It is incumbent on other parties to do what Fine Gael is doing, namely, putting forward solutions.  If one puts forward solutions one cannot be criticised.  However, when one criticises without offering solutions, that is not a very political way of finding answers for the problems we now have.</P>
        <P>With the budget coming on stream, it is important as well to look at the possibility of having a directory of skills available to us, as I mentioned on the Order of Business.  The Minister might look at compiling such a directory of skills through the unemployment system to see precisely the type of people we have who might need to avail of upskilling.  Most of them will not need to upskill, however, since a good many are professionals.  We could use those professional skills if we knew their extent.  Such people perhaps could do improvement schemes through F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>We should remember that F&Aacute;S has &euro;1 billion at its disposal and we should examine how that money is being spent and whether it might be diverted towards other objectives.  Should we have an entrepreneurial section to promote small business starts?  That could be a worthwhile move instead of looking at the negatives.  Instead of the &euro;21 billion payout every year, we might examine how this could be used more intelligently while ensuring the unemployed have a better chance either to upskill or start new businesses.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that as part of any new budget initiative.  We have to come up with ideas.  Taxation is only a small part of the solution, so I would suggest this is important.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, a former Member of this House, to this very important debate.  More frightening figures were released this morning by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, with another 20,000 people having lost their jobs.  In February it was 1,000 jobs a day.  The Taoiseach has said that the trend appears to indicate that the rate of unemployment is slowing down, but either way this is terrifying.  It is terrifying for the people who have lost their jobs as they turn to social welfare <Col N="897"/>after a period of unprecedented economic growth when they were gainfully employed, earning money and had become accustomed to a certain standard of living.  Now, all of a sudden, they find themselves without work and must face unacceptable delays in obtaining social welfare.  That process is very dispiriting for the persons concerned.  It happened to me in the past, where I lost a job because of a decision taken by a company.  It is enormously traumatic for any individual.  The current figures, when seasonally adjusted, come to 372,800, the biggest live register statistic on record, following the February figures, since records began in 1965.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about taking money out of the economy and we have debated the economy continually in the Seanad for the past six months.  A point that has been put forward by the deputy leader and economic spokesperson of my party, Deputy Joan Burton, is that there is too much emphasis on restoring the public finances.  Obviously, it is a critical mechanism by which we may recuperate and it is to be hoped the economy can recover.  None the less, we have not discussed sufficiently or meaningfully the issue of job protection and creation.  These are every bit as important as restoring the public finances.</P>
        <P>That brings me to a point I have raised several times in this House.  I know from experience in my area &mdash; and I am sure no Member is indifferent to this &mdash; that the Department of Education and Science is spending hundreds of thousands of euro renting prefabricated buildings which are de facto schools in my constituency in west Cork.  It is quite appalling given that the money spent on rent could have been better used had the Department decided to build the extensions and the schools.  This rent is dead money.  That point has been made on several occasions to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>It is time for the Government to show action in this particular regard as an initiative.  Not only would it put in place a decent education infrastructure, people who have lost their jobs because of the downturn in construction would be taken off the dole queue and put back into the workplace.  Each job lost to the economy costs the State around &euro;20,000 in terms of the social welfare bill and lost taxation revenue.  Taking people off the dole queues and putting them back into the economy serves to stimulate and reboot that economy.  The Government must look seriously at this proposal.  It is just not good enough to waste resources while giving money to the unemployed in the form of social welfare.  It ignores the underlying issue.  We do not want a return to the levels of long-term unemployment that obtained throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s.  We need to ensure those who lose their jobs are adequately retrained and upskilled so that when the upturn comes, they can go back into the workforce more qualified and better able to contribute in terms of employment.  That would be very worthwhile and I would like to see a lead being taken in that area.</P>
        <P>Figures released to Deputy Shortall on waiting times for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance are not good enough.  The social welfare office in my town of Dunmanway was closed in July 2007 because the branch manager unfortunately passed away at a rather young age.  We tend to concentrate on urban areas but people in my town of Dunmanway must commute to other towns in west Cork to have their applications for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance processed.  That is not good enough.  Two years ago when this office was closed, there was a strong hope it would reopen but that has not happened.  I accept the point the Government may have made at the time.  The demand for the service then was nowhere near what it is today.  We must be very mindful of that and that in rural areas, there is not the same level of transportation.  That is making an already difficult situation more difficult for those concerned.</P>
        <P>Bandon has one of the longest waiting times to process a social welfare claim.  That is simply unacceptable.  The people in those queues are feeling the brunt of the mismanagement of this economy over the past ten years.  It is bad enough that they must face unemployment without having to experience unnecessary delays.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P>Much has been said about consumer confidence.  I agree with the point made by a Deputy recently that some people may be better off than they were last year or the year before.  However, they are afraid to spend.  The issue of consumer confidence is important and the Government needs to be very cognisant of that when trying to address the current situation.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about Opposition co-operation, which amuses me politically.  We have been told the Opposition can have access to the Department of Finance.  I am not entirely convinced it has the same access as Ministers, although I would not expect it to.  However, let us be clear about Opposition co-operation.  The Government is trying to share the blame with the other side of the House.  The spokespersons on finance need full access to all the up-to-date information, figures and statistics readily available to the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State.  If that information is not made available, it is pointless discussing Opposition co-operation in a meaningful way.</P>
        <P>The pension and income levies are making an already difficult situation worse for those on low incomes and we have debated at length the repercussions of that.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of mortgages about which I have written to the Minister for Finance.  I will continue to make the following point until action is taken.  Over the past two or three years, the mortgage advice available to most young couples and young single people in the fortunate position to obtain a mortgage was to fix their rate because the rate was going up.  That was good advice at the time and pertinent if one was cognisant of economic trends.  The ECB is as close to zero as it ever has been and those on tracker mortgages, because they are tracked to the ECB rate, benefit immediately.  However, those with variable mortgages, like myself, are left to the discretion of the banks.  The banks have been allowed to get away with too much.  I do not want to give them anything else, never mind discretion in passing on interest rate cuts for variable mortgages.</P>
        <P>Thousands of young people are on fixed rate mortgages and the reduction in the ECB rate is of absolutely no benefit to them.  The Government guaranteed the banks and bailed them out but we saw the shenanigans and the blackguarding that went on in regard to chief executive officers and boards of directors.  They literally creamed off the system on the backs of those who were less fortunate than them.  It was appalling to find out lately that Mr. Fingleton&rsquo;s pension is a &euro;27 million or a &euro;28 million deal and that he was paid a &euro;1 million bonus.</P>
        <P>When the legislation was discussed in the other House, Deputy Burton tabled an amendment to cap the salaries and bonuses of bankers.  An assurance was given that they would not get away with this but it was quite a hollow assurance when we saw what happened.  We found out through the media that man got a &euro;1 million bonus.  That is adding insult to injury and it is quite an expensive lesson.</P>
        <P>Will the Government consider the position of those on fixed rate mortgages and try to do something for them?  That is my question to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  It is not good enough to say the variable rate is at the discretion of the banks and that they are fixed.  If we can recapitalise banks, we can expect some<i> quid pro quo</i> in regard to young people whose rates are fixed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is a decent individual, a constituency politician and has experience of this.  He is in a position to do something about it and I urge him to do so.</P>

	<P>While I register that last point, needless to say, the Senator would not expect me to either anticipate or pre-empt any budget measures relating to mortgages.</P><Col N="899"/>
        <P>The Government amendment refers to the substantial investment already made in energy infrastructure and water services.  It invites the Government to continue to invest in those economic priorities that will assist economic recovery.  It also invites the National Pensions Reserve Fund to continue to manage its assets with a view to making the maximum contribution to the cost of future pension liabilities in a manner that will maintain this country&rsquo;s commitment to long-term fiscal stability.  I will come in due course to those elements of the Government&rsquo;s amendment that specifically address the Fine Gael motion.</P>
        <P>The Government welcomes the publication of Fine Gael&rsquo;s document, Rebuilding Ireland &mdash; A New Era for the Irish Economy, as a contribution to public debate.  As Senator Bradford said, it puts forward options and perhaps the comments made here will help the party further refine its ideas.  Given the economic and budgetary challenges Ireland faces, the Government is open to considering any alternative constructive proposals for financing public capital projects.  Ireland still has particular infrastructure ambitions and objectives which need to be progressed.  We must continue to invest in key infrastructure, if we are to position ourselves for a sustainable economic recovery and build an economy that will be competitive and support employment into the future.</P>
        <P>Many of the proposals in the Fine Gael motion replicate the Government&rsquo;s smart economy document which was published last December, in particular in the areas of investment in energy efficiency and new technology.  In that context, the Government welcomes this as an acknowledgment &mdash; implicit anyway &mdash; of its positive initiatives in these areas.</P>
        <P>As well as stabilising public finances and improving competitiveness, supporting those who become unemployed and supporting Irish business and multinational companies, the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s smart economy document published last December include investing in research and development, incentivising more research and development capacity in Ireland, implementing a new green deal to move away from fossil fuel-based energy production through investment in renewable energy to promote the green enterprise sector and the creation of green collar jobs.</P>
        <P>I have some experience in the past of working on economic policy documents in Opposition, so I am familiar with the genre.  They are designed to answer the question, &ldquo;What is your alternative?&rdquo; in a plausible and popular way and, in present circumstances, to sound tough without specifying anything that would seriously frighten any interest groups.  Very often such policies involve repackaging or restructuring existing Government activities to make them look new or in effect shifting around the deck chairs without necessarily adding value.</P>
        <P>Turning to the Fine Gael proposal, it is a very incomplete answer in terms of what needs to be done now with perhaps the tough bits left to a separate document published this afternoon but with which I am not yet familiar.  I do not believe that it is thoroughly thought through.  It is aspirational and the job numbers proposed are unsubstantiated.  Some 100,000 jobs is a very round number.  This type of promise is reminiscent of a previous era in politics in the western world where politicians made dramatic promises about precisely how many jobs their policies would create in a specific timeframe.  Furthermore, the Fine Gael proposal is based on further large-scale borrowing and envisages a new quango-type structure with no clear mandate.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s reservations, in particular that politicians do not create jobs, although with some limited exceptions.  They create conditions in which jobs can be created.  Establishing a body called a new economy and recovery authority does not necessarily mean it will deliver a new economy or recovery.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>It does not mean that it will not either.  I remember in 1987 Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s programme for national recovery with the social partners brought about national recovery.</P><Col N="900"/>
        <P>The Government certainly does not propose to set up another State body, at a time when we are committed to reducing the numbers and improving efficiency and effectiveness through rationalisation of State bodies, a move for which Fine Gael previously indicated strong support.  Fine Gael proposes to fund half its programme, &euro;9.2 billion, from the NPRF and believes that its proposals would be off balance sheet.  In principle, establishing companies to provide services on a commercial basis would bring such investments off balance sheet but it would be important to ensure that this was implemented properly.  To the extent that the NPRF was used to fund new expenditure and this expenditure was on balance sheet, it would need to displace other elements of the NDP in order to maintain the general Government deficit at the required level.  I note that in the fairly recent past the Fine Gael leader simply said that the NDP would be scrapped.  The question arises as to the extent to which the jobs are additional or in substitution.  To be fair to Fine Gael, parts of its document specify that these are additional to what would be already anticipated.  Otherwise, the Fine Gael proposal would increase the general Government deficit, which is the last thing that Ireland needs at a time of severe budgetary stress and when we need to guard our reputation.</P>
        <P>The current structure of the NPRF operating under a commercial investment mandate with a view to making as great a contribution as possible to the cost of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 to at least 2055 has been commented on favourably by international commentators and the credit rating agencies as an indication of the country&rsquo;s commitment to long-term fiscal stability.  A large-scale raid on the kitty in current circumstances in a manner in which the money would not flow back into the fund as was the case with the banks&rsquo; recapitalisation would not impress the markets, on which we depend for our ability to borrow at reasonable rates.  At a time of heightened sensitivity about Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal and economic positions, the existence of the NPRF is taken very positively as a sign of our determination to maintain a fiscal policy which takes account of the potential difficulties posed by longer-term expenditure trends.</P>
        <P>I regard the Fine Gael proposals in their present state as lacking in rigour.  I am not convinced they bear much, if any, resemblance to what Fine Gael would actually do with partners in government.  A short while ago the Fine Gael leader spoke about selling off semi-State bodies, although this is a particularly poor time to do that if one were trying to realise the value of, in many cases, a long investment by the people in such bodies.  That proposal would prevent any danger of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to, getting too close to the trade unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; or indeed the Labour Party for that matter.</P>
        <P>I would like to address some of the infrastructural improvements in the areas of green energy power generation, broadband, and water treatment and distribution in which the Government has invested and the results of which can be clearly seen throughout the country.  Building and maintaining our energy infrastructure is a key strategic priority for the Government.  The most essential part of that infrastructure will be the development of our electricity grid to increase the security and reliability of electricity supplies, improve competitiveness by connecting us to the UK and Europe and enable the uptake of dramatically increased renewable energy.</P>
        <P>The key role in this development will be played by EirGrid, which has set out the roadmap for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission network for the next 17 years in the recently published GRID25.  Overall investment of &euro;4 billion in the infrastructure over a 17-year period in GRID25 will double the capacity of the national grid and allow for major increases in the amounts of renewable energy we can take on to the system.  The upgrade of <Col N="901"/>our grid will mean that citizens, businesses and international investors can be assured of the reliability of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity supply.  This is essential in a world where we are competing for international investment.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is proceeding on target with its east-west interconnector due to be in place by 2012.  This project will contribute to security of supply and competitiveness as well as providing increased potential for the export of wind-generated electricity.  Following Government consent, EirGrid has signed a contract to construct the interconnector, once the relevant planning consents are obtained.  The EU also recently signalled its strong support for this project with an allocation of up to &euro;110 million for the east-west interconnector.  As a young energy official in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach in the early 1980s, I remember trying to advance this project, which has taken 30 years to come to fruition.  Increased North-South interconnection is also critical for increased security of supply and will play an important role in the context of the all-island electricity market.</P>
        <P>The ESB has a strong and proud history of creating much of the infrastructure which has underpinned economic and social development in our country.  In its strategic framework to 2020, the ESB prioritised investment in sustainable energy, particularly in the areas of emissions reductions, renewables, energy efficiency and smart metering.  The company intends to halve its carbon emissions within 12 years and achieve carbon net-zero by 2035.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann also made significant investment in the development of a natural gas transmission and distribution network.  This includes the completion of the North-South gas pipeline which linked the gas markets North and South on the island.  The natural gas network has been extended to a considerable number of towns to their great benefit.  It continues to invest in energy infrastructure in the context of its expanding role as an energy company.  I agree with what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said on the subject of bringing natural gas ashore on the west coast.  We live in a democracy where the rule of law should apply and all procedures have been abided with.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland plays a key role in the Government&rsquo;s investment in the development of renewable energy.  The renewable energy Ireland proposed by Fine Gael would merely be a rebranding of this already very successful body, which runs programmes in both renewable energy and energy efficiency, and has a substantial complement of applied energy research programmes.  It has already established an ocean energy development unit, which is funding a number of different elements of the Government&rsquo;s ocean energy strategy.  Senator Boyle updated us on this and tidal energy. This includes an industry programme designed to ensure that maximum use is made of the opportunity presented by our ocean energy resources and a dedicated grid connected test site.</P>
        <P>SEI energy efficiency schemes include the &euro;50 million home energy savings scheme, an insulation programme designed to assist home owners in making their dwellings more energy efficient.  I was somewhat puzzled to hear Senator Cannon refer to the views of the president of Taiwan on the subject.  This Government, or any previous Government, does not recognise any such person with that title or indeed political entity.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is developing plans to enable 10% of all vehicles in the transport fleet to be powered by electricity by 2020, which would represent 250,000 cars.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of nuclear energy.  As I was once on a nuclear working group and on the atomic energy group in Brussels in the late 1970s, I have some familiarity with this question.  I remain sceptical of its value in an Irish context.  From an economic point of view there is the relative smallness of the energy market and major safety concerns still remain.  When it was last raised, I remember the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, expressing <Col N="902"/>puzzlement.  One could see that what was going through his mind was the question of in which constituency it would be proposed to locate a nuclear power station.</P>

	<P>I do not really have time to go into broadband even though it is mentioned in my script.  The widespread availability of broadband is a major priority for the Government.  The Irish market has taken major strides forward since 2000 when there were only 4,000 broadband subscribers, whereas today there are 1.2 million.  We are now seeing the beginning of next generation broadband.</P>
        <P>The Government has made extensive investment in water infrastructure in recent years and the programme for Government includes a commitment to continue that investment.  By its nature, it is highly capital intensive and there is a continuing need for extensive upgrading of distribution and collection networks.  It is not proven that one new State agency as proposed by Fine Gael would deliver better value for money.  There is no costing in the proposal to show how this new agency would deliver more efficiently or the scale of the charge the State would have to pay to the new agency.</P>
        <P>I hope the Fine Gael Party will take these comments in the spirit in which they are made.  As with all policy documents made by an Opposition party in mid-term, the party will use whatever time there is to the next election to refine those proposals further.  It may be that some of these comments will assist them to do that.</P>
        <P>The Government has invested substantially in green energy, broadband and water treatment in recent years and this will provide the necessary infrastructure to improve Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, make us a more attractive destination for foreign investment and enable us to return to normal growth rates as soon as the current financial and economic downturn recedes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s last comments.  While I assume he meant them to be a great support to the next Government, I did not intend to start bickering when I began my contribution.  However, the tone of the Minister of State&rsquo;s and Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments have been less than helpful.  Whether the motion has some points that are in the Government programme does not matter.  The bottom line is that we have a huge haemorrhage of jobs.  The public at large would not appreciate the kind of silly bickering that is going on in the House between the Minister of State&rsquo;s party and the Green Party, which is most unhelpful.</P>
        <P>Each job that has been lost is costing the Exchequer &euro;20,000 per annum, and 372,800 people have lost their jobs.  While I hate referring to these people as percentages, 11% of the workforce have lost their jobs.  These are individuals with mortgages and car loans who are trying to put their children through college and put food on the table.  They would not appreciate the Minister of State pointing the finger at our very helpful job creation proposals.  The Minister of State should bear in mind that the Government has been in control for 12 years.  What has it done, particularly with regard to green energy?  What has the Green Party done?  Hurlers on the ditch is how I would describe them.</P>
        <P>I worked in the ESB and I know it was established in a crisis in 1927.  We can see how it has evolved, how, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s words, it has adapted to extraordinary technologies and is able to provide the national grid with reliable energy.  However, it is extremely expensive.  Yesterday, I visited a manufacturing company in Athlone which has had to let go 50 people from its employment base of 193 due to unsustainable energy costs.  It is an issue we must examine.  It is referred to in our proposals as well as in the Government&rsquo;s glossy proposals, to <Col N="903"/>which the Minister of State alluded.  We need to address the infrastructure deficit that is costing so much money.  We must allow people to maintain jobs, which is what this motion is about.  I appreciate the idea of smart metering.  I know the Government and the Green Party spoke about this but some measure must be put in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State glossed over the issue of broadband.  Fine Gael had a Private Members&rsquo; motion on broadband some weeks ago.  Broadband access in this country is a disgrace.  Senator Feargal Quinn noted that he does not have broadband 15 miles from this city centre.  That every person does not have access to broadband at this stage is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>We propose to go a step further and introduce next generation broadband, which would make speeds of up to 100 megabytes per second available to 90% of the population.  This would make education, health and entertainment inclusive for our people and would create jobs.  The idea of clean bio-energy and ocean-related wave energy is the way forward.  There must be more investment in research regarding this type of energy, which must be made available and accessible to the public.</P>
        <P>The other part of our motion relates to powering our cars with renewable energy, which would be domestically produced rather than spending millions importing fossil fuels and continuing the dependency on such fuels.  An infrastructure must be developed for a grid whereby we can store renewable energy to power our cars.  This would not cost much and it is an issue we need to begin to consider.</P>
        <P>I also wish to refer to transport and water services.  The Athlone area has been waiting for a main drainage system for I do not know how long.  The River Shannon is now very polluted.  We have come out of the Celtic tiger era but the Government has failed the people of the midlands by not providing a main drainage system.  Our source of drinking water is polluted because there is no system to clean the water from domestic housing and business, which is an outrage.</P>
        <P>That the Minister of State criticises our efforts to support and encourage the Government, when it still has two years left in office, although I am not sure about that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>As I am spokesman on social and family affairs, I wish to refer again to unemployment.  While Senator McCarthy spoke about Dunmanway, Athlone is no different, and I am sure the Minister of State&rsquo;s area is no different either.  The dole queues are getting longer.  It is sad that we have lost our AAA rating and that we have the highest unemployment figures in the eurozone, which is scary considering we had an &euro;8 billion surplus last year.  Where has the money gone?  What is happening to the Government?  The Minister of State did not answer one question as to how the Government proposes to solve the problems.  He only criticised what Fine Gael put forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>When positive proposals are put forward, they should be welcomed.  However, it is difficult to expect that they would be taken on board in full when many aspects are already being implemented.  I am very conscious of the fact that part of the proposal is probably unacceptable in light of what my colleague said in connection with off balance sheet lending.  Off balance sheet lending has been responsible for a major part of the Irish banking crisis.  Perhaps it would be timely if a proposal came forward to ensure that in future banks could only lend a certain percentage linked to their actual reserves in mortgages and commercial loans.</P><Col N="904"/>
        <P>I am also conscious of the fact that there are very positive proposals to go before the Government.  It is not as if we have not been here before.  We have already been around the houses in the 1980s and we came up with very positive ways of creating employment.  Taxes will be increased, property based incentives will be reduced &mdash; they will certainly over time pass their sell-by date &mdash; and more incentives will be introduced in terms of ensuring employment.  When one listens to positive contributions it is then difficult to listen to illogical contributions and to hear at Ard Fheiseanna and in this House people suggest that fixed rate mortgages can be broken as easily as a ministerial diktat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If a financial institution offers a fixed rate mortgage at a rate of 4% or 5%, it must have, correspondingly, a guaranteed income stream of between 6% and 6.5%.  Otherwise, when the European Central Bank, ECB, reduces rates to 1.5% the banks which issued loans at the rate of 5% will not be able to fund them.  This process is funded by mechanisms that include fixed rate mortgages.  Rather than assisting the banks in the current situation, we would be ascribing a non-financially viable situation to them.  It is surprising to hear the Labour Party continue to make impossible suggestions that fixed rate mortgages of 5% be reduced to 3%, and that banks could make up the difference.  That is not feasible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Wind energy provides a wonderful opportunity for Ireland.  Having seen the Arklow Bank wind park and the turbines in the sea, the potential for wind energy in this country is evident.  Ireland and north UK are best placed to ensure we obtain wind energy.  I suggest that because Europe now claims a competence in the area of energy, in the same way as it claims competence in the area of agriculture &mdash; in other words, subsidiarity at European level is reflected at national level &mdash; we would now see a major input from Europe in terms of substantial funding to ensure a back-up supply to Europe in its energy needs.  We have seen twice in the past year the Ukraine cut off the gas supply into Europe from Russia.  Whereas Russia may be a reliable supplier, its transit network is not reliable.  Up to 10% of Europe&rsquo;s energy requirements could be supplied from Ireland and paid for by the EU.  I would like to see that happen.</P>
        <P>The ESB will in the next couple of years invest up to &euro;22 billion in projects, half of which will be in the area of renewable energy.  While this is positive news, there is no doubt but that we have paid significantly for our energy costs and that this in turn has impinged on our competitiveness.  However, the good news is that there will be a 10% reduction in electricity prices for all customers in April and May.  Gas prices for domestic and small and medium enterprises will be reduced by an average of 12% in April.   The &euro;100 million national insulation scheme will unlock great potential for energy efficiency and employment for those employed in the construction industry moving away from the construction of houses.  Households can expect to halve their heating bills, with reductions of &euro;700 per annum.  The total number of jobs created from this initiative will be 7,000.  The proposal regarding on-site generation of electricity in homes and farms across Ireland is to be welcomed.  There is no doubt but that the Government has good green credentials.  Since 2000, the Government has invested &euro;1.6 billion in water schemes alone.</P>
        <P>As regards broadband, Ireland will have 100% coverage by September 2010.  Half of the area involved in the scheme will receive coverage by the end of this year.  Positive initiatives are being undertaken by Government in a wide number of areas.  The price of oil today was $49 a barrel.  Interest rates are currently 1.5% and are expected to fall to 1%.  It is disquieting to hear Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s has reduced Ireland&rsquo;s AAA credit rating.  In the 1980s when we had a 130% debt to GDP, only half the current number of people at work and sky high interest rates of 18%, we managed to pay everybody in full and on time.  The same Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s gave a AAA rating to the sub-prime lenders that almost brought down the world&rsquo;s financial systems. <Col N="905"/> It is also disquieting to hear the comments of some UK commentators in regard to the euro.  For some reason, they downplay the euro and Ireland&rsquo;s role as much as possible.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt we will come through this crisis and that the same elements that made us stronger in the past remain in place to enable us catch the upswing in the world economy whenever it comes.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I am disappointed the Opposition and the Government were not able to put forward a motion with which they could agree, given that they appear to agree on a lot.  There has been a fair amount of point scoring during the debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, gleefully engaged in this when he said that while he welcomes the support of Fine Gael, the good ideas were Government ideas and that others had not been properly costed.  That is the stage we are at.  Obviously, we have not comprehended the nature of the crisis and the two principal parties are not prepared to get behind ideas rather than partisan interests, which is a pity.  There is a great deal of sentiment, coincidentally, in the area of green energy in particular.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This afternoon I met a man who was wearing an interesting pin in his collar, which I thought was an aeroplane.  I asked him what the aeroplane represented and he told me it was not an aeroplane but a symbol for wind energy.  The man concerned is a Minister&rsquo;s adviser.  Obviously, this matter is being taken seriously.  A couple of weeks ago, I was the guest of a friend of a neighbour, Mr. Clarke, at Westbrook Motors and was permitted to drive the new Mitsubishi all electric car, which costs &euro;1 million.  I drove the car around Merrion Square.</P>

	<P>While I was a little nervous, I was very careful.  It was fantastic.  It was silent, with tremendous acceleration and one had good control of the car.  That is green energy.  It was interesting to hear that one of only 11 prototypes was made available to a local garage in north central Dublin.</P>
        <P>I want principally to speak about wave energy.  I believe we have an opportunity to get involved in and become a world leader in this area.  As with food, we have the best national resources.  We are one of the four principal areas in the world wherein wave potential exists, including the Atlantic coast of Europe, in particular Ireland, the west coast of North America, San Francisco to British Colombia, Hawaii and New Zealand.  We are one of four countries with the richest potential for harvesting this energy source.  We have the capacity and innovation to make it.</P>
        <P>I wish to put on the record, as other Members did, that various companies are doing well in this area.  The company to which I refer is Wavebob, which is involved in developing this energy in consultation with other major international companies.  It seems that the single flaw in the Fine Gael proposal is that we do not need the extra level of bureaucracy advocated in it.  We need to clear away the dead wood and red tape and allow the most energetic promotion of new ideas on the part of the Government.</P>
        <P>Wavebob is important because it has solved a number of problems.  The Wavebob structure is an axi-symmetric buoy on slack moorings, which makes it inherently seaworthy.  Its ability to <Col N="906"/>de-tune, or switch off, in seconds is vitally important in a resonating energy absorber.  As waves change all the time, a particularly sensitive and flexible response is needed to collect their energy.  The Wavebob structure is able to respond to high waves of long duration.  The natural frequency of the Wavebob, unlike many other buoys, may be set to match the typical ocean swell, thereby facilitating good energy absorption.  The Wavebob structure can ride large waves of up to 40 m high.  A structure of this type must be sensitive enough to respond to the variability of wave systems.  The Wavebob structure, which has low operating costs and high availability, can be made fairly simply.  The fact that it can stay in the sea for 25 years &mdash; its components are changed on a regular basis &mdash; means that it attracts low capital and maintenance costs while retaining a high level of output.  It can produce enough electricity to supply up to 700 households.  I remind the Minister of State that many innovative products of this nature are available.  We have good technology.  Wavebob, which is an important company, is collaborating with Vattenfall, a Scandinavian company that is at the leading edge of a technology that needs to be encouraged.</P>

While I do not intend to support the Fine Gael motion this evening, I welcome the focus of the debate it has initiated as it is important to make progress in finding solutions.  Last week, Sinn F&eacute;in was the first party to publish a job creation strategy.  We announced 80 proposals that would have a direct impact on the jobs crisis in 2009, at a cost of just over &euro;2 billion.  One of the reasons I am not supporting Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals is that they are too closely aligned to Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s current policies.  Now that Senator Cannon has joined Fine Gael, perhaps it intends to promote the privatisation agenda in a more aggressive manner.  It needs to learn from the mistakes of the past.  Privatisation has never helped this country and will not help us in the current economic climate.  It makes absolutely no sense to advocate the sale of strategically important State companies such as Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, ESB International and Aer Rianta, all of which are making profits for this State.  While such proposals are reckless in the extreme, I welcome other aspects of the Fine Gael document, such as those relating to next generation broadband and the green economy.  When it launched this policy document a week ago, Fine Gael placed particular focus on such investment.  This document has been proposed as a means of fostering job creation.  The reality is that 184,000 people in this State have lost their jobs over the past 12 months.  It is estimated that a further 100,000 people will lose their jobs by the end of this year.  Although Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal involves an investment of &euro;18 billion over three years, the only jobs it would create would be the directors&rsquo; positions in the new quangos.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Those jobs are the only ones that the document proposes to create.  When I examined the timeframe that would apply to Fine Gael&rsquo;s expenditure, I was surprised to note that it would all be done by 2010.  For example, the chief executive officers would be appointed by June of this year.  We need solutions if we are to get the people of this country back to work.  We need a long-term vision.  While I welcome some of the proposals in Fine Gael&rsquo;s document, I do not agree with the manner in which Fine Gael proposes to finance them, which involves the sale of this country&rsquo;s jewels, such as Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  People in County Donegal and many other rural areas cannot access the gas network, just as they could not access broadband services ten years ago.  We still do not have broadband today as we cannot force Eircom to provide it.  Under the Fine Gael proposals, we will be unable to force Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to extend the gas network.  It would be misguided to sell this country&rsquo;s strategically important assets, particularly at a time when they are making a profit for this State.  I will <Col N="907"/>not support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, which is an exercise in back-slapping.  If the Fine Gael document has done anything, it has pointed out the significant flaws in Government policy.  The Government has not invested in what is needed.  While there is much to be welcomed in the Fine Gael document, I oppose its central politics.  It would not create jobs this year, with the exception of the directors&rsquo; positions at the new era company.  It would be wrong to allow a quango to run State assets worth &euro;18 billion as part of a privatisation agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to contribute to this Private Members&rsquo; debate.  I congratulate Fine Gael on tabling the motion before the House.  Aspects of some of Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals are very worthy.  We are all aware that the country is facing huge challenges.  We live in uncertain and anxious times.  The national debt, which is spiralling out of control, is expected to reach more than &euro;50 billion in 2009.  It was &euro;35 billion in 2008, but it is likely to double to over &euro;70 billion next year.  At a time when the global economic recession is taking a real grip, this country&rsquo;s economy is contracting.  It is a serious situation.  There has been a massive increase in unemployment in Ireland, especially as a result of the collapse of the construction industry, which has had serious consequences for associated industries.  In other areas of industry, there have been widespread factory closures, job losses, pay cuts and reductions in working hours, so where are we?  The economy is contracting, the national debt is growing, employment is declining and the global economic recession is taking a firm hold.  Politicians, community leaders and the social partners need to display a unity of purpose during such an unprecedented set of circumstances if we are to defend our economy, stabilise the public finances, protect employment and explore new areas of employment opportunity, especially ones that would have a beneficial impact on the economy.</P>
        <P>This country&rsquo;s scope for growth and development was outlined in the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, which was launched by the Taoiseach in December of last year.  The document in question, which is known as the &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo; document, sets out a number of priorities and actions that the Government will pursue in the short and medium terms.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has set out a number of additional measures this evening.  Under its new leader, Deputy Cowen, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has a new approach to economic renewal.  We are focusing on ensuring that Ireland becomes the world&rsquo;s leading location for the knowledge-based society, innovation and research and development.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s policy approach involves new thinking, greater creativity, innovation and improved productivity.  As a country, Ireland has enjoyed a good run in its short history.  While we have had our ups and downs, especially over the past ten or 12 years, it has been up all the way under Fianna F&aacute;il-led administrations.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Ireland has undergone a massive transformation in recent years, from a country with low wages, restricted products and limited markets to a high value, low tax structure with diverse markets and established trade links.  Our well educated, entrepreneurial and determined population has an abundance of ability.  There is no doubt that the next stage of this country&rsquo;s development will involve an equally big transformation.  If we are to meet the challenges that are ahead as successfully as we met the challenges of the past, we will have to come up with new products and services.  As I understand it, one of the key features of the smart economy document focuses on the need to develop the innovation and ideas component of the economy.  We need to use the knowledge, skills and creativity of our people if we are to effectively translate ideas into valuable processes, products and services.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">A great deal has been said this evening about green issues, such as renewable energy.  The smart economy plan that was launched by the Taoiseach answers the call for a new green deal to stimulate and benefit the Irish economy.  It will help to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy pollution and costs.  I do not have time to go through the Fine Gael policy proposals in <Col N="908"/>detail.  It indicated cuts in the public sector, reduced earnings for people earning in excess of &euro;100,000, a carbon windfall tax, tax on power companies, switching to generic drugs from branded products, reduced spending on decentralisation, a reduction in CIE&rsquo;s subvention, a reduction in various allocations to various State agencies, etc.</P>

	<P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with Senator Twomey.</P>

	<P>Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to say a couple of words on this document and the responses received in the House.  I am amazed that this document has proved to be too right wing for Sinn F&eacute;in and too left wing for some of the Government and Independent representatives.  In the spirit of a party going to the trouble in opposition of presenting a document, I would expect a little more from the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and some of the Government representatives than to mock it as being aspirational and not thought through.  On the whining and griping that comes from Government continuously about this document, if it has proposals to change and improve its provision we are in favour of that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If there is one party for which I want to reserve my particular displeasure, it is the Green Party.  It reminds me of the pigs in George Orwell&rsquo;s <i>Animal Farm</i>, when they used to go around saying &ldquo;Two legs bad, four legs good&rdquo; until they got into the farmhouse themselves and took charge.  They are starting to tell us, &ldquo;Four legs good but two legs better&rdquo;.  Senator Boyle has nothing to offer only constant criticism of any policy offered.  He will never learn anything about an Opposition party&rsquo;s policy documents if he arrives into the House two minutes before he makes his speech and disappears immediately afterwards.  The quality of his researchers is good and no doubt he is getting good briefings from Government, but he needs to stay here for a little longer and learn a little more about what is happening.</P>
        <P>I would like to think if we go to the trouble of presenting these policy documents to the House the Government will say that there are good points and state what it will or will not take out of it.  The Government has been copying Fine Gael policy for some time, which we do not mind &mdash; that is not a problem &mdash; but I would like to see these debates, when we go to the trouble of having them, a little more constructive for the benefit of the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the whole, this was a good debate.  I listened to most of the contributions and there are a couple of matters I want to mention.  I am not familiar with the ICTU document that has been referred to by previous speakers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will give it to Senator John Paul Phelan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I must get a copy.  I understand Senator MacSharry will lay it before the House, and I must take a quick look at it afterwards.</P><Col N="909"/>
        <P>I agree with the view expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  It is disappointing it contains no proposal whatsoever.  It is completely negative.  It expresses opposition to the Fine Gael proposal but provides no positive Government suggestion whatsoever.</P>
        <P>A few points were raised that I want to discuss.  Senator Doherty spoke about the need to keep Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in State control because there is no gas supply in Donegal.  The company is in State control and is not supplying gas to Donegal, and privatising the company will have no effect on that position.  In terms of exposing the company to the full rigours of competition, it might ensure the provision of gas in County Donegal.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey is correct, it is interesting that we are being criticised for being too left wing and too right wing, but nobody else seems to be coming up with any proposal as to how we could inject a stimulus into key areas of the economy.</P>
        <P>This is not about establishing new quangos.  Senator Doherty was completely wrong in suggesting that the only jobs created would be on the board of new quangos.  No new quangos are proposed under this document.  A number of new State companies is proposed, which will replace existing companies that would either be sold or amalgamated because the harsh reality is that many of them are not suitable to the current economic climate and there is a need for reform.  The idea that State institutions should remain in perpetuity makes no sense in a financial situation and a global economic situation which is changing rapidly.</P>
        <P>A good example of rationalisation and of where this NewERA national holding company would come into practice would be in the existing provision of broadband.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is involved in broadband provision, as is the ESB.  These two separate commercial entities which are involved in broadband provision do not ensure that we get the best return for the taxpayer and the citizen, but instead work independently of one another, and that is why the new holding company is essential.</P>
        <P>On the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, the Fine Gael initiative removes the requirement for investment under the stimulus plan from Government borrowing.  That is vitally important given the current position of the public finances.</P>
        <P>A reprioritisation of the national development plan, up to &euro;7 billion, from existing provisions under the plan, will be particularly focused on labour-intensive sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>There will be no depletion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The investments under the fund will be made purely on a commercial basis.   That is what the National Pensions Reserve Fund is for and I do not see why it should not be invested in this country rather than overseas.</P>
        <P>There is also the provision, which other speakers mentioned, on the potential of homes and business to provide energy for themselves and to sell into the national grid.  There are a number of other provisions, although I understand the Cathaoirleach wants me to finish up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The time is up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callely was supportive, but he spoke about the Government&rsquo;s policy on the knowledge-based economy, about which I have heard a great deal but the delivery of which I have not seen.  This Fine Gael document at least is something that proposes concrete changes that would lead to an improvement in our economic position.  We have not yet seen any of that from Government.  I urge the House to support the motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cystic fibrosis is Ireland&rsquo;s most common life threatening inherited disease.  Ireland has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world and the worst strain.  Ireland has the highest mortality rate for cystic fibrosis sufferers in the world and the worst adult treatment for the condition.  It also has the largest proportion of families with more than one child suffering from the condition.  There are an estimated 1,135 sufferers in the country.  Every year approximately 30 to 40 children are born with cystic fibrosis in Ireland and one in 19 Irish people is a carrier of the gene.  There is no cure for cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>It has been shown that the overall condition of cystic fibrosis patients improves when their care is concentrated among specialists who are well aware of all the systems that must be treated.  The future looks uncertain for cystic fibrosis patients as treatment, services and facilities in Ireland remain well below acceptable international standards.</P>
        <P>The Pollack report of 2005 brought the crisis to the public&rsquo;s attention.  It highlighted the serious situation existing at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, the national adult referral centre.  The exposure of immune-suppressed patients to cross-infection is a critical issue in the management of the health of a cystic fibrosis patient.  In his report Dr. Pollack described the lack of segregation and isolation facilities at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in Dublin as dangerous and creating significant risks of cross-infection by virulent organisms.  The hospital treats almost 60% of the country&rsquo;s adult cystic fibrosis population.</P>
        <P>Patients are treated and staff are working in totally unacceptable, overcrowded conditions.  It is critical that cystic fibrosis patients be treated in single rooms with en-suite facilities and that they are not admitted through accident and emergency departments  Younger patients are being exposed to the frightening reality of the disease&rsquo;s progression by sharing wards with older patients.  The death rate among people with cystic fibrosis is intrinsically linked to facilities and specialist staff.  Ireland displays a much higher death rate than England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showing an average life expectancy of 35.  Respiratory infections are the main cause of <Col N="912"/>clinical problems and the leading cause of death for people with cystic fibrosis because constant infections lead to deterioration of the lungs.</P>
        <P>When asked about the funding issue in the D&aacute;il last night, the Minster for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, said that although the 120 bed unit in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital which was promised and due to open in 2010 was a priority, the HSE cannot build it if it does not have the money.  The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland claims that the HSE was inundated with offers of private funding to build and furnish the unit and that the cost to the HSE would be that of staffing the unit.  I remember hearing on a television or radio programme that a private donor was going to put up the money.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State please clarify the matter for the House and the people of Ireland?  On a human level, when one talks to parents who have children with cystic fibrosis, one realises it is a harrowing disease.  The Minister of State is a parent with beautiful children.  Any parent will know what it means to see a child suffering from the day it is born.  I am familiar with one lady who is saving up money for her child to have a lung transplant.  I cannot imagine what it is like to have to deal with this, only that it is brutal.  I plead with the Minister of State to progress this matter and to consider having alternative funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator White.  I apologise that the Minister, Deputy Harney, cannot be in the House and I take the Adjournment on her behalf.  I accept totally the bona fides of the case made by the Senator.  Last night in the D&aacute;il, I took the Adjournment debate, not the Minister.  I made it clear on her behalf that while the HSE states that it does not have the funding at present this situation will be reviewed after the budget of next week.  I will rely on the script prepared for the Minister to outline her position.</P>
        <P>The Minister has consistently emphasised the need to improve facilities and services to persons with cystic fibrosis.  It is worth noting that 48 additional staff, 19 at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, including consultant, nursing and allied health professionals, have been appointed across the hospital system in recent years in order to enhance the level of services provided for persons with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin is the national adult tertiary referral centre for patients with cystic fibrosis.  A number of capital projects to improve the quality of accommodation have been completed at the hospital recently.  These include the refurbishment last year of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for the exclusive use of people with cystic fibrosis.  The eight single rooms have improved the quality of service for people with cystic fibrosis.  The hospital&rsquo;s management works closely with doctors caring for cystic fibrosis patients to ensure the needs of those patients requiring treatment are met within the overall bed complement at the hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is intended that a proposed 120-bed development will include dedicated facilities for patients with cystic fibrosis.  These facilities will include appropriate isolation facilities, as mentioned by the Senator.  Design work and preparation of tender documents continue in respect of the development.  This is a significant capital project in the acute hospitals area.  The HSE&rsquo;s draft capital programme of 2009-13 is currently the subject of consideration.  The Minister has confirmed she will discuss this matter and the overall capital plan with the Health Service Executive after the budget of 7 April.  This is far from being a closed case but it involves seeing what is available in the capital plan which will become obvious to all of us after next Tuesday. <b> </b>At this point, the Minister has stated she will encourage innovative solutions to implement high priority projects, so that services, including for patients with cystic fibrosis, can continue to be developed.</P><Col N="913"/>
        <P>A number of other significant capital projects are being progressed for cystic fibrosis patients throughout the country, including in Beaumont Hospital.  The HSE&rsquo;s expert advisory group on children and families produced a draft policy document on the implementation of a cystic fibrosis screening programme for newborns.  A steering group will be established in 2009 to oversee the roll out of the screening programme.  An independent register for cystic fibrosis has been established.  It is expected that preliminary data offering full analysis relating to median survival here will be available by the third quarter of 2009.</P>
        <P>The Minister is conscious that further improvements are required, including the need to develop community outreach services to facilitate the treatment of patients outside of a hospital setting, where appropriate.  Taken together, the planned developments represent a tangible improvement in the quality of services for people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the capital programme, as promised, is still on the agenda and further clarity will be available after Tuesday next.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Chair&rsquo;s permission to share time equally with Senator McFadden.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for attending.  This matter is very simple.  It asks that we recognise the contribution of carers.  I pay particular tribute to the carers in my area of Cork city, to Mr. Peter Cox and to those involved in the Cork Family Carers Forum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than 106,000 people provide full-time care in our State for the elderly and the sick, in many homes and communities.  The key words are homes and communities.  These people save the State &euro;2.5 billion per year.  It is wrong that the national carers&rsquo; strategy has not been implemented.  This is regressive.  It is important that the Government stops its rhetoric and pious platitudes and delivers and gives a commitment to the cost-neutral elements of the strategy.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State will know, from his current position and from being Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, carers are unique people who provide a great service to the community and the people for whom they care.  They prolong the lives of many people who otherwise would be in institutions and would not have the quality of care that carers provide for them.  There is a need to deliver on the national carers&rsquo; strategy.  I lament the fact the Government has decided not to proceed with this.  Given the recession we face, we all accept that costs must be trimmed and excesses removed.  However, as Senator Paul Bradford stated in this Chamber last week, the cost of providing a non-means tested carers&rsquo; allowance would be minimal to the State.</P>
        <P>The Government is instilling fear, worry and concern in the minds of carers and those for whom they care.  What does this tell us about the Government&rsquo;s attitude to carers and to those who are in need of care or are elderly?  The Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, the HSE and all involved &mdash; stakeholder is the great word we use &mdash; must come together in this recessionary time to deliver on the cost-neutral proposals in the Government&rsquo;s policy on the national carers&rsquo; strategy.</P>
        <P>The Carers Association has proposed many good, sound, sensible cost-neutral proposals and I know the Minister of State is familiar with these.  I cannot understand why there cannot be an announcement to the effect that the carers&rsquo; allowance can be shared by two carers who provide care on a part-time basis.  This relates to the establishment and regulation of quality standards and community and home care services in the delivery of home care packages and other home care services.  The anomaly whereby the income generated by carers who work part-time as home helps with the HSE is taken as means in respect of their carers&rsquo; allowance <Col N="914"/>payment should be rectified.  Income generated by all carers working the allowed 15 hours should not be taken as means.  Carers have raised other issues.  It is important to develop the existing resources at our disposal to put in place a work-life balance that recognises the great work being done by carers and that gives hope and comfort to those being cared for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State.  I wish to highlight this issue because of the fear and the devastating impact that would ensue if there were to be cuts to carers&rsquo; payments in the imminent budget.  As Senator Buttimer has said, a total of &euro;2.5 million has already been saved to the State every year by these people being allowed to care for their relatives in their own homes.  It is Government policy to keep people in their own homes.  What upsets me is that the carers are over a barrel.  Any of us here would care for our elderly relatives and try to keep them at home no matter what and this will still be the case whether the budget is for them or against them.  It is unfair because we need to support these people.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State that the carers&rsquo; strategy be put back on the table and the budget-neutral proposals brought forward by the Carers Association and to which Senator Buttimer referred, be adhered to.  If they are implemented they will not cost the State anything but will be of great assistance to carers who are the unsung heroes whose voices are silent.  They are prepared to do the work anyway, regardless of whether we support them because they love their dear ones.  It is incumbent on us as legislators to care for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Buttimer and McFadden for raising the issue.  I apologise that the Minister for Health and Children is unable to attend to deal with this matter.  I will read the response on her behalf.</P>
        <P>Caring for another person, especially on a full-time basis, can have a huge impact on the carer and on his or her family.  While it can be a very rewarding experience, it often involves sacrifices for the carers and their families, particularly in employment opportunities.  It can also affect the carer&rsquo;s own health.  While the work of carers can be unseen, the important and valuable role played by them in society has been extensively recognised by Government in recent years.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that it has been disappointing for carers and the people for whom they care that the Government was not in a position to publish a strategy at this time.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, met with some of their representatives at the time to inform them of the difficult decision taken by Government. Faced with the current economic situation, it has not been possible to set targets or timelines which can be achieved in the near future.  Publishing a strategy would be making false promises to carers and carers deserve better than that.  It is important to be honest in the commitments we make.  The Government made a commitment to the social partners and to the carer representative groups at the outset that a national carers&rsquo; strategy would not be just a paper exercise.  While much work was done by the interdepartmental working group in 2008, including the production of a number of drafts covering the areas outlined in the terms of reference, a final text, including a list of recommendations, was not completed by the working group.  It is therefore not possible to isolate a set of so called non-financial aspects.</P>
        <P>I wish to reiterate on behalf of the Government that it is acutely aware of the sacrifices made by carers and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.  By way of dealing with the income supports, in budget 2009, the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged 66 or over was increased by &euro;7 to &euro;239 per week and for those aged under 66 by &euro;6.50 to &euro;220.50 per week.  These increases took effect from January 2009.  Recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.</P><Col N="915"/>
        <P>Since 1997, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit, half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been significantly eased over the years and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of &euro;60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure that those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  In June 2006, the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full-time care for the purposes of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant was increased from ten to 15 hours per week.  It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carers will be &euro;650 million in 2009.</P>
        <P>We must also acknowledge that carers need more than just income support, and in particular, they need community health services to assist them in their caring role.  The Government&rsquo;s objective of continued development of community-based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times.  The total additional funding allocated for such services by the Department of Health and Children was in excess of &euro;210 million over the three year period 2006 to 2008, which included, for example, &euro;120 million given for the new home care package initiative, and &euro;55 million new funding to expand the home-help scheme nationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2009, the HSE will continue to promote community and home-based services, which directly benefit both clients and carers around the country, and expects to provide, for example, in the region of 12 million home-help hours, benefiting more than 54,000 people; 4,700 home care packages, benefiting around 11,500 people; and 21,500 day-respite care places.</P>
        <P>Another important service for carers is the ability to take a break from caring.  In this regard, very significant residential respite care continues to be provided in public community nursing units, including community hospitals and long stay residential units across the country.  There are over 700 designated respite care beds provided nationally in these units.  It is estimated that approximately 19,000 people benefit over the course of a full year, based on an average length of stay of two weeks per person.  The HSE is involved in working closely with carer organisations in supporting older people in their own communities through service level agreements with a view to delivering services both nationally and locally within its budget and overall health policy priorities.  For example, in 2008 an additional allocation of almost &euro;2 million was provided between the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society and the Carers Association.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children, including the Health Service Executive, are committed to providing support and services for carers and to working with the carer representative groups to deliver services in a more effective way.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am disappointed the Government has not proceeded with the implementation of the cost-neutral element of the <Col N="916"/>national carers&rsquo; strategy.  The Minister of State in his reply referred to the fact the interdepartmental working group did not complete a final text.  Why was this the case?  Why is it not possible to isolate a set of so-called non-financial aspects?  If it is cost neutral why can it not be implemented?  It does not make sense in the overall, holistic approach to carers.  They have recognised that we are in stringent economic times.  We have all been asked, including the Minister of State, for a cost neutral set of proposals to augment the work in the absence of a national carers&rsquo; strategy.  Why is that not being allowed to go ahead?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years since the Carers Association became active in making representations to the political process one fact that has become very apparent from its deliberations and presentations is that it never wanted commitments or promises made that could not be costed or fulfilled.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s belief that we can never do enough for carers, but I have to support the Government&rsquo;s position by suggesting that producing a list of recommendations that are cost neutral, in the context of the carers&rsquo; strategy as initially outlined, separates the non-cost commitments from those that create the real difficulty.  The Government prefers to wait until economic times are better to produce the strategy in full with the financial costings and the non-financial elements.</P>
        <P>I will ask the carers groups to recognise this is not a stepping back or a cutting of services but a realisation that it would be nonsensical and dishonest of us to give commitments we cannot fulfil.  I take Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion concerns the urgent need for the construction of a new school at Summercove national school in Kinsale in view of the large number of prefab classrooms in the yard and the delay in having this project put together.  I would like to share my time with Senator Michael McCarthy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1997 the Department recognised that a new school was warranted.  It was originally a small two-teacher school and now has 11 or 12 teachers.  What concerns me most is that there is a total of nine prefabs on the school grounds and the square footage of the prefabs quadruples the original size of the old school.  It is worrying that one of the prefabs is 26 years old and falling apart, another is 20 years old, one is ten years old, one eight years old, and so on.  I do not blame the Minister but the year-on-year cost of these prefabs is more than &euro;53,000.  With current low interest rates that would service a loan of approximately &euro;1.25 million.  Over ten or 15 years, had it been built in 1997, that school would have been paid for without this waste of money on prefabs that are not conducive to a good education and are inappropriate.</P>
        <P>I do not blame the Minister but it annoyed me that the Office of Public Works identified a site, a planning application was submitted and then another agent of the Government, the local authority, refused planning and proposed an alternative site, never thinking that this had gone <Col N="917"/>on for ten or 20 years.  The local authority could have been of a broader mind and given planning.  If the planning had been granted the school would have been built by now.  It is a disgrace there is such a delay.  It is a very old chestnut and I hate bringing it up again because people can say our Government has been in power for a long time.  However, it is so frustrating for the 11 teachers, the parents and the pupils that it is worth raising in the Seanad.  I am delighted to see Senator McCarthy supporting the call.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for generously sharing his time with me on the issue of Summercove national school and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I support this call because I do not think it is economically viable to spend money renting prefabricated buildings which will never be permanent educational infrastructure.  There are probably instances in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency.  I raised this at a broader level earlier.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan point is well made.  We spend a great deal of money renting prefabricated buildings.  They are not classrooms, never will be and never were intended to be.  However a custom has developed through practice whereby they formulate an extensive percentage of the school property portfolio.  Perhaps it is the case that the accommodation group in the Department of Education and Science can no longer deal sufficiently well with this.  I have very little faith in that section of the Department and we need to create a new body to deliver this type of infrastructure.  The Department must produce the necessary educational infrastructure, in this case a new school for Summercove.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the school principal, Ms Kathleen Lane, and the teachers and staff who have to work in very difficult circumstances.  The pupils are at the heart of this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and I, along with other candidates, attended a very well-organised meeting at the Carlton Hotel in Kinsale prior to the general election, and we all gave firm commitments that in whatever capacity we emerged after the election we would pursue this issue politically irrespective of who was in Government.  The downturn in construction provides a double benefit, the obvious one being the delivery of a much needed school for the area and the other being the stimulation of the local economy by taking people off social welfare and putting them back into the workforce where they contribute to the Exchequer as taxpayers, which also leads to a social welfare saving.  Every job lost in construction or any related area costs the Exchequer &euro;20,000.  While this is beyond economics and is more important than that, if one were to take that narrow viewpoint, the economic saving for the State is self-explanatory.  I urge the Minister of State, in so far as he can, to deliver a favourable response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for his candid outlining of the facts which he, as a Senator on the Government side, has been raising for quite some time.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, cannot be here to respond.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge and one of the priorities of the Minister for Education and Science.  The Government has increased investment in the school building programme to &euro;656 million this year.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>It underpins a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the schools building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>Summercove national school has a staffing of a principal, seven mainstream teachers and two learning support teachers.  The school&rsquo;s enrolment at 30 September 2008 was 199 pupils, a <Col N="918"/>15% increase on 2003 figures.  The Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure the most appropriate accommodation is delivered for the school&rsquo;s needs.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As the Senators are aware, the Office of Public Works, OPW, which generally acts on behalf of the Department on site acquisitions for schools, previously identified a suitable site and a letter of offer was issued to the owner in 2006.  Unfortunately, however, this offer was rejected.  An alternative site has been identified by the OPW.  An inspection was carried out on this new proposed site and the report was received in the Department in April 2008.  In view of the current budgetary constraints, the Minister for Education and Science is not in a position to provide a definite date for acquiring this site.  The further consideration of the proposed site acquisition and the proposed building project for the school will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senators for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House on behalf of the Minister the position on the need for the location of a site and provision of a new school building for Summercove national school.  I wish I could be more definite but, unfortunately, I cannot be.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response in that the cost of renting prefabs year on year represents an approach that is penny-wise but pound-foolish.  If the school authority has to continue to operate from prefabs for another ten years, that would represent a further &euro;600,000 plus in rent down the drain.  That is the net point.</P>
        <P>When the school authority was given the go ahead for the project and a site was secured with some difficulty, I was extremely disappointed that the local authority, for no great reason, refused planning permission for it.  That caused further frustration when project should have been progressing.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will convey to his senior Minister my frustration and disappointment that this school project is being long-fingered.  It is not economically viable that substantial funds should be paid for the renting of prefabs that are not conducive or appropriate to good education for teachers, children or their parents.</P>

        <P>In support of Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s case, I point out that this is another example, as if one were needed, of a lack of joined-up thinking.  The State, on the one hand, deserves to be commended on requesting the OPW to identify a site for the school, but the local authority, on the other hand, refused planning permission for the school.  That lack of joined-up thinking needs to be examined at a broader level.  In this instance, national Government has done one thing while local government has done something else.  In any event, I urge that progress is made to a point where the site can be acquired and a new school built.</P>
