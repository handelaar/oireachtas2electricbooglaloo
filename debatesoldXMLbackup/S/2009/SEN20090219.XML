	<P>I have received notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to reverse his decision to cut special teacher support for children with mild learning disabilities in St. Teresa&rsquo;s school, Balbriggan.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline when funding will be distributed to the county councils particularly, to Kilkenny County Council, in respect of the housing aid for the elderly and grants for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to consider a three-year extension to planning permissions due to expire in 2009 given the current economic environment and the cost associated with re-applying for permission.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give an update in relation to how well the towns of Buncrana, Moville, Greencastle, Clonmany and Ballyliffen fulfil European standards in relation to waste water and the processes in place between the local authorities and his Department to ensure such regulation compliance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Eugene Regan of the following matter:</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the recasting of the Eurodac regulation and the Dublin regulation, to be referred to the committee without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, motion re European criminal records information system, to be referred to the committee without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 3, Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken and to conclude following the completion of No. 2.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed public service pension levy is unfair and unbalanced.  My party voted against it in the other House.  We recognise more than anybody else the need for the &euro;2 billion in savings in current spending in 2009 and we have offered an alternative strategy.  However, the Government does not seem to listen to anybody.  It will not listen to the Opposition and the social partners, and seems to think it has a monopoly of wisdom on economic affairs.  When will the Minister for Finance amend what he proposes in this pension levy to exclude lower paid public servants from it?  It is not a question of if but of when he will do it.  He will then also have to spell out the proposals of what other economies or cuts will be necessary to make up for that.  I hope that next week, when we will discuss this issue, he will amend this unfair levy, especially in the case of lower paid public servants.</P>
        <P>On another issue, power companies currently charge consumers for the cost of carbon allowances used in power generation, even though they get these allowances free from the Government.  This is not fair.  Fine Gael calls again, as it has previously, for a windfall tax to be imposed on power generation, which would raise approximately &euro;300 million.  This would certainly help ease the burden in other areas and keep vital services going.  Again, this is an area where Fine Gael is making a constructive proposal.  It remains to be seen whether the Government will accept the proposal or consign it to the scrap heap, as it has done with all the other suggestions from this party, the Labour Party and other parties and interested bodies.  We are offering alternative suggestions daily but the Government is not responding.  We hope there will be a definite response next week on this unfair levy.  Its unfairness is bringing lower paid workers out on the streets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the same issue.  It must be addressed.  We are facing strike action throughout the country after two and a half decades of being the country with the best record in Europe in terms of the lowest number of strikes per year, growing productivity in almost every year of the last 15 until 18 months ago and good industrial relations.  That is all fragmenting in front of us.  I cannot answer the questions I am being asked.  I cannot explain to a person in the public sector on &euro;25,000 per year why he is paying more than if he were in the private sector.  He is paying more than the level he or she would pay in the private sector to receive the normal superannuated pension, which would be more or less the same as the &euro;12,000 he would get in the private sector.  I cannot explain to workers why people who are earning more than &euro;90,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000 per year are not being asked to pay anything extra if they are in the private sector.  I do not understand the thinking behind it.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the idea that this is a public sector versus private sector issue.  For me, it is quite simple.  If we must pay, we must pay but &mdash; the last time I raised this the Leader did not <Col N="1121"/>address it in his response &mdash; people earning big money in safe, secure jobs in the private sector should also pay their share.  This is not happening and it cannot be explained to ordinary workers.  We will be faced with embarrassment everywhere, difficulties, production breakdowns, loss to industry and damage to the image of the country.  If the Government intends to make some moves on this, as it appears to be indicating it will, it should sit down with the social partners to ask what can and cannot be done.  It should also meet with the Opposition and discuss the matter in the Houses.  It should recognise that if movement is to be made, it should be as part of a wider scheme.  I ask that there be further engagement on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Over recent months in the current crisis there has been much comment on what has occurred in the banks and the wider economy.  An opinion piece this morning by a former, very senior official in one of the organisations that has figured in the news in recent days offers the most eloquent analysis of what has occurred over this period, particularly in the financial institutions.  I commend the article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> by Mr. Donal Casey.  It is a calm, measured and devastating analysis of what has happened.  One of the conclusions he draws is that public trust in the banking system is &ldquo;shattered beyond repair&rdquo;, to use his phrase.  It is a devastating conclusion.  He is not somebody who is in any way detached or semi-detached from what has occurred, but has been very closely involved in it.  He talks about people living in a parallel universe and so forth.</P>
        <P>My colleagues have called for another debate on the banking system.  I would welcome such a debate but it should be structured in a particular way, whereby we could examine the question of trust and the issues Mr. Casey raises in his excellent article.  We could use that debate on the banks and financial institutions to open a wider debate, which the Leader might consider facilitating, on the issue of confidence and trust in the entire political system.  I accept I sound like a broken record on this but I will continue to do so.  One can say the banking system is broken but a compelling argument can be made that the political system is also broken.  The political system is not responding to the issues people are talking about.</P>
        <P>I am not making a partisan point; I could make many partisan points but I am not making this one in a partisan way.  Every day we can see that the political system is not seen to be responding and facilitating the type of collective effort the Taoiseach and others say we must make.  One of the issues that must be addressed is the profoundly unhealthy relationship that exists between the political system and certain elements of big business, particularly banks and financial institutions.  Members on the other side of the House sometimes roll their eyes and think Members on this side are simply being politically correct when we say this.  However, there should not be a close association between the Taoiseach or other Government Ministers and business persons.  It does not mean that anybody is alleging anything untoward is taking place.  It is simply not proper for Government Ministers ever to have private meetings with senior business figures.  All relationships and contacts with senior business officials and lobbyists should be conducted publicly.  I do not mean out on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green but they should be conducted in a formal way that is recorded so the people who elect and pay their Government can see what is happening and what are those relationships.  I seek a debate on those issues.</P>
        <P>When Members on this side of the House talk about, for example, curbs on freedom of information, political donations and the other issues that irritate some people in the community and some politicians, there is a reason for doing that and calling for regulation.  That puts some form of control and discipline over the sometimes very unhealthy relationship that tends to develop between Government and business.  Judge McCracken spoke about this in his report ten or 11 years ago in the context of his comments on the late Mr. Haughey and the Dunnes payments.  To paraphrase the judge, he said that even if a direct relationship could not be proven in respect of a particular payment, it gives rise to a reasonable suspicion in the eyes of <Col N="1122"/>members of the community that such things are taking place.  People think there is a golden circle.  All the pleading, complaining and irritation by the Taoiseach about it will not solve the problem unless real measures are taken to address it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to arrange an emergency debate today on energy and, in particular, electricity supply.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, should come to the House for the debate.  I welcome in principle the Bord G&aacute;is decision to supply electricity to the residential market.  Heating and energy costs are a significant portion of a householder&rsquo;s budget at present.  Since last night 3,000 people have already signed up with Bord G&aacute;is.  There will be a 10% reduction in price, with another 2% reduction if they are currently Bord G&aacute;is customers.  It is a tremendous offer.  The company hopes to secure 25% of the ESB&rsquo;s supplies.  That could put 25% of workers in the ESB in jeopardy.  The knock-on effect will be that Bord na M&oacute;na workers will be laid off.  I call on the regulator to take the handcuffs off the ESB&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and let it reduce its price by 10% as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been saying it for months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Otherwise, it will be a very unfair market.  It is grossly unfair.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning it got tremendous publicity.  Every Member of the House will probably sign up for it by the weekend over the Internet or by telephone.  That is the reality.  The ESB has increased its workers&rsquo; wages by 3.5% while its senior executives are getting approximately &euro;650,000 per annum.  There are other perks for ESB workers such as free electricity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government doing about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is the regulator has been assigned responsibility for it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Has Senator Leyden a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter requires an emergency debate.  I do not see why we cannot have an emergency debate in this House.  There is no point in having this debate on Tuesday or Wednesday next when approximately 100,000 suppliers will have joined up to Bord G&aacute;is.  Who will read the meters and who will maintain the power lines after a storm?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is well made.  Senator Leyden&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The ESB.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have you a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1123"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I put that question to the Leader.  The question to the Leader is to ask him, in his position of Leader of this House, to invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden can make those points in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to get the debate, that is the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say Senator Leyden has convinced the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Remember that Bord na M&oacute;na supplies peat to the ESB.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden can make those points in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>You are asking the Leader.  We will establish that later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is not a debate, I must try to make them now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the Leader will accede to Senator Leyden&rsquo;s request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Finally, I call on the ten shareholders who received &euro;300 million to put their hands up now.</P>

	<P>Senators Donohoe and Bacik missed out yesterday and they will be taken first today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the state of industrial relations in the country, and in particular, what I believe is happening with Dublin Bus where a union has expressed its intent to strike and stay out until many of its demands on what is happening with the company are met.  If that is correct and if the union is announcing its intention for an all-out strike, this will deal a hammer blow to the city of Dublin.  The morale of people who are doing their best to get in and out of our city to work is already low enough and if they wake up on a Saturday or Sunday morning to find the buses absent that day, and then absent for the days to come, it will be a gigantic problem, not just for those but also for people looking to create work within our city.  We all know we are at the beginning of difficulty and to see a move like this being signalled just at the start is extremely worrying.  I ask the Government to intervene in this and ensure it does not happen.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by responding to what Senator Leyden stated.  If he is looking to move an amendment to the Order of Business, I would be delighted to second it.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues.  The Cathaoirleach kindly chose my matter for the Adjournment last week on Project Kelvin, a major project for the north west <Col N="1125"/>that was given to Derry-Letterkenny because of the gateway status and disadvantaged status of the north west and with the goal of making it a very good location for business.  I raised last week the issue of the sleight of hand that took place that meant the Telehouse was moved to Coleraine.  I ask the Leader to offer my congratulations to all involved who ensured there was a U-turn and the project is now returned to Derry, but to ensure the associated infrastructure and connectivity promised in the original tender will be given exclusively, as intended, to Letterkenny, Derry and Monaghan.  This is an important status.  The change is welcome but the problem should not have arisen in the first place.  The west of the Bann has the same entitlement as the east of the Bann to development and I am glad our voices stating we will not accept this have been acknowledged.  It was a shot across the bows and we intend to continue such battles.</P>
        <P>There has been a serious spate of burglaries in my area of Inishowen.  I can relate to this issue of people wanting heads on plates, but there is such a thing as due process and bringing people with evidence before the courts and laws.  Similarly, in the case of burglaries, people are genuinely scared of what they face.  Anecdotally, the co-op has run out of pick-axes etc., because people want to defend themselves.  This is not a healthy environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Senator Keaveney a question to the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Where can one get a pick-axe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that I have put the issue in context, could we have a debate here on neighbourhood watch, community alert, the Garda Reserve and the types of the processes that can be used to ensure communities are as safe as possible?  While I understand the Garda has committed complete resources and top priority to resolving this issue, a debate in this House on how we can help the community to look after each other, rather than to look to the concept of vigilantism, would be important.</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the criticisms made by Senators Cummins and O&rsquo;Toole of the public service levy.  The real problem at present is the uncertainty surrounding it, the fact that Ministers stated it will be tweaked and yet we have not seen any sign of that tweaking.  Previously, there was tweaking done on the medical cards scheme for the over 70s and a U-turn on that.  There was a U-turn, or tweaking, which ever way one likes to put it, on the 1% levy.  We need to see the public service levy being tweaked in the same way so those on low incomes will not pay this disproportionate amount from their incomes.  I am all in favour of a public service pension levy for those public servants who can afford it and for those who are better paid.  I accept that when the private sector is taking such pain &mdash; we see workers in Dell, Waterford Wedgwood plc, SR Technics etc. being laid off &mdash; we need to pay our share in the public service, and I think public servants recognise that.  However, this levy must be imposed with fairness and competence.  Unfortunately, we are not seeing either of those.</P>
        <P>I also echo calls for a debate on the difficulties in banking and scandals in banks.  We have seen exposed, not just the light-touch regulation that has been passed in relatively recent times but the heavy hand of the criminal law.  Even where there are criminal law powers and quite appropriate criminal law offences in legislation, these are simply not being used.  As I stated previously, we are seeing a lack of enforcement as much as a failure in the legislative framework.  An interesting debate on the radio last night spoke of there being over 300 staff in the Financial Regulator, and yet we are not seeing enforcement and we are not seeing the issue of simple information that people need to restore trust and confidence in the banking system.</P><Col N="1126"/>
        <P>Like Senator Donohoe, I was impressed by Senator Leyden&rsquo;s vocal call for the naming of the ten individuals who bailed out Anglo Irish Bank in this way but it is yet another example of Members on the Government side speaking out of both sides of their mouth.</P>

	<P>I join Senator Leyden in calling for action on the whole issue of electricity prices and the ESB.  Prices can be reduced.  Last year the ESB made hundreds of millions of euro in profits.  People desperately need cuts in their monthly bills and they would certainly welcome it.  The fact that electronic billing has been introduced will obviously cut ESB costs so it can afford to reduce prices.  In the UK many electricity companies are cutting their costs to consumers by as much as 10% because of the advent of electronic billing.  There is scope for the ESB, too, to make changes and I would encourage the regulator to impress on the company the need to do so. </P>
        <P>I agree with other Senators on the whole issue involving the naming and shaming of the golden circle.  I listened to the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, on today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and he said that to do so might be prejudicial to any future trials.  He also said he did not believe it was right to do so just to satisfy curiosity.  However, this is not about satisfying anybody&rsquo;s curiosity, it is about trying to restore some confidence, not just in the banking system, but in the political system and our international reputation.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;both politically and economically.  The reason people are suspicious includes the following: the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, did not show real muscle in dealing with the banks.  He did not clear out the boards in line with good international practice; he did not adequately protect home owners; and he did not use his leverage to unburden hard-pressed couples with fixed rate mortgages when he had total bargaining power with the banks.  This smells rotten and it is time for the Government to come clean, just as has been said. </P>
        <P>I want to ask the Leader where is the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in all of this.  The chances are that he has a great deal of information he could share with us.  I call on him today to also come clean and give information for the sake of the country&rsquo;s political and economic stability.  It is really a case of Rome burning while Nero fiddles, and the farmer is now burnt.</P>
        <P>Poor management by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in relation to the farm waste management scheme leaves some farmers in dire straits.

	<P>I join others in welcoming an early debate next week on the pension levy.  It remains my hope and that of colleagues in this House that a mechanism can be found whereby we can ensure those people in the lower paid brackets are looked after in a better way than is currently proposed.  The measures that have had to be introduced are enor<Col N="1128"/>mously traumatic for a generation and a half, effectively, which has known nothing other than increments and benchmarking, with positive steps and measures.  However, the situation has changed drastically and measures have had to be introduced that were unimaginable some months ago, never mind years ago. </P>
        <P Just="Left">None the less, while we cannot direct the wind, we can adjust the sails.  I hope that, in the context of the debates in both Houses on the levy legislation, a mechanism can be found that is equitable and fair to all concerned, particularly those who are less well-off.  We must spare a thought for the unemployed and the many people in the private sector who face the prospect of unemployment and the lack of security because, after all, they comprise 80% of the workforce, which is much higher than the number of those of us in the public sector who are somewhat luckier.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the highest respect for my colleague, Senator MacSharry, but the present Government has been in power for so long that, accident or not, it has presided over a situation where the four pillars of society have come into disrepute, the church, the law, the banks and politics.  Not a single one of them can stand with its head high in this State.  That is partly because the Government has been in power for too long and it has become too lax.  We have heard about tweaking the pensions Bill, but one thing is certain, the people will tweak the Government at the first opportunity. </P>
        <P>As regards the pensions Bill, I would support the Government in taking hard decisions, and so would the people of Ireland, but they will not do it when there is an unsteady hand on the tiller and when there is complete uncertainty and total amateurishness in evidence.  Unfortunately &mdash; I hate to have to say it &mdash; this is what has happened.  The pensions reserve Bill has been instanced.</P>
        <P>I was in this House before Christmas, at the time of the budget, when the Minister for Finance gave an undertaking that the weakest, the poor, the children, the needy etc. would be preserved.  Now early in the new year we have the pensions reserve legislation, under section 17 of which early child care supplement is to be cut by 10% and the entitlement of children is to be terminated six months early.  This is an extraordinary abandonment of the weakest people in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator support the calls for a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support them strongly for the reasons I have set out.  An attempt was made to conceal this measure by sticking it into the final, non-procedural section of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I want to address the question of the pensions levy.  It is astonishing to me that the Government did not seem to know what it was doing.  Two Ministers gave two totally different answers to the question of whether the levy will be gross or net of income.  One said it will be gross, whereas the other said it will be net.  There is a difference between the two.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Half a billion euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody receives a tax break on pensions.  The Government set the levy at 3%, 6% and 10% depending on the rates of taxation.  The actual rate is therefore 2%, <Col N="1130"/>5% and 6% because the people on the highest salaries receive the largest tax breaks.  That is a difference of &euro;215 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make these points during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>These people are obviously asleep at the wheel.  Unlike private sector pensions, which are paid directly into a pension fund, public sector pensions were until recently paid from current expenditure.  Now that we have the National Pensions Reserve Fund, that is where the money will go.  Instead of reducing Government debt, it will top up the emergency fund to get Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and the rest out of a hole.  That does not gladden my heart.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to seek comment from the Government on the apparent inability of leading people in the financial sector to tell the truth.  We are offered a classic example of this on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> of today.  A gentleman called Dr. Michael Walsh has resigned, giving as his reason that the institution over which he presided cannot survive without a financial injection from the Government.  His board, led by Mr. Michael Fingleton, denies any financial implication.  That cannot possibly be true.</P>
        <P>Next Monday, Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe will be persecuted in the Supreme Court for the costs of a case she took, the facts of which are inarguable.  She was sexually abused in a church-run school.  The church passed the buck to the State, which passed the buck back to the church.  She is now being hounded and could lose her home.  Even as we let FitzPatrick and the rest of the golden circle, the existence of whom I have no doubt regardless of whether they were in the tent in Galway, off the hook, we persecute an ordinary citizen.</P>

	<P>We have been presented with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009 to deal with the pensions levy.  It appears the Government is intent on legislating by emergency whenever the opportunity arises.  We have done this in regard to the State guarantee scheme and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and now we are about to rush this legislation through the Houses.  That is an entirely inappropriate practice because we should be given time to consider this legislation.  With the benefit of time, more knowledge has been made available by the Government to the Opposition than was the case when these legislative matters were rushed through.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am concerned the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009 &mdash; a long title for a Bill &mdash; is to be rushed through this House next week.  The Leader has stated the Bill will be taken in the House next Wednesday at 8 p.m.   From memory, we, in both Houses, do not do a very good job when we pass legislation in this manner.  Rushed legislation is usually bad legislation.  I recall the Leader, following a point made by Senator Ross in regard to legislation being debated in this House some six or seven years ago, coming into the House at midnight and informing us the Bill was being dropped.  Legislation which receives attention is usually better legislation.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill was published yesterday and the first opportunity which this House will have to debate it will be at 8 p.m. next Wednesday.  I urge the Leader to ensure this House gives more consideration to this legislation.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators spoke about energy and electricity.  It is time we debated energy in general.  I am concerned we are not considering this issue in the long term.  We import practically all of our power.  I gather that if we do manage to obtain sustainable energy, be it wave, tidal or wind &mdash; it is unlikely to be solar &mdash; it is likely to be of only minimal benefit during the next 20 years.  We should debate this issue and should not exclude from such debate the issue of nuclear energy.  I am not proposing we use nuclear energy as I do not know enough about it.  However, I read earlier in the week that 43 countries in the world have nuclear energy.  Two thirds of the world population live in countries that have nuclear energy.  We have decided not even to consider nuclear energy or include discussion of it in our debate.  I suggest we have a debate on energy which includes all options.</P>
        <P>I am concerned at the closeness of crime to normal business.  I learned this week of a debt collecting agency which has employed a person known to have been a criminal in the past.  I am concerned at the acceptance of this as a means of collecting debt.  I was impressed to hear this week that a shopkeeper in Galway seeking to recoup debts for some years has displayed on his window the names of his debtors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Quinn seeking a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like a debate on the ability to run businesses without having to resort to criminality.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, a bad debt collecting company was established.  The debt collector would park outside the debtor&rsquo;s door, knock and ask to speak to the debtor and if told the person was not home, would sit outside and wait until the person came home.  People who had bad debt collectors sit outside their homes or businesses for 24 hours quickly paid up.  It is time we debated the issue of criminality once again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Leader provide time for a debate on social partnership.  The reality is that social partnership has served this country well.  Reference was made earlier <Col N="1134"/>to the difficulties in the past couple of months in the social partnership framework.  If we are to move forward in these difficult times we must request the Taoiseach to make a state of the nation address on television, give the clear facts, without party political implications, and tell the people we can and will get through these difficult times if we work together.  We cannot continue saying that the next income grade should pay higher tax or that before we are prepared to do our bit we want something done to sort out issues in other areas.  Many of the issues with which we must deal are immediate.  We need to take action now.  We cannot wait until the world is perfect to ensure we do what is right.</P>
        <P>I make a renewed call for a debate on social partnership to restate the benefits it has brought to this State and to request that everybody works together to ensure we move forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s call for the restoration of the social partnership process, an issue I also raised yesterday.  Social partnership has served us well in the past, in particular in the 1980s when we had massive economic difficulties, worsened by unemployment and mass emigration.  I support the call for the restoration of the social partnership process, not least to bring everybody on board and to find a fair and balanced way forward.  Rather than dump the economic crisis on the backs of public sector workers, in particular low earners, we should go after others to ensure they pay their fair share.</P>
        <P>In an effort to restore confidence not alone in the political system but in the banking system, it is important the Government takes the lead and, if possible, identifies the ten people involved in the controversy at Anglo Irish Bank.  It is important in these straitened times, when people are expected to put their shoulders to the wheel, that there is some element of credibility at the highest level in society, including in the banking system.  People need to have confidence in the banking and political systems at this difficult time.  I ask that the Leader request his colleagues in Government to ensure there is as much transparency as possible in regard to this issue, and that involves naming the ten people involved in the controversy at Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Alex White referred earlier to an article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>, which is good.  However, I sincerely hope the damage to our banking system is not beyond repair.  We must have hope.  There is no doubt but that the drip feed of allegations and wrongdoing have been damaging to the system.  Reference was made to the resignation of the chairman of Irish Nationwide, a man who has done nothing wrong.  However, he has cleared the way for the Government to act in regard to that bank, which is one of the six institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader tell us the reason for the Government&rsquo;s delay in introducing the necessary restructuring of the banks, including Irish Life &amp; Permanent?  We need to make a clean breast of things and stop dilly dallying.  Two public interest directors have been appointed to each of the six institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme.  These people of experience and repute have been in place long enough to determine if there are people in those institutions whose positions are untenable, either at board or executive level.  For the sake of the country, these people should take themselves off the stage.  The public interest directors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-should be guiding the Government in this matter and ensuring matters are rectified.  As I said yesterday, if they could get the banks to apologise publicly for what happened, as their British counterparts have done, that would help.  Many Senators have spoken of the need for trust and confidence.  We will have neither without first clearing the decks.  We cannot move forward until that is done.  Perhaps the Leader will respond to my <Col N="1135"/>question in regard to restructuring of the six institutions covered by the guarantee scheme and in regard to how we can move forward.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Cummins&rsquo;s remarks in regard to the pension levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cummins made that point very well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Senators who have called for identification of those involved in the support operation for Anglo Irish Bank.  The sooner it is done, the better because there is a kind of opaqueness about what is going on with this shadowy carry-on which people cannot understand and which nobody is prepared to reveal to them.</P>

	<P>There are people not far away from here who know those names.  It certainly would relieve some of the reasonable public disquiet if they were released without any prejudice.</P>
        <P>That said, we are in danger every day in this House of whistling past the graveyard.  I ask the Leader to comment on the following.  I have a great deal of sympathy with much of what was said on the economy on all sides today about the real problems which are being faced, but I am not sure people realise the situation we are in.  This is not just a matter of one problem here and another problem there being solved &mdash; the pension levy, the banks and so on, which are all cumulative and disastrous.  The real question is whether Ireland is facing national bankruptcy.  Although I did not hear it expressed in the House, I heard it expressed yesterday and it is the question on people&rsquo;s lips which is not often uttered publicly.  I was staggered to hear this question asked yesterday on George Hook&rsquo;s programme on Newstalk radio where an absolutely reputable economist from overseas, not in the pay of any of the banks, asked the question whether Ireland is facing national bankruptcy.  He suggested we were heading in that direction.</P>
        <P>That is not alarmist.  It is actually where we are going and is what everybody outside this country but not inside it is suggesting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.  I want to ask the Leader if we could have a debate on a particular aspect of this.  That is a question which everybody outside this country is muttering.  One can see by the credit rating in the international markets what they think.  The answer is we are in danger of defaulting at some stage.  It is an issue we will have to face up to because it is the kind of situation we are in.</P>
        <P>It is not necessarily helpful to constantly bash the Government, so to speak, on this issue.  There are other people involved who have contributed to it.  The root problem in financial regulation is the Financial Regulator.  I am tired, every time I hear a politician defending what has been going on the banks, of hearing them say: &ldquo;Do not worry, it is being investigated by <Col N="1136"/>the Financial Regulator.&rdquo;  They topped Mr. Neary, which is fair enough, but the Financial Regulator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are points that can be made in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for a debate on this for the following reason.  The Financial Regulator is an institution which has lost the faith of the international markets.  They do not think it can do it because they think it is absolutely genetically flawed.  That is the problem we will have to attack next.  We will have to face it because it is no good not facing these appalling facts which the international markets, which are sinking Ireland into the mire, are beginning to face.  We will have to do the following, namely, ask whether we are facing financial bankruptcy and ask whether the whole institution of the regulator has the confidence of the international markets, which it does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time when people are afraid of losing their jobs and not having money to pay bills, mortgages and groceries, of evaporating retirement funds and a complete lack of confidence in the key State institutions, as Senator Ross rightly said, I want to ask the Leader a series of questions.  In so doing, I emphasise that the Fine Gael party will vehemently oppose any plan to rush through the emergency legislation next week.  We will fundamentally oppose the Government, first, because the legislation is rushed and, second, because it is unfair.  In light of the comments of the Minister for Finance in his so-called tweaking U-turn on the Bill, we need time to debate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are points that can be made in the debate on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  I want to ask the Leader a series of questions relating to the economy and governance, and I would like a response.  Who is telling the truth to the people regarding the real state of the economy?  Is what Senator Ross said correct?  If it is, we need to hear it.  We have been told lies for long enough.  Is there any real accountability with regard to the regulator, the banks or the Government?  Who is accountable and where is the accountability to the ordinary people who are standing today in the dole queue at Clarke&rsquo;s Bridge in Cork?  Who is in charge?  Is it the Government, the cosy cartel, the golden circle or the banks?  Where has the leadership been for the past 12 years?</P>
        <P>With regard to the so-called golden circle, all I can say is that I am not one of them.  Senator Leyden might think he knows who they are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not one of them either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>They have done the ordinary person in this country a complete disservice and they are a disgrace to the island of Ireland.  They should be held accountable along with their buddies and the Government which failed to govern for the past 12 years.</P>
        <P>I want the Leader specifically to answer those questions because the people outside, the people working in this House, ordinary people paying their taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are questions that can be asked during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude.  Those people want answers.  They do not want spin or Fianna F&aacute;il-speak, they want cogent, clear answers and confidence to be restored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning we all received a survey from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association suggesting that 48% of those in small and medium businesses <Col N="1137"/>who were surveyed had been refused credit by the banks we are discussing today.  I completely agree with Senator Ross that it is a culmination of all the crises which will cause our country to go down the tubes.  The banks have a huge role to play in giving credit to small and medium enterprises so they can function, maintain jobs and keep money in circulation.  I know the Leader has a keen interest in small and medium enterprises and I ask him to invite the Minister to the House to discuss this issue.</P>
        <P>In a discussion last night with friends, I was told of the situation in Iceland, which has gone bankrupt.  People there are driving up to get food relief in their swanky 4x4 vehicles.  This is happening not far from here.  Thank God we are part of the EU and, please God, we will not be in the same situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Cummins, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Leyden, Bacik, Hannigan, Healy Eames, MacSharry, Norris, Regan, Buttimer, Quinn, Hanafin, McCarthy, Coghlan, Ross and other Senators have again highlighted their concerns in regard to the banking dilemma in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>The Irish people have been a resilient race for many generations.  In the time I have been around, I have seen at least three downturns in the economy.  On every occasion, the Irish people came back and proved to the world their massive ability.  The fact is we have had huge success in our lifetime, if we look back on it.  Never could we have imagined the success our country has had, and the younger generations have had, in the past 12 to 15 years.  We must acknowledge that a huge amount has been achieved.  We have all lived to see it, we have all participated in it and we have played a part, as legislators, in assisting Governments of the day so that this could happen and that the correct policies were in place for it to happen.</P>
        <P>However, there is currently a world downturn.  We are no exception and certainly we are affected.  As I said in the House on Tuesday, 80% of the produce of the farming community must be exported and 31% of all exports are from agricultural produce, whether beef, cereals or otherwise.  Given our status as an island nation, energy costs, which have been highlighted by many colleagues, are vital.  An opportunity has now presented itself, with Bord G&aacute;is coming in with reductions of 10% and 12%, and 14% for those who are customers.  Last Friday in Mullingar the Taoiseach instructed the regulator to ensure the ESB reduces its charges to the consumer by 15% in the next month or two.  That represents a reduction of almost 30% in energy costs.  Progress is taking place in areas affecting those most in need.  That is why the contributions of Members in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on the Order of Business are invaluable.  They highlight the concerns of constituents on a daily basis and we can pass on these serious concerns and views to Ministers and Departments.  I have heard Senator Ross outline to the House his serious concerns and he has significant experience in the field of finance.  I have also heard concerns from those with legal qualifications on the Opposition side.  There are three legal people on the Opposition benches.  We are all aware that the majority of those in the Law Library are not on the Fianna F&aacute;il side.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>

	<P>I refer to the request from Senator Cummins and other Senators for a special debate.  Senators Leyden, Hannigan and Quinn called for a debate on energy, wind power and alternative energy.  I have no difficulty allocating a half a day for this purpose.  We are an island nation.  This is a very serious opportunity to address the challenges of alternative energy for industry and especially for the creation of jobs.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called for a debate on industrial relations in general.  I have no difficulty in allocating time for that.  Senator Keaveney offered her congratulations on the project brought back to Derry.  I wish to be associated with those comments and I will remember the views of the Member regarding future debates in this area.  Senator Keaveney called for a debate on the <Col N="1140"/>Garda reserve force, neighbourhood watch and all the various community help organisations.  I have no difficulty in putting aside time for this at some point in the future.  Senator Camillus Glynn called for a debate on the establishment of joint policing committees.

	<P>Oireachtas and local authority members will meet with officials and the Garda to establish how we can help and assist in respect of the matters and challenges in each constituency area.  I have no difficultly in holding a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to farmers and the waste management scheme.  We are all aware there was &euro;150 million allocated for the scheme last year.  However, the success of the scheme amounts to between &euro;416 million and &euro;417 million.  As we are aware the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been a hard working, dedicated rural man from our neighbouring constituency in Cavan-Monaghan.  I can only speak in the highest terms of the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith.  Everything that can be done is being done and payments will be made.  I understand that negotiation, discussion and consultation is taking place at the highest level involving Mr. Padraig Walsh and his team along with the Minister&rsquo;s team to establish how we can help those who need help first and who need this grant.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn highlighted concerns regarding crime and bad debt collections and his experience in the past.  His suggestion to the House was not a bad idea.  For those allegedly involved in crime to be collecting bad debts for anyone is not to be recommended and I take the proposal in the spirit in which it was given.  We hope to have a lengthy debate on justice and related matters at the very earliest opportunity.  There are many Bills due before the House related to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the portfolio of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  There is often an opportunity on Second Stage when the Minister is present and later on Committee Stage for questions and answers and the up to date position can be provided by the Minister in this area.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin and McCarthy called for a debate on social partnership.  I have no difficulty in this taking place.  I wish to see the social partners and the Government staying close together.  The success of our country since 1987 has been the success of the Government and social partners and everyone participating in our discussion.</P>

	<P>The achievements of the social partners have been acknowledged worldwide.  They have been examined by many nations, some of which have sent delegations here, including the United States of America.  I had the great honour of meeting Mr. Tim Kaine, the Governor of Virginia.  He acknowledged the wonderful achievements of Ireland in the 20 years during which the social partners were closely involved in deliberations.  That success must be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden referred to small and medium sized businesses and the 48% which have been refused credit.  I understand this has been the norm for the past 12 months.  However, now some 12 months have past and we have assisted the banks in their hour of need.  I understand the Government initially participated in assisting the banks in the interests of the depositors and is now re-financing them.  On the Order of Business last Tuesday I welcomed the fact that two major banks are making loans available to first-time buyers at 2.45%.</P>

I want to hear on the Order of Business from colleagues in the House if this is not happening in their areas.  If it is not, we on the Government side will bring the strongest possible pressure to bear and tell the Minister for Finance why and where this is the case.  We will consider what we in the Seanad can do to highlight this issue every week. </P>

We have supported amendments on how these ports should be formed and run and expressed our concerns regarding many aspects of the Bill.  We have nothing further to say.  I reckon that we have debated the Bill since the middle of last October.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern.  Like the previous speakers, I do not intend to go into further fine detail <Col N="1143"/>on a Bill that has already been fairly well thrashed out in the House.  However, it would be remiss of me not to go over one or two points raised by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, who is indisposed today and cannot be with us.  He, and other colleagues, put up a long battle against the proposed amalgamation of Cork and Bantry harbours.  He pointed out that this is not popular in Bantry where it is seen as totally unnecessary.  Were he here today, I am sure the Senator would continue at further length on that point.</P>
        <P>It is comical to suggest to people in Fenit that Shannon Foynes Port, with which it is to be associated, is its local port.  Cork is nearer as the crow flies and Fenit would have more in common with Cork than with Shannon Foynes, which is a large industrial and commercial port.</P>
        <P>Last weekend I chanced upon the chairman of the Wexford Harbour Commissioners.  While they do not fall under the remit of this Bill, he said they object strongly to proposals that the Department take them over.  There is a fair amount of disquiet about this matter, not all centred on the west coast.</P>
        <P>The directors and connections of the Shannon Foynes Port Company are horrified at the idea that they must take responsibility for Fenit.  There is so much happening in the Shannon Estuary that it is not practical to divert the company&rsquo;s business focus from the estuary to Fenit, which is an angling and tourist base, with the exception of one major commercial customer.  The reports are that the LNG project in the Shannon Estuary, which is crucial to our energy requirements, is getting the go-ahead in its latest planning stages.  The Foreshore Act sets one final hurdle for it but I hope that it will go through without further objections.</P>
        <P>The future of the region depends on this development, with many jobs at stake.  In this recession the country badly wants a major project such as this, and money up front.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, I am aware of the significance of an alternative new energy source in LNG which will free us from the tyranny of dependence on the infamous Russian gas pipeline.  This is the Shannon Foynes Port Company&rsquo;s baby.</P>
        <P>We must also consider the future of Aughinish Alumina, one of the biggest employers in the country, which, as its biggest single customer, contributes significantly to the budget of the Shannon Foynes Port Company.  There have been scares about the future of the plant and it is not possible for the harbour board to deviate from concentration on such a large client to deal with other smaller fish.  There is a board in Fenit which is more than happy to run, and is capable of running, the harbour at a profit.  It has drawn up interesting new development plans with the Department.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is also an issue in the Shannon Estuary regarding the future of Tarbert power station.  Until recently, it was one of the major contributors to the national grid.  Moneypoint is on the other side, and both stations are big customers of the port company.  There is also an emphasis in Limerick city on the Limerick docklands initiative which was stalled owing to local politics and business politics in the city.  That was a shame because I was in support of it as a director of the port company.  It is to be hoped the initiative will re-emerge.  The port company has enough to do on all of these issues without having to get involved with Fenit.</P>
        <P>We have thrashed this issue out by now.  The Minister of State has heard just about enough.  I am sure it will be thrashed out again at a later stage when Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is back in full health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  We have had much discussion on the matter and I have replied before to the strong views expressed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1144"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has replied several times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental point is that this is enabling legislation that follows on from various consultants&rsquo; reports and from the Government&rsquo;s ports policy published a few years ago.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned Wexford, but Wexford is in a different category.  The reason Bantry and Fenit are mentioned is that when the original legislation was being published, the option existed to set up a private company or transfer them to a local authority.  Wexford does not have any commercial traffic of significance.  Talks are ongoing between Wexford Harbour board and Wexford County Council about transferring that.  This has happened with a number of smaller harbour commissioners where the functions have been transferred to the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Bantry and Fenit are different and this came out of the Government&rsquo;s ports policy document which stated that if Fenit was only about angling and fishing and tourism &mdash; I spent a week in Godley&rsquo;s Hotel once when the children were small and I meandered up and down every cul-de-sac at the time, but that was a while back&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should have gone to west Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Whatever.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>He has cousins in west Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am making is that there is a difference due to the significant amount of commercial traffic from Liebherr in Killarney to Fenit.  That company is very attached to Fenit because it suits its operation.  If Fenit was only about tourism and angling, we would not be talking about putting it under the control of the Shannon-Foynes Port Company because it would be transferred to Kerry County Council.  It is because there is a significant amount of commercial traffic in Fenit and Bantry that we are doing this.</P>
        <P>The different perspectives of the different Senators have been very interesting, but there has been a long process of various reports, the results of which mean that this has been transferred to the Department of Transport.  It is a very good model when dealing with the big ports and with the amalgamation of roads and ports under the same Department.  I accept the argument made by some that it is more difficult to see the synergies when one is talking about smaller harbour commissioners, but that policy was approved by the Government a few years ago.  Wexford is in a different category because the harbour commissioners there would come under the local authority.  The option for Fenit and Bantry to link in with a port with professional expertise and corporate governance is due to the significant amount of commercial traffic at those ports.  If Liebherr was not delivering to Fenit and if the oil terminal was not in Bantry, we would not be talking about this.  We would be talking about transferring the competencies of those ports to the local authority.</P>
        <P>I can see that there are strong local views on this and we have agreed to look at some amendments on more consultation and reflect on them before the Bill is passed.  While we feel that the consultation that took place has been exhaustive, we have agreed to look at Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s amendment to formalise a consultation process in a statutory way.  This will not happen in three months or six months.  There have been suggestions that the previous consultation was at a high level and that individual local groups or fishermen were not involved.  Sometimes we do not shout early enough but wait until decisions are nearly made and then jump out of the rafters, as it were.  If any groups felt that they did not get the opportunity to <Col N="1145"/>speak on this issue, we are looking at wording that can be put into the Bill to allow for a consultation process in which every group and every individual can make their views known.</P>
        <P>I cannot accept any of the amendments tabled but I hope that, in time, people will be happy with the process as laid down in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the need for the Minister for Education and Science to reverse his decision to cut special teacher support for children with mild learning disabilities in St. Teresa&rsquo;s school, Balbriggan.  I cannot understand why children with special needs should be victims of cuts, especially those in education.  We agree that everybody should take his or her fair share of the pain but I do not believe it is fair that any children with disabilities, who need special teachers, should take this cut announced by the Minister on Tuesday of the week before last.</P>
        <P>In excess of 530 children and 119 schools are affected by the cuts.  No great thought can have been put into this matter.  These cuts will save the Exchequer only &euro;7 million and will victimise the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in St. Teresa&rsquo;s School in Balbriggan because a constituent who has a mildly disabled child asked me to raise this issue.  The child needs special education teachers.  St. Teresa&rsquo;s has a facility for two special needs classes but after the cut announced by the Minister it will have only one.  The result, as the Minister will probably know, is that some of those pupils will have to go elsewhere, either to a special needs school or to a special needs class in another school, or will have to go into mainstream classes.  The Minister said there are not enough children to avail of special needs schools.  That is not an adequate explanation.  There are never enough classes for the children in question.  He should not count the children but should count the classes first and put the children into them.  It is absurd to count the children and then say some must suffer while others do not.  It is very unfair especially as the number of children allowed into such a class is nine.  That seems a rather rigid and inflexible allowance which should be varied, and every child with special needs should be accorded the suitable education he or she deserves.</P>
        <P>Putting children into mainstream classes, which was proposed as a possibility for St. Teresa&rsquo;s, is acknowledged not to be the optimum solution.  It is extremely disturbing for the children involved.  Even if they are only mildly affected it dislocates them when they have begun a form of education that suits them.  They would have to adjust to an education that is not suitable for them.</P>
        <P>While the Minister has made some concessions in recent days, it is very important the Minister of State, who is in the Chamber, should spell out the effect of such concessions and what they will mean to St. Teresa&rsquo;s school in Balbriggan.  I would like to disassociate myself from these cuts and ask the Minister not just to look after the children in Balbriggan but to completely reverse these cuts, which are saving only &euro;7 million.  The Minister should consider the children who need this.  They are children with autism, Down&rsquo;s syndrome or other mild or more <Col N="1147"/>severe special needs.  I ask him to reverse these cutbacks, particularly in this case, and to spell out what the future holds for those children who really need special teacher support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this Adjournment debate matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position.  It is of tremendous concern to me and to the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, that there has been a staggering level of misinformation and misrepresentation of the notification to a number of schools by my Department that they were no longer entitled to retain teachers in classes for pupils with mild general learning disability.</P>
        <P>The first and most important point is that all pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have, additional teaching resources to support their education.  All primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability.  Each school was given these additional teaching resources under the general allocation model of learning support-resource teaching introduced in 2005.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that these additional teaching resources have not been withdrawn from any school.  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils.  Most pupils with a mild general learning disability are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher.  The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of pupils of different abilities.  This policy of inclusion has widespread support within the educational community.  Schools can use their resource-learning support allocation to give pupils special help if they need it.  This might be done with a teacher working with a group of pupils or on a one-to-one basis for a few hours each week.</P>
        <P>Before the general allocation model was introduced, some schools grouped pupils with a mild general learning disability into special classes.  Senators are aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of classes for mild general learning disability the normal pupil teacher ratio is 11:1.  My Department, however, allows for a small reduction in this number and permits a school to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of nine pupils in the class.  The rules also provide that a teacher would no longer be allocated where the number of pupils fell below nine.  In the schools in question, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum and the schools no longer qualify for the teaching posts in these classes.</P>
        <P>In 2005 when the general allocation model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for mild general learning disability were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes.  Effectively, these schools received a double allocation.  The number of these special classes has decreased over the years and schools have integrated the pupils into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All the other primary schools in the country which do not have classes for pupils with mild general learning disability cater for these pupils from within the general allocation model.  Surely commentators are not suggesting that three or four pupils with a mild general learning disability should be kept in a class of their own when they could benefit from the interaction of other peers with support from their teacher.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross will be aware, however, that the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, is open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher.</P><Col N="1148"/>
        <P>There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years.  There are approximately 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs.  There are more than 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared with just 2,000 in 1998.  In excess of 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.  Some 76 classes for pupils with mild general learning disability are being retained where there are nine pupils or more in these classes.</P>
        <P>Priority will continue to be given to provision for pupils with special educational needs.  The establishment of mild general learning disability classes predate many of the developments in special education policy in recent years and we now have a system for providing schools with supports for pupils with high incidence special needs through the general allocation model.  The parents of all children with mild general learning disability need to know their children in mainstream classes are getting a quality education delivered by committed class teachers and supplemented by additional support from the resource-learning support teacher.  This is happening every day in schools throughout the country and it will continue happening.  I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to this matter.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, in which he read, &ldquo;The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe is open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher&rdquo;.  Is that a kind of let-out clause?  Does it mean the parents or teachers of the pupil to whom I refer in Balbriggan can make representations to the Minister which will allow him to restore the special teaching facilities to which they were formerly entitled?</P>
        <P>There was a very noticeable omission in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reading of the script.  I do not know if it was deliberate.  In the last paragraph the script reads, &ldquo;The natural sympathy we all have for pupils with special needs and their parents makes it all the more important that we do not cloud facts with emotion&rdquo;.  What does that mean and why was it left out?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the letters went out to the schools the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, said he is open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate it is more educationally beneficial to the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and learning resource teacher.  He has also said he is open to listening to suggestions regarding combining resources of schools in a particular locality.

    <Title>Housing Aid for the Elderly. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Finneran.  I want to ask him about the schemes administered by local authorities for housing aid for different groups, mostly for elderly or disabled people.  Within the past 12 months responsibility for a number of schemes that <Col N="1149"/>previously rested with the former health boards has been transferred to local authorities.  Those schemes have been combined with a number of existing schemes run by local authorities and as a result, last year local authorities were inundated with applications for funding under the schemes.</P>
        <P>I raise this on the Adjournment due to the fact that in Kilkenny, the area with which I am most familiar, there are a number of outstanding difficulties for people who are trying to get funding to provide necessary improvements to their homes.  The current position in the housing department of Kilkenny County Council is that it will provide funding for repairs to roof damage and similar, related problems, but if elderly people have problems with poor windows or lack of heating, the local authority cannot address them this year.  A standard letter issued by the county council states that this year&rsquo;s funding will largely be spent on roof repairs and that any repairs to windows or the cost of installation of heating cannot be covered because it does not have the money for it.</P>
        <P>I note that within the past week a parliamentary question was put down in the Lower House about the current position with this funding.  In his reply, the Minister stated that his Department is liaising with local authorities with regard to how much funding will be allocated.  What is the position with that?  It should have been concluded by now.  There is a huge backlog of people in the system who have been approved for work to be carried out, but local authorities cannot given them the money to complete the work as the funding is not available.  A number of local authorities are allowing people to do the work.  People can borrow from the credit union or elsewhere and the money will be repaid when the grant is paid.  However, the people seeking this funding are either disabled, elderly or ill &mdash; some are in all three categories &mdash; and many of them are not in a position to get a loan from a credit union or any other institution.  It is not the best time to be seeking loans from any institution.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister will shed light on this issue.  I refer specifically to the essential repairs grant, the disability grant and the housing aid for older people grant.  Will there be an increase in funding for those schemes this year given that there is such demand for them?  When will the funding for local authorities be announced?  Is the Government serious about tackling the backlog that exists as a result of the amalgamation of the schemes that were previously operated by the health boards with those operated by local authorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to discuss the operation and funding of the suite of housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability in 2009.  The new suite of grant schemes replaced the previous disabled person&rsquo;s and essential repairs grant schemes late in 2007.</P>
        <P>I attach great importance to these schemes which play a vital role in facilitating the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability.  In line with my objective of prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable households, I underlined my commitment to ensuring the continued effectiveness of the schemes by announcing an 8% increase in funding for the schemes in 2009.  The new suite of grant schemes is funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, funding and activity under the schemes has been accelerating year on year, with expenditure increased from &euro;13 million in 1997 to over &euro;71 million ten years later.  During that time, 74,000 grants have been paid.  This represents 74,000 older people and people with a disability who have been assisted in remaining in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  In May 2008, I announced a combined capital allocation of &euro;71.4 million for the operation of the schemes for last year.  In addition, to take account of the <Col N="1150"/>significantly increased levels of activity under the grant schemes experienced by local authorities in 2008, supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling &euro;15 million were made in September, October and December.  This level of funding supported the carrying out of badly needed adaptation works to over 12,000 disadvantaged households.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In preparing the allocation of funding to individual local authorities for the operation of these schemes in 2009, my Department has been in regular contact with individual local authorities on a range of relevant issues, including the levels of activity experienced under the schemes in 2008; the levels of claims on hand; the degree to which prioritisation of applications has taken place and the anticipated levels of activity in 2009.  In view of the anticipated high levels of demand under the schemes once again this year, I am conscious of the need for local authorities to be able to deploy available resources as early as possible in order to maximise their impact for households availing of the schemes.  Local authorities will therefore be notified of their capital allocations in respect of the housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability immediately following the publication of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009.</P>
        <P>As in previous years, it will then be a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within this allocation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said there will be an 8% increase in funding for the schemes in 2009.  Is that an 8% increase on the &euro;71.4 million originally allocated for 2008 or the &euro;86.4 million spent in 2008?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>

    <Title>Planning Issues. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will look with favour on my proposal regarding planning approvals which were granted in 2004 to people, particularly young couples and members of the indigenous community, for one-off houses.  Those planning approvals are due to expire this year.  The applicants are finding it extremely difficult in the current climate to obtain a mortgage or financing to build the house for which they have planning approval.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister and the Department to examine the possibility of permitting local authorities to grant a three-year extension to these approvals.  The reason I seek a three-year extension is that, in light of the current economic situation, three years might give people the opportunity to obtain the finances required to build their houses.  I do not call for developers to be given a three-year extension but that it should be given to individuals who sought and received planning permission for one-off houses.</P>
      
        <P>Consider the cost of reapplying for planning permission.  I met a couple last weekend who told me that it cost them &euro;2,500 to reapply for permission this year for the house for which they were approved in 2004.  That is a huge cost.  It might provide finance for architects and <Col N="1151"/>keep them employed, but it is a burden for young, local couples.  In many cases the planning permission is expiring and these couples are not reapplying, with the result that they are on the local authority housing list.  It would be a progressive step if we granted to those young couples in particular who have applied for permission a three-year extension.  It would allow them to continue to save to build up their resources in the hope that they would build a house in the next three years.  Otherwise we are burdening the local authority in terms of housing lists.  That is a burden we cannot afford given that many people are going on to local authority housing lists throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I am not sure of the legalities of this issue or whether legislation would be required, and I am not sure whether the Department would consider it.  I am requesting it today because many people, including county councillors, have raised this issue with me.  While I do not expect a conclusive response today, I hope the Department will at least consider the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill for bringing this matter to my attention.</P>
        <P>Under section 40 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the duration of a planning permission should normally be a period of five years from the grant of permission.  However, under section 41 of the Act, a planning authority or, as the case may be, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, may, having regard to the nature and extent of the relevant development and any other material consideration, specify a period in excess of five years during which a permission is to have effect.  It is, however, the responsibility of an applicant in the first instance to request such a longer duration in appropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P>Under section 42 of the 2000 Act, the holder of a planning permission may apply to the relevant planning authority for an extension of the period originally specified.  Subject to compliance with certain requirements, including that substantial works were carried out pursuant to the permission during the period originally specified, a planning authority may extend the duration of the permission by such additional period as it considers necessary to enable the relevant development to be completed.</P>
        <P>This additional period may be further extended where, upon application, the planning authority is satisfied that the development has not been completed due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.</P>
        <P>It is apparent therefore that reasonable provisions were made in the 2000 Act to allow flexibility within the planning system to accommodate the specific circumstances of individual developments.</P>
        <P>However, in the current economic situation, it is evident that cases may arise where, due to external circumstances beyond the reasonable control of a developer, it may not be possible to commence a development within the period originally specified in a planning permission or, indeed, to carry out substantial works under a permission.</P>
        <P>In addition to the latitude currently available, therefore, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is disposed, in the context of the drafting of the planning and development amendment Bill, to enable planning authorities, on application, further to extend the period of a planning permission where particular considerations beyond the control of the planning applicant would warrant it.</P>
        <P>The Minister considers that such further flexibility, which may be exercised by planning authorities on a case-by-case basis, would be a more appropriate response to current circumstances than provision for a blanket extension of all existing planning permissions.  He does not consider that a fee of the level imposed in respect of an application for an extension of the duration of a planning permission &mdash; currently &euro;62 &mdash; is a significant impediment or cost.</P><Col N="1152"/>
        <P>I understand that it is the intention to publish the planning and development amendment Bill soon and this provision will be included.  I am glad to be of assistance to the Senator today.  We have already contemplated what he has proposed and we hope to be in a position to accommodate it in the Bill that will be published shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, for that favourable response and acknowledge his input in ensuring that young people across the country are given the opportunity of the extension they require.  I appreciate fully that it is a matter for local authorities more than the Department but if local authorities are given the flexibility considered by the Minister, it will be a significant step forward.</P>
