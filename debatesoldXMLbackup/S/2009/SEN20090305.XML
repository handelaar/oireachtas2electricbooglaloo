	<P>I have notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to report on his interactions with his Northern counterparts to address the international port status of Magilligan, which has placed an economic noose on the Foyle ferry that is out for re-tender and is in need of a change of security status for this cross-Border project to thrive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to liaise with and mediate between the nurse managers and the Health Service Executive to resolve the dispute in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the accommodation needs at Bishop Ahern national school, Leamlara, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to publish a definitive list, on a county-by-county basis, of all schools which are using temporary prefabricated buildings as classrooms and the amount of public moneys spent on such.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Keaveney, McFadden and Bradford and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Doherty may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Diseases of Animals Act 1966, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2009 &mdash; All Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, with Second Stage to conclude at 2 p.m., if not previously <Col N="412" />concluded, spokespersons having ten minutes, other Members seven minutes and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House; and No. 3, earlier signature motion on the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2009, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 2.  It is proposed that the business of the House will be interrupted for 30 minutes at the conclusion of Second Stage of No. 2.</P>

	<P>Yesterday we heard the &ldquo;B&rdquo; word, &ldquo;budget&rdquo;, from the Taoiseach for the first time when he acknowledged a new budget was needed, but we still have not heard the &ldquo;A&rdquo; word, apology.  Like any addict or person in rehabilitation, the Government must first apologise and accept the mistakes it has made.  It is important the Taoiseach acknowledges some responsibility for the role he and his Government have played over the past ten years in the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach ought to accept some responsibility.  If one wants to find the solution to the economic problems in the country, one has to accept mistakes were made here.</P>
        <P>The Opposition had a limited briefing on the economy at the Department of Finance yesterday.  The House called for a meaningful debate before the new budget is announced.  It must be a meaningful debate with Ministers outlining the policy rationale behind their decision making in recent months and years.  We need details from Ministers on the policy choices facing them.  We need details of the cost benefit analyses of the options available to them.  We need to understand the policy rationale behind what the Government, in particular the Taoiseach, said in recent weeks concerning the decentralisation programme, the reform programme and other areas.  We cannot have empty scripts.  We need information if we wish to have a real debate on the policy choices facing the country.</P>
        <P>For example, we cannot just have a &ldquo;Yes-No&rdquo; debate to the suggested cuts to child benefit.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs must explain to the House the policy options, costs, benefits and rationale if we are to have a meaningful debate before budgetary decisions are made, as Senators demanded yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The points made by Senator Fitzgerald are extremely important.  The only aspect on which we differ is that I would not ask for an apology because an apology for which one is obliged to ask is not worth receiving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Those in government should at least accept responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should come clean in respect of the issues to which the Senator referred.  It would boost confidence if it were to admit that it made mistakes, if it identified those mistakes and indicated how it intends to approach matters from now on.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Government is involved in discussions with the Opposition parties and the social partners and is trying to develop a strategy.  The next three weeks will be critical.  What happens in that period will prove more important than the budget that is due to be introduced.  During the next three weeks, every opportunity should be taken to explain to people, in terms they can understand, the seriousness of the difficulties we face.  They should also be informed of the remedial measures that will have to be taken and be reassured that the weak and vulnerable will be protected from the essential cuts that must be made.</P><Col N="413" />
        <P>It is also important that people are informed as to when it is likely that our problems will be resolved.  One of the difficulties that always arises is that if a Government takes emergency measures &mdash; for example, those relating to the declaration of the Emergency &mdash; they tend to remain in place for ever.  A timeframe must be set down so that people will know when our current difficulties will end.</P>
        <P>If the Government can convince the social partners of the need to take tough action, I will champion that cause in this House.  It is necessary that we should do so, however unpopular it might be.  It will not be easy to ask the representatives of the business community, the unions or the organisations that make up the social pillar to accept what it will be necessary to do.  However, if they can be convinced with regard to the measures that need to be implemented, Members have a duty, despite the wave of unpopularity that will certainly follow, to sell and support those measures.  Let no one believe that taking tough action will satisfy critics in the media because those individuals will simply focus their attention elsewhere.  We must be reassured by and confident in the decisions that must be made so that progress will be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody asked me last week whether I believe that politicians are part of the problem or part of the solution.  The man in question was not sure of the answer to his own question.  He was referring to politicians across the board.  In view of the fact that 1,000 people are losing their jobs each day, we must recognise the need to shake ourselves up in the way we do business in this House.  I apologise if people take what I am about to say as criticism, but what passes for debate in the Seanad is abysmal.  There is no point in our having debates that are mere set pieces.  We must deal meaningfully with the types of issues to which Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole referred.  We might as well close the House down if we do not take these matters seriously.</P>
        <P>I made a proposal earlier in the week to the effect that if we are to engage in a so-called rolling debate, it should be conducted in a way that makes sense.  Such a debate must also make a real contribution to the national conversation that must take place in respect of the serious crisis in which we find ourselves.  The word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; is used continually.  The matter to which I refer is an emergency issue.  Not to put too fine a point on it, people should remember that we are paid to carry out our business in this House.  In that context, we need to be able to satisfy members of the public that our services are worth the money they pay for them.  In light of the manner in which we conduct our debates, questions arise as to our worth.  I am not criticising any individuals, the Leader or anyone else, but we must address this matter.  If we do not do so, not only will questions arise as to our relevance, but we will render ourselves entirely irrelevant.</P>
        <P>We can begin by dealing with the issue to which Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole referred, namely, the need for information, facts, figures and details.  Why can the Seanad not lead the national conversation with regard to what the mini-budget to be introduced at the end of the month should contain?  Why can we not engage in debates informed by what is contained in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers in respect of who pays tax, the levels of tax they pay and the contribution they make to the raising of revenue through the taxation system?  Would it be possible to place more information in the public domain so that people might, whether on radio programmes or whatever, take part in the discussion?  That would be better than maintaining the type of traditional and old-fashioned secrecy that surrounds fiscal and budgetary matters.</P>
        <P>We must take perhaps not a long but certainly a hard look at ourselves to identify the contribution we might make.  I welcome the fact that the Government is involved in discussions with the Opposition.  However, I hope the process relating to those discussions will amount to more than merely putting in place a suggestion box at the bottom of the stairs in the main hall <Col N="414" />of this building.  We need more than the type of suggestion box one might see at a Butlins holiday camp or in a youth club.  There must be serious engagement with the Opposition and if that is to take place, information and facts must be provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the European Central Bank, ECB, will reduce its interest rate by approximately 0.5% later today.  This will make a big difference for borrowers and mortgage holders.  In 1982, another dark period in our history, inflation and interest rates stood at approximately 18%.  The ECB&rsquo;s move will sound a positive note on the day on which we will recapitalise the two major banks.</P>
        <P>The Government should put in place a &euro;10 billion investment or national reconstruction fund.  This could possibly be done through Anglo Irish Bank, which would restore some of that institution&rsquo;s credibility.  There are people who have money in respect of which they are not receiving a great return as a result of the reduction in interest rates and who would be prepared to invest in such a fund.  Serious consideration should be given to my proposal in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that departmental officials do not follow up on suggestions put forward by Members of the House.  They do not even contact Members by telephone to seek additional detail in respect of what might be considered logical ideas.  No one has contacted me regarding my proposal that a national reconstruction fund be established since I first put it forward some time ago.  I make an appeal to those officials who are following the proceedings of this House, on the Internet or by whatever other means, to contact Members who put forward suggestions to obtain additional information in respect of such suggestions.  Departmental officials have the expertise to assist Members in further developing proposals they might put forward.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader request that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come to the House to discuss the National Consumer Agency and the work it does in respect of consumer rights?  The costs relating to this agency are quite high.  Yesterday I was obliged to inflate two of the tyres on my car.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should have tried blowing into them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is hardly relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make one point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe the Leader will be able to do anything for the Senator in respect of this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach will understand the position when I finish my point.  At some point, he could undergo an experience similar to that which I endured yesterday.  I drove to the BP TOP filling station on the quays, the Esso station in Parkway West and the Shell station in Palmerstown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator should make another list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but none of them had in place facilities to allow one to inflate the tyres on one&rsquo;s car.</P>

	<P>In this country, there is only one filling station for every 2,000 people.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am amazed that the people of Dublin do not complain about the fact that they cannot inflate the tyres on their cars at filling stations.  In Castlecoote, the village in which I reside, it is possible to inflate the tyres on one&rsquo;s car without charge.  However, three filling stations within a 10 km radius of this House do not have any service facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator could have blown air into the tyres himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I was aware that the Senator might make jokes of that nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s list of filling stations is similar to that which he produced in respect of the banks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I will overlook them.</P>

	<P>Senator Leyden&rsquo;s point is not relevant to the Order of Business.  I call Senator Coghlan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am making is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is a bit of a windbag.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the T&aacute;naiste should come to the House to explain the work being done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden should resume his seat.  I call Senator Coghlan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on behalf of the Government by the National Consumer Agency.  I have lodged a complaint with the agency in respect of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should resume his seat.  I call Senator Coghlan on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points put forward by Senator Fitzgerald.  We are all in this together, but it must be acknowledged that mistakes were made.  The spirit should be proper and correct.  The books should be properly and fully opened and all cards should be face up on the table.  In that way, meaningful dialogue and discussion can take place and something useful might emerge in a proper all-party spirit.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Leader back from Heaven&rsquo;s Reflex, where we both attended&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to the Order of Business to welcome anybody back from where they were.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it is very relevant to the question that will follow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a very important conference of the Irish Hotels Federation, people who are on the business front line trying to attract tourists, which is so important to this country.  We are aware of how hard hit these people are at present.  The Leader and I took <Col N="416" />part in several of the discussions at the conference.  The federation made a useful proposal with regard to extending free travel to all European Union senior citizens.  These people could come in their millions to Ireland.  We need every extra visitor we can get, and senior people have time, discretionary income and the inclination to travel.  I fully support the Irish Hotels Federation in this regard.  We should seek to advance the proposal in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ireland must position itself properly and I am anxious to hear the Leader&rsquo;s response on behalf of the Government to the proposal.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with that, I wish to refer to something mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole yesterday.  We must not stop anybody who is in a position of leadership in this country visiting abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  These are front line ambassadors, be they Ministers, Deputies, Senators, council cathaoirligh, councillors or mayors.  We need all that goodwill scattered worldwide for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to attract every extra visitor possible to this country in this difficult time for us and our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that Fine Gael policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope so; I am sure it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That point was made yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have always been broad-minded on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was discussed at length yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism was mentioned.  It was very fortunate that the door of the helicopter did not hit the rotor blades or drop off over a built up area.  People could have lost their lives.  It was a very serious incident.  We have six of these helicopters.  They appear to be sturdy machines but the left hand door of the helicopter concerned came off for an unexplained reason.  We must get an early result from that air accident investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the animal welfare Bill be introduced in the House?  I also reiterate Senator Wilson&rsquo;s frequently asked question about when legislation will be introduced to ban the party pill, as it is familiarly known, given the legislation was due to be introduced early in this session.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier this week in the Leader&rsquo;s absence, Scotland is the eighth highest consumer in the world of alcohol.  Its government has taken on this important issue because it costs its economy &pound;2.2 billion as a result of approximately 42,000 people attending hospitals with alcohol related problems.  Given that Ireland is second in the world for alcohol consumption, we should return to the issue of alcohol abuse, not just because of the health risks and the financial cost it imposes on our economy in these straitened times but also because people are travelling to the North to buy alcohol and other commodities because of the price differential.  Now that Scotland has taken on this serious issue, perhaps we should speak to our counterparts in the North with a view to formulating an all-Ireland alcohol policy, whether that involves minimum pricing, getting rid of happy hours, abolishing two-for-one deals and so forth.  We should take on best practice given that the island shares a common problem with access to and abuse of alcohol.</P>
        <P>There was a briefing today in Buswells Hotel by the Higher Education Authority on what makes Irish voters vote and how they vote.  Given that International Women&rsquo;s Day is near, and I am aware the Labour Party has put forward a Bill to deal with gender issues in politics, I ask <Col N="417" />the Leader to arrange a debate on how to encourage more women into politics and how to help them reach the top of the tree in their areas of business.  The research by the Higher Education Authority could be a starting point for a debate on what makes voters vote and how they vote and to examine the impact or role, from the female perspective, the decision making on candidate selection and presentation plays in that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I greatly fear that Senator Alex White might be correct in his perception that this House is becoming increasingly irrelevant.  That could explain why, once again, less that one third of the Members are present for the Order of Business, as has been the case over the past two weeks.</P>
        <P>I welcome the indictment of the President of Sudan on war crimes charges.  His response was to exclude a number of aid organisations, including M&eacute;decin San Fronti&egrave;res, which means that many people in the camps will not be immunised against meningitis and will die.  His response is to sentence more people to death.  I am glad this indictment has been made and I hope a similar warrant will issue for Mr. George Bush and his cronies, another president who deserves this treatment.</P>
        <P>I support my colleagues&rsquo; call for a debate on the economy, be it a rolling debate or otherwise.  We hear news all the time on the radio, such as the Government opening the books to the Opposition and the social partners.  How about forcing the banks to open their books?  We would all like to know what is in them too.  I was horrified to hear that nobody in the Department of Finance has an economic qualification.  I do not believe everybody must be academic but apparently there are 100 such qualified people in the ministry in the North of Ireland, which is one third the size of this country.  I agree that we must examine matters such as child benefit.  Again, I rely on the wireless for news because we have not had this debate here.  Children must be protected but if, as was stated this morning on the airwaves, there are people in receipt of child benefit who use the benefit to go on skiing holidays, it is an obscenity.  We must look at where the money is.  It is not just a case of technically fiddling with the income tax rate but of finding out where the money is.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on hedge funds.  Mr. Brendan Keenan has said that one of the problems with the economy is that London-based hedge funds are gambling against the Irish economy and deliberately driving it down.  They want to do us in so they can collect the pickings.  I want to know about that.  I was astonished to learn that Mr. Garret FitzGerald, &ldquo;Saint Garret&rdquo;, recently retired from them.  I wonder about the ethics of that.</P>
        <P>Finally, let us examine competition.  We have made a tin god out of competition but we do not understand the difference between competition and competitiveness.  The Competition Authority should be put in the firing line, given its record.  The abolition of the groceries order sent prices up, not down as it claimed it would.  The licensing of every huckster&rsquo;s shop in Dublin to sell hard booze sent the alcoholism rate up.  We are keeping electricity prices high in the name of competition.  Selling off eircom was not the decision of the Competition Authority but privatisation was supposed to result in competition.  Private investors asset stripped the company, did not invest a penny in broadband and then flogged the company to an Australian pension company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also the problem with taxis.  Taxi drivers were forced to increase their prices against their wishes.  They are protesting on the streets today.  It is absurd.  A ridiculous number of unqualified people are coming into the taxi sector.  The Competition Authority is now opposing the freezing of drink prices.  What is going on?  Finally, there is what happened to the most vulnerable people, that is, low paid workers in the acting profession who <Col N="418" />do voice-over work.  They were screwed by the Competition Authority and threatened with being hauled before the courts to face criminal prosecutions simply because they banded together.  Let us have this issue out in the open.  Let us discuss competition, what it is and if it is uniquely and inevitably in the interest of the Irish people.  I do not think so.</P>

T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil dea-thoil ann don Ghaeilge sa Teach seo agus &uacute;s&aacute;ideann roinnt mhaith de Bhaill an T&iacute; Gaeilge &oacute; ham go ch&eacute;ile.  Chomh maith le sin, t&aacute; st&aacute;das faoi leith bainte amach ag an Ghaeilge i reachta&iacute;oct an St&aacute;it.

        <P>I ask that we place particular emphasis on the Irish language because that is the purpose of Seachtain na Gaeilge, which is primarily organised by vibrant young people with great vision.  Seachtain na Gaeilge is exceptionally comprehensive.  It is celebrated nationally and locally, and RTE, the press and many others are involved in it.  I also raise the issue of Seachtain na Gaeilge to highlight that we should not view Irish solely in a linguistic sense.  If one examines our history, one finds that the language was one of the motivating factors for our patriots.  In our recent commemoration of the establishment of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1919, Members will have noted from looking at the proceedings of the first sitting of the D&aacute;il that the language was very much to the fore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the inception of the State, bodies such as Conradh na Gaeilge and Cumann Luthchleas Gael regarded the Irish language as a vehicle for other things.  For example, they promoted the concept of supporting Irish industries, buying Irish made goods, showing loyalty to the country and so on.  We should not underestimate the Irish language.  To take the point made by Senator Alex White, we could show the relevance of the House, not only from a linguistic point of view but also in responding to the current crisis by drawing on our history and the example given by many patriots, past and present.</P>

	<P>Senators spoke about the job losses we are experiencing.  Last night, 30 apprentices from SR Technics, a firm in north County Dublin which is under threat of closure, visited the House.  These apprentices are halfway through their courses, which they will not be able to complete if the company decides to pull out of the country.  I am aware that many apprentices throughout the country face a similar prospect.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on how to get F&Aacute;S, IDA Ireland and other relevant bodies involved to ensure the thousands of apprentices who are in this position as a result of job losses are able to complete their courses?</P>

	<P>I support Senators&rsquo; calls for a debate in advance of the forthcoming mini-budget.  The House must have a detailed discussion on tax rates.  Many people are calling for a widening of the tax band.  As my colleague in the other House, Deputy Burton, has discovered, many people can afford to pay a little more.  They should be asked to come forward to the table.  For instance, the 30,000 people who earn more than &euro;200,000 per annum are taxed at just 41%.  In the Netherlands the highest income tax rate is 52% and I understand the figure in Belgium also exceeds 50%.  If we increased the tax rate for these people by 10%, the tax take would increase by &euro;1.5 billion per annum.  I ask that, rather than trying to widen <Col N="419" />the tax base and include people who currently find it very difficult to pay their way, we consider how we can hit those who can most afford it.  We should debate all these issues prior to the mini-budget.  I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take issue with the suggestion made by Senators Alex White and Norris that the House may be in some way irrelevant.  I fundamentally disagree with my colleagues.  While the quality of debate in this House may be affected by a lack of information and the obfuscation of Ministers who appear before it, over the past two years Senators, through debates, have highlighted these issues and the sheer incompetence of the Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I merely put a question. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seanad has also highlighted the actions of Ministers who have come before us and given glib speeches and have been in denial about issues such as recapitalisation of the banks, the public finances and the need for a new budget.  These issues have been exposed by debate in this House.</P>
        <P>The vetting of legislation, the questioning of Ministers and the opposition provided in the House have been useful in inducing the Government to take action at different times, not least in giving a commitment to introduce a mini-budget.  It takes many people to influence the Government, whose members are slow learners.  Peter Sutherland, Garret FitzGerald, a series of economists and the Opposition have stressed the importance of the Taoiseach taking action.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Slowly but surely the penny has dropped.  It may take time but the Government responds to pressure.</P>
        <P>We will soon have a mini-budget, on which the Minister for Finance has proposed that the Opposition parties make submissions.  The Minister believes this is a clever move.  He is, in a sense, playing a trick on the Opposition and he expects it to decline his invitation, but it has not done so.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in have, however, given commitments to make submissions.  The Government must provide information to the Opposition.  It is not a simple question of walking across to the Department of Finance and obtaining some information on the latest Exchequer figures.  We must know what are the policy options, what advice is being given to the Government from various outside advisers and what measures can be adopted.  The Opposition needs this information if it is to play a meaningful part on deliberations on the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>On the question of taxation, Colm Keena&rsquo;s article in <i>The Irish Times </i>today highlights that 3% of earners pay 33% of income and 6% of people who earn more than &euro;100,000 per annum pay 43% of income tax.  We can have a witch-hunt against high income earners but it may kill enterprise and the incentive to work and turn the recession into a very deep and long depression.  It is necessary to take a considered view of taxation measures.</P>
        <P>The good news always seems to come from Europe.  Today, the European Central Bank will announce a reduction in interest rates.  This follows news that the European Union is committed to help a state which may be in difficulty with its debt.  I hope Senators who opposed the Lisbon treaty will review their position and, in the interests of the Irish economy, commit to supporting the treaty in the next referendum.</P>

	<P>I have asked Senators not to bring mobile phones or BlackBerrys into the House.  We must be fair to those who are trying to record the proceedings, and Senators who bring these devices into the Chamber are acting irresponsibly.  I have asked that they be turned off or, if it is necessary to take calls, that they be left with Senators&rsquo; secretaries.  Mobile phones ring too often in the House and, to be fair to everyone<b>,</b> it must stop. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>While I support calls for a debate, it must an informed debate.  Senators must recognise that many members of the public perceive this House to be irrelevant.  Seanad reform, for which all of us have argued, has not taken place.  The issue is usually the set piece debate on the first day of each new Seanad.  The Government needs to take the bull by the horns by reforming the Seanad and eliminating duplication between the Upper House and the Lower House.</P>
        <P>Unlike Deputies, Senators are not able to hold Ministers to account and may not table written questions to obtain information.  The information required to have an informed debate includes access to the types of figures to which various speakers referred.  For example, who are the 5,803 people who work and earn income here for part of the year but do not pay tax in this State?  Why can we not ensure such tax exiles pay their taxes here?</P>

The only information the Department of Education and Science can give us is this 100-page file of 900 schools which, between them, have 2,700 prefabricated classrooms.  That is only a fraction of the number of schools out there.  The Department does not know where the &euro;100 million it has invested in prefabricated classrooms over the past three years has gone.  It has no idea which schools are involved and it does not even know the list of schools in the school building programme on a county-by-county basis.  How can we make an informed decision on the direction in which this country needs to go when the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance do not know the figures?</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised a very important point this morning that he would lend his support if the social partners need to make difficult decisions.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the support of the social partners, particularly at this time.  Difficult decisions will have to be made.  The issue of Ministers going abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day has been mentioned.  Those Ministers have wall-to-wall appointments that will be for the benefit of the nation.  People do business not with ideas or concepts but with people who turn up on their doorsteps and talk to them.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day has been of major benefit to this country.  It is an international symbol of which we should be very proud.</P>
        <P>I also support the very positive proposal of Senator Keaveney on an alcohol tax similar to that pertaining in Scotland.  We need to raise funds, and the raising of capital from alcohol seems to be a virtuous cycle, particularly if it results in a decrease in deaths and the number of people who need to be treated in hospitals or treatment centres for alcohol abuse.  Despite the fact that beer is practically given away in countries such as the Czech Republic and Germany when compared with our prices, Ireland still has the second highest level of alcohol consumption in the world.  It would be of benefit, fiscally and in terms of public health, if we considered this matter.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the hedge funds that are thought to be betting against the Irish economy, to ensure that in the future contracts for difference are registered and reported to the Stock Exchange&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, on the outspoken way in which he has dealt with his personal experience of bowel cancer.  Today the Irish Cancer Society launched a bowel cancer awareness campaign.  One in three people in Ireland are not aware of the warning signs of bowel cancer.  At present 287 people have been waiting more than six months for a colonoscopy.  This is a terrible tragedy.  The day before yesterday I spoke about cervical cancer and commended the Government on its cervical cancer screening programme.  I call on the Leader, through his good offices, to ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney &mdash; I do not think there is a need for her to come to the House &mdash; to put in place a free bowel cancer screening service for people over 50.  In the long run it would be very good economically because it would save the State a large amount of money as cancer would be detected early and people would not need ongoing treatment.  It is a crying shame that one in three people do not know the early signs of bowel cancer.  I commend the Irish Cancer Society on its campaign and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, on his openness about his personal journey.  I ask the Leader to obtain firm answers on this issue for next week.</P>

	<P>I raised last week the issue of cross-Border social welfare fraud.  It is an ongoing issue and it is happening again this week in County Donegal.  I would like an <Col N="422" />update from the Leader on when we will have a debate on that issue &mdash; I hope it will be before the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day recess.</P>
        <P>I referred here before the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, which continues to refuse and defer applications from practising auctioneers with years of experience and university qualifications in their professions, while other applicants seem to obtain approval.  It is a selective process.  I call for a debate on the licensing of auctioneers and on this body.  While many reputable firms are associated with the body, there are questions to be asked about it.  I ask the Leader when the legislation on the establishment of a regulatory authority to bring more transparency to this sector will come to the House.  It is a scandal and a disgrace that this body is deferring applications and giving no reason.  It is a scandal and a disgrace.  The IPAV has serious questions to answer.  At a time when the construction sector is in difficulties, it should be opening its doors to new members instead of closing them.  The members, two in Donegal of whom I referred, do not want membership of this organisation now because they have no faith in it.</P>
        <P>Ireland is synonymous with sporting success.  However, an international survey recently showed that while 52% of the population of Finland had spent at least 30 minutes exercising in the previous week, with 46% in Australia and 39% in Canada, the comparable figure in Ireland was 26%, or roughly one in four of the population.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should come to the House to discuss the sports capital programme for 2009.</P>

We need a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>We must also examine the opportunities for Ireland with regard to the Olympics in 2012.  I do not think the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is doing enough.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s viewpoint on the strategy that is being adopted.  I have been calling for a debate on this issue since I entered the House but unfortunately there has not been one.  I accept the Leader has made every effort to bring the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to the House and, while that Minister has come to the House to discuss tourism issues, he should be invited to discuss sporting issues.  I know the Leader is doing his utmost to achieve that.  I hope we can have a discussion with the Minister on the sports capital programme and the 2012 Olympics.</P>

        <P>I call for a debate on the economy and the crisis or emergency budget which is due to be published in April.  I do not entirely agree with Senator Regan.  This House is becoming irrelevant whereas we should be driving the debate rather than Joe Duffy or Pat Kenny.  This situation has arisen partly because of the way business is scheduled in the Seanad.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance has not attended the House.  We have debated matters with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, but with respect, he is the junior Minister at the Department.  As Senators Fitzgerald and Alex White have pointed out, we need not only to be given facts, figures and information but also the ability to hold Ministers to account.  It is time to reform our business to allow Senators to put written questions to Ministers.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the issue of child care, which will become more relevant in the context of the forthcoming mini budget.  The Government will have to take child care into consideration when it raises taxes.  We should be honest and recognise that tax increases will have to be made.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on child care with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>Everybody we know who works in the private sector has experienced wage cuts and the cost of rented accommodation has fallen.  However, commercial rents are slow to decrease.  We must push for reductions in the cost of child care, which currently consumes almost one third of parents&rsquo; salaries.  Across the Border in Northern Ireland, child care costs half as much as here.  In the context of the mini budget and taxation, child care is one of the main issues we must address.  Approximately 1.8 million people remain at work and we want to keep them in employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Later today the European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates from 2% to 1.5%.  While that is welcome news, unfortunately, it is of no benefit to those who hold fixed rate mortgages.  Given the manner in which the State has bailed out and guaranteed our financial institutions since the advent of the global financial crisis, the least we should expect is that banks would pass on the reduction to those with variable rate mortgages.  Even those who hold variable rate mortgages are not guaranteed to benefit from the reduced rate, never mind the unfortunate people who have fixed rate mortgages.  The Government should insist that banks pass on the reduction as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for its support.  Policies in respect of fixed rate mortgage holders should be reviewed given that for the past several years mortgage applicants were advised by banks to take out fixed rate mortgages.  The expectation was that interest rates would increase but the mortgage holders are not benefiting now that rates are falling.  I urge the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Finance.  I have corresponded with the Minister and, while I understand the issues that arise, I believe a strong case can be made for revisiting this policy.</P>
        <P>A Latvian ship, the <i>MV Defender</i>, arrived in the Port of Cork yesterday after being seized by port state control officers and the Department of Transport on the grounds that it was <Col N="424" />keeping inadequate at-sea logs and did not have sufficient supplies of food.  The ship&rsquo;s nine crew members have not been paid in six months and are literally being starved.  This is the second time that the ship has been detained in the Port of Cork.  It is an affront to humanity to starve people and refuse them their due wages.  I commend the Greater Chernobyl Cause on arranging emergency food supplies for the crew.  Opposition Members usually offer constructive criticism of the Government but in this instance I commend the Department of Transport and the port state control on its prompt action.  I am disgusted that any human would be starved or denied his or her rightful wages.</P>

We held a debate on this issue in the last Seanad.  Unlike their female counterparts, men are slow to look after their health.  Statistics indicate that men visit general practitioners at the urging of their mothers, sisters, wives, daughters or female friends.</P>
        <P>We should revisit the subject of diabetes types I and II.  Any physician would attest that the incidence of diabetes type II is going through the roof.  We should put that issue to centre stage given its adverse consequences for our health services.

        <P>I strongly support the proposition that our Ministers should travel abroad to represent the country on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  However, they should not be accompanied by a phalanx of advisers and civil servants.  The delegations should be lean and effective and their members should travel in economy class and stay in acceptable hotels.  There is no need for extravagance and hard pressed taxpayers need to see a willingness on the part of Ministers to be patriotic and to do what is right for the country.

I commend the Taoiseach and the Government who on every occasion since the commencement of the downturn have one way or the other taken the required corrective measures.  We are a small nation that has become one of the greatest countries in the world, having grown from small beginnings in 1991-1992 to where we are to date, with a growth rate during the past ten or 12 years of 7% per annum.  We have achieved an enormous amount.  These are the facts and we should be proud of them, in particular coming up to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when all our Ministers, the Taoiseach and others are going abroad to sell Ireland plc.</P>

	<P>This is the time when the world media affords Ireland a window of opportunity of three or four days during which we can promote Irish goods, Ireland as a destination and sell the achievements of our country.  We must support these people in every way humanly possible.  I accept the spirit in which colleagues on both sides of the House have supported the hard work of travelling Ministers, Taoisigh and T&aacute;naiste of all Governments down through the years.  This window of opportunity presents only once a year for the Irish diaspora.  We must support them and not let them down owing to the downturn in the world economy.</P>
        <P>I will do all required of me in terms of the forthcoming debate in regard to the corrective measures to be taken in April.  I have no difficulty in leaving aside an entire day for an open-ended debate to tease out issues in regard to the economy and the advice that can be given to the Minister and Government officials.  Senator Alex White and Senator Norris expressed concern in regard to the image of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We must seek the assistance of the responsible media in regard to informing the people of the real worth of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We in the Oireachtas know that time does not always permit all sections of all Bills to be teased out by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  However, I first took up the position of Leader of this House in 1997 and have on only one occasion guillotined a Bill as it was of utmost urgency and had to be enacted the following morning to deal with the situation in the banks.  Members are aware no time limit has been set in regard to today&rsquo;s debate on the Investment of the National pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2009.</P>
        <P>We are the protectors of the Constitution on behalf of the people.  We must scrutinise minutely each Bill that comes before us, line by line and section by section.  I say to those people who believe the Oireachtas could perform as well without Seanad &Eacute;ireann that that is not true.  The Constitution must be protected on behalf of the people and that protector is this House, Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is not by chance this House is called the Upper House of the Oireachtas.  This title was earned by the many Members who passed through this House and went on to become Taoisigh and T&aacute;naiste.  Many Ministers of all Governments were in the first instance Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is not possible for any person to walk into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and become a successful Minister on one&rsquo;s first day.  I first came through the gates of this building in 1962, having assisted a former Member from my village of Castlepollard, of which I am so proud, who served as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for 38 years.  I can say here today without fear of contradiction and as one of the longest serving Members of the Oireachtas that in my experience I do not know of any Minister who on his or her first day made an outstanding success of any portfolio.  That does not happen overnight.  One must have experience and wherewithal if one is to be successful.  Where better to get that than as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann on one&rsquo;s way to serving the country in Government.</P>
        <P>Seanad &Eacute;ireann is the protector of the Constitution.  I urge colleagues here to defend this House.  It is a great honour and privilege not alone to be Leader of this House but to be a <Col N="426" />Member of it.  We are the protectors of the Constitution and we should let our colleagues in the responsible media know that this House has a serious role to play in ensuring the taxpayer gets value for money because we minutely discuss and debate every line and every section of each Bill that comes to this House.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden, Regan and McCarthy welcomed the proposed reduction of 0.5% in mortgage interest rates.  It is hoped that reduction will be forthcoming and that there will be further reductions in this regard as this would greatly assist many people during this downturn in the economy.</P>
        <P>The Senators also called for an urgent debate on enterprise trade, in particular the National Consumer Agency.  I have no difficulty in providing time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan expressed strong views in regard to the hotels sector.  I must at this point declare a vested interest in this sector given that my family operate in it.  His suggestion that we discuss the proposal that where possible we promote low cost or free travel for consumers from other countries wishing to visit our shores would assist the tourism industry during these difficult times.</P>
        <P>On the reduction in energy costs announced by the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, I understand in respect of the new electricity supplier, Bord G&aacute;is, that this reduction will apply only to household consumption and not in respect of business consumption, including the hotel and other sectors employing people, which is regrettable.  We have a duty to consider how we can assist industries such as the Irish Hotels Federation at a time when energy costs in this country are so high.</P>
        <P>I was horrified to hear of the experience of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen during a trip to Kerry by helicopter.  Given the height at which the helicopter was flying, had the door hit the blades all on board would have been killed.  We should thank God all were safe.  While I presume everybody will learn from this experience, why no safety chain was attached to the door is beyond me.</P>

	<P>The Air Corps has been to the fore in its dealings with Members down through the years.  I am thankful all ended well.  Senators Keaveney and Hanafin called for a debate on alcohol consumption and abuse.  Senator Keaveney also referred to the Scottish experience.  It is timely this issue was raised today given a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, of which I am a member, will take place following this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business.  I will take up this issue under any other business to see how we can improve on the proposal put forward by Senators this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney also called for an update in regard to the animal health and welfare Bill which seeks to consolidate and update existing legislation in respect of animal health and welfare and to consolidate responsibility for the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, within the Department.  I understand the Bill is proceeding at the normal pace and that it will come to the House by the end of this year.  I will update Members next week on the position in regard to legislation to ban party pills.</P>
        <P>I will provide time for a debate on participation by women in politics and public life and how we can help in this regard.  I would like to discuss with all women Members of the House what can be done to ensure we have a meaningful debate in terms of encouraging more women to participate in politics and public life.  I will discuss this issue with all female Members of the House to see how we can improve on the proposal for discussion.</P><Col N="427" />
        <P>I will pass on Senator Norris&rsquo;s strongly held views on events in Darfur, which we all share, to the Minister.  Senator Norris also called for a debate on the Competition Authority and an update on the groceries order.  I do not think its lifting has been a success.</P>

	<P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made a strong case for a debate on the Irish language coming up to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, and Senators Doherty and O&rsquo;Reilly also called again for this debate.  I will endeavour to have this take place, especially during the two weeks of Seachtain na Gaeilge, from 2 March to 17 March.  We in the Oireachtas can be really proud of having set up TG4 which has been an enormous success.  I am delighted in this 125th anniversary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, to see that the four captains of the All-Ireland winning teams will be the grand marshals of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in Croke Park.  I congratulate all who have made this possible.  We salute the GAA and everyone associated with the language and I will have time set aside for this next week. </P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan called for an update on jobs and apprentices finishing their courses.  We all fully agree with this.  I can also confirm that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be in the House to give us an update on what is really happening on the job front and the serious challenge facing the country.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty called for a debate on education.  I certainly can have that take place.  The Government is investing &euro;640 million this year in capital programmes.  That is the fact although times are difficult for the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Senators McFadden and Glynn called for a debate to highlight serious concerns about bowel cancer and a proposal to offer free screening services to those aged over 50 years.  That is a wonderful idea and we should strive to ensure that the Minister will bring it in at the earliest possible time.  I have no difficulty in a debate on these issues taking place after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill called for a debate on cross-Border fraud in the social welfare area.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, gave an uplifting and enlightening address at our Ard-Fheis but I have no difficulty in asking her to come to the House to let all colleagues contribute on this serious issue.  The Senator also spoke about the licensing of auctioneers and his experience in the Donegal area.  I will pass on his views to the Minister after the Order of Business and see what the response will be.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Buttimer called for a debate on sport and particularly Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the 2012 Olympics.  We all want to see our sportspersons getting the greatest opportunity especially when the Olympics take place in London and I have no difficulty in having time put aside to debate this.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and Glynn called for a debate on mental health.  I have no difficulty in having time set aside for this.  Senator Butler called for a debate on child care.  I have no difficulty having time left aside for this also.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy spoke of the horrific experience of the unfortunate Latvians on a ship in the Cork area, this being the second such experience.  I thank and congratulate everyone who helped there.  The human rights issue arising from this is totally unacceptable.  I will certainly pass the Senator&rsquo;s views on to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P><Col N="428" />

    <Title>Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2009: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for agreeing to discuss this Bill today at short notice.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents an important step in the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s announcement on 11 February regarding the proposed recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  It implements the Government&rsquo;s decision that the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, will play an important role in the recapitalisation programme.  Across the world, the past 18 months have seen unprecedented turbulence and pressure on financial institutions, and banks in particular.  Banks have had to compete strenuously for deposits and other forms of funding in a weakening economic environment.</P>
        <P>The global recession has shown us all the pivotal role the financial system plays in supporting the economy.  In turn, it has become clear to all that it is essential for Governments to take appropriate action to maintain the stability of the financial system.  Governments across the developed world have intervened to assist banks which are seeking capital in difficult market conditions.  Like many other European countries, Ireland moved to ensure the security and stability of its banking system.  Throughout this process, our approach has been based on two basic principles.  First, that the State will not let any systemically relevant financial institution fail and, second, that any State involvement in financial institutions will protect the interests of the taxpayer and have regard to legal implications and European requirements.</P>
        <P>In view of the continuing turmoil in global financial markets, the Government initiated intensive discussions with Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland with a view to securing the position of these two banks.  The recapitalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s two main banks is a key element in the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy for addressing the current economic challenges.  A banking system that can provide credit to sound businesses and personal borrowers is a fundamental requirement to maintain employment and output in the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided to provide &euro;3.5 billion in core tier 1 capital to each of the banks which will boost their capital ratios.  In return for the investment, the State will hold preference shares that will pay a fixed dividend of 8%.  The banks can redeem the preference shares at par within the first five years, or at 125% thereafter.  The Minister for Finance will also have the right to appoint 25% of the directors of each board and will also get 25% of the total ordinary voting rights in decisions on board appointments and change of control.</P><Col N="429" />
        <P>Warrants attached to the preference shares give the State the option to purchase 25% of the ordinary share capital of each bank in five years&rsquo; time at predetermined prices.  The recapitalisation will ensure the two main banks in Ireland are in a position to provide the necessary commercial credit facilities to their customers and to the economy in general.  In line with this, the banks have given a commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers this year.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, the extra capacity will be available to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Statutory codes of practice on business lending and mortgage arrears have been finalised to ensure credit is extended in an appropriate manner.  Of the &euro;7 billion to be provided, &euro;4 billion is to be funded from the current resources of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and &euro;3 billion will come from the frontloading of the Exchequer contributions to the fund for 2009 and 2010.  These investments will remain part of the fund and the return earned on them will accrue to the fund.  The use of some of the resources of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to fund the bank recapitalisation programme strikes a prudent balance between the need to address an urgent economic priority and the need to continue to take account of long-term budgetary stability and the sustainability of our pensions system.</P>
        <P>The current crisis has demonstrated the benefit, for a small open economy like Ireland, of maintaining a sovereign wealth fund such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is vital, in relatively good times, to establish and add to a fund of that nature to prepare for the inevitable rainy day.  If the fund had not been available to us, our current position would be even more difficult than it is.  The existence of the fund gives the lie to the notion that at the height of the Celtic tiger, we were awash with revenue but it was squandered.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has enabled us to cope with the banking crisis without aggravating further our alarming budget deficit.  The total amount of money to be invested &mdash; &euro;3.5 billion in each of the two banks &mdash; was determined following detailed consultation with financial and property experts, consideration of likely trends in asset values and examination of various related stress scenarios.  The State&rsquo;s investment will significantly strengthen the core tier 1 capital of the banks, bringing it in excess of regulatory limits.  The State will obtain a direct return on its investment in specified terms.  The banks have agreed a customer package containing a number of measures to improve lending in the economy, including statutory codes on business lending and mortgage arrears and a &euro;100 million fund to support environmentally friendly investment in innovations in clean energy.  The recapitalisation programme will strengthen Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland as financial institutions central to the economic future of the country.  The Government is in discussions with other relevant institutions about their capital positions.  It will take whatever measures are judged necessary in that regard at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>As Senators are aware, the National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in 2001 with the aim of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of the social welfare and public service pensions that will be paid between 2025 and 2055.  Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the Minister for Finance is required to pay 1% of GNP into the fund every year.  This Bill amends the 2000 Act to facilitate the recapitalisation of financial institutions.  It amends the Act so that, in respect of credit institutions listed on a stock exchange, the Minister for Finance may, in the public interest and in particular circumstances specified in the Bill, direct the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to make investments in such institutions and to underwrite their share issues.  The Minister may also give directions in relation to the holding, management and disposal of such directed investments.  An investment in a listed credit institution made by the commission on foot of a direction from the Minister is referred to in the Bill as a &ldquo;directed investment&rdquo;.  That is what is meant when that term is used.</P><Col N="430" />
        <P>This Bill will enable the Minister to make additional payments into the fund for the purposes of a directed investment in a listed financial institution and to transfer into the fund a shareholding or other interest held by him or her.  If the total payments or transfers made in any one year are greater than 1% of GNP, the excess will count towards the requirement to make annual contributions to the fund in future years.  For example, the annual contribution from the Exchequer to the fund will amount to approximately &euro;1.6 billion this year.  This amount was provided for in the 2009 budget last October.  The &euro;3 billion contribution from the Exchequer to the cost of the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland will comprise the &euro;1.6 billion I have mentioned and an additional amount of &euro;1.4 billion that will count towards the Exchequer contribution to the fund in 2010.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most notable of the other provisions in the Bill is the proposal to amend the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 to provide for greater transparency in respect of trading in financial instruments.  This provision will allow the Minister for Finance to make regulations requiring certain information relating to transactions in financial instruments to be disclosed to the Financial Regulator, the market or both.  It is intended that this measure will provide for the introduction of regulations requiring the disclosure of contracts for difference.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the provisions of the Bill in more detail.  Sections 1 and 2 contain the standard provisions that are necessary to explain certain terms used in the Bill.  Section 1 links the Act to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 by defining the &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; as the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  Section 2 amends the principal Act by inserting definitions of a number of technical terms used in the Bill, such as a &ldquo;Commission investment vehicle&rdquo;, a &ldquo;directed investment&rdquo;, a &ldquo;listed credit institution&rdquo; and a &ldquo;regulated market&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 3 of the Bill extends the functions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to enable it to manage directed investments.  It amends the commission&rsquo;s functions to take account of investments to be made by the commission in accordance with directions from the Minister for Finance.  It enables the commission to have regard to directed investments when determining the investment strategy for the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the commission is precluded from investing in Irish Government securities.  Section 3 also contains a technical provision to clarify that the reference in the principal Act to &ldquo;Irish Government securities&rdquo; means debt instruments issued by the Exchequer.  With the exception of donations and bequests, the commission is currently allowed to accept contributions from the Central Fund only.  This section amends the functions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to enable it to accept funds or assets for the benefit of the National Pensions Reserve Fund from sources other than the Central Fund, if so directed by the Minister.  This technical provision is the counterpart of a provision in section 6 that will allow the Minister to transfer shareholdings and other assets into the fund.</P>
        <P>Section 3 of the Bill also enables the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to advise the Minister for Finance at his or her request on a proposed directed investment.  This will allow the commission to carry out the necessary due diligence on Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland before the actual recapitalisation, for example.  This section will also enable the commission to underwrite issues of securities.  This measure is being included in the Bill, as an enabling provision, in case there is a need for the commission to underwrite a capital-raising issuance by a financial institution.  This is not something we are proposing to do &mdash; we are merely taking the opportunity to include the provision on a contingency basis while we are amending the National Pensions Reserve Fund legislation.</P><Col N="431" />
        <P>This legislation also allows the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to form a company or other body corporate.  This will allow the commission to establish special purpose investment vehicles where it is more efficient for the commission to invest through such a structure.  The commission is currently precluded from controlling a company.  Section 15 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 prohibits the commission from controlling a company or acquiring a shareholding of such size that the commission would be required to seek control of the company.  This is appropriate given the purpose of the fund.  The role of the commission is to invest for the optimum return, rather than to get involved in managing companies.  It is necessary to lift this restriction in two instances, first, where the commission sets up a special purpose investment vehicle, as I have described; and second, where the commission is required to invest in a credit institution on foot of a direction from the Minister, in other words, when the commission is facilitating the State recapitalisation by investing in the banks.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I emphasise that the State does not intend to take control of the recapitalised financial institutions.  The recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland is to be based on the State taking preference shares, rather than ordinary shares, in those institutions.  However, if the fund were to underwrite a future share issuance by these institutions, it is possible that the fund&rsquo;s overall holding could constitute a controlling interest.  This is not something we propose to do &mdash; we are merely providing for it in the Bill on a contingency basis.  It is proposed that certain statutory provisions in company and takeover law should not apply where the commission is required to invest in a financial institution, as part of the recapitalisation programme, on foot of a direction in the public interest.  The proposed provisions would ensure that investments by the NPRF in the financial institutions on the scale now envisaged would not be impeded by procedural delays.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, section 5 of the Bill provides that certain provisions of competition and takeover law and section 7 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 do not apply in respect of an acquisition or proposed acquisition by the commission of an interest in a traded credit institution or a transfer into the fund of the Minister&rsquo;s interest in a listed credit institution, if the acquisition or transfer results from a directed investment.</P>
        <P>Section 7 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 essentially provides that the Minister for Finance is to take over the role of the Competition Authority in relation to the merger or acquisition of a credit institution in the current banking crisis.  That section will not apply where the Minister is directing the NPRF Commission to recapitalise the credit institutions, because it is not necessary in these circumstances.  The section also provides that nothing done by the Minister, the commission or a commission investment vehicle for the purposes of a directed investment in a traded credit institution will constitute a reorganisation measure for the purposes of certain European Communities regulations.  The Bill seeks to ensure that contracts previously entered into between recapitalised banks and third parties are uninterrupted, so as to permit the orderly continuation of the banks&rsquo; operations, notwithstanding that shares in the bank have transferred to the commission.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Bill amends section 18 of the principal Act in a number of respects.  First, it amends section 18(2) of the principal Act by allowing the Minister to make the annual contribution of 1% of GNP in a lump sum or in instalments at any time during the year, rather than in equal quarterly instalments.  The NPRF Act 2000 provides for a contribution from the Exchequer to the fund each year of an amount equal to 1% of GNP, to be paid in equal quarterly instalments.  To allow more flexibility, we propose a technical provision so that the annual contribution need no longer be paid in equal quarterly instalments.  This change would, for example, allow the Minister to pay the contribution in a single instalment early in the year, if funds were required in the context of bank recapitalisation.</P><Col N="432" />
        <P>Section 6 of the Bill also amends section 18(5) of the principal Act to include an enabling provision, which would allow the Minister to transfer into the fund a shareholding or other interest held by the Minister or his or her nominee, and to contribute to the fund by paying a sum into the fund.  Section 6 provides that these transfers or contributions may be taken as satisfaction or part satisfaction, as the case may be, of the Minister&rsquo;s obligation under section 18(2) of the principal Act to make annual payments into the fund.  If the total contribution exceeds the amount required to be paid into the fund in any one year, the excess shall be taken in satisfaction or part satisfaction of the amount required to be paid in any subsequent year.</P>
        <P>Section 6 also provides that stamp duty shall not be chargeable on any instrument giving effect to a transfer by the Minister into the fund.  Ownership of the fund is vested in the Minister, so there is no basis for stamp duty being payable, when the Minister is transferring a shareholding in his or her name to the commission for it to manage and invest on his or her behalf.  Section 6 provides that any commission investment vehicle which may be established is owned by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The NPRF Act 2000 provides that the NPRF Commission controls, and is responsible for the investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, subject to the level of risk involved being acceptable to the commission.  This is effectively a commercial investment mandate.  The concentration of significant investment in a particular sector or small number of institutions could be construed as contrary to this strictly commercial mandate.  Accordingly, section 7 of the Bill amends section 19(1) of the principal Act to provide that the commission&rsquo;s strictly commercial investment mandate will not apply in the case of directed investments.</P>
        <P>In the intervening years, there has been significant debate on the overall parameters, within which institutional and sovereign investors should be expected to invest the funds they manage on behalf of the ultimate owners of those funds.  There have been considerable developments in thinking in this area, and the NPRF Commission has taken a number of initiatives to integrate environmental, social and governance considerations into its management of the fund.  In light of this ongoing debate, and having regard to the experience of other countries with sovereign investment funds, it is the Minister&rsquo;s view that this matter requires further consideration.  This subject is frequently debated in various international fora such as the OECD and ASEAN.</P>
        <P>Given the sensitive and urgent nature of the legislation required to facilitate the recapitalisation of the financial institutions and the complexity in drawing up a responsible investment policy that will work in practice, it would not be appropriate at this time to include such a provision in this Bill.  However, given the importance of the subject and in order to advance matters, the Minister is establishing an interdepartmental committee to examine the issues further.  The group will report to the Minister within three months of its establishment, and will be open to receiving the views of interested parties.</P>
        <P>Section 8 is the key section in the Bill, as far as recapitalising the credit institutions is concerned.  The NPRF Commission will be the principal agent of the State in providing the additional investment needed to capitalise the financial institutions.  This will require the NPRF Act 2000 to be amended to give the Minister for Finance the power to direct the commission to make, hold and dispose of investments in the financial institutions as necessary.  Accordingly, section 8 of the Bill amends the principal Act so as to provide that the Minister, in the public interest, having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the regulatory authority, may, in specified circumstances, direct the commission to invest on specified terms and conditions in certain listed credit institutions and to underwrite or otherwise support the issue of securities in such listed credit institutions.</P><Col N="433" />
        <P>The section also enables the Minister to give a direction to the commission in relation to the holding, management and disposal of, and any voting rights attaching to, a directed investment on such terms and conditions as are specified in the direction.  The exercise of these powers will be subject to the normal EU state aid approval process.  This section also provides that the Minister, the commission, a commissioner, the manager of the fund and staff of the manager shall not be taken to be shadow directors within the meaning of section 27(1) of the Companies Act 1990 of a company or its subsidiary, in which the commission has made a directed investment.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the Bill amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, TCA, to provide that the same exemptions from taxation that apply to the NPRF Commission shall apply to any &ldquo;commission investment vehicle&rdquo;, as defined in section 2 of the Bill.  It is logical, that if the commission has tax exemptions when investing in its own right, then it should have the same exemption when investing through an investment vehicle.</P>
        <P>Section 10 of the Bill amends the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007, to clarify that the NPRF Commission and any commission investment vehicle which may be established, are not subject to the regulations.  This is a technical provision.  For the avoidance of doubt, it provides that the NPRF Commission and any commission investment vehicle are not to be regarded as investment intermediaries in their role of investing the fund on behalf of the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 11 amends the Securitisation (Proceeds of Certain Mortgages) Act 1995 to facilitate the winding-up of Ulysses Securitisation plc.  This is a securitisation vehicle, which was established in 1995 to borrow for the Exchequer, using the cash flow from local authority mortgages to guarantee repayment of the bonds issued by Ulysses plc.  The bonds issued by the company have been repaid and it is now proposed to wind up the company.  The provision proposed in section 11 is a technical change to the legislation to facilitate the winding-up of the company and to provide that any remaining assets of the company on its winding-up will be transferred to the Minister for Finance or to such other body as he may direct.  Regrettably, the winding up of Ulysses will not represent a major windfall for the Exchequer.  Ulysses holds approximately &euro;127 million in cash, but it is already borrowed by the Exchequer as ways and means borrowing, so that this amendment will not represent a real improvement in the fiscal arithmetic.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes a provision amending the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 to enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations requiring that certain information relating to transactions in financial instruments must be disclosed to the Financial Regulator or the market, or both.</P>
        <P>Certain financial instruments can be used to acquire an economic interest in the shares of publicly listed companies without acquiring direct control over, or ownership of, such shares.  Such financial instruments are increasingly used by investors to avoid disclosure of their economic interest in a company.  As Senators will be aware, there has been particular controversy regarding the use of contracts for difference, CFDs, which, unlike share transactions, do not need to be reported to the market unless the contracts explicitly give a right to acquire, or give access to, voting rights.</P>
        <P>The provisions in section 12 of the Bill would enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations to require all those who have entered into transactions in financial instruments to disclose certain information relating to those transactions to the Financial Regulator or the market or both.  The provision covers all financial instruments to cater for possible future market developments but the intention is to make regulations covering CFDs in the first instance.</P><Col N="434" />
        <P>Section 13 contains a commencement provision which will apply to the whole Bill other than sections 3(<i>d</i>) and 3(<i>e</i>) which are needed urgently to facilitate the recapitalisation of the financial institutions.  The commencement provision has been included as a courtesy to the European Commission which is still examining some of the provisions of the Bill, as is to be expected given that the main purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the recapitalisation of the two main banks.</P>
        <P>The decision to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland is a clear indication that the Government is fully prepared to stand behind the Irish banking system.  The Government&rsquo;s comprehensive recapitalisation programme for our financial institutions will reinforce the stability of our financial system, increase confidence in the banking system in Ireland, and facilitate the banks involved in lending to the wider economy.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is almost sobering listening to the Minister of State discussing this legislation.  When one thinks about Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s claim that he would destroy the world&rsquo;s economy even if it took him 30 years, little did he realise that it would take the international bankers in this country and across the world a much shorter period than that to do the destruction for which he hoped.  Here we are today discussing our way of digging ourselves out of this mire in which we have put ourselves.</P>
        <P>There are two big issues: the National Pensions Reserve Fund and what it is all about, and the banks.  There was a problem recognised right back in 2000 that there would be a difficulty with paying public sector pensions from 2025 onwards.  When the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 was enacted so that 1% of gross domestic product would be put into this fund, the first and second benchmarking reports were still to arrive.</P>
        <P>I remember speaking in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions asking that some of the funding from the National Treatment Purchase Fund be used to build hospitals, schools and roads in this country.  It was pointed out to me <i>ad nauseam</i> by different Ministers for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children that the National Treatment Purchase Fund was not a slush fund for Government.  Neither is it &mdash; I would hate to correct the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh &mdash; a rainy day fund for the Government.  It was quite clearly pointed out that the National Treatment Purchase Fund was to be used to pay public sector pensions and there was no other purpose for which it could be used.</P>
        <P>If we are taking &euro;4 billion out of the National Treatment Purchase Fund to invest in the banks and we are not sure what could happen with the banks yet and therefore this might not be the wisest investment,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, it is not the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is a minor point, to be honest, given what is happening.  If the Government is taking &euro;4 billion out of this fund and is not putting any payment into it this year and next year, what due diligence has been carried out on the effects of this on the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  The Government is taking out a block of four years&rsquo; payments to the National Pensions Reserve Fund plus there has been a decrease in the investment return of this fund because of what has happened internationally, and when the Government speaks of starting to get back on track in paying into this fund in 2011, it then will have approximately 14 years before this fund is supposed to start paying out on public sector pensions.  Has due diligence been done on the effects of this legislation on the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  That is a matter which has not been alluded to.  I acknowledge we are in a difficult crisis, but when this fund was set up in 2000 it was quite clearly stated <Col N="435" />by the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy, that this was a serious issue and we needed to start building up the fund quickly to deal with public sector pensions.  That is the first question I want the Minister of State to answer.</P>
        <P>The sum of money involved is quite staggering.  The Government is handing over to the banks all of the public sector pension levy, the legislation for which was passed last week, plus this money.  The next issue we should look at is the banks.  There is no confidence that we are being fully informed in the House about what is happening with the banks.  In October last, the chief executive of AIB stated that the bank did not need this capital and was quite happy that it had enough capital within its banking system and that it would need no recapitalisation.  Then there was the PricewaterhouseCoopers report which raised concerns about the level of indebtedness within all our major banks.  That report was not published and therefore we do not know how serious those issues were.  Now we are told that the National Pensions Reserve Fund will conduct its own due diligence on the banks to look at how stable they are from the point of view of handing over billions of taxpayers&rsquo; money to recapitalise them and whether that will have any effect in the long term.  Let us not forget the annual reports and how matters have changed from the public utterances coming from those banks.</P>
        <P>I am not a bit surprised that international investors have lost confidence.  If one was thinking about investing money in either of the two major banks, one would have got sorely burnt and been sorely disappointed with the information one would have been receiving in the public domain from those banks and from the Government in the past six months.  Before we go pouring billions of taxpayers&rsquo; money into this there is a need for more of this information to be made available to Members of this House.</P>
        <P>Over recent weeks, as this crisis has got out of control, Government representatives have been desperately trying to tie the Opposition in to the decision-making process of the Government.  I do not agree with that.  There is a serious need at this stage for constructive opposition to what the Government may be doing because we are not really seeing the clarity and honesty one would expect from a Government which is acting in a financial and political crisis such as this.  There is too much changing of the ground rules as matters move on when we know that the information that subsequently becomes public knowledge was already known by the Government, the bankers and the regulators involved.</P>
        <P>There is a need for national honesty and confidence to be rebuilt in the Government, the banking system and the regulator.  It is the loss of confidence on the part of people in the greater community which is making them angry and resentful towards what is happening here.  This comes not only from the individuals paying the public sector pension levy but others who see vast sums of Government money going towards the banks, and yet at the same time they see little or no regret expressed by the banks for what they have done to the banking system.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should put much more stringent sections in this legislation covering bankers&rsquo; salaries and the reductions that should be made in that regard.  The fact that nobody is seen to be paying a price for obliterating our economy in such a short space of time is what is making the public extremely angry.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should also do something about senior Ministers who are still under the illusion it is 2003, when Ministers were flying in Air Corps helicopters to open off licences in the west of Ireland while their Garda drivers drove down in ministerial Mercedes to pick them up at their destination.  I regret what happened to the Minister in Killarney, but when Ministers are still whizzing about in Air Corps helicopters and Government jets as this crisis unfolds before us, it shows they have no tact or are oblivious to the anger out there.  Ministers should be a little more humble when carrying out their duties.  The Minister gave a lame excuse for using the helicopter.  If he could not make it to Killarney, there would have been another <Col N="436" />Minister nearby who could have deputised rather than making a round trip in an Air Corps helicopter to make a short speech there.  The Government must listen to what is happening because people are getting angry about it.</P>
        <P>The figures state that &euro;1.6 billion is the 1% that is expected from the Government this year and allowed for in the budget.  There is a figure of &euro;1.4 billion as the 1% for next year.  Does that mean the Department of Finance expects a serious regression in GNP next year?  A decrease to &euro;1.4 billion would indicate serious economic regression in 2010.  Is there an expectation in the Department of Finance that things will get worse next year?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State comment on the tax take, which will have a huge impact on the economy?  In 2007, the tax take was &euro;47 billion and the latest projections from the Department of Finance are that this will drop to &euro;34 billion this year.  Government expenditure, however, is not dramatically declining.  That indicates that we are heading for massive budget deficits for the next three years.  It will be almost impossible for us to make it back within the 3% figure in the European Union stability pact.  That should be taken into account when we discuss recapitalisation of the banks.  Throughout the legislation the Government acknowledges the possibility that far greater sums of money might need to be put into the banks to keep them afloat over the coming years, that the &euro;7 billion is just the opening gambit rather than the total amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill supports the Government action to allow for the investment of &euro;3.5 billion in each of the two main banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB Bank.  It also contains provisions to allow the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest in line with its rules and regulations, while dealing with other transactions that may be undertaken within the State in which the State would have a vested interest.  This arises from what happened in financial institutions where contracts for difference were used, which can affect the share price even though they are not share transactions.</P>
        <P>In line with market reality worldwide, the Government took appropriate action to capitalise the banks, a necessary move.  In light of the fact that banks across the world are having difficulties and governments are going around financial institutions with a cart, asking them to bring out their dead, we had no choice but to ensure the stability of our banks and we did so by nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and committing to ensure no systemic bank be allowed to destabilise the national finances.</P>
        <P>It is good for business and the National Pensions Reserve Fund that we have recapitalised the banks.  The return on investment, of &euro;16.2 billion, in the National Pensions Reserve Fund from its establishment in April 2001 until the end of 2008 was 0.9%.  The average return for managed pension funds in Ireland was -1.5% so not only did we have a low return but we were lucky to get anything at all because it was well managed in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>We are getting a guaranteed 8% return from the banks on preferential shares, with an option to take a quarter of the bank and the right to appoint directors and a say in how the bank is run.  We could not have made a better investment.  What is the point of having a National Pensions Reserve Fund if it does not support the Irish economy?  Any investment, equities or otherwise, that is held by the National Pensions Reserve Fund should be brought home.  Similarly, companies that trade in Ireland should bring their funds home.  We would then have full capitalisation of the banks.</P>
        <P>I suggest that instead of borrowing in the home market as a Government, we should borrow abroad, thus ensuring the funding that might otherwise have gone into Government bonds would go into the banks, further enhancing our banking system.  Had we not undertaken this investment, providing capital for the banks and putting in place the terms and conditions that <Col N="437" />ensured money would be released into the economy for business, social and environmental enterprises, it would not have happened and the recession would have become a self-fulfilling prophecy because the banks would have ensured their own stability and cut back on lending.</P>
        <P>Banks that are owned abroad, such as Ulster Bank and First Active, which are owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, have debts by virtue of their take-over of ABN Amro.  This provides proof of the international nature of economics and shows that we are not operating in a vacuum; a bank that owned a bank that bought a bank got into trouble.  Royal Bank of Scotland, which owned Ulster Bank, which bought ABN Amro, could not lend in Ireland because it lost so much money when it bought ABN Amro.</P>
        <P>The Government is acting correctly.  This is good for the National Treasury Management Agency.  The return is more than adequate at 8% and makes good business sense.</P>
        <P>There was a suggestion that hedge funds are betting against the Irish economy.  If this is true, it is essential.  There is no doubt that the Irish economy was being down-played, to say the least, by financial commentators, especially &mdash; to be very straight about who it was &mdash; the City of London.  Some of those financial people were down-playing and bad-mouthing the Irish economy.  If anybody is taking a position against the Irish economy in the contracts for difference, we should know about it.  We should remind ourselves that we have an undertaking from the European Central Bank, as well as the paymasters of Europe, the Germans, and the head of the Bundesbank that they would support the euro and the Irish economy.  This is all positive news in light of the fact that the ECB will lower interest rates by 0.5% this week and possibly by another 0.5%.  The reality is that people will be asked to make sacrifices, including paying extra taxation.  However, if the cost of mortgages has significantly decreased, with the cost of electricity, heating and other outgoings, bar tax, it will be a softer cushion for when that inevitable increase in taxation takes place.  It is also good for the Government.  We have a very low debt and continue to have a low debt within the EU.  If one includes the National Pensions Reserve Fund and cash balances, we are down at approximately 20%.</P>
        <P>Our small open economy has been one of the first to be hit by the global downturn, but it will also be one of the first to recover. This has been pointed out by Mr. Trichet, the head of the ECB.   That is why I am happy to commend this Bill to the House.  Funds should be at the service of the people and if there is a national emergency, of course we should use the National Pensions Reserve Fund to assist the nation.  That is exactly what has been done.  When faced with stark choices the Government has made the tough decisions and will continue to do so.  The necessary decisions should also be measured by those who will come on board, such as the social partners.  As soon as we take the necessary decisions, the social partners should be regarded as having assisted us in a time of emergency and therefore we should move quickly to reinstate any loss when the international economy turns around.</P>
        <P>There are positive signs but it may be too early to tell whether they will affect the Irish economy.  Some of the economies in the Far East are growing, such as China&rsquo;s.  In addition, the price of oil is very low and the cost of money is coming down, while inflation is very low.  There are positive signs, including lower expectations.  With that in mind, I hope that not only in the future will this Bill be seen as having been emergency legislation, but also that it will be seen to have had a beneficial and positive effect on the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Between 2001 and 2009 the total return on that fund was 0.9%, which is regarded as a positive return.  We are guaranteed 8% on our &euro;7 billion, payable either in cash or ordinary shares.  We also got a &euro;30 million arrangement fee.  For those reasons the legislation is necessary, positive and timely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not anticipated being the first speaker from the Independent group and I am certainly not the most qualified.  I have some observations to make with an <Col N="438" />unusual degree of humility because I recognise my lack of expertise in this matter.  I also recognise the expertise of the Minister of State in this area.  However, I have some questions to ask about this legislation.  As I entered the Chamber, I think I heard my distinguished colleague, Senator Hanafin, refer to the question of hedge funds.  I raised this matter on the Order of Business, as did Senator Hanafin who backed up what I said.  The Minister of State might be in a position to give some view on this.  On the radio this morning, Mr. Brendan Keenan alleged that one of the difficulties in terms of fiscal policy for the Government was that London-based hedge funds were gambling extensively against the Irish currency.  This is a particularly nasty practice so we should examine the operation of hedge funds and their ethical background.  I welcome the fact that, within the past year, both archbishops of Dublin spoke on the ethics of international financial dealings.  Although I am not in any sense an expert in this area, I asked a friend of mine, who is something of an expert, what was a hedge fund and he said it was basically somebody betting on failure, like betting on a football team to lose.  It has been noted scientifically that the establishment of an experiment, including the process of observation and calculation, can have a damaging and detrimental effect.</P>
        <P>Putting hedge funds aside, however, I wish to raise another question arising from that radio programme, which a large proportion of people would have heard.  Mr. Keenan, who writes on these matters for the Independent Group and is usually fairly balanced, said there was not a single person in the Department of Finance who had any economic qualifications.  I wonder if this could possibly be true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Well, I have some.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What a relief that the Minister of State has some, but he is disposable.  That is the thing.  He is a mere ephemera in the situation.  It is like the old Robert Bridges poem which includes the line, &ldquo;But I go on forever&rdquo;.  We have the permanent Civil Service.  I am just wondering what the level of expertise is because apparently the contrast was that there are 100 civil servants in the financial section of the Northern Ireland civil service.  I am not somebody who believes that one must stuff every area of life with academics.  I believe in hands-on management, but an academic view is sometimes of assistance because it is impartial.</P>
        <P>This legislation indicates the severity of the problem whereby we will have to break the piggy-bank to go to the cinema.  We are basically smashing the little ceramic pig and taking out all the pennies.  There has been a cautious response from Monsieur Trichet at the European Central Bank.  He seems to have a number of reservations about this operation, although he is not in a position to annul it completely.  A recent ECB opinion document stated that there should be a co-ordinated approach.  Perhaps the Minister of State will assure us with regard to the level of co-ordination across Europe with our partner countries.  It also refers to the temporary nature of this legislation and matters such as any effect to limit distortions in financial markets.  I am putting these matters on the record as they are published in this ECB opinion.</P>
        <P>The document states the common principles to be adhered to as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) interventions should be timely and the support should in principle be temporary; (ii) the interests of taxpayers should be protected; (iii) existing shareholders should bear the due consequences of the intervention.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The latter one seems a little harsh to me.  What are the due consequences?  With regard to Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, the Minister might indicate what the ultimate consequences will be because many people would be interested in hearing about this.  I am saying this because I have had a most horrendous time at the hands of Irish builders.  I delight in the <Col N="439" />collapse of the building industry by and large.  I think the builders asked for it and behaved like the French aristocrats prior to the arrival of the tumbrels.</P>
        <P>However, there are decent builders and I ultimately came to one of them.  He was a young married man who worked hard and behaved with extraordinary integrity.  He, unfortunately, invested his savings in Anglo Irish Bank shares which are now wiped out.  The due consequences should fall on the directors of the banks and those who took decisions.  The investors, by and large, should be afforded some protection.</P>
        <P>The ECB&rsquo;s observations continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">(iv) the government should be in a position to bring about a change of management; (v) management should not retain undue benefits [I say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to that]; (vi) governments may have, <i>inter alia</i> the power to intervene in remuneration[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am not sure if that power is other than persuasive.  I do not believe governments have a direct power to determine exact remuneration.  The legislation, taken as a whole, may be somewhat lax in this regard.</P>
        <P>The ECB&rsquo;s observations continue, &ldquo;(vii) legitimate interest of competitors must be protected, in particular through the State aid rules and negative spill-over effects should be avoided&rdquo;.  On the Order of Business, I had a fair amount to say on competition issues.  It is a cautious view but it does not say we must not pursue this course of action.</P>
        <P>Will this Bill be enough?  The Government has opened the books to the Opposition parties, which I welcome.  I do not agree with my colleague who said this was a cynical move to mire the Opposition in some kind of machiavellian plot.  That is far too cynical a view to take of politics.  However, it is an informed view for whatever reason.  The Government has also opened the books to the social partners.  When will the banks&rsquo; books be opened?  We need to know the depth of the problem.  Is it a mirage that alters all the time?  It reminds me of the film &ldquo;Flubber&rdquo; in which a mad scientist discovers a green material which keeps altering its dimensions and shape.  Is the indebtedness of the banks a kind of economic flubber that we will never get to end of and will fly around doing all kind of damage?</P>
        <P>I must pay a compliment to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for providing debate packs so that we can have a more informed debate.  I notice in one of the articles enclosed in the pack that there was a call from a reporter wanting another prominent political person to call for the resignation of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  That is fatuous.  I do not envy his job.  I commend him as a person of considerable integrity and decency.  I would understand if he were to resign voluntarily.  How could anyone bear the responsibility of that horrible job at the moment?  I welcome the fact that he is taking on board views from other people.</P>
        <P>Returning to the breaking of the piggy bank, it suggests to me we are in difficult circumstances.  The pension reserve was launched in 2000 by the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, because of the changing demographics and age profile which would have an impact on the capacity of the State to pay pensions and social welfare benefits, especially after 2025.  The fund set aside 1% of gross national product every year to provide for this perceived problem in the future.  It was to remain inviolable and was legislated in such a way that it was ring-fenced so that Governments could not use the moneys for other purposes.  I welcomed this provision at the time, as I welcomed any steps any Governments took to pay off the national debt and putting aside moneys for the rainy day.  There was an absolute prohibition on drawdowns until 2025.  Will the Minister inform the House if the Government has considered the impact from 2025 on its ability to pay pensions now that the fund is being used in this manner? <Col N="440" /> Before the establishment of the fund, we had committed ourselves to a rather lackadaisical system of paying pensions out of day-to-day revenue which was found to be very unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>I knew the fund&rsquo;s initial chairman, the late Mr. Donal J. Geaney, founder of &Eacute;lan, who engaged my services to talk at Trinity College Dublin.  Alas his financial experiences towards the end of his life were not entirely positive.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to answer the questions I have raised.  I have felt for some time that we need to know the exact scale of the problem.  The banks&rsquo; books need to be opened.  We need to know if these will be enough funds because it is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Can we rely on the assurances of the banks that these funds will be used productively?  I note 10% will be put aside by the banks to provide lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises and an additional 30% capacity to first-time buyers in 2009.  What happens in 2010?  I know interest rates are going down but a time will come when they go up again.  It is all very well theoretically for the banks to say 30%.</P>
        <P>This is taxpayers&rsquo; money going into the banks to make up for the poor decisions of their executives.  Accountability is needed in this action.  I am not for the creation of a toxic bank but a bank to extract the dangerous and speculative property-based loans.</P>

It might allow the people to benefit by 2025.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I support this vital legislation.  Last October, the Government introduced the guarantee scheme which has proven to be the most important pillar put in place to support the banking system.  The scheme has provided protection for the system, for depositors and those who invested in the banks.  The Bill before the House is no less important than that scheme.  The Government has decided to influence the way in which the banking system will develop in the coming years.  It will do so by way of investment rather than by engaging in a bail-out of the banks.  There are certain individuals who, on each occasion on which they are interviewed on radio, state that the Government is <Col N="441" />bailing out the banks.  There will be no bail-out.  The two main banks in which taxpayers&rsquo; money is being invested will be obliged to pay for that assistance.</P>
        <P>Without a banking system, we would not have an economy.  We must ensure that our economy and the 1.8 million people who are in employment have access to a banking system that serves them well.  In addition, it must serve small and large businesses.  There is also a need to ensure that credit flows will be in place when the economy begins to recover.</P>
        <P>We are being obliged to underpin a system that was failing.  This problem is not peculiar to Ireland; the banking system worldwide has failed.  In that context, the American Insurance Group, AIG, the largest insurance corporation in the world, announced further major losses last week.  While the situation in this country may be bad, that which obtains in other jurisdictions is worse.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s job to lead and it has been very successful in doing so in respect of this matter.  However, it is important to think outside the box when considering the various financial sectors.  There is a particular sector which has not really been mentioned and to which not much consideration has been given.  I refer here to the credit unions, which have approximately &euro;13.5 billion in deposits on their books.  These institutions could be encouraged to play a greater role in respect of the current crisis.  For example, a Government bond scheme in which they might invest could be introduced.  This would be better than investing on the open market, which gave rise to major difficulties for them in the past two years.  A Government bond system such as that to which I refer could be a means to bring additional money into the banking system at a lower but safer level, particularly in view of the fact that credit unions are tied to more co-operative and local management support structures.  There is no doubt that additional cash is required.  In that context, a national bond scheme in which people might invest should be introduced.  When money was required in the past, ordinary citizens supported such a scheme.  The time is right to introduce a national bond scheme.</P>
        <P>In the context of how we might move forward, people have posed the question as to whether further recapitalisation will be required in respect of the banks.  The answer is probably yes.  I would not rule out the prospect that the banks may eventually need to be nationalised.  No one has been able to solve the crisis currently affecting global financial markets.  Ireland has probably been more cautious than other countries, some of which were quick to invest in their banks.  The latter course of action does not appear to have had a positive impact.  It is only now that Ireland is making an investment in its two main banks.  This is a timely development.  The banking system must now provide the flow of credit necessary to keep the economy going.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not as concerned, and I do not become as excited, as Senator Butler about the use of the term &ldquo;bail out&rdquo; in respect of the banks.  I have always understood that term to have originated from the need to remove water from a sinking ship.  However, I am not sure whether that is the correct derivation.  We are extending a huge indulgence and generosity to the banks and, in the circumstances, the term &ldquo;bail out&rdquo; does not fall too wide of the mark.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey raised an important point when he inquired as to the likely impact of the measures being introduced in this Bill on the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Will the Minister of State outline the nature of the assessment carried out by the Government in respect of the impact of these measures and indicate whether the residual moneys in the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be sufficient to allow it to be used for the purpose for which it was originally established?  Elaboration of this matter has not really been forthcoming.  The Minister of State indicated:</P><Col N="442" />
        <P LI="1">The use of some of the resources of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to fund the bank recapitalisation programme strikes a prudent balance between the need to address an urgent economic priority and the need to continue to take account of long-term budgetary stability and the sustainability of our pensions system</P>
        <P FLI="0">I accept that he is saying, on behalf of the Government, that there is not a major concern in this regard and that a prudent balance will be struck.  However, the National Pensions Reserve Fund is the property of the Irish people.  We are entitled to some insight into the Government&rsquo;s view on the potential or likely impact on that fund of our delving into it for a purpose which was not envisaged when it was established.  It is at least arguable that this purpose is one which, if not expressly excluded, was certainly implicitly excluded when the fund was formed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is important to recognise what is being done in the legislation before the House.  Senator Norris referred to raiding piggy banks etc.  Regardless of how one describes what is happening, it is important that we make clear that we are making a fundamental change to the character and purpose of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which was established in 2001.  There is no point seeking to characterise it as something temporary or as an <i>ad hoc</i> contingency that we must use for the moment and see how we get on.  This legislation fundamentally alters the very principle and nature of the fund and the reasons for which it was established.  That being so, a greater insight and a little more elaboration and analysis is necessary of the Government&rsquo;s view as to the future direction of the fund.  What will the fund be in the future?  Is it likely or at least possible that it will be open to further raids, although I hesitate to use that word because it is emotive?  Is it the case that on policy grounds the Government will make other changes in the future to allow the fund to be used for other purposes?  I accept that it will be done by way of legislation, but there is an element of uncertainty now as a result of the Government having altered the fundamental basis on which the fund was established.</P>
        <P>I smiled a little when I heard the Minister of State say that the existence of the fund gave the lie to the notion that at the height of the Celtic tiger economy, when the country was awash with revenue, the money was squandered.  It does not give a lie to it at all.  Is the Minister of State seriously saying that because the fund was set up in 2001 to deal with the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions which will arise from 2025, it is an answer to the charge levelled against the Government that it failed to act prudently or understand, especially in the serious decisions that were made throughout the past seven or eight years, that there were inherent risks in the way the economy was going and that much of the economics being practised could only be described as <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i> economics?  Is he seriously invoking as his defence to the charge of <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i> economics the existence of the fund?  The fund was set up for a specific, good and prudential purpose in 2001, to anticipate how the Exchequer would deal with the pension demands that would arise after 2025 and not as a means of setting aside money for a rainy day which has now unquestionably arrived.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State let the cat out of the bag by stating that the NPRF &ldquo;has enabled us to cope with the banking crisis without aggravating further our alarming budget deficit&rdquo;.  It was never the intention of the NPRF to enable us to cope with a banking crisis.  Let us be clear on what the fund is and let the Government acknowledge that they are bringing about a fundamental change in that.  What the Government is seeking to do is to alter wholly the nature and purpose of the fund.  Regrettably, the Exchequer has no other source of funds to recapitalise the banks.  The Government has no choice; it must do it.  It must go to the piggy bank, as Senator Norris described it.  However, it should not spin these things.  The Minister of State is not the worst spinner in the outfit.  That is not a criticism but is meant as a compliment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>He usually states things reasonably clearly but many of his colleagues do not.  There is an attempt to spin this matter even in some of the arguments from my colleagues on the Government benches who say it is good for the National Treasury Management Agency, the Government and so forth.  It is not good that we must dip into this pension contingency fund.  It is terrible that we have to do it and why do people not honestly say so instead of trying to suggest that it is fantastic and will be great for everybody?  It is a disastrous thing to have to do.</P>
        <P>It is in a line of emergency measures the Government has had to introduce repeatedly in the Houses owing to our current situation.  My colleague, Deputy Burton, has stated that according to her count, this is the ninth measure the Government has attempted to take or purported to take to deal with the banking and credit crisis in this country.  On most occasions when an action is taken by the Government the other actions that are ruled out at that time are subsequently taken.  Last September, for example, there was not going to be a recapitalisation because it was deemed unnecessary.  There was also going to be no nationalisation of any banks.  A mini-budget was categorically ruled out in the words of the Minister for Finance.  He said there would not be a further budget.</P>
        <P>I accept times change but we are all intelligent enough to be able to absorb honest language and commentary from the Government that makes sense.  Stop trying to spin things.  Stop trying to turn bad, difficult and in some cases wrong decisions into great things just by the use of words, as has been attempted in the last few minutes in this House, because they are not.</P>
        <P>Is today the date on which the famous committee is due to report on bankers&rsquo; salaries?  I wonder what will emerge from that.  I regret that the amendments introduced in the other House relating to the capping of salaries were not included in the legislation.  I also regret that the legislation does not make it necessary for the Government to return to the Houses if it requires more than &euro;7 billion.  I will certainly support the amendments tabled by Senator Twomey that reflect the issues raised in the other House by my party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I would have seen the pension fund as our security or our inheritance.  It is the last remaining morsel of the Celtic tiger economy.  I regret that it is necessary to invest &euro;3.5 billion each in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In view of the AIB figures released yesterday, I wonder if &euro;3.5 billion will be enough, given our great expectation that this recapitalisation will keep the banks solvent and liquid.  Does the Minister of State believe it will be enough?</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has always agreed that the banks must be capitalised to maintain liquidity and solvency.  My colleagues, Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell, have agreed on this for a long time.  Since last July our party has made very good suggestions and while I welcome the invitation to the Opposition parties to examine the books, some of those suggestions have fallen on deaf ears.  This is particularly the case with the proposed good bank model, which is that we establish a good AIB and Bank of Ireland as well as a bad AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The bad bank would effectively operate as a debt collection agency and no longer function as a commercial bank.  This would allow the good bank to function and people could have confidence in it.  The new bank would be seen as a new start and could take off with fresh investment.</P>
        <P>A number of friends and elderly people have approached me expressing concern about where they should move their money.  They are taking money from one bank and putting it into another.  Elderly people, in particular, are experiencing severe anxiety.  I fear people will start keeping money under their mattresses if the proposed new model, under which we would have <Col N="444" />a &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad bank&rdquo;, is not introduced.  As to the question of how one would fund a bad bank, the new institution would be self-funding if it were to act as a debt collection agency.</P>
        <P>I welcome the instrument introduced under section 12 on contracts of difference.  We are all aware of the serious difficulties the Financial Regulator encountered with regard to a number of debtors of Anglo Irish Bank who were not obliged to disclose their dealings.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated the banks have committed to increasing lending capacity to small businesses and first-time buyers by 10% and 30%, respectively.  Senators will have read reports published last week on a survey carried out by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association which found that 48% of the association&rsquo;s members had been refused credit by banks.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure small and medium-size enterprises are guaranteed access to funding and bank credit.</P>
        <P>Under the sound financial leadership of Deputies Bruton and O&rsquo;Donnell, the Fine Gael Party has made a number of excellent suggestions, which I do not propose to repeat.  The bottom line is that we need to obtain value for money for taxpayers who, after all, own the funds being used to recapitalise the banks.  If the position of AIB is desperate, how will small and medium-size enterprises secure access to a flow of money?</P>
        <P>Senator Butler, for whom I have great respect, indicated the State is investing in rather than bailing out the banks.  We are being forced to bail out the banks.  One invests &euro;7 billion in a company with an expectation that one will get value for money and substantial rewards.  I do not envisage the State being rewarded for bailing out the banks.  In addition, an investment is a transaction in which one freely participates.  This is not the case with this proposal.  While I accept the necessity to recapitalise the banks, we must secure value for money for taxpayers and a guarantee that small and medium-size enterprises will have access to cash flow to allow them to operate their business, employ staff and get the economy rolling again.</P>
        <P>What course of action will the Government adopt if, several months from now, AIB, Bank of Ireland or another bank decides to seek further money?  This is a genuine concern.  I wonder if &euro;7 billion will be sufficient and, if not, what other resources are available to the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State who appears to be the permanent Minister for the Seanad.  While I respect the Minister of State&rsquo;s decision to attend this debate, the absence of his senior Minister reflects poorly on the Minister for Finance.  I share Senator Alex White&rsquo;s view that the Minister of State is not one of the best spinners in Government.  The senior Minister should have attended this debate to show respect for the House. </P>
        <P>As Senator McFadden stated, we need banks and recapitalisation is, therefore, necessary.  Senators may not like to hear it but the measures proposed in the Bill amount to another bail-out.  We are back in GUBU territory, an area with which the Minister of State will be familiar.  Senator Twomey asked a pertinent question to which we require an answer.  What will be the impact of the Bill on the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  The purpose of the fund is being changed.  Are we selling the family silver or putting all our eggs in one basket?</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on liquidity and the provision of moneys for small and medium-size enterprises.  I hope the banks will lend to these enterprises as liquidity will be vital for economic growth and ensuring the country emerges from recession.  My understanding of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments is that the Minister for Finance will be given <i>carte blanche</i> under the legislation.  This is a matter of concern.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine the issue of control.  Why will the NPRF be unable to invest without first seeking Oireachtas or ministerial approval?  Is the &euro;7 billion we propose to <Col N="445" />invest in two banks sufficient or is the sum involved perhaps excessive?  What are the views of the gurus on this matter?</P>
        <P>I read commentary, listen to Ministers and note the contributions of Members from all sides on these issues.  However, as a public representative who canvasses four days each week, I have not heard anything from the Government to reflect the anger of ordinary people or the fear of small business owners &mdash; restaurateurs, shop owners and trades people &mdash; with a staff of three or four who are struggling to survive and may go to the wall.  Last Saturday, I met a 72 year old spinster, a former national school teacher, who lives alone and does not have family to care for her.  Having bought shares in Bank of Ireland which are now virtually worthless, she is beside herself with worry.  She did not invest because she was greedy or wanted to make a profit but because she wanted to have a nest egg.  As she pointed out to me, she hoped to feel financially secure when she entered a nursing home.</P>
        <P>As Senator McFadden noted, people are fearful.  I reacted initially with disbelief and laughter when I learned that people were withdrawing money from banks.  I have since had many calls from people who are fearful about their savings.  This week, for instance, we heard news about a credit union.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey is correct that while politicians are pilloried, the financial institutions have done everyone a disservice.  Positive action must be taken on the remuneration and bonuses of banking executives.  People must also be held to account in the courts.  I do not say this to play to the gallery.  The people in question must be held to account and solutions must be provided.  While I have no sympathy for those involved, unfortunately, decent, honourable people working behind the counters of banks &mdash; I visit my local bank every week &mdash; are being wrongly attacked by every Tom, Dick and Harry.  We have clearly lost trust and faith in the financial institutions.</P>
        <P>Are the 25% voting rights and the 25% shareholding the State may acquire as a result of recapitalisation sufficient?  Given that the State will effectively own the banks, it should control them.  The share prices of the banks have collapsed and the markets, as we saw this week, have nearly imploded.  Do we have confidence, internationally and domestically, that we can overcome this?  From talking to people across the USA and the UK, I know they are seriously concerned about regulation here.  Will this Bill allow the banks to create liquidity for our small and medium-sized enterprises?  The Government seems reluctant to take on board the suggestion of the European Commission about setting up a bad bank.  I wonder why.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the 25% voting share is insufficient.  We need to see the interests of the people reflected in the banks.  Where will the 8% dividend go?  I am afraid the banks will use the money they get from us now and carry on their merry way.  That cannot happen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House and am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I support the recapitalisation of the banks.  It is proper and fair that we have a strong banking sector.  We need banks that will go down the road with a person who is willing to take a chance.  Thus, we need strong banks and we need them to take chances on people.  After all, self-employed people who are willing to invest and take a chance are living on their wits and they need strong banks behind them that are also willing to take a chance.  That is why I support the recapitalisation.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin said it was only right that the National Pensions Reserve Fund should be able to invest in our own country.  This is true.  Deputy Michael Noonan proposed this about seven years ago and I am delighted Fianna F&aacute;il has now come around.  The NPRF should invest in this country and if this had been arranged when Deputy Noonan proposed it, much of our infrastructure would now be supported by the NPRF.  It would now be getting quite a return <Col N="446" />on its investments.  It may well have purchased the toll roads, for instance.  I support this measure and I am delighted to see the Government has come around to that way of thinking.</P>
        <P>We need to spell out in simple language what is taking place and how the Government is recapitalising banks.  The public is muddled about whether the Government is taking shares and what type of shares they are or whether the NPRF is investing money in the bank on behalf of the Government and getting a return of 8% annually.  The Minister of State said in his speech:</P>
        <P LI="1">Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the commission is precluded from investing in Irish Government securities.  Section 3 also contains a technical provision to clarify that the reference in the principal Act to &ldquo;Irish Government securities&rdquo; means debt instruments issued by the Exchequer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What exactly does this mean?  Is Anglo Irish Bank a debt instrument?  The Government has invested in it.  The public is not fully <i>au fait</i> &mdash; none of us is fully <i>au fait</i> &mdash; with what is happening.</P>
        <P>I must also ask the Minister whether everything is in the open now.  First, we had the guarantee scheme, then we had the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and now we have the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  At every stage the Minister for Finance said this was for the sake of the markets.  He stressed every time that he was making those decisions based on the markets.  However, the markets nose-dived every time.  They went straight down through the floor.  Since he made his announcement last September, time after time the markets have gone through the floor.  Is there anything else that is yet to come out?  We are here on behalf of the taxpayer, giving power to the Minister for Finance to put the pensions and the future of our people into the banks.  That is what we are doing.  The Minister of State said we would get an 8% return.  We are not sure whether we will get that, but the Minister of State suggests we will.  The public needs to know whether there is any more bad news to come out.  Are we at the bottom?</P>
        <P>The Bill states that the National Pensions Reserve Fund can only invest in companies that are listed on the Stock Exchange.  What is the position with EBS and Irish Nationwide, for example?  If they require recapitalisation or an injection of capital, does that mean the NPRF cannot invest in them?  Will the Minister for Finance have to dip into some other pot to get funding?  Are there any limits on the amount of money the NPRF can invest?  In giving power to the Minister to direct the NPRF to invest, are we giving him an open invitation to invest in any financial institution?  Under the existing legislation, does the NPRF not have the power to invest in companies or is it prohibited from doing so because of what the Minister of State said in his speech about Government securities?  Do we have to change this in the current legislation to give the fund that power?  I may have some further questions on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for a very good debate.  I am not the Minister for Finance, but I will attempt to reply to the best of my ability to the points raised.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael spokesperson, Senator Twomey, raised the issue of due diligence.  If I understand him correctly, he was referring not to due diligence with regard to the banks, which has been dealt with, but with regard to the original purpose of the pension fund, which was to disburse funds from 2025.  Am I correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="447" />
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not delay the House talking about due diligence with regard to the banks.  Obviously there is a degree of uncertainty in the projections for pension costs post-2025, which depend on demographic assumptions.  The Department of Finance has published projections carried out by the long-term issues group, assisted by Alan Barrett at the ESRI.  Such projections are kept under review and are inevitably changing.  The major variables, of course, are net immigration and emigration over the next 20 years.  Clearly, however, there is a degree of uncertainty in that regard.  We are looking at a timeframe of 16 years if we set 2025 as the end year.</P>
        <P>It is not accurate to speak about raiding the National Pensions Reserve Fund or selling the family silver because the returns from the investments in the banks will accrue to the fund.  We hope to come through the current difficulties long before 2025.  In the short term, the fund will earn 8%, which is an attractive rate of return in light of current market conditions.  If the shares are not repaid within five years they will be valued at 125%.  A balance must be found between the need to recapitalise the banks and preserving the integrity of the fund.  We are maintaining the 1% contribution in addition to the 8% dividend.  The warrants attached to the preference shares give the State the option to purchase 25% ordinary shares in five years&rsquo; time at current prices.  The Exchequer stands to gain, therefore.</P>
        <P>In regard to drawing the Opposition into the decision making process, Opposition Members can at any time make suggestions or propose ideas.  They are not under an obligation in this regard, however.  The roles of Government and Opposition are equally honourable and the former has made it clear that, while it will take the necessary decisions, it would welcome the input of the latter.  It has been the case since Dr. Garret FitzGerald was Taoiseach that the Department of Finance is available to Opposition Members to perform costings on a confidential basis.</P>
        <P>Several Senators raised the question of bank salaries.  A report by the covered institutions remuneration committee on the remuneration of bankers was handed to the Minister two days ago but he will need time to study it before bringing it before the Government.  I am sure he will be making a statement on the matter shortly.</P>
        <P>The issue of ministerial logistics was raised.  It is not a simple matter to travel from A to B to C without losing an excessive amount of time.  It is possible to travel using slow and cheap methods but much depends on the value attached to ministerial time.  I am conscious of being as economical as possible in the fulfilment of my official functions.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey asked whether the differing amounts required in 2009 and 2010 implied a sharp regression in growth.  The amount required for 2010 will be 1% of GNP, as forecast in the budget for that year, but we are front-loading &euro;1.4 billion towards our requirements for that year.  If, for example, &euro;1.6 billion is required in 2010 a further contribution of &euro;200 million will be necessary.  There is no inherent implication in this of a worse than expected shortfall next year.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin expressed his satisfaction that Irish investments are coming home.  The investment mandate of the NPRF is to invest the assets of the fund with a view to achieving the optimal return, subject to a level of risk which is acceptable to the NPRF commission.  This commercial investment mandate is similar to those of private sector pension funds.  In seeking an optimal return, the commission is required to choose investments on the basis of what appears to offer the best prospect of return and it has absolute discretion in that regard.  The commission has invested in Irish companies but in accordance with the mandate set out in legislation, the bulk of its investments are made abroad.  It would not be possible to require <Col N="448" />that all investments be made in Ireland, any more than it would be proper to require Irish companies to invest exclusively at home.  I take the Senator&rsquo;s point, however, and consider it a matter of finding a balance.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about the activities of London-based hedge funds and commentary on the Irish economy.  The Government is determined to do what is necessary to overcome the difficulties in the banking sector and the national finances.  One cannot help but note that nearly every country, and certainly Britain, is grappling with the same problems.</P>
        <P>Officials in the Department of Finance hold a broad range of qualifications, including economics and business-related degrees.  Over the years, many civil servants have taken evening courses to gain such qualifications.  Economics formed part of the studies for my degree but the vast bulk of my practical knowledge was learned over the past 34 years as a public servant in various capacities.  The Department can draw on the practical experience of bodies such as the National Treasury Management Agency, which has strong experience in markets, the NPRF, which employs highly qualified staff with a broad range of experience, and the ESRI in respect of economic analysis.</P>
        <P>The EU, the OECD and other bodies are taking a co-ordinated approach in responding to various aspects of the current crisis.  On the ultimate consequence of the bank crisis, no more than other Members, I do not have a crystal ball.  Several Senators asked if the current recapitalisation is enough.  It is sufficient for now.  Obviously, there is capacity in the Bill to take further action should it prove necessary.  There is a limitation, in terms of bank confidentiality, to the degree to which one can open bank books to the general gaze of the public.  While there are reports on the matter, one needs maximum transparency consistent with confidentiality in order to carry out bank activities.</P>
        <P>The Minister has referred to Peter Bacon the question of whether it is a good idea to establish a toxic bank, an issue being examined by other Governments.  Reference was made to the excesses of builders and banks.  However, the vast majority of construction activity that took place in this country during the past ten or 15 years has been beneficial.  Building firms should not be necessarily attacked in a blanket manner.  Similarly the thousands of people, not on particularly high salaries and working in the banks, should be respected and not be held responsible for the banking crisis.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler asked about a national bond.  The National Treasury Management Agency is responsible for the management of debt.  There are plenty of opportunities to support the Exchequer including, for institutions, normal bond insurance and for individuals, small savings products including savings bonds and certificates, prize bonds and so on.  There is concern in regard to an excessive deflection of funds from banks to small savings products and as such there is some reluctance to encourage a national bond.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White questioned the use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to address the recapitalisation issue.  Despite the original purpose of the fund, the Oireachtas has the power to change legislation should it prove necessary.  The clauses contained in the original Bill were to ensure the purpose could not be changed without reference to the Oireachtas.  I must point out that the Labour Party was, for a number of years, pressing Government to use the National Pensions Reserve Fund to fund all sorts of domestic capital projects under the capital programme and the national development plan.  Effectively, it wanted the Government to spend some of the money saved.  It is a little ironic that Senator White is now calling on the Government to do due diligence in terms of the effect of recapitalisation on the National <Col N="449" />Pensions Reserve Fund.  I do not recall the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals requiring that the fund be accompanied by any due diligence on its effect on pensions from 2025.</P>
        <P>Senator White also said this legislation is the ninth measure.  In my speech in the D&aacute;il last night, I stated that we have been engaged in crisis management since last July and in particular since the autumn, as have most other Governments.  One of the features of crisis management is that crises take twists and turns requiring one to continue to address problems until matters are stabilised.  In the case of AIG, the US Administration has had to revisit that issue three times.</P>
        <P>I will not outline in detail the recapitalisation issue as that has been done many times.  However, the recapitalisation package includes specific measures requiring the banks to support small and medium enterprises and relating to mortgages.  Senator Buttimer referred to GUBU and 1982, a year I recall well, politically.  The character of the current crisis has nothing in common with the events of that year.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators asked if I can give a guarantee there is no more bad news to come.  It would be absurd for me or any Minister to give that type of guarantee.  That is not a reasonable request.  I take on board Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point in regard to the anger and dismay of people, not least those people who invested in bank shares.  Up to a couple of years ago bank shares, more than property &mdash; I am speaking in this regard of our main banks &mdash; were viewed as the ultimate in safe investment.  I am aware of charitable trusts and so on that had their savings almost exclusively invested in bank shares as they had a good record of appreciation, supplied a good income and paid handsome dividends.  It is unfortunate that that situation has changed.</P>
        <P>It is partly out of regard for those shareholders, and for other reasons, that the Government has not nationalised banks without necessity.  If the banks, which should in better conditions be inherently profitable and up until recently have been so, manage to get over the current problems then, presumably, bank shares will again eventually increase in value and all will not be lost.  It would be bleak for those shareholders if shares not alone lost the vast majority of their value but the situation was irrecoverable, which is what nationalising the banks would do.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members of the House for their patience.  I hope I have responded to the points raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to the question in regard to Irish Nationwide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Burke referred to the credit institutions not listed on the Stock Exchange, notably EBS and Irish Nationwide.  The Government announced proposals for the recapitalisation of the two main banks and it nationalised Anglo Irish Bank.  It has announced that it is in discussions with the other institutions covered by the deposit guarantees, Irish Life &amp; Permanent, EBS and INBS, concerning their respective capital positions and review of the guarantee scheme.  </P>
       <P>There are several options available if further funds are needed to recapitalise the banks.  It would be possible to invest Exchequer moneys directly under the Credit Institutions Financial Support Act 2008.  It would be possible to provide moneys from the Exchequer to the NPRF commission for investment in a listed credit institution under this Bill and it would also be possible under this Bill for the Minister for Finance to direct the commission to invest in a listed credit institution from its own funds.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1, 3<i>a</i> and 3<i>b</i> are related and will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">2.&mdash;The remuneration of any officer, employee or director of any financial institution to which funds are paid out of the National Pensions Reserve Fund under this Act shall not exceed the sum of &euro;250,000.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This relates to one of the core provisions Fine Gael wants to see in this legislation, namely, some block on the remuneration of senior bank officials under this legislation.  There is no <Col N="451" />reason in the world that the Government cannot fix this and deal with bank officials&rsquo; remuneration.  On other occasions in the course of the debate on the economy and the bank recapitalisation, I have raised the issue of people who are stuck with fixed interest mortgages.  I raised it again last night.  The bank recapitalisation plan is costing taxpayers &euro;7 billion.  We are using all the 1% income levy, which normally goes towards looking after social welfare and public sector pensions, to recapitalise the banks for this year and next year.  All the money from the civil and public servants&rsquo; pension levy, which the Government passed into law last week, is going directly towards recapitalisation of the banks.  Yet there seems to be no give from the banks regarding what they might be able to do for their customers, the ordinary people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Fixed rate mortgages are at a much higher rate now.  Somebody who took out a mortgage a year or two ago and got a fixed rate for four or five years pays up to 6% interest.  The situation has changed dramatically in that time and people are paying huge repayments on their mortgages.  When I raised this last night the best the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives could come up with is that this is a contract, and they are therefore happy to see the customer being screwed by the banks.  It could be made part of the recapitalisation programme that the banks would give customers the opportunity to come out of these fixed rate contracts if they wish.  It is possible that some customers may wish to stay with these fixed rate contracts, but as a gesture, this should be put forward by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The silence is deafening from the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and other Ministers on this issue, although it has been raised a few times in this House.  I would like the Minister to examine it.  Will the Government give serious consideration to putting a proposal on this to the banks?  Will it look at some way of getting those who have fixed rate mortgages, which cost them from &euro;200 to &euro;350 per month depending on the size of their mortgages, out of them, especially since the Government has hit them with a fairly significant income levy in the past few weeks?  Many of the people affected by the levy have this type of mortgage.</P>
        <P>There must be a cap on executives&rsquo; pay in the banks that are being recapitalised.  The impression is given is that the Government is saying no bank will fail.  This is being picked up by senior bank executives as meaning they may do as they like because the Government will not challenge them.  The Minister of State can speak about preferential shares and ordinary shares, and 25% of this and 25% of that, and state the Minister is charging the banks 8% for this money.  If there is an 8% cost to the banks, what is the cost to the Government for borrowing that money at this time?</P>
        <P>There is also a need for the Government to show its back teeth in its dealings with the banks, to show that not only is it representing taxpayers&rsquo; interests but that it is also prepared to stand up for customers of the banks and to show that the banks, just like all of us, must pay for this over the next couple of years.</P>
        <P>This is an awful crisis.  We have seen the way a blue-chip stock, which is what banks were always considered to be, simply disappeared off the face of the earth.  It is a crisis beyond proportion.  The public is angry because it cannot really fathom the size of this crisis and how it was delivered to them by a few individuals motivated more by greed than anything else.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State responds I want to hear that the Government is serious about taking on these issues.  I ask him not to give me the response that these individuals, if they are not paid &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million per year, will go somewhere else.  There are few places to go for senior bank executives, given the track record of some of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>For Senator Doherty&rsquo;s benefit, we are discussing amendments Nos. 1, 3<i>a</i> and 3<i>b</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled amendments Nos. 3<i>a</i> and 3<i>b</i>.</P><Col N="452" />
        <P>There is much we could say about this Bill.  It has been described as a technical Bill in one sense but it provides for what is potentially one of the most momentous decisions that will ever be taken by the Oireachtas in our time.  The Government is about to commit the people&rsquo;s money, in the form of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, have repeatedly called on the Minister to use the National Pensions Reserve Fund in productive investment projects to ensure that we get the country back to work and that the social services for which the people are crying out are delivered.</P>
        <P>Only today I highlighted the fact that the Minister for Education and Science, even after a year of posing the original question, still does not have a clue how many schools are using prefabs in this State.  He does not have a clue how many schools have got planning permission and can move to the next stage.  He does not know.  The Taoiseach and the Government are willing to work through the night into the early hours of the morning to bail out the banks and to secure high pay and bonuses for bank executives and senior managers who have been reckless, but when it comes to our children they are not willing to bail them out of classrooms that are falling down and prefabricated buildings that are in a terrible state, some of which date back 40 or 50 years.  That is where some of the problem lies in terms of the Government&rsquo;s priorities in this Bill.</P>
        <P>One of the problems is that the amendments being put forward, and those that were put forward by my colleague, Deputy Morgan, in the D&aacute;il, are not being accepted by the Government.  They are falling on deaf ears.  They are responsible amendments, amendments that the majority of people would like to see implemented.  They deal with proper reporting, proper procedures and ensuring that those who continue to rip off the country will not be favoured by the Government at a time when it is attacking the most vulnerable, the most weak and the poorest in society.  I urge the Minister of State to accept and listen carefully to the proposals that we have tabled.</P>
        <P>We all know that there was a drug in banking society, but also in the elite in Irish society, which was based on profit, bonuses and a merry-go-round that they thought would never end, and they are holding the rest of us, the workers of the country, to ransom.  All this was based on irresponsible borrowing by the banks and it locked the Irish financial system into a cycle which, as my party previously highlighted in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il, could only end in disaster.</P>
        <P>It was not the case that nobody shouted stop.  Sinn F&eacute;in shouted stop but the problem was that the Government was not prepared to listen.  The people are now paying the price for that rampant irresponsibility by bankers, developers and the Government, which failed to listen and to take action, and which will commit to put every man, woman and child in the State into debt, increase their taxes and increase the pain so that those who got us into this difficulty continue to be bailed out.</P>
        <P>Both of the amendments I tabled deal with executives, senior managers and employees of financial institutions that are availing of these funds.  Amendment No. 3<i>a</i> proposes that executives, employees and senior managers of these banks should not be paid more than a Minister.</P>
        <P>If I go back to Donegal and tell the people that I proposed an amendment that bank officials would receive over &euro;250,000, they would probably lynch me because we should be going much further.  My party would go much further but, as I stated initially, this is in light of the fact that the Government is not willing to take decisive action and is not willing to rein in those who were responsible and reckless in the financial institutions.  It is a compromise amendment, but <Col N="453" />it is linked to ministerial salaries, which, with the salaries of Deputies and Senators, should also be cut substantially.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister of State accept this amendment.  I predict that he will speak of further reports, further discussions and further strategic or scientific analysis, but the reality is nobody needs a report to tell us that a senior bank official should not earn &euro;3 million per year.  Nobody needs a report to tell us that bonuses in the region of millions of euro per year should not be paid to these people who trapped the Irish people into borrowing vast amounts, who are now repossessing their homes and treating them shabbily and who have completely restricted financial lending to small and medium enterprises.  There is a need for this amendment.</P>
        <P>My second amendment deals with the bonuses that have accrued by executives within these financial institutions over the past three years.  In this amendment my party proposes that all bonuses collected as part these people&rsquo;s remuneration in the financial institutions over the past three years be paid back to the State.  As I stated, some of these executives received millions of euro in bonuses per year over those three years.</P>
        <P>A question needs to be asked and I know the answer to it.  Did those people earn that money?  Did they deserve that money?  We cannot reward people who exploited the Irish economy and who put us into this disaster.  We speak about it &mdash; we heard it from the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis &mdash; being as bad as Cromwell.  Would the Minister of State pay Cromwell a couple of million euro per year?  Would he pay him huge bonuses?  If the Minister of State does not accept this amendment he is allowing the people who put us in this position to continue earning vast amounts of money.</P>
        <P>One must remember the important aspect of this.  After this Bill passes, which no doubt it will, it is the Irish people, the taxpayers, the mothers and fathers who sent their children to special needs classes, which were taken away by the Government two weeks ago so that they are now in mainstream classes, who are paying these executives their bonuses and wages.  It is the woman who is lying on a trolley in an accident and emergency department who is paying these executives their bonuses and their millions of euro in wages.  The people demand that the Government take action and I put forward these amendments to ensure action is taken.  The people will reward the Government if action is taken, however belatedly.  It is never the wrong time to do the right thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>While I generally agree with Senator Doherty&rsquo;s desire for fairness, I am not in favour of this sort of tinkering with small aspects of the general crisis.  The entire matter of remuneration, not just of the banks but across the whole public sector, will come under savage scrutiny in coming times.</P>
        <P>Since before Christmas I have been saying unemployment will hit half a million and I have since revised that figure upwards to 700,000, with 20% unemployment, and I do not believe this is down to the Irish economy.  I am totally opposed to the hysterical campaign that has been whipped up against the banking system as a whole.  There are delinquents within the banking system and people who should be brought to book and, indeed, put in jail.  The Bank of Ireland, however, has existed since before the Famine and been there through the land wars and two world wars.  AIB Bank goes back to the Munster and Leinster Bank and no one would wish to see these two great Irish institutions which have a physical presence in every town and village go to the wall.  The Government was right to support these banks systemically.  Perhaps it got a bad deal.  It is a pity one had to bail out the banks but it had to be done because otherwise we would have no credibility in the world.</P>
        <P>I have stressed repeatedly the extent and depth of this crisis.  It is not an Irish crisis.  It has been exacerbated somewhat but not to the degree some parts of the media have been exciting <Col N="454" />themselves about.  It is not confined to us.  There are versions of what is happening in Ireland occurring in Japan, Australia and across Europe.  This is not just a depression or a recession.  It should be more closely compared to one of those historical moments such as the Black Death or the Thirty Years&rsquo; War.  It will outlast our lifetime.  It is a systemic and deep structural crisis of the capitalist system and it will not be alleviated by recourse to the equally flawed Marxist system which has been tried and tested.  It will take a long time to recover confidence.  As my colleague, John Drennan, pointed out, it takes no time to pollute a river but it takes a long time to clean it up.</P>
        <P>There is a volume of debt across the globe that is untapped and unknown, a vast, bottomless pit of debt caused by the insurance contract default system.  The AIG model, not Lehman Brothers, caused the beginning of this collapse, aided and abetted by the sub-prime mortgage system.  It cannot be dealt with, as many of my colleagues think, simply by regulation.  That can do a lot but I am not a Platonist who believes in a perfect society, human nature being what it is.  I believe in the doctrine of original sin and just because many things were legal in our society does not mean to say they were not wrong.  They were wrong and we must introduce the concept of sin back into the body politic at every level.</P>
        <P>Let us begin here.  There are increasing calls for the abolition of the Seanad.  These calls cannot be gainsaid much longer.  In a year&rsquo;s time they will seem commonplace and unless we proceed to take voluntary cuts of a severe sort in our income, the people will come and take it off us.  I have always believed in going forward to meet a problem, in hanging a lantern on it and not standing back from it.  The Members of the Seanad should seriously consider a cut in their salaries so swingeing that it alerts the public to the fact we are sincere about it.  It should be a minimum of 15% to 20%.  We should stay ahead of public sector cuts.</P>
        <P>Beyond that, Senator Doherty rightly raised the general question of equity and that should be brought up right across the board in all forms of public remuneration, not least in further reforms of the public sector.  The Minister did not cut deeply enough and I understand why.  I spoke to the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, lately, commiserating with him on the death of his father.  There was no partisan or party element in our conversation about the economy, just a deep concern for this country.  Perhaps he belongs to the trade union for Taoisigh so he empathises with the current Taoiseach but he believes, like me, that this is a deep crisis.</P>
        <P>I value the contribution of my colleague and fellow <i>Sunday Independent </i>writer, Senator Shane Ross.  It is clear, however, that he understands banks but does not understand politics.  Perhaps I know a little bit more about politics in the same way he knows a little more about banks.  I disagree with his statement yesterday when he warned Fine Gael not to get embroiled in supporting the Government.  In recent days, Fine Gael has gained great credibility.  I read with great interest Deputy Richard Bruton&rsquo;s broad outline of the plans that he is bringing to the Minister for Finance and which I hope he brings to the Taoiseach.  They are credible, deep and cutting.  The Government has never got ahead of this crisis and to do so, public sector pay cuts of the order of 30% will be necessary and pensions of Ministers and former Ministers should be levied severely.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty is right.  The public must see that fairness comes first.  If we are fair, the public will put up with anything.  That means starting at the top with us, with the politicians and the political class, then going on to the public sector.  I do not agree with Senator Ross, however, when he advises Fine Gael not to get involved because we do not know what is coming down the stream.  Fine Gael knows as well as anyone else what is coming down the stream and it is not good.  It is time to remember Andr&eacute; Gide&rsquo;s great motto for getting through life: anything can happen.</P><Col N="455" />
        <P>We need a dose of European pessimism now, not American optimism.  We must look at this situation and recognise that bad stuff is coming down the stream and we must assume the worst.  We may need to go back to allotments before we are finished, growing our own food in our back gardens, but we can handle anything.</P>
        <P>I am not presenting this apocalyptic vision to make the flesh creep but I am tired of people half-trying to explain it away as just another recession that was caused by a few Irish bankers or Charlie McCreevy&rsquo;s low tax policies, all of them correct policies at the time.  The Government has nothing to apologise for and the business of these pathetic, mawkish apologies should stop.  We were all in the Celtic tiger together and the infrastructure lies all around us.  It is good stuff, well built.</P>
        <P>Low tax policy is the right policy and in that respect I want to point to the ideological struggle going on in Ireland.  There are elements and media commentators grouped around RTE who carry on as if increases in taxation will solve the deficit of &euro;18 billion, which I believe is closer to &euro;25 billion.  Whatever it is, tax will not do it.  One would think listening to RTE, to George Lee, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole and other commentators, that this can all be done through tax increases.  It cannot; some of it must be done by tax, but the bulk of it must be done by cuts in public expenditure.  The national development plan should be stopped, the metro should be stopped and all State companies that can be privatised should be privatised with the exception of the courts, the Defence Forces and the security forces.</P>
        <P>We need radical measures for these terrible and radical times.  While Fine Gael has gained enormous credibility with the public in its responsible attitude, and I am glad the Minister and the Taoiseach have invited the Opposition parties in, I still believe that despite its position in the polls, the Labour Party will continue to decline in credibility if it continues to refuse to tell us where it proposes to make the cuts.  Fine Gael has credibly told us where it will make cuts.  The Labour Party just grandstands and swans around the place, being all things to all men, like the Quakers: friend to all, enemy to none.  That sort of stuff will not last forever.</P>
        <P>I have great sympathy with the need for fairness that drives Senator Pearse Doherty.  We should not tinker with that fairness.  We must look at the tax situation again, not least at the way farmers have fallen below the radar.  They pay ridiculously small amounts of tax compared with the public sector.  I have been a hammer on the public sector but I will be no less hard on the farming sector.  There are 105,000 of them paying some ridiculously small sum in the millions compared with the 370,000 civil servants who pay &euro;3.4 billion in tax.  This must stop, there must be no protected or cushioned classes.  To borrow one of the Minister&rsquo;s best sardonic lines from yesterday, all must aspire to the dignity of being Irish taxpayers.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions on these three amendments.  Focusing on amendment No. 1, there must be pay restraint.  In reality, however, reductions in net income are vital in the overall current economic situation.  The Government recognises the importance of that at the most senior levels of the banking sector.  It is important not only in the context of financial support being provided by the taxpayer to that sector but also because it sends a message to workers on ordinary incomes who are suffering as a result of the global crisis. </P>
        <P>The covered institutions remuneration oversight committee, or CIROC, was established to oversee remuneration plans of senior executives of the covered institutions.  CIROC was also asked to examine whether an overall cap on executive remuneration could be introduced for the banking sector.  I can inform the House that the Minister for Finance received CIROC&rsquo;s report on Tuesday and is considering it.  The report proposes caps on the remuneration of <Col N="456" />various senior executive positions within each of the institutions.  That will go to Cabinet in the first instance and I imagine there will be a public statement shortly afterwards.  In the meantime, I take the points that Senators have made.</P>
        <P>One needs to be aware that in banking cultures, and far below the top level that has attracted so much attention, remuneration in recent years has been made up of basic pay, bonuses and share options.  There has been an unhealthy culture whereby the value of people working in that sort of world is measured by the size of their salaries and bonuses.  We have to shake ourselves out of it because nobody&rsquo;s value is measured by whether they have a higher salary than someone else.  All of that is false thinking.  Some of the best people are those on low incomes and salaries, yet their contribution can be quite disproportionate.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey raised the question of the Government&rsquo;s view of fixed rate mortgages.  Perhaps a question should be tabled on that matter in the other House.  The pros and cons of fixed rate mortgages were well debated at the time they were introduced.  People make choices which have risks attached, whether they concern variable or fixed rate mortgages.  I do not know whether anything can be done about that matter in discussions.  However, in a situation where banks are vulnerable we must resist the temptation to interfere in every possible way.  The banks have to recover credibility, but they will not do so if they are subject to systematic Government, Oireachtas or public diktat on any and every activity they undertake.  However, I am not denying the reality of the particular problem to which the Senator referred.  No doubt it can be looked at.</P>
        <P>Up to now, the repossession of homes has been on a very small scale.  I saw a figure last week in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 75,000 repossessions in the United Kingdom.  Allowing for the disproportion in population between the two countries, we are at nothing like that level here at the moment.  The recapitalisation package contained specific measures to hold off on repossessions.</P>
        <P>I am not a spokesperson on education, but it was stated that the Minister for Education and Science did not know the number of prefabs.  I saw an article in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>two or three days ago which provided great detail from the Department of Education and Science on the number of prefabs and their cost.  Therefore I do not accept that point.</P>
        <P>Sweeping rhetoric is made about how the Government is bearing down on the weakest, poorest and most vulnerable in society.  Frankly, that is absolute nonsense because every effort has been made to protect them.  I was glad to see that only last week Age Action Ireland&rsquo;s bulletin pointed out that such people were not affected by the current set of measures since the beginning of this year.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris was speaking in the voice of the author of &ldquo;The necessity for social democracy&rdquo; back in 1989.  I agree with his general points about remuneration.  I do not wish to make any particular virtue of it because we are still pretty well paid, but Ministers and Ministers of State took a voluntary 10% cut and followed it up by being subject to the pension levy, which together probably adds up to about 16% or 17%.</P>
        <P>I was amused by the reference to going back to allotments and I do not think there would be any harm in that.  In fact, within the last week, as Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works, I had discussions with my officials and those of the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, on precisely this point and the possible use of property within State control.  As someone who still does a bit of fruit and vegetable gardening, to the extent that time allows, I greatly regret the way that has gone totally out of use.  Some 20 or 30 years ago, if one was travelling along the canal in Dublin one would see a line of allotments, but nearly all of them are now overgrown.  In the countryside, every cottage garden was used to grow potatoes, cab<Col N="457" />bage and possibly turnips.  It would be healthy, quite literally, if the 75% of people who, according to the ESRI, do not engage in direct sporting activity, did a bit of gardening.  Senator Harris will remember the final line of Voltaire&rsquo;s <i>Candide</i>, &ldquo;<i>Il faut cultiver notre jardin</i>&rdquo;.  I would not see that as being the equivalent of going back to the cave, or anything like it.</P>
        <P>We are clearly in a prolonged crisis but it is hard, if not impossible, to say how prolonged it will be.  I am sure it was also very hard to say so if one lived in the early 1930s.  We do not have a crystal ball to see into the middle distance.  I hope I have dealt with the main points raised by Senators.  I will not be accepting these amendments.  However, a commissioned report on the matter is being studied which will provide the basis for action in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the issue of fixed rate mortgage repayments can be addressed.</P>
        <P>The point that the banks will not repossess any house for 12 months is a red herring.  A bank would easily wait 12 months or more before it would apply for a repossession order, attempting other ways to resolve the arrears.  When people took out fixed rate mortgages, they were not anticipating this financial crisis no more than the Minister of State or I were.  Banking continues in other aspects.  I run a business myself in which I pay banking fees, overdrafts and mortgages.  While not seeking concessions in this area, I am asking about that particular group of people who are being hit by mortgage repayments due to what is happening in the wider economy.</P>
        <P>There is a need for leadership in resolving this.  Small actions often matter much.  The Government has too much of a hands-off approach to the banks.  Telling the banks the State will not take control of them is an opt-out clause to allow them to do their own thing.  We are challenging those actions and decisions in the banking sector that may be legally correct but are morally wrong.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Harris is correct that we need to examine this from the top down.  However, it is not a question of someone making a voluntary contribution here or not taking a remuneration there.  For example, there is a need for Members in both Houses, and Ministers, to take a significant pay cut.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, sent out the wrong signal recently, flying around Ireland in an Air Corps helicopter to attend one meeting in Killarney.  Former Ministers receiving pensions while still Members also sends out a wrong signal.  These are small issues but they matter much to ordinary people.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, Deputy Richard Bruton, has put forward his ideas on resolving the wider economic issues.  There was a certain amount of sneering and smart-aleckness in the way the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance asked the Opposition to assist them in tackling the economic crisis but then did not take up offers of co-operation.  If that is the way they want to play, we can easily withdraw our co-operation.  We are still trying to keep the country&rsquo;s interests at the top of the agenda.</P>
        <P>There are small and large matters that can be addressed with regard to banking and the perception of how Ministers carry on.  The Minister of State should be taking these amendments on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not happy with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P><Col N="458" />
        <P>In trying to play down home repossessions, claiming the figures for them are not as great as they are in other countries, the reality is that home repossessions have increased 100% over the past year.  Repossessions before and after Christmas have increased at an even higher rate.</P>
        <P>Home repossession is just not a statistic.  It is the repossession of the homes of people who bought houses at large prices who cannot genuinely meet their repayments due to the new financial circumstances.  They are being chucked out of their homes by these banks who have been bailed out by taxpayers&rsquo; &mdash; their &mdash; money.  One home repossession is one too many when those affected are paying the salaries of the bank chief executive officers, the bank officials and those pen-pushers signing the orders to chuck people out of their homes.  We cannot play it down because it is too serious an issue.</P>
        <P>From our history, we all know from landlordism and evictions the importance to the Irish people of owning their homes.  Compared to other countries in Europe, Ireland has the highest house possession.  It is unfortunate the Government did not take decisive action to curtail home repossessions during the bank bail out.</P>
        <P>We do not need to wait for a report on bankers&rsquo; remuneration.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Bankers have made millions of euro every year through reckless behaviour.  A decision can be taken on their remuneration now.  However, a report is in the Minister&rsquo;s drawer and the Cabinet will decide on it after the legislation is passed.  A statement will be made but there will have been no debate in these Houses in which we can hold the Minister to account and ask him did he cut their wages from &euro;7 million plus bonuses to a ministerial salary level.  The decision on bankers&rsquo; pay must be taken now.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Harris to a certain degree that it is not just bank officials.  Ministers, Deputies and Senators need to take serious cuts in salary.  The matter over pensions and Members, as pointed out by Senator Twomey, is ridiculous.  In my school in Donegal, a Deputy held down his teaching job and took the difference in salaries while denying somebody a full-time position.  This was a Fine Gael Member but it happens with Fianna F&aacute;il Members with former Ministers still drawing down pensions.  These anomalies need to be stopped immediately.</P>
        <P>The figures involved may seem minute and addressing them will not plug the hole in the projected &euro;30 billion deficit by the end of the year.  However, it will stem the anger felt by people outside this House.  I am feeling this anger too because I can see the wrong direction in which this country is being lead.  Why would people not be angry if the Government allows 5,300 people to live part-time in this country, earning money for themselves but not paying a penny in tax?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said he does not believe me that the Minister for Education and Science does not have a clue about the number of prefabricated schools in the State.  I am glad the Minister of State referred to the article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  It was based on statistics gained last week by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  The Minister only did a sample survey of 900 schools in the State when there are over 4,000 schools.  Up to 93% of the schools had prefabricated units.  In total, there were 2,605 prefabricated units.  The Minister does not know the figure even though he has been investing &euro;130 million in the past three years in this area.  He does not have a clue where the buildings are located.  We need Ministers to work through the night to bail out our children from the prefab classrooms.  Let us show the same attitude that supported the bankers to these children who do not have a voice.</P><Col N="459" />
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about supporting the most vulnerable in society.  Today, the people&rsquo;s money, to the tune of &euro;7 billion, will be invested in the banks.  Two weeks ago, savings of &euro;7 million were made by the Government withdrawing special needs classes from special needs pupils.  In the context of &euro;7 million in savings in this area as against the &euro;7 billion being given to the banks, we must ask who is vulnerable.  Are the special needs of bankers more important than those of children?  The Minister of State should not say the Government is protecting the most vulnerable and the weak.  I am angry with regard to this matter.  The Minister of State is aware that the children in question require special needs tuition but due to the fact the numbers of such children have fallen below a certain point, they will now be placed in mainstream classes.  If the Government had closed 113 special needs classes two years ago and dispatched these children into mainstream classes, there would have been uproar and the Houses would have been obliged to debate the matter day and night.  However, because the country is in such a mess, issues of this nature are not receiving a proper airing.</P>
        <P>The Government must grab the bull by the horns and decisive action must be taken.  People are sick and tired of waiting for reports and hearing about matters being placed on the long finger.  Provision should be made in the legislation to cap the salaries of bank CEOs at the level which applies to Ministers.  In addition, the bonuses these people received for the past three years should be taken back.  They did not earn that money and what we should do is demand that they pay even more money back.  These individuals behaved recklessly and they should not be in a position to retain the millions of euro they received in bonuses.  In that context, it should not be forgotten that taxpayers are going to pay these people&rsquo;s wages for the next couple of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The responses given by Ministers in respect of amendments to Bills of this nature contain a common thread.  I find such responses disappointing.  The common thread to which I refer relates to the &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; attitude to the banks.  I have spoken about this matter so often that I sometimes exhaust myself with the monotony of what I say.  However, I cannot understand why the Government has not decided to dictate to the banks what they should do in the short term, at the very least.</P>
        <P>The amendments under discussion are not particularly demanding.  They state that anyone working for a bank who will be paid out of the National Pensions Reserve Fund should not receive more than &euro;250,000.  Why can the Minister of State not indicate that this is a fine proposal and that those involved will not be paid more than that amount?  For some reason, the Government is frightened with regard to making a decision on this matter.  It does not want to be seen, as the Minister of State indicated, to be interfering in the macro or micro activities of the banks.  The Government should interfere because the activities of those who operate at the top levels in our banks are rotten.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that CIROC is due to report next week and that the Government will cherry-pick from that report.  As far as I am aware, there is no commitment that the Minister for Finance will do what CIROC asks of him.  It is obvious what needs to be done.  In the first instance, those at the top in our banks must be removed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>These individuals are putting up two fingers to the Government on a daily basis and they are winning.  When the chief executive of AIB put two fingers up to the Irish people last week, I really began to despair.  The individual in question stated he would remain in his job for the foreseeable future.  When asked what he would be paid, in words reminiscent of those used by the former chief executive of Bank of Ireland, he stated his annual remuneration would be &euro;690,000.  I am not engaging in rhetoric; I am providing plain, factual, <Col N="460" />forensic evidence when I state that &euro;690,000 is an exorbitant amount to pay someone who has presided over the absolute pulverisation of the value of shares in AIB.  On this man&rsquo;s watch, share values have decreased by 98% or 99%.</P>
        <P>The board of AIB was completely irresponsible in announcing last year that, for reasons those in the market or anyone else could not possibly understand, it was going to increase the dividend paid to shareholders.  Now the chief executive has stated he will only take home &euro;690,000 this year.  In my opinion, that is &euro;689,000 too much.  That is just this man&rsquo;s salary.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State outline the Government&rsquo;s attitude to share options?  Let it provide an indication in that regard before CIROC issues its report.  If I were a very cynical banker &mdash; God knows there are plenty of them around &mdash; I would state that I was taking a salary cut and that I would only be paid &euro;700,000, and I would give myself a pat on the back.  When matters have settled down somewhat, the boards of the banks &mdash; which dished out an orgy of share options in the past &mdash; would suddenly get the bright idea that I and others like me should be given a few share options.  That avenue remains open to the banks and they would provide share options at rock bottom prices.</P>
        <P>The share price will not go much lower than it stands at present, even if the banks to which the Bill relates go bankrupt and are nationalised.  If that happens, the cynical bankers to whom I refer will get back on the gravy train by means of the back door.  These guys make their money not through their basic salaries but through underhand perks such as those I have outlined.  If the incumbent at Bank of Ireland receives unlimited options in the future, he may perhaps make millions of euro within in a few years.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable to state that we should wait for the CIROC report.  I do not recall who serves on that committee but I believe those involved may be highly paid civil servants.  Why are the customers and small shareholders of the banks who would have views in respect of this matter not members of CIROC?  My guess is that those serving on the committee have some knowledge of the banking industry, have themselves benefited and are very highly paid people.  I am sure these individuals have not suffered at the hands of the banks.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough to say that we are going to leave responsibility for this matter to someone else.  This time next week, CIROC will report and will recommend reductions and caps here, there and everywhere.  The Minister for Finance will accept the parts he likes and will reject those with which he is not enamoured.  What eventually emerges will be riddled with loopholes and will contain recommendations on performance criteria that will enable top bankers to earn fortunes once again.</P>
        <P>What has happened to the Government&rsquo;s nominees on these boards?  Are they asleep or are they conflicted?  The board of Irish Life &amp; Permanent sat late one night recently and emerged with a result of which the Minister for Finance did not approve.  As a result of the outcry that followed, the Minister directed those on the board to meet on the following day.  On the second occasion, these people arrived at a different result.  Had events not unfolded in this way, the board of that institution would have got away with something.  I presume it would have done so against the wishes of the two Government-appointed directors on the board.</P>
        <P>The Government-appointed directors to whom I refer have already proven themselves to be political eunuchs.  I do not know whether they have gone native, have been ostracised or have no influence.  In a case such as that involving Irish Life &amp; Permanent, if they could not get their way and if the old board was up to its old tricks, we must ask what sort of role the Government is playing in respect of the banks.  We have the right to exert major control over the activities of the two main banks once this &euro;7 billion has been invested.</P><Col N="461" />
        <P>The Minister of State indicated the funds provided by the NTMA do not constitute taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Of course it is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  This money may not be taxed currently but it came from the Government pot, which is owned by the taxpayer.  I beg the Minister of State to outline the Government&rsquo;s attitude to those who are earning &euro;700,000 and not merely to state we will reconsider the matter when CIROC reports next week.  Why does the Government not have more control over the banks which caused so much trouble for the economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendments.  With regard to Senator Twomey&rsquo;s remarks, it is, of course, the function and duty of the Opposition to put the other point of view.  However, I always pay particular attention when the Opposition, when saying what the Government should be doing, states that if it were in government it would do it.  Very often, however, one does not hear that.</P>
        <P>Some of my remarks on fixed mortgages might also relate to the pay issue.  Incidentally, the Government is not waiting for the report; it has the report and will take decisions on it.  There is no significant delaying mechanism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no need for the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>That might be the Senator&rsquo;s point of view but the Government commissioned the report, has received it and will deal with it with due process.  That will take place very shortly.  I do not propose to express personal views on the matters covered by that report.  I am sure the Minister will make a statement in that regard next week or, at the latest, in the following week.</P>
        <P>With regard to fixed mortgages, a contractual arrangement was entered into by the parties.  A contract provides legal, commercial certainty.  We need banks to get back to operating on commercial investment if the investment being put in by the taxpayer is to be protected.  There is also the question of protecting our international reputation.  If one systematically interferes with commercial decisions, it sends a bad signal to international markets.  Without in the least denying the difficult social and financial problems referred to by Senator Twomey, we must be a little clear-headed about what we are doing.  For that reason I do not accept the notion put forth by Senator Ross that we should ride roughshod in all directions over the banks that still have independence.  At the same time there are clear issues relating to lending to small businesses, providing mortgages and remuneration, on which action must and will be taken.  In the case of remuneration, I am not in a position, and do not intend, to pre-empt the precise position the Government will take.  It is fine in a Seanad debate to adopt an &ldquo;off with his or her head&rdquo; position, but Governments must act responsibly when dealing with sectors.  They must also act ruthlessly from time to time.  Government is not just about striking attitudes.</P>
        <P>The issues of repossessions and mortgage arrears were raised.  The Senator will be aware that a statutory code of practice on mortgage arrears has been published by the Financial Regulator.  Under this code, where a borrower is in difficulty the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will only commence legal action for repossession after 12 months from the time arrears first arise, where the customer continues to co-operate reasonably and honestly with the bank.  To be frank, that is in the bank&rsquo;s self-interest, apart from any altruistic or societal point of view.  With the fall in the price of property I cannot imagine that repossession would be anything other than a last option, from a purely commercial self-interest point of view.</P>
        <P>The banks have assured the Government that in the normal course of events they will make every effort to avoid repossessions, as has been evident from the low level of repossessions by them to date.  A percentage increase on a very low base can seem very large but the level of repossessions to date has been small.  To use a historical analogy, if there was that level of <Col N="462" />evictions taking place we would be reading all about it in the newspapers and hearing about it on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  There is also support for mortgage lending.  The recapitalisation package includes a commitment to increase lending capacity for first-time buyers by 30%.  Of course, the fall in house prices presents opportunities for people trying to get on the property ladder.  On balance, for some people property might be more accessible now than previously.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty mentioned that Sinn F&eacute;in had put down a question about prefabs in schools.  Presumably, the question was put down for reply by the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister supplied the information.  The idea that the Minister does not know the information he is including in his reply does not appear to be very sensible.</P>

	<P>With regard to special needs classes, the provision for resource teachers, special needs assistants and other assistance, which was virtually non-existent in 1997, has been vastly improved, partly due to various Ministers, including Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s sister.

	<P>A tremendous amount of provision has been put in place in the past ten or 12 years for special needs and resource teachers.  The change does not even affect every part of the country.  In my constituency of Tipperary South, no school was affected by that decision.  Something that does not even affect every constituency in the country legitimately deserves the description I attached to it.</P>
        <P>The final point is one on which I failed to respond to Senator Harris.  He wants to see farmers pay much more tax.  Farmers are among the poorest people in this country today.  The lowest paid salary of any full-time civil or public servant in this country is &euro;20,000.  Many small farmers are earning far below that figure.  I accept there is a commercial sector and some of those farmers might be doing well, and obviously, they should pay tax like everybody else, but I do <Col N="463" />not underestimate the extreme income marginality of very many farmers.  It is much too easy to say that this sector is essentially wealthy, but it only applies to a small part of the sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow up Senator Twomey&rsquo;s point about the Government not having a hands-on approach to the banks.  Is it the case that the Government&rsquo;s position is compromised?  On the one hand, it is investing &euro;7 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money in AIB and Bank of Ireland while, on the other hand, it has its own bank, Anglo Irish Bank.  As Senator Twomey said, it is not taking a hands-on approach where it is investing the &euro;7 billion.  Is it because it is compromised as it has its own bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I absolutely reject the proposition that the Government is compromised in that or any other sense.  The provisions that have been adopted are those judged to be in the best long-term interest of the people of this country. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">2.&mdash;Any funding to any financial institution to which funds are paid out of the National Pensions Reserve Fund under this Act in excess of a cumulative total of &euro;7 Billion shall not be made save pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">To answer Senator Burke&rsquo;s question, the Government has taken a hands off approach, not only to the bank it owns but also to those it proposes to recapitalise.  Perhaps this is the reason the Minister of State believes a conflict of interest does not arise.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to accept my amendment.  The Government proposes to recapitalise the banks using &euro;7 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  It is amazing how things can change.  In September 2007, when the House sat through the night to discuss the legislation to guarantee all bank deposits, I tabled an amendment in the early hours proposing that the Government should not invest more than &euro;10 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money in recapitalising or nationalising the Irish banks.  The Minister for Finance stated he would be discommoded if the taxpayer had to pay more than &euro;10 billion to save the banking sector.  This figure has been exceeded  and it is approaching &euro;20 billion.</P>
        <P>The Government must seek the approval of the Houses if it plans to spend more than &euro;7 billion recapitalising the banks.  Any such proposal must be discussed in both Houses.  The Minister should not be in a position to issue resolutions to provide more taxpayers&rsquo; money to the banks when the full extent of their debts are finally exposed.  While I am not an expert on the precise exposure of the banks to bad debt, basic common sense would suggest it is probably well in excess of &euro;20 billion and probably closer to &euro;50 billion.</P>
        <P>Given that they are technically insolvent, I hope the banks will be able to survive the crisis and, with the assistance of taxpayers, trade themselves into a position of greater strength.  They are being allowed to trade into a position of solvency at the expense of the taxpayer.  For this reason, the Minister of State should accept some of the amendments and show respect to both Houses and the Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments make a straightforward proposal and, like Senator Twomey, I can find no reason the Government should not accept them.  They do not propose to prevent the Government from investing in excess of &euro;7 billion in the banks but simply to <Col N="464" />require it to seek the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before proceeding with any such measures.  They seek to avoid giving the Government an open purpose which it could continually dip into to fund the banks and financial institutions.  The proposal is a sensible one which would require the Government to argue a case for any further proposed funding for the banks.</P>
        <P>The sum involved in recapitalisation, &euro;7 billion, is substantial.  The amendment provides that the Government must seek the approval of both Houses if it proposes to provide funding in excess of this figure.  On a previous occasion, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, maintained that such a scenario would not arise as it would send a signal to international markets that the banks were in trouble again.  I do not subscribe to that argument.  The &euro;7 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund is not under the Minister&rsquo;s mattress but invested across the world.  Clearly, therefore, it will be necessary to call in some of these investments to invest in the banks.  The Minister&rsquo;s argument does not stand up.  I ask the Minister of State to accept my amendment No. 3(<i>c</i>).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am at a loss about a couple of issues and I ask the Minister of State for an explanation.  When &euro;7 billion has been taken from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and split evenly between Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, how much will be left in the fund?  On the basis that these figures cannot be calculated daily, I ask the Minister of State for a reasonably up-to-date figure, perhaps from the previous quarter or the most recent valuation.</P>
        <P>It is important to put this issue in perspective.  Provision has been made to allocate 1% of GNP to the National Pensions Reserve Fund every year.  Will the fund continue to be topped up with 1% of GNP this year, next year and in 2011 or does the Government intend to cease this practice?  From where does this money come?  I presume it is borrowed because I cannot think of any other source.  If it is borrowed, I presume our need to borrow would reduce if we stopped paying into the fund.  It would be absurd to borrow or take from any other source &euro;1 billion to give to the National Treasury Management Agency to manage, probably at a lower return than the interest charged on the loan or, worse still, to hand over to the banks.  I seek clarity on this issue.  Am I correct that this is the process being proposed for the next few years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Twomey&rsquo;s amendment.  The funding allocated to the banks should be capped at &euro;7 billion and if the banks require further funding, the Government should seek the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross raised an important question.  Is there any point in borrowing &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.5 billion annually to be allocated to the managed fund?  If, as Senator Ross stated, this practice were to cease, our borrowing requirement would immediately reduce.</P>
        <P>Last September, when the House debated legislation on the financial institutions, I expressed to the Minister for Finance my view that he was taking the wrong option and should instead have taken a stake in the banks.  Six months later, we have adopted a course of action which places future pensions at risk.  How will the banks repay the funds they receive from the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  Will 8% of the &euro;7 billion be paid annually or in monthly instalments?  If the banks cannot afford to repay the fund, will the &euro;7 billion go down the swanny?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>To make a general point, the Minister or Minister of State will accept an amendment if it makes sense.  They will not do so merely out of respect for this House or the Other House.</P><Col N="465" />
        <P>The amendments have been carefully considered and the Minister appreciates the thinking that lies behind them in relation to the oversight of the expenditure of public moneys.  It is important to bear in mind that the Bill provides that the Minister for Finance may give directions to the NPRF commission in circumstances where the Minister is of the opinion, having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, that the direction is needed to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy or prevent serious damage to the financial system.  In these kinds of circumstances, there may be a balance to be struck between transparency and the need to withhold, at least for a time, market sensitive information about investments which the NPRF is being directed to make in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The NPRF Commission is, in any case, required to produce an annual report within six months of the end of its financial year, and the Minister for Finance can give directions as to its content.  The commission has been producing very detailed reports of its activities and investments and that is expected to continue.  I might add that the Minister undertook in the D&aacute;il yesterday to keep that House informed in advance of any directed investment in a listed credit institution, subject to any requirements of confidentiality.  He made the point, however, that he could not absolutely guarantee it in all circumstances.  I regret I am not able to accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>I will refer to two other points that were made.  The intention is to continue making payments into the NPRF, simply because that is a responsibility we ought to be fulfilling and which we should not just scrap because of our present difficulties.  The fund at the end of 2008 amounted to &euro;16.4 billion.  Of this, &euro;4 billion has been designated for recapitalisation, which would reduce the total to &euro;12.4 billion, and &euro;3 billion of additional funding is coming from the Exchequer.  Thus, &euro;12.4 billion is available to the fund for its normal investment activities at end-2008 values.  The payment obviously comes out of the Central Fund each year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The payment into the fund from the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>An exact figure was given in my speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was &euro;1.4 billion or &euro;1.6 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is &euro;1.584 billion &mdash; in effect, &euro;1.6 billion.  There is no provision in the Bill or indeed the principal Act for a suspension of this contribution.  The Senator is correct in saying the contribution is effectively being borrowed.  Those were the main issues raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>May I pursue this further?  If &euro;1.6 billion is being borrowed, or coming out of Exchequer funds, whichever one likes &mdash; it does not really matter how one designates it &mdash; is there not the possibility of making a saving?  It is a reasonable point to make.  This fund is now being used for utterly different purposes from those for which it was set up.  That is why this legislation is before us.  It is a different creature.  I do not want to put it in a pejorative way, but it is now a fund to be used by the State in times of emergency.  It certainly is not being used for investment purposes or for pensioners of the future.  We are now taking at least &euro;4 billion &mdash; maybe &euro;7 billion &mdash; out of it, and there is every prospect of our taking a great deal more in the future if a bank, or any other organisation in trouble, needs more money.</P>
        <P>We are borrowing money in an amount of &euro;1.6 billion per annum, when we are in chronic debt, to put into a fund that, as far as I can see, does not need it.  In other words, we are <Col N="466" />borrowing money to put into a contingency fund.  Surely one way of reducing our borrowings would be to decide that this fund unfortunately does not fulfil the purpose for which it was set up and we will save &euro;1.6 billion by not putting in any more money.  In this way we would also save money on interest.  Is that not a perfectly reasonable, sensible thing to do at a time when we are in chronic difficulties and are vastly over-borrowed?  We could knock &euro;1.6 billion off our borrowings immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The fund, in the short term, is being used for recapitalisation, so we do need the money, and therefore we will have to borrow it and we cannot save the interest on it.  When the Senator says the fund has been diverted from its purpose, or words to that effect, given that this fund was never intended to be used until 2025, he is talking about a temporary use of it for emergency purposes.  However, it is an investment which should in principle bring a return.  None of the money will be lost during the process, and therefore it is present and within the remit of the original purpose.  One Senator, before Senator Ross was present, rejoiced in the fact the NPRF was investing more in domestic institutions than abroad.</P>
        <P>There is also the point that there are gross borrowing figures and net ones.  This has always been the case.  Net debt was always lower than gross debt, although the latter was mostly quoted for public purposes.  The net debt was 10% or 12% lower when the NPRF was taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is ruling out the possibility of making a massive saving by saying the Government will go ahead and borrow the money on the market to put into the fund.  Is that correct?  I want to get this right.  We are actually going to go out and borrow the money to put into the fund.  Is that right?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>What I am saying is that there is no provision in this Bill or, <i>a fortiori</i>, in the principal Act for suspending payments into the fund.  The payments into the fund will be needed in any case over the next year or two, perhaps more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>There is &euro;16.4 billion minus &euro;4 billion &mdash; that is, &euro;12.4 billion &mdash; left in the fund.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>As of 31 December 2008, yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that not be enough for the recapitalisation process?  Will we have to pay all that out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government, in this Bill, has not changed its policy with regard to annual payments into the NPRF.  In broad principle I do not think it is a good idea to suspend payments.  If we suspend them, when will we ever re-establish them?  There is a pensions problem down the line; we have seen that with regard to public sector pensions.  I do not think we should consider the virtual suspension or scrapping of the NPRF for short- to medium-term considerations.  There is much to be said for maintaining continuity and staying on course even in turbulent waters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I find that difficult to accept.  The Minister says it would be wrong to do that for short-term reasons.  However, we have taken a short-term decision by taking all this money out.  I do not think the Government yet realises we are in a state of financial emergency.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="467" />
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course we are.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the measures taken by Government was to take apart a ring-fenced fund that was never to be touched &mdash; a sacred cow.  That was set out in legislation and that is why we need legislation now.  The fund was devised by a former Minister for Finance specifically to make it difficult to raid and to this end legislation is required to change its purpose.  The Government has taken the drastic decision to introduce the requisite legislation, with the result that the fund is a completely different creature and is available for all sorts of emergencies, including recapitalisation of the banks.  It seems that it will be available for further recapitalisation as necessary.  Given that that decision was taken, it is inconsistent to say that because the fund will be needed in the future for its original purpose, which has now been undermined, we will borrow &euro;1.6 billion on the international markets, to which we are already in hock, and pay a vast rate of interest to save the banks.  I am making a point of logic rather than a political argument.  If that is our intention, we should be honest about it, but if it is not going to happen we should suspend our efforts to borrow &euro;1.6 billion, thereby saving the interest payments at a stroke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross makes perfect sense.  The rate at which this country can borrow has increased dramatically in recent months.  It does not make sense to borrow &euro;1.6 billion at a very high rate when we do not need to do so.  I cannot understand why the Minister of State is getting hot and bothered about the matter when he should be proposing it to his senior Minister and the Government.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am loathe to take issue with Senator Ross, who gave me very good financial advice several years ago.  I remain reasonably solvent because I heeded his advice to put a small legacy into a plastic bag inside a Jacobs cream cracker tin and bury it in the darkest part of the deepest woods.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>However, I take issue with the nit-picking.  I wish the Government was more courageous in its defence of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which seems to be one of the most imaginative innovations of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy.  I deplore the constant revisionism that is taking place.  I always hate hindsight in people or those who wait for polls before putting their hunches on the market.  I cannot stand whinging about apologies.  We did what we did and one lives one&rsquo;s life minute by minute.  Who in Ireland&rsquo;s history could escape scot free from the never ending tribunals of inquiry?  Mistakes were made and obsessing about them comes under the heading of what my mother used to call &ldquo;a Mhuire, a Mhuire&rdquo;, which is what the women at a wake used to howl and moan.  If one moans like that, one becomes impotent and cannot move.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund is a perfectly understandable Irish phenomenon.  It was established in the boom times to back up the pensions reserves and, dialectally, to do any other function required of it.  The reserve is just a kitty or nest egg.  I agree with Senator Ross that it does not make sense to borrow to top it up but I do not care what it is called.  It is almost a celebration of our exuberant financial health during the Celtic tiger era.  It is our rainy day money and some of it should be spent on recapitalising the banks or on small and medium enterprises.  I do not see any reason to nit-pick about what it is called or why, although I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s secondary point about avoiding borrowing.</P>
        <P>I do not want to nit-pick the Minister of State on the farm issue but, given that he responded to me on it, I should note that I am not referring to farmers who own less than 60 acres.  As even this quantity of land is worth approximately &euro;1 million on the market, they are not in the same position as civil servants who are totally dependent on their income.  They have the capital of their farms behind them.  Farmers who own more than 60 acres are not paying enough.  I <Col N="468" />recognise that the Minister of State has to protect the interest of his south Tipperary constituents but I come from an urban background and I wish to raise several difficult questions.</P>
        <P>Why are farmers not paying towards the farm pension scheme?  Why are 3,000 public servants assigned to the farming industry when they could do far more valuable work in other Departments?  Why is a region by region balance sheet not published so that we can understand how much an area receives compared to the amount taken from it?  Take, for example, a cutback of &euro;50 million imposed on a regional hospital.  We would need to know the grants being paid to the farmers in the region before determining the equity or otherwise of the cut.  Why are there special laws for farmers in regard to stamp duty?  A progressive land tax would help young farmers and take some of the old hang-abouts off the land.</P>

	<P>It has been our saving grace.  It is not the Government&rsquo;s intention to begin using the fund for various purposes.  A specific emergency has arisen and acting on it is not inconsistent with the fund&rsquo;s long-term purpose after 2025.  It is being made available solely for the purpose of recapitalisation.</P>
        <P>The annual 1% contribution is a substantial charge on the Exchequer by any standard.  The deliberate structuring of that charge in a way that does not require ongoing parliamentary approval sends a powerful message about the intention to provide for future pension costs and our willingness to structure budgets around that provision.  Changing that policy now could be seen as short-sighted and would be damaging to confidence in Ireland at a very sensitive time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Senator Ross is wrong.  A more pragmatic point is that because the annual contribution to the fund is not reckoned in the calculation of the general Exchequer balance, it does not impact on Government expenditure.  High borrowing costs are a temporary phenomenon and if we succeed, as I hope we shall, in getting the financial situation under control, any additional borrowing costs will subsequently fall.  The fund is a symbol of commitment to fiscal responsibility for credit rating agencies.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris referred to agricultural inspectors and suggested that more valuable work is done in other Departments.  I believe the agricultural sector remains important to this country in particular in terms of the development of the regions.  It is an important part of society outside city areas.  Senator Harris spoke about the progressive land tax, a proposal put forward by former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald in 1986.  It is one of the battles I, as an adviser, fought with former Leader of the Opposition, former Deputy Charles Haughey, in conjunction with the Irish Farmers Association.  Our purpose was to defeat that proposal which was introduced as a substitute for income tax.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P><Col N="470" />
        <P LI="2">2.&mdash;(1) Any advance contributions made by the Minister to the Fund shall be confined to the provision of funds to certain financial institutions agreed by a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas to constitute critical financial institutions to the provision of financial stability and the flow of credit in the economy.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) Any institution that receives funds under this Act must publish a quarterly report, to be provided to the Houses of the Oireachtas, detailing their increased lending provided to enterprises and first time home purchasers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a fairly straightforward amendment.  Unfortunately, the Government has so far taken a hands off approach to the banks and how they propose to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money.  What guarantees can the Minister of State give us that money promised to SMEs and first-time buyers will be spent as intended?  Also, will the Government put before the Oireachtas a quarterly report in that regard, as requested in this amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair to say that both parts of this amendment reflect a concern, which we all share, to improve the flow of credit in the economy.  Under the Credit Institutions Financial Support Act 2008, the Minister for Finance can provide financial support only where, after consultation with the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority, he or she is of the opinion that there is a serious threat to the stability of financial institutions, provision of support is in the public interest to maintain the stability of the financial system and support is necessary to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy.</P>
        <P>These onerous requirements on the Minister are further<i> </i>reflected in the conditions for direction by the Minister in section 8 of the Bill which require that a direction to make investments will be given only after consultation with the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and where it is necessary in the public interest to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy and-or to prevent serious damage to financial stability.</P>
        <P>A central objective of the Government&rsquo;s bank recapitalisation programme is to support the flow of credit, which is of course critical to continued economic development in Ireland.  In this context, the recapitalised banks have agreed to a package of measures which include increased lending capacity to small and medium enterprises and first-time buyers, codes of practice to facilitate the flow of credit and protect consumers and the establishment of specific funds for environmental and seed capital lending.  To ensure these lending targets are met the banks will make quarterly reports to the Financial Regulator, with the first report to end March 2009 to be submitted by end April 2009.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the Government is aware of restrictions in the flow of credit to viable business while at the same time reports suggest that falling demand for credit is the main cause of reduced credit flow.  There may be truth in both explanations.  The perception of limited credit availability is damaging at this time of fragile business and consumer confidence.  The Government has therefore decided there should be an independent review of bank lending to report within a short timeframe.  The recapitalised banks have agreed to fund this independent review which will be managed by the banks, Government and business representatives.  The banks have undertaken to co-operate fully with this review and to engage constructively in implementing any recommendations made.  Independent consultants appointed to conduct this review will report in four weeks.</P>
        <P>I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to an independent review of credit flow.  We are all agreed that credit needs to flow to small businesses in particular.  We have our own <Col N="471" />bank in the form of Anglo Irish Bank.  I have received several complaints in regard to high interest rate charges and a lack of credit availability to small businesses.  Perhaps the Minister of State will address the following issues.  First, no independent review in regard to credit flow to small businesses is required from Anglo Irish Bank, which is our own bank.  Surely, we do not need an independent review in that regard.  Second, what is the up to date position in regard to Anglo Irish Bank in terms of whether credit from it is flowing to small businesses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On that point, I appreciate what the Minister of State had to say on this matter.  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks have two large branch networks throughout the country and are the ideal vehicle through which to get credit flowing again and to provide seed capital for small businesses.  While I am delighted to hear there is in place an agreement with the banks following recapitalisation, will the Minister say how much is earmarked in that regard?  It is important we know that.  Banks will be concerned with maintaining their ratios and improving their profitability rather than focusing on the flow of credit to small businesses.  This will cut against the grain.  Banks&rsquo; concern will be for the shareholder rather than small business.  We are seeking balance.  I would like if the Minister of State could elaborate a little on this and tell us specifically what amount of money is earmarked in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have set out already what recapitalisation involves.  Senator Burke referred to Anglo Irish Bank as our bank.  Anglo Irish Bank is a semi-State bank which is run at arm&rsquo;s length on a commercial basis.  It is not an instrument of Government that operates according to different rules from other banks.  Anglo Irish Bank will bring before Government a business plan outlining its proposals on lending into the future.  Obviously, these will need to be consistent with what we are expecting other banks to do.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3<i>d</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister for Finance shall make a quarterly report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on all financial institutions availing of funds from the National Pension Reserve Fund.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is another simple amendment.  We might have to make these amendments a little simpler if the Minister of State is to accept some of them.  I propose that the Minister for Finance should be required to make quarterly reports &ldquo;on all financial institutions availing of funds from the National Pension Reserve Fund&rdquo; available to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We cannot wait for a year.  As Senators said earlier, the banks have done immense damage to the Irish economy over recent years.  They could continue to do similar damage.  There needs to be tight scrutiny of where taxpayers&rsquo; money is invested, how much of it is invested and how it is used.  We are asking the Minister for Finance, who has asked for co-operation from all sides, to respect the elected representatives of the people who sit in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This amendment deals with that, in a sense.</P>
        <P>We would like to have a share of the information so that, like the party colleagues of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, we can scrutinise it.  If a report is laid before the Oireachtas on a quarterly basis, we will know whether damage is being done.  If we find people are not behaving as the Members of the Oireachtas would like them to behave, as they use <Col N="473" />funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, at least we will be able to discuss such matters in a transparent manner.  Like those of us who have been elected to the Oireachtas, the public was outraged when it learned of the behaviour of bankers like Mr. FitzPatrick who organised secret wheelings and dealings, loans and forms of embezzlement between financial institutions.  If there had been greater transparency and more accurate reporting of what was going on, various issues would have been identified and certain problems would not have continued for as long as they did.  Some of the reporting that was done in the past omitted details of the real deals and scams that were taking place.  We are calling for the Minister to be required to furnish to both Houses of the Oireachtas quarterly reports on how the funds taken from the National Pensions Reserve Fund are used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Minister for Finance, I respect the decisions of this House and the other House.  Section 27 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 requires the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to submit an annual report to the Minister for Finance &ldquo;as soon as may be, but not later than 6 months, after the end of each financial year&rdquo;.  The Minister is then required to &ldquo;cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  Section 27(2) of the 2000 Act sets out the matters that need to be covered in each annual report of the commission.  It provides that each report must include, for the year under review, information on the &ldquo;investment strategy&rdquo; being pursued by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission in respect of the fund; &ldquo;a report on the investment return&rdquo; achieved by the fund; &ldquo;a valuation of the net assets&rdquo;, including the market capitalisation value, of the fund; an illustration of the changes that take place from year to year; a detailed list of the asset holdings of the fund; information on &ldquo;investment management and custodianship arrangements&rdquo;; and details of the &ldquo;fees, commission and other expenses&rdquo; incurred in the administration of the fund, including expenses incurred by the National Treasury Management Agency as the manager of the fund.</P>
        <P>In compiling the report, the commission must bear in mind the need for open and transparent reporting on the operation of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  This will ensure that the maximum appropriate detail will be made available to the Oireachtas and to the public in general.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that the annual report of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission &ldquo;shall include information in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct&rdquo;, thus allowing the Minister to ensure the amount of information provided in the report is satisfactory.  In fact, the commission&rsquo;s annual reports have been models of information.  They have provided extremely detailed information on the activities and investments of the fund.  They could well be taken as an example of best practice in reporting on sovereign wealth funds.  I take the view that the commission&rsquo;s annual report is the most appropriate vehicle for informing the House on all investments undertaken by the commission, as well as on all forms of funding provided by the commission to listed credit institutions on foot of directions from the Minister.  As I do not see any advantage in providing for a separate report on this aspect of the commission&rsquo;s activities, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State will not accept the amendment.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has entered into new territory.  As we have said, it is not being used for the purposes for which it was originally established.  Annual reporting may have sufficed in the past.  I do not question the best standards or practices used in such reporting.  Now that we are funding banks that have been involved in extremely dodgy dealings, there is an onus on us to provide for additional reporting so we can know how this &euro;7 billion is spent.  We are talking about a huge amount of money.  The Minister of State said earlier that a report is needed so he can tell us how much these executives should be paid.  It <Col N="474" />is strange that, in this instance, he is not willing to provide for a report to be published every quarter.  I do not believe he needs a report to tell us how much banking executives should be paid.  I am asking for a report to be produced every three months so we can know where &euro;7 billion of public money is being spent.  The Government&rsquo;s priorities are absolutely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 3<i>e</i> deals with the drawdown of funds under the terms of this legislation.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that the funds should have &ldquo;sole application to the primary banking activities of either beneficiary&rdquo; and should be &ldquo;confined to the said financial institution&rsquo;s activities wholly within the island of Ireland&rdquo;.  In other words, the moneys that are drawn down should be used as we want them to be used.  When we suggest that funds should be used for &ldquo;primary banking activities&rdquo;, we are trying to ensure they are made available as mortgages and car loans and to small businesses.  The &euro;7 billion that is being provided by the Irish people, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, should not be used to lend money to people in other countries.  We ask that it be confined to the island of Ireland.  Banks such as AIB have many branches in Poland and the USA, for example.  Will the Minister clarify whether some of this money could be used in those branches to provide big loans to the Poles or the Yanks?  Could that happen to our National Pensions Reserve Fund or are there restrictions?  If there are no restrictions, we ask that the money invested by the Irish people in these banks be used for customers here on the island of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to impose such chauvinist and protectionist thinking on the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The amendment is not acceptable.  The scope of the Bill is such that it allows the Minister for Finance to direct the NPRF commission to invest <Col N="475" />in a listed credit institution.  That means a credit institution listed on a stock exchange which has a trading presence in this country.  In view of our commitments as a member of the EU it would be unacceptable and impossible for us to attempt to limit the scope of a direction to activities in this country.  Given that the recapitalisation will involve the purchase of preference shares, it is not obvious how that investment could be limited to activities in this country.  It is primarily for the boards of the financial institutions to manage their day-to-day activities to make a return on investment and it would be inappropriate for the Minister to interfere in such board decisions or proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying the &euro;7 billion can be used by AIB or any other institutions to provide massive loans in places such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Poland, Britain, Scotland and Spain where there are branches of these banks and that there is no guarantee that this money will be spent on the island of Ireland?  The Minister says the Bill is to allow us to invest in these institutions but it also contains conditions on the institutions.  We should seek to incorporate the spirit of this amendment even if it is not accepted as I have worded it.  We are recapitalising the banks to sort out the Irish economy.  There is a fear that this could sort out other economies and that if the banks decided to they could invest this money in providing loans and engaging with the markets in different countries outside Ireland.</P>
        <P>The amendment seeks to ensure we invest our National Pensions Reserve Fund on the island of Ireland.  It is consistent with what my party has said in the past.  We should invest this fund on the island of Ireland to get people back to work.  We should build the roads, schools and social housing that are needed.  That would be an investment in the future of the country.  The Government has taken a different decision to invest in the banks.  That is its prerogative but it will not get people back to work.  At least if we were investing in Irish banks that operate solely with customers in Ireland, not merely Irish-owned banks or banks which are on the Irish Stock Market, it would be one small step in the direction I would like this Bill to go.</P>

	<P>Recapitalisation is linked to a customer lending package to support credit availability.

	<P>I will deal with amendment No. 4 in general first.  Section 6 of the Bill allows the Minister for Finance to transfer shareholdings or other assets to the fund.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>)(5A) is the counterpart to that provision, allowing the commission to accept funds and other assets.  Any shareholding or other interest transferred by the Minister under the powers provided in section 6 of this Bill will count against the normal annual Exchequer contribution to the fund of 1% of GNP.  The provision will allow the Minister to transfer shareholdings in a semi-State body into the fund.  However, the provision would also allow a different scenario for recapitalising the banks where the Minister for Finance would make the initial investment in the banks under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 and subsequently transfer the shareholding to the NPRF.  This is a contingency provision just like the provision allowing the Minister for Finance to direct the commission to underwrite a share issuance in a listed credit institution.  There are no plans to use the provision but it is generally a wise move when drafting legislation to allow the possibility of an alternative approach to an issue.</P>
        <P>The amendment seeks that approval of both Houses would be required when the Minister transfers funds or assets to the commission other than from the central fund.  To the extent that this power is used in the context of recapitalisation, the Minister would also be giving a direction to the commission to invest in a listed credit institution in the extraordinary circumstances envisaged in section 8.  The Minister for Finance has undertaken to inform the House in advance of any direct investment in a listed credit institution subject to any requirements of confidentiality.  He made the point that he could not guarantee it in all circumstances.  I am satisfied that the concerns motivating the amendment have been adequately addressed and I regret that I am unable to accept it.</P>
        <P>The &euro;30 million is a standard arrangement fee payable by a body receiving an investment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an issue of great importance in my constituency.  I must declare an interest because both my father, before me, and I, when I was on the council, worked extremely hard to develop the Foyle ferry service.  In all respects, including the context <Col N="479" />of the peace process, it has been one of the most significant cross-Border and cross-community reconciliation projects to have been undertaken in the past decade.  Within a short period of its inauguration, 1 million passengers had used the ferry.  People who had never been on the Donegal side of the Foyle were coming over to see the scenery or to buy petrol.  There is also no doubt but that Coleraine&rsquo;s significant shopping figures last Christmas proved that the car ferry was bringing people there from Donegal.</P>
        <P>While I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for being here to deal with this matter, it may come within the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  I am seeking guidance as much as dictating what will happen because a significant issue has arisen.  Seven years ago the economies of Donegal County Council and Limavady Borough Council were different than they are now.  A couple of years earlier, I managed to get the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, to give &euro;4.5 million towards the ferry project, while the International Fund for Ireland contributed &euro;1 million to get it going.  As I said, it has been extremely successful.</P>
        <P>We are now in a retendering process which, I accept, can be the wrong time to raise such issues.  However, this matter must be dealt with now.  Magilligan port is a defined slipway for the roll-on/roll-off ferry.  It is not elaborate but serves the purpose for which it was created &mdash; to cater for the car ferry.  It does not have any other uses.  The ferry is at the end of a narrow road which serves the port and also serves Magilligan prison.  It is not a major access road to any large urban area, but as the ferry service is now up for retendering it should be considered.  While some people may not agree, I firmly believe this venture would be competitive and commercially viable in its own right, but it has an economic noose around its neck because it must pay for international security on the Magilligan side.  The reality of that status means there must be male and female security staff there at all times so that people can be searched.  The gender issue adds to the complications concerning personnel numbers.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, was involved in the peace process, which I am sure included the security issue of Border road closures at that time.  I can now jump in my car in Moville and drive across any Border crossing &mdash; into Derry or Lifford, crossing the Foyle by the new bridge, the two decks of the old bridge, or the bridge between Lifford and Strabane &mdash; to Magilligan, arriving at the same location having crossed no international security or permanent checkpoint of any sort.  As a result of the peace process this car ferry, that is used extensively, was delivered.  I have discussed the matter with people on both sides of the Border because the ferry service has been embraced by all communities in the general area.</P>
        <P>Arising from an increase in the number of security checkpoints, people from all sides went on BBC news programmes to state clearly that they disagreed with this increase in security.  The problem, however, is that the cost of the security is significant and will cause a great deal of concern for anyone tendering for the ferry project.  I have called for the international status to be reviewed and removed.  I do not believe Magilligan comes under the right criteria for an international port.  It may simply require a change of designation or what is done in Greencastle with excellent closed circuit television coverage being installed.</P>
        <P>The First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the North replied to me that the UK Department of Transport&rsquo;s security guidelines require compliance on the part of Magilligan.  From a parliamentary question to the Under Secretary of State for Transport tabled by Alan Meale, MP for Mansfield, I understand that the issue is around EC regulation 725/2004.  If I can travel to the same point without involving a security check, then I will use that method.  The ferry service was a big boost to the north west but this is affecting its success.  People would be searched on their way into the port to prevent criminals, illegal immigrants or mass terrorists <Col N="480" />entering the jurisdiction.  From its inception, a cage was put up into which people entered as they left the jurisdiction.  It has not served the purpose for which it was established.</P>
        <P>From speaking to officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, there are some trying to ensure what we have we hold.  I understand the security concerns but in the north west they do not necessitate the levels of security in place.  It is an overreaction which road crossings do not have.  Magilligan cannot be seen as an international port in the same way as others.  If the Minister of State visited it, he would realise that.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the value and importance of ferry services across Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly.  I have a clear memory of crossing Lough Swilly on 14 September 2007 to mark the 400th anniversary of the flight of the earls.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport has no function in the future of the Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly ferry services.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that it has no function too but that Donegal County Council does provide funding for ferry services on Lough Swilly.  The Department has informed me that some funding for the Lough Foyle ferry service was provided by the UK authorities with the balance from Donegal County Council in the past.  The responsibility for maritime security in the port facility of Magilligan rests with the British Department for Transport.  Officials from the Department of Transport have been in contact with their counterparts in the United Kingdom to consider a proposal that the ferry service as a whole should be considered as a domestic, rather than an international service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1949, at the time of the declaration of the Republic, legislation was passed in the Oireachtas and the British Houses of Parliament which specifically stated that both states did not regard each other as foreign countries.  The use of the term &ldquo;international&rdquo; seems to be the equivalent of &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;.  It is accepted in the Good Friday Agreement that the Irish nation relates to the whole island of Ireland, although not everybody would wish to describe themselves as Irish.  The Department of Transport continues to monitor the situation closely and to seek a satisfactory resolution to the maritime security related difficulties which have arisen in connection with this service.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney referred to several security related issues.  One that can be addressed is continued dissident republican activity which is entirely without purpose or justification.  Nationalist public opinion should bring its influence to bear in helping to bring this activity to an end.  The <i>Irish News</i> has been doing so heavily since the beginning of this year.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his endorsement that this service should be regarded as a domestic one.  I am not concerned about the money aspect to this but I believe it could be a viable commercial venture.  I hope the Minister of State will inform the relevant Department of this.</P>

      <sTitle>Industrial Disputes.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, intervene in the serious dispute at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway, ongoing since September 2008.  I raise the issue because much is at stake for the health of the people of the midlands and Galway area.  The hospital is integral to the health services for the area because Athlone, with a population of more than 20,000, does not have its own hospital.  A press release from the Health Service Executive last month stated wards might close and surgical services could be cancelled at the hospital owing to the dispute.  The hospital has 200 <Col N="481" />beds with 700 health staff.  It would have serious consequences if there were any cancellations of surgical procedures.</P>
        <P>Five nurse managers, who have given stalwart service to the health service over the years, had concerns over health and safety issues for staff and patients.  There have been several peaceful lunchtime protests where auxiliary and nursing staff have shown their support for their colleagues in the dispute.  A stalemate has emerged between the hospital&rsquo;s senior management and these nurse managers.</P>
        <P>There is a possibility the Labour Relations Commission will mediate between both parties.  There appears to be reluctance on the part of the senior management at Portiuncula Hospital to engage in discussions that might allow those on both sides to air their grievances.  This matter is not beyond resolution.  I am of the view that there has been a lack of communication.  I know members of the senior management at the hospital and also the five nursing managers who are absent from work on sick leave as a result of stress.  I am aware that the latter want to care for the patients at the hospital and I cannot understand why this matter has reached a stalemate.  The Minister for Health and Children must intervene.</P>
        <P>Last year, staff at Portiuncula Hospital discharged more than 11,000 patients and dealt with 6,300 day cases.  In addition, 39,000 people attended the hospital through the outpatients department.  I do not wish to be political about this issue, that is not why I am raising it, but the Hanly report is being implemented behind closed doors and I am concerned that the HSE will use what is happening as an insidious means by which to downgrade services at Portiuncula Hospital.  It has already been stated that there will be ward closures, that surgical procedures will be curtailed and so forth.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to ensure that all the services currently on offer at the hospital will be retained and that the dispute will be resolved so that the five nurse managers, who are dedicated and have a vocation to their work and who really care about people, will be able to return to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator McFadden for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I do not doubt what the Senator said with regard to the value and importance of the services on offer at Portiuncula Hospital and people&rsquo;s concerns in respect of possible reconfigurations.  I am familiar with these matters as a result of events in the area I represent.</P>
        <P>The issue raised by the Senator relates to an internal operational matter at Portiuncula Hospital, which is managed by the HSE.  However, the Department of Health and Children has been informed by the HSE that concerns were raised by senior nurse management in respect of communication, morale and working relations.  Hospital management engaged a third party to undertake a review that would include recommendations, as appropriate.  This approach was agreed with the Irish Nurses Organisation, INO, which advised its members to participate in the process.</P>
        <P>The HSE also informed the Department that failure to comply with an instruction from the general manager to two assistant directors of nursing to participate in the review resulted in the disciplinary procedure being invoked.  On appeal to the director of the National Hospitals Office, the complaint of insubordination was upheld with a lesser sanction and the staff were asked to return to work on 10 November 2008.  On that date, the staff in question informed management that they were on sick leave.  Industrial action by the INO commenced on 17 November and was lifted on 24 November following agreement by the INO and the HSE on two matters, namely, an independent review of the HSE disciplinary procedure in this case, with recommendations for future situations, and the appointment of an agreed mediator to <Col N="482" />manage an orderly return to work for those assistant directors of nursing involved.  Mediation hearings were held on 9 December 2008 and 12 January 2009.  These were organised by the Health Service Executive employers agency but they have not proven successful to date.</P>
        <P>The return to work of the assistant directors of nursing has been hindered by the insistence of the INO that all records of disciplinary sanction be removed from the files of the assistant directors of nursing and that no disciplinary action should be taken against three other assistant directors of nursing who had also refused to attend a meeting as instructed and who also went on sick leave in November 2008.  Management&rsquo;s position is that this request is outside the terms of the November agreement.  HSE management has contacted the INO and confirmed its intention to attend conciliation with a view to securing an acceptable accommodation which will allow for the orderly return to work of the five assistant directors of nursing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for outlining the position.  However, I am already familiar with the complexities of the situation.  His reply did not really provide much comfort, particularly as I asked that the Minister for Health and Children should become involved.  The toing and froing involving the HSE and the INO has been taking place since September last and a satisfactory resolution has not been reached.  I am of the view that it will be necessary for the Minister to bring the five nursing managers and the various other parties involved together to discuss this matter.  If this happens, the authoritarian attitude that has marked the reaction to the dispute will be absent.  A peace process is required in this instance.  I accept that what I am seeking is out of the ordinary but that is what must be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ample conciliation procedures available in the health service and elsewhere.  In general, Ministers are advised not to intervene in disputes of this nature.  If they did intervene, we would rapidly reach a position where no dispute could be resolved without the personal involvement of the relevant Minister, and that would simply not be practical.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s desire to see this matter resolved through a display of goodwill, flexibility and pragmatism on the part of the various parties involved.  Those parties must be willing to accept mediation and arbitration.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for providing me with the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the accommodation needs of Bishop Ahern national school, Leamlara, County Cork.  This school is unfortunate in that applications it made during the past 12 months in respect of both permanent and temporary accommodation were rejected.  At present, 84 pupils attend the school.  However, as it is situated in an area where major housing development took place in recent years, 23 new pupils are expected to enrol next September.  Information available to the Department of Education and Science on demographic trends will show that there is a need to provide temporary and then more permanent accommodation at Bishop Ahern national school at the earliest possible opportunity.</P><Col N="483" />
        <P>In association with parents and community representatives, the board of management at the school made an offer to the Department to the effect that the local community would contribute 33% of the money required in respect of accommodation needs.  I understand that in a reply issued to the school authorities last week, the Department rejected the offer to which I refer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members of the board of management requested a meeting with representatives of the planning and building unit of the Department so that they might have an opportunity to outline the short and medium-term requirements relating to the school.  That request was rejected but I ask the Minister of State to bring it to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, with a view to revisiting it.  Dialogue between the school board of management and the Department of Education and Science is the least we should expect and demand.</P>
        <P>In the growing community of Leamlara there is a willingness through the board of management, the parents&rsquo; association and so forth to provide a significant local financial input into the solution to this problem.  That is something we should recognise, welcome and, I hope, respond to.  The current position of the board of management is that it will resubmit a request for temporary accommodation and a request for permanent accommodation.  I support those requests and hope the Minister of State will ask the Minister for Education and Science to respond favourably.</P>
        <P>A large additional number of students is due to come on stream next September.  The current structures within the school, whereby a general purpose room is being used as a classroom and therefore having an effect on physical education and other school activities, is not satisfactory and must be addressed.  I look forward to some degree of flexibility on the part of the Department in terms of providing a reasonable response to a reasonable request from a local community.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Undoubtedly, he has the quietest voice in the Seanad.  That is meant as a compliment.</P>
        <P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who unfortunately cannot be present.  Bishop Ahern national school, Leamlara, County Cork, has applied to the Department of Education and Science for large-scale capital funding for an extension project.  In common with all such applications, an assessment was carried out in the Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of existing buildings, site capacity and so forth, leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it and as it is ready to proceed.  There are four band ratings in all, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but where there is a high demand for school places, while a band 4 project provides for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Each band rating has a number of sub-categories which more specifically describe the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.</P>
        <P>Bishop Ahern national school is a fully vertical co-educational primary school with a current enrolment of 84 pupils.  The staffing level is a principal, three mainstream assistants and two <Col N="484" />learning support teachers.  Consistent with the approach already outlined and following an assessment of the school&rsquo;s application for capital funding, the proposed building project has been assigned a band 2.4 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  This reflects the fact that while there is a deficit of accommodation at the school, this does not represent a substantial or significant proportion of the school&rsquo;s overall accommodation needs.  It also reflects the fact that moderate refurbishment is needed.  The next step for the project is the appointment of a design team.  Unfortunately, owing to the scale of the demand on the capital budget of the Department of Education and Science from higher competing priorities, it is not possible to provide an indicative timeframe for the appointment of a design team at this time.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, the school applied for the provision of temporary accommodation for a mainstream teacher and a resource teacher.  Owing to the level of demand on the budget for temporary accommodation, it is not possible to approve all applications received and only those with no scope whatever to accommodate extra teaching resources can be approved.  In the case of Bishop Ahern national school, it has a 92 sq. m. general purpose room.  With a teaching staff of four teachers and an enrolment of 85 pupils, a pupil teacher ratio of 21:1 will apply.  A smaller classroom than that normally provided by the Department of Education and Science therefore would suffice.</P>
        <P>The Department holds the view that part of the general purpose room can be cordoned off for use by the extra mainstream teacher on an interim basis until the Department is in a position to make funding available for an extra classroom.  The school already has a 37 sq. m. prefab for its two resource teachers, which is almost the size of what is usually provided, and this should be sufficient.  The school appealed the Department&rsquo;s decision and put forward a matching funding proposal to address its accommodation needs as part of its appeal.  The Department examined this proposal and recognises its merits in terms of addressing the school&rsquo;s current accommodation needs.  Unfortunately, however, in the current economic climate the Department of Education and Science is not in a position to approve the funding sought, even with a contribution from the school.  This decision was communicated to the school earlier this month.</P>
        <P>While the Minister for Education and Science accepts that it is far from ideal for any children to be taught in non-customised accommodation, he hopes the school authority will realise the Department does not refuse demonstrably necessary funding applications unless it is not in a position to do otherwise.  Unfortunately, the situation with regard to the accommodation application for Bishop Ahern national school is unlikely to change this year, especially given the availability of a short-term solution to the issue within the school itself.  I assure the Senator, however, that the Minister is committed to regularising the situation at the school as soon as the funding is available to do so.</P>
