	<P>I have received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to comment on the reduction in the number of acute beds in Mullingar Regional Hospital, County Westmeath, and outline her intentions in relation to rewarding hospitals which are the most efficient in the country in the context of the annual Casemix adjustments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">To ask the Minister for Health and Children if statistics are available for people with an intellectual disability or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome who are in prison or awaiting trial, and if consideration can be given to the provision of a secure facility specifically for such individuals within the context of developments in the national forensic mental health services, as the individuals in question have specialised needs and are extremely vulnerable.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an update on the regeneration project in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Dublin 7, and outline the funding he has allocated this year to the project and the funding that will be made available next year to ensure the target date of 2013 for completion of phase 1 is met.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify that the issue of male cancers should be highlighted and to outline the efforts being made towards male screening programmes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a statement on the plans he has to assist local authorities to make sufficient funding available to maintain estate, rural and secondary roads.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
<Col N="478"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the measures he is taking to ensure Waterford courthouse is refurbished and adequate facilities are provided to meet the demands of the normal sittings of the District and Circuit Courts, as well as the reinstatement of High Court cases to be heard in Waterford city.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Cassidy, Corrigan, Donohoe and Keaveney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Cassidy, Corrigan and Donohoe and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Buttimer, as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  I also regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Coffey, as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter, which is one for the Courts Service.  Senator Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, while I respect the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s decision and do not propose to challenge it, the matter of which I gave notice was addressed specifically to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who is responsible for the provision of funding for local authorities.  I asked only that the Minister outline his plans.  The Cathaoirleach ruled that the matter raised by Senator Cassidy was suitable for discussion on the Adjournment, although it relates to the Health Service Executive rather than the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to start on a positive note.  I thank the Irish team for the magnificent performance it gave in the Stade de France last night, particularly Wexford&rsquo;s Kevin Doyle who has been a fantastic addition to the team throughout the qualifying period.  Unfortunately it did not qualify for the competition in South Africa but its effort was fantastic.</P>
        <P>On another positive note, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments last night in regard to old age pensions are correct.  We have to be careful that we do not hurt the most vulnerable in our society in the budget and I would like the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to give us a greater indication of what they are planning to do in the budget because they have <Col N="479"/>been very tight lipped until now.  There is a need for such a debate before the budget is announced on 9 December.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on Allied Irish Banks and the appointment of its new chief executive officer because this House becomes irrelevant when it is three weeks out of kilter with the major news items on the lips of the people of this country.  It is a major issue and we should have such debates in real time if we are to remain relevant.  I ask the Leader to find some time in the schedule next week for statements on the appointment of the CEO of Allied Irish Banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge and welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement last night on old age pensions, senior citizens and their awards.  It is important that the Government explains itself in such situations.  The statement relieved many people of their worries and such simple comments are important.</P>
        <P>In terms of understanding how people feel about the matter, many people have asked me about the day of action to be taken by unions next week.  I would like people to understand that workers are trying to express a great sense of unease, anger and many other things.  They have seen their salaries drop by 17% or more over the past number of months, like many workers in other sectors, and do not know where it will end.  They hear from the Government that there will be further cuts.  There is no certainty whatsoever.  They are not sure where it is they are going.  We understand better than most that such people are coming under constant despicable comment in the general media.  There is a sense that people feel completely removed from the situation and that they are dealing with all the pain on their own.  I do not agree that is true but it is how people feel.</P>
        <P>We need to examine how the Government can move the situation forward.  It can be moved forward.  The Government has made progress in two significant areas.  There is an acknowledgment that &euro;4 billion has to be raised and that the public sector has to be reduced by some 15,000.  There is also an understanding that will only create savings in two, three or four years.  There is an acknowledgment that there must be a bridge to the savings which will accrue in two or three years&rsquo; time.  We are trying to cross that gap.</P>
        <P>What is wrong with an emergency temporary tax rate for people earning over a certain amount of money per year in order that they can play their part?  It is a fair question.  It would allow the Government to go back to other workers at a lower level and say it has done that, it still does not bring in &euro;4 billion and that the Government has to look at the unmentionables of salary and allowances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There are things which can be done and everybody realises they have to be done.  People should move forward.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement last night is important and he should follow it with an acknowledgement of his understanding of how people are feeling uncertain about their futures.  Everybody works to the limit of his or her salary whether it is small or large.  If the amount is being constantly reduced, people look at the impact it will have on them.  It is true that this is happening in the private sector as well as in the public sector &mdash; in many case the private sector is affected more.  However, there are 1.8 million people working in this country, which is a fair basis for us to work our way out of this problem.  We should be doing it together.  I regret that people feel compelled to take certain actions, although I understand and support the thinking behind it.  We need everybody to move and if everybody moves together the situation can be resolved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I renew my call to the Leader for a debate on climate change.  I asked him last week to schedule a debate on climate change in the Seanad and, in particular, on the principle of a climate protection Bill.  As colleagues know, I have a Bill before the House and there is a Labour Party Bill before the D&aacute;il.  The Government promised a Bill and I understood it would be published before the Copenhagen climate change talks in December.  I note the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, announced yesterday that the Bill to sign us in a binding way to making certain yearly reductions in our carbon emissions will not be published until early 2010.  It is crucial such legislation is passed and it is something on which there is consensus, but the Government is delaying the Bill.  This House should have a debate on climate change before December, even if the Bill or the heads of a Bill are not published.  It is a significant issue.  The debate is over and everybody is agreed on the facts of climate change, although I note in <i>The Irish Times</i> today John Gibbons suggested Pat Kenny is in some way a climate change denier &mdash; that is probably stretching the point.  The time for political action is now and we need to take action.  We should have a debate in this House to try to move the issue on in a political way.</P>
        <P>I also ask for a debate on funding for third level education.  Colleagues have raised the issue of the delay in the payment of student maintenance grants and the extreme hardship it is causing for students.  I back their concerns.  The Union of Students of Ireland lobbied us last week and it was useful and helpful to hear the concerns of third level students.  It is also concerned about the high and rising cost of the student registration charge, which is now &euro;1,500 per year and which students are required to pay.  It is a sort of third level fee, in effect.  The facilities provided to students are disimproving.  There has been a huge reduction in facilities at Dublin Institute of Technology, for example.  Libraries have been closed and classes have been cancelled.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>I ask again for a debate on mental health in prisons.  We heard yesterday from Professor Harry Kennedy on his concern about the high level of psychosis among young men on remand and on the early successes of the diversion programme he is running.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the matter so that we can give our political support to the diversion programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the near future on the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, which has yet to be ratified by Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, sent me a letter on the matter on 11 November last.  I am a member of the Council of Europe Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men.  The Minister&rsquo;s letter stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">My Department, in co-operation with other relevant Government Departments, Agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are presently putting the outstanding arrangements in place to facilitate the ratification of this Convention before the end of 2009.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Ireland&rsquo;s failure to ratify the convention puts it in the same position as countries like Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.  I hope our existing human rights record will demand that we associate with countries that have a better record.  It is imperative that we ratify the convention by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The subject matter of the convention was highlighted this morning by the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, who mentioned that 175 children who are asylum seekers are in the State and separated from their families, in conditions that are far worse than they should be.  While human trafficking is not an explicit issue in this context, the possibility of a higher threat or risk of trafficking of these young individuals cannot be discounted.  Ms Logan also said that, shockingly, 419 separated children have gone missing in the last decade.  As Senators might <Col N="481"/>recall, it was reported in June that 22 children are missing from HSE care under asylum schemes.  Concern has been expressed that a significant proportion of these children were trafficked into the State for forced labour or sexual exploitation.  When they are accommodated in a State hostel, they are kidnapped, in effect, and forced into work.  Accordingly, it is vital that this convention is ratified.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on this matter.  The Minister is doing his utmost to ensure the convention is ratified.  This issue is regularly raised at the Council of Europe Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men.  It is important that Ireland is ahead of all other countries.  Perhaps the Opposition can raise this issue in Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>

	<P>What about Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to pass on my welcome for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s signal last night that the current rate of the old age pension will be upheld, as far as possible.  We are all aware that elderly people are probably the most vulnerable people in the community.  They made an investment in the State by working to get us to where we are today.  I would like the Leader to take into account the special request I am about to make.  As we speak, the Department of Finance is preparing next year&rsquo;s budget.  Many Senators met representatives of carers last week.  We are aware that workers in the caring profession look after elderly people every day.  They are under pressure in the current economic climate.  They are saving the State enormous sums of money by caring for people in their own homes and communities, which is as it should be.  I ask the Leader to set time aside at some stage in the future for a debate on the care of the elderly.</P>
        <P>I am not sure what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will say when he launches the international review of waste management policy later today.  Perhaps he will mention the proposed Poolbeg incinerator.  According to the regional waste management plans that are in operation at the moment, an incinerator is planned for each region.  The Minister has not given a clear direction to the local authorities which are engaging with these plans.  As they push ahead with the development of five incinerators throughout the country, there is a conflict with the suggestion that a single incinerator will serve the entire country.  I hope the Minister this afternoon will address the need to give local authorities a clear direction on waste management in this country.  I will be interested to hear whether he does.  Perhaps the Leader will take up the matter on behalf of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat the call I made last week for an early debate on right to life issues, including abortion and euthanasia.  I note that the Irish Medical Organisation has produced a document on such matters.  The related subject of capital punishment was raised last week by the former president of the High Court, Mr. Justice Richard Johnson.  It is important for us to debate such matters at an early stage.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should set the trend for the direction in which we will go on all of these issues.</P>
        <P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in calling for a debate on competitiveness in the context of the forthcoming budget.  I suggest that such a debate should take place next week, rather than in the first week of December.  It would be opportune to discuss the matter as public servants are protesting outside this building.  I often visit the John F. Kennedy memorial arboretum for a walk.  It is in a nice area just outside New Ross.  When I visited it last weekend, I was shocked and a little hurt when the person working on the gate told me he is anxious to get out of that position.  I understand he earns &euro;31,000 per annum.  He said he is getting abuse as a result of the divide between the public and private sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to inject some facts into this debate.  Those who will gather outside this gate next week are probably oblivious to the comparisons that can be made to show that we have lost <Col N="482"/>our competitiveness.  I refer to people in the public service, particularly civil servants.  Junior clerks in this jurisdiction are paid between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000 per annum.  An official in the corresponding position in Northern Ireland is paid between &pound;18,000 and &pound;19,000.  Last week, I came across the case of a person with a law degree who is qualified as a solicitor.  He is paid &pound;19,000 per annum as a court clerk in the High Court in Northern Ireland.  We have allowed salaries and wages in the private and public sectors to get out of line.  If something drastic is not done about it, this country will not be able to compete, the economy will not recover and the IMF will have to take decisions that will be extremely hard on everyone.  We need to play our part by providing for moderate reductions in salary rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Many speakers have referred to vulnerable people, such as the elderly and carers.  I gave the House a warning a long time ago about the systematic crippling of State agencies that are charged with protecting the vulnerable.  I will continue to use the Seanad to highlight such cases.</P>
        <P>I was contacted some time ago by a woman who is concerned about her 87 year old sister, who has intermittent dementia.  She is part of the home care package.  The home care package is a scandal.  It is a very good idea, but it is badly applied.  Some &euro;700 is made available to families that require carers.  It is paid directly to private agencies that are not regulated in any way.  This leads to very inappropriate situations.  There are discrepancies between the various charges that are applied after the &euro;700 is provided.  I am aware of a family that, over a short period of time, had to pay between &euro;84 and &euro;450 in additional fees.  The service is extremely poor.  Those providing it often do not have basic functional English.  They have no training whatever.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This was confirmed in an excellent article by Eilish O&rsquo;Regan in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  The article mentioned that the HSE spends &euro;120 million on this system each year.  It quoted from a report published by the National Economic and Social Forum which suggested that care workers are sent into people&rsquo;s homes without being the subject of Garda checks.  When the HSE confirmed that is the case, it said that such matters are the responsibility of the agencies.  No, it is not.  Carers are completely untrained.  No training is given.  Private companies have acknowledged that they have never been inspected by the HSE.  There is poor or no supervision of staff.  Complaints just disappear.  Some staff refuse to do tasks that are required by their patients.  When one woman was called on to collect the pension of an Alzheimer&rsquo;s patient, she asked for &euro;25 in petrol money.  A 78 year old had to be hospitalised because her carer was unable to give her the appropriate medication.</P>
        <P>This situation could lead to further scandals like that at Leas Cross nursing home.  I am asking for something to be done about it.  Guidelines were agreed by some of the private home care people but they were not signed off by the HSE.  What is the HSE doing?  Dr. Maureen Gaffney has said that there is poor accountability and slow decision making.  I agree with her that the connection between national policy decision making and local work practices is poor.  I ask the Leader to get the Minister to do something clearly, directly and specifically about this matter.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be long before we enter a countdown period leading to what everybody now accepts will be one of the harshest budgets we have had for a long time.  We have had much debate, certainly in the Houses of the Oireachtas but also outside, particularly in the media.  In the early stages of that debate one of the biggest difficulties in arriving at a consensus was that people were not sure whether we were dealing with a real crisis.  If one likes, we first needed to break through that sound barrier.  We have now done that and if we had done it sooner, perhaps the consensus might have been much clearer.  There <Col N="483"/>is consensus on one aspect of the crisis, that the vulnerable should not be asked to suffer.  Those who have most should pay most in whatever form.  I am not just talking about those who earn &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000 a year; I am also talking about people in secure jobs with guaranteed pensions who, in the main, have done exceptionally well from the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>I welcome the indication by the Taoiseach last night that pensions for the elderly would not be interfered with.  He was sending a further important message that there would be a strong caring element to the budget, not just on pensions for the elderly but also for others who were vulnerable.  When people take to the streets or go on strike, which is their right, in the main, the vulnerable are not represented.  They usually come as a second thought in some statement in the public arena because they are not organised and do not have a strong voice.  Invariably, they will suffer.  The Taoiseach sent a message last night that we should keep in mind in coming weeks that the budget will have a strong caring element.  That will help to put people&rsquo;s minds at ease.  It should also send a message to those who have done well from the Celtic tiger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Further to what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said and as we approach the budget, one of the great challenges facing us is the degree to which we create new jobs and hold existing ones.  I am fully in favour of a debate on the issues raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I also ask the Leader for a specific debate on the creation of new jobs and keeping existing ones.  In that context, in recent days we have been advised that one in three restaurants is at risk of closure, which means the displacement of jobs, with waitresses, chefs, commis-chefs and others finding themselves without work.  The cost of food here is 24% higher than the European average, which raises questions.</P>
        <P>The 250,000 people who regularly shop in Northern Ireland are displacing retail jobs in Border areas and elsewhere in the Republic.  In addition, the pending carbon tax and the 4% bio-fuel obligation will lead to an increase in the price of diesel and petrol and the closure of filling stations along the Border in counties Cavan and Monaghan and further afield.  While finding solutions will not be easy, the House has a duty to spend a day discussing the matter and investigating options, including the extent to which a reduction in the rate of VAT or excise duties on alcoholic drink might stop cross-Border shopping.  We need the qualified professionals to give us the figures to try to find solutions.  The House has a duty to respond to the crisis.  There are 40 restaurants in County Cavan, 12 of which are at risk of closure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>In calling on the Leader to arrange a pre-budget debate, it is important to consider what the Taoiseach said last night.  If we cherish people, the budget must protect the vulnerable, the elderly, the disabled and those in the caring profession, particularly carers.  If we place a high value on the work the people in question do, the budget should not cut back on their services and not hurt the old and the disabled but protect and fortify them.  We do not need simple words from the Taoiseach at some event.  What we need is strong cogent action by the Government.  Where I disagree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is that we have not seen such a plan from the Government.  It is make it up as one goes along budgeting.  We saw this in its handling of the banks crisis and the budget last year.  The cuts of &euro;4 billion need to be spread evenly across all areas.</P>
        <P>In the light of the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling on the Adjournment matters, which I respect, I ask the Leader to facilitate as a matter of extreme urgency a debate on the role of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport in the maintenance and upkeep of roads.  As the Leader said in giving a weather forecast at the end of a debate yesterday, we have seen inclement weather and the roads are falling apart.  In my area in Glenbrook Passage, Carrigaline and Monkstown the roads are falling apart.  What will it take for the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport to put in place a proper road maintenance programme?  Local authorities cannot do it, as they claim <Col N="484"/>they do not have the money to do so.  Who will do it?  Who will maintain the roads to ensure road safety?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Walsh&rsquo;s call for a debate on the economy and our competitiveness.  I, again, make the point that it is an absolute disgrace for a member of a Government party to stand up in the House or elsewhere to say there is a possibility the IMF might come in and take over.  This means the Government is telling its people that it considers it a reasonable course of action because matters are so bad for it to hand over responsibility for the governing of the country to another body not elected by them and which would not be accountable to us.  We have heard this statement from Ministers and regularly in this House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has destroyed the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Bearing in mind that this is a mess for which the Government is responsible, it is appalling for a Government party member to say to the people that if they do not do what it is needed, the Government will bring in the IMF.  I asked the Leader to do this previously and I am asking him again.  He should stand up and say this is not acceptable.  Fianna F&aacute;il is in government and it is its job to govern the country.  It is not acceptable for Government party members to stand up and say it is an acceptable course of action to call in the International Monetary Fund to pull the country from the mess into which the Government got us and from which it is not capable of pulling us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also relieved to hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s hint to the effect that the old age pension will not be cut.  There are many other deserving groups in society which have similar hopes they will not be unfairly targeted in the coming weeks.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right to stress the bona fides at the heart of the public sector and the concerns of workers in the public sector.  Like him, I would like it to go out loud and clear that nobody wants to target the public sector unfairly or hit out at the good work that so many in that sector are doing.  However, if we are serious about protecting the interests of the most vulnerable, particularly older people in the context of the old age pension, other groups such as carers and those looked after by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, we must wonder at the wisdom and propriety of strike action.  If we fracture unity by going out on strike &mdash; even if we have a legitimate grievance &mdash; the more vulnerable sectors will lose out.  They will suffer because others are more vocal and influential.  That is why I very much regret there is to be strike action next week.  I said several months ago that there will have to be an accounting in the future whereby those who make a disproportionate sacrifice now for the sake of the unity we need in dealing with our crisis are acknowledged and somehow recompensed.  However, the planned protest action is not the way to go.</P>
        <P>I am concerned at the recent report and comments by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  While we may aspire to treat the children of the nation equally, it is disgraceful that we do not treat the children of other nations with any dignity when they come to our shores and are dependent on us.  It is appalling to think of the neglect that takes place, with children being looked after by security personnel during the day.  That is no way to treat minors in our society, whether Irish natives or otherwise.</P>

	<P>A report in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> indicates that hospital consultants in many hospitals are not treating the required number of public patients, with some consultants operating a case load that consists of up to 80% private patients.  Consultants are paid large salaries in respect of which it took a long time for contracts to be agreed.  Who is responsible for ensuring they do the job they are paid to do according to their contracts?  Is <Col N="485"/>it the hospital manager, the Minister for Health and Children or the Health Service Executive?  Is it proposed that the situation be allowed to continue as it is?  The Minister must come into the House to provide some answers in this regard.  It was she who spoke about the improvements for public patients that would flow from agreement on a new consultant contract.  Recent reports clearly show that has not happened.</P>
        <P>The same newspaper includes a report on yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on the Constitution, at which the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, proposed the abolition of county and borough councils throughout the State.  Is this one of the Minister&rsquo;s kites &mdash; another of the <i>faux pas</i> he makes from time to time &mdash; or is it Fianna F&aacute;il and Government policy?  The Leader may be well qualified to answer that question.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the funding of local authorities?  I have called for such a debate on numerous occasions and it is apt that it should take place now in light of the views expressed yesterday by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, on the abolition of city and county councils.  As Senator Cummins observed, the Minister has made statements on this matter on previous occasions.  He is the Minister responsible for the mess in which local authorities currently find themselves and now he proposes to abolish them.  However, the Minister is correct that local authorities do not have sufficient funding to fill potholes, cut bushes, maintain public lighting and so on.

	<P>It is a matter of great importance because it was this particular goal which qualified France for the World Cup, dashed the hopes of the Irish players to play in the international arena and ensured we lost out on the spin-off of that participation in terms of franchising, finance and so on.  Although it was not intentional, an injustice has been done.  Nor is it the first time such a high-profile controversy has arisen.  In the 1980s English people were outraged when their team suffered the injustice of a clear handball goal from their opponents in a famous World Cup match.  This is an issue of international concern and it will continue to be a cause of controversy until the situation is resolved.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on the way he handled the appointment of the chief executive officer of Allied Irish Banks.  I am amazed at the contention that he should have gone elsewhere because of the difficulties in the Irish banking sector.  The reality is that by far the greatest difficulties were in the international banking sector; that is where the problems arose.  Why then should we seek an international candidate?  I have no doubt that if an international candidate had been appointed, the Opposition would be asking why an Irish person was not chosen.</P>

I ask the Leader to bring a response from the Minister to the House next Tuesday as to what precisely the Governor means by &ldquo;risky loans&rdquo;.

I raised this issue last week on the Adjournment, as I have done on a number of occasions over the past two years.  I referred, in particular, to the fact that residential accommodation for children with disabilities, unaccompanied minors and adults with intellectual disabilities is exempt from inspection.  I was pleased with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response that next year a number of the residential units that house unaccompanied minors will be closed and, following a reorganisation, they will come under the remit of the inspectorate of children&rsquo;s services.  The Minister of State noted that a result of the economic times we are in it will take a little longer for inspections of accommodation for adults with intellectual disabilities to be organised.  Will the Leader arrange at this earliest convenience for the Minister for Health and Children to attend the Chamber?  It is not acceptable that we can debate issues raised in the Ryan and Monageer reports, for example, and speak about the vulnerable people who were abused in the past and yet when it is within our capacity to ensure such abuse does not happen, we have not taken the steps necessary.  I appreciate these are difficult economic times but none of us wants to look back in 20 years with regret that we did not expand the inspectorate.</P>

	<P>Over the past year the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Irish Exporters Association have called for a State supported short-term export credit insurance scheme.  I raised this matter on the Order of Business last week and, subsequently, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment informed the IFA and the IEA that it would not provide this insurance.  I call on the Minister to publish the KPMG report, which states not enough companies require this insurance and it does not affect many people.  The multinationals are responsible for 90% of our exports while the remaining 10% are generated by indigenous companies, of which two thirds operate in the food and drinks industry.  I demand that the report be published.  The bureaucrats in the Department have no understanding of the pressures on indigenous food and drink companies, the rapid deterioration of sterling by 30% over the past two years, the lack of competitiveness, costs and so on.  Jobs have been lost in the food industry and sales have dropped to &euro;8 billion.  We have a crisis in our indigenous industry and the bureaucrats in the Department employed KPMG to produce a report when they knew that 90% of companies, the multinationals, had their own insurance.  I am calling for insurance to save our food and drinks companies.</P>

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly outlined to the House the fact that one in every three restaurants was in danger of closure.  I understand 80% of restaurants are losing money.  I hope the Minister for Finance will address this in the budget.  The restaurant trade is a large employer.  The Senator outlined the difficulties being experienced in his own area.  I also have much experience and know the importance of competitiveness, whether in wages or the cost of food and electricity.  The second largest cost item on a balance sheet used to be insurance.  It is now rates.  If wages and other costs are being reduced, rates must be reduced also.  Everyone is playing his or her part.  The issue of rates must be addressed because they are threatening the tourism, leisure and restaurant industries.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by my neighbour, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>

        <P>Senators will be aware that the full suite of existing Companies Acts, amounting to 14 in all, is currently the subject of a major reform and consolidation exercise.  I will outline progress made in this regard later and I assure Senators that the provisions of this Bill will also be incorporated into the consolidation exercise.</P>
        <P>This Bill covers two separate provisions.  The first of these allows for the use of US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, known for short as US GAAP, in the preparation of the accounts of a specified category of companies.  It also enables the prescription of other specified internationally recognised accounting standards.  The second provision limits a potential exposure of the Exchequer to costs that could arise from court investigations into the affairs of a company.</P>
        <P>On the first of these provisions, which I will refer to as the US GAAP proposal, I make the following introductory comments.  Attracting and developing foreign investment in the State is a major strand of the policy of this Government.  Indeed, foreign direct investment has played a pivotal role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth over the past decades and will continue to do so well into the future.</P>
<Col N="492"/>
        <P>In order to attract investors, industrial promotion policy needs to be agile, flexible, imaginative and continuously evolving and changing.  This is particularly the case where the attraction, integration and retention of foreign investment projects in Ireland is concerned.  This is paramount at times like the present where the global economy is facing almost unprecedented challenges to get back on track and where there is intense competition for a restricted pool of foreign investment.  In times like these, foreign investments do not come easily.  There is intense competition for this scarce investment resource.</P>
        <P>A parallel imperative confronts multinational companies as they seek to adjust and adapt to a changed and changing economic situation worldwide.  Those who wish to survive, not to mention prosper, simply cannot afford to stand still.  For many, this means restructuring and reconfiguring their global operations to best advantage.  Such strategies have the potential to result in opportunities or disadvantages for investment locations around the world.  In such a context, a country&rsquo;s ability to maintain its attractiveness as a centre for investment largely depends on how, or whether, it responds to these developments.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not have the luxury of passively watching as multinational investment disappears to competitive destinations that have kept up with or anticipated new trends and developments.  We cannot afford to miss out on these possibilities if we are to work our way through our current economic difficulties.  This Government is aware that openings must be created and availed of and it is committed to doing all that is possible to meet this goal.</P>
        <P>It is encouraging to note that notwithstanding the economic downturn, Ireland continues to be an attractive location for foreign direct investment.  IDA Ireland has already had a significant number of new investment projects approved and announced this year.  To date in 2009, there have been 48 announcements, with a combined investment of in excess of &euro;650 million and a potential to create 3,300 jobs.  That is a remarkable achievement in these difficult times and I wish the IDA the best in its work.  It always excels in the work that it does.</P>
        <P>It is encouraging that so many companies are prepared to undertake and announce these investments in Ireland given the current global trading environment.  The more optimistic economic forecasts for 2010, both globally and for Ireland, should help the IDA to make a significant contribution to economic recovery and continue to secure foreign direct investment for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s foreign direct investment landscape has continually undergone its own transformation, scanning the horizons of enterprise focusing on and securing FDI using novel technologies, innovative business models and new markets.  Ireland&rsquo;s landscape has evolved from that of a location based originally on manufacturing to a re-branding of ourselves as the young Europeans through to today&rsquo;s model of the smart economy built on the dual strengths of our innovation culture and our ability to be entrepreneurial.</P>
        <P>As a member of the European Union, Ireland offers international investors a stable political and economic environment and a sophisticated, well-developed corporate, legal and regulatory environment.  The Government recognises that the quality of economic regulation has a considerable impact on our competitiveness and growth and it is critical that we are capable of responding to changing economic circumstances in a way that is strategic and which reflects the evolving needs of business and investors.</P>
        <P>This is the broad policy context in which the US GAAP measure contained in the Bill can be seen.  The legislation is designed to facilitate multinational companies that have operations in Ireland to continue to add activities and substance to these operations.  This will further contribute to economic activity here and provide valuable employment opportunities.  This <Col N="493"/>measure will assist in attracting specific categories of companies from abroad to establish in the State.</P>
        <P>Certain multinational companies, which already have a substantial investment presence in Ireland, have further integrated their activities here by transferring their parent undertakings to Ireland.  As these companies are listed on US stock exchanges and report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, they will continue to have to prepare US accounts using US accounting standards in order to remain compliant in the United States.</P>
        <P>In addition to this obligation, as Irish registered companies, these multinational parent undertakings will also have to prepare Irish accounts.  The accounting standards followed by the generality of companies in this State are Irish generally accepted accounting practice, known as Irish GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, designated by the acronym IFRS, which are adopted by the EU.  It would be particularly onerous and expensive for a company if the obligation to convert to Irish GAAP or EU IFRS were to arise over a compressed period and inordinately so if this requirement arose during a company&rsquo;s current financial year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislation, therefore, provides for the use by this restricted category of companies of US GAAP for a limited period of time, namely, the arrangement will apply for a maximum of four financial years and it expires on 31 December 2015 at the latest.  This measure will facilitate an orderly transition by these companies to the use of Irish GAAP or IFRS, the EU standard.  There is a precedent for this.  When IFRS was introduced by the EU, a transitional period was allowed so that the various parties could make the necessary preparations.</P>
        <P>Companies will be subject to Irish company law generally, including all the provisions which relate to accounts.  In fact, our objective is that Irish company law will override any provision of US GAAP if it were to be in conflict with the Companies Acts.</P>
        <P>Allowing these companies to prepare their Irish accounts using US accounting standards for a limited period of time would eliminate the significant duplication of cost and effort of preparing two sets of accounts under two different sets of accounting standards.  It will also create a bridge roughly spanning the period during which significant international developments are expected in regard to the convergence of US and international accounting standards.</P>
        <P>In the interests of providing for future flexibility in this area, the T&aacute;naiste is including an enabling provision for ministerial prescription of other specified internationally recognised accounting standards if such a demand arose and was considered appropriate to do so.  Any such regulations will apply for the same transitional period as the US GAAP measure.</P>
        <P>Some enforcement costs are likely to arise for the Director of Corporate Enforcement in respect of the US or other GAAP provision.  Accordingly, the T&aacute;naiste proposes to table a Committee Stage amendment to provide a mechanism that would allow the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations for the purpose of defraying, or assisting in defraying, enforcement costs that may arise from this proposal to provide for the use of US or other GAAP.</P>
        <P>The second proposal included in the Bill addresses a potential exposure of the Exchequer to costs of inspectors appointed by the High Court under section 7 of the Companies Act 1990.  There are two related powers within that Act allowing the court to appoint inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company.  Section 8 facilitates such an appointment at the request of the Director of Corporate Enforcement while section 7 provides that a variety of specified interested parties can petition the High Court to have inspectors appointed.  Those parties include the company itself, a director of the company, a creditor and a group or block of shareholders of the company.</P>
<Col N="494"/>
        <P>As the law stands, there is an upper limit of &euro;317,435 on the amount that those who petition for such an appointment can be required to pay towards these costs.  This limit applies both to the security they can be asked to advance before the investigation commences and to the amount of the eventual costs of the investigation that the applicants would have to bear.  Unless the court decides that a company should meet all or some of the costs of the investigation, the balance of those costs, namely, the amount above the applicants&rsquo; statutory ceiling of just over &euro;317,000, would have to be borne by the State or the taxpayer.  On the basis of previous experience, the cost of a wide-ranging investigation could amount to &euro;10 million.  The T&aacute;naiste and I believe it necessary to take immediate action to protect the taxpayer from having to meet the very significant costs of such wide-scale investigations, some of which could conceivably duplicate investigations happening elsewhere in the State system, for example, by the ODCE, the Financial Regulator or the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>This need has to be balanced with the competing duty of the State to ensure shareholders and others have suitable access to justice.  To ensure an optimum balance would be achieved, I considered a number of alternative policy responses to this question.  Having regard to wider safeguards provided for in company law that are available to prospective applicants under section 7, the T&aacute;naiste concluded that the fairest and most balanced way of approaching this issue was to remove the absolute limit on costs currently applicable to applicants.  This involves removing the statutory limit in the two sections of the 1990 Act where it appears, that is, section 7 dealing with security for costs and section 13 which deals with the final costs of the completed investigation.  This will leave total discretion to the court in relation to the issue of costs, and will place applicants under this provision on the same general footing as other parties initiating court proceedings in that they can be held liable for the full costs if the court decides to do so.  The costs of investigations initiated by the ODCE, under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990, would continue to be met in the first instance by the Exchequer though my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>Company law must remain dynamic and responsive to meeting emerging opportunities and challenges.  To meet this goal, the T&aacute;naiste, in her role as the Minister with responsibility for this area of law and in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Commerce, Deputy Kelleher, consistently seeks to make timely and appropriate amendments to the Companies Acts if this will support the development of business or the enforcement of our laws.  I wish to inform Senators that the T&aacute;naiste is finalising a small number of other important law proposals which I hope to include in the Bill.  We would like the Seanad to consider these proposals on Committee Stage of this Bill if they can be finalised within a timeframe that would not delay its enactment.</P>
        <P>On the details of the Bill, section 1 provides that a true and fair view of a parent undertaking may be given by the use of US GAAP by certain parent undertakings which are defined in the section.  This is subject to the proviso that the use of those principles in the preparation of the undertaking&rsquo;s accounts does not contravene any of the provisions of the Companies Acts or any regulations made under them.  The accounts in question are the company&rsquo;s group accounts and the individual accounts of the parent company.  This arrangement will be limited to a specified category of companies. These are defined as parent companies incorporating in Ireland for the first time whose securities are not traded on a regulated market in the European Economic Area, whose securities are registered with or who are subject to reporting to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and who, on the date this Bill passes into law, have not already incurred an obligation to file their first accounts with the registrar of companies.  The section also provides for this arrangement to apply for a maximum of four financial years and expires on 31 December 2015 at the latest.  Where accounts are prepared under this section, the notes to the accounts are required to state that this is the case.</P>
<Col N="495"/>
        <P>Section 2 gives the Minister the power to make regulations that may prescribe other specified internationally recognised accounting standards under which specified categories of companies may prepare accounts for a maximum of four financial years to end by 31 December 2015.  Any such regulations shall specify the accounting standards, which shall be internationally recognised, and generally accepted accounting principles or practices of a jurisdiction where a majority of the subsidiaries of the parent undertaking have a substantial connection or where the market is situated on which the shares of the parent undertaking are primarily admitted to trading.  In preparing accounts using other internationally recognised accounting standards, companies must not contravene any provision of the Companies Acts or any regulations made under them.  Where accounts are prepared under this section, the notes to the accounts are required to state that this is the case.</P>
        <P>Section 3 removes the current upper limits that applicants can be asked to contribute towards the costs of court investigations initiated on foot of their applications under section 7 of the 1990 Act.  The upper limit currently applies both to the security applicants can be asked to advance before the investigation begins, provided for section 7(3), and to the amount of the eventual costs of the investigation the applicants would have to bear, provided for in section 13(1).  Section 4 is standard drafting and simply contains the Short Title and the fact the Act and the Companies Acts shall be read as one.</P>
        <P>I wish to brief Senators on the status of the ongoing major review and consolidation of the entire suite of Companies Acts.  As Senators will be aware, the Company Law Review Group published its draft general scheme of the companies consolidation and reform Bill in 2007.  The Government subsequently approved the drafting of a Bill along the lines of the general scheme and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is drafting the legislation.  The proposed Bill will consolidate the existing 14 Companies Acts, dating from 1963 to 2009, as well as other regulations and common law provisions relating to the incorporation and operation of companies, into a single Act comprising more than 1,300 sections.  The provisions of the general scheme cover the incorporation of companies, corporate governance duties of directors and secretaries, financial statements and auditors, receivers, reorganisations and examinerships, windings-up and compliance and enforcement.  The provisions are brought together in a coherent manner which will facilitate business people in incorporating and operating companies day to day.  The general scheme also modernises company law to reflect modern business practice.  Given that 90% of companies in Ireland today are in the form of a private company limited by shares, the general scheme sets out in sequential sections all the provisions relating to that type of company.  In subsequent sections the provisions for the private company are modified for other company types such as public limited companies.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, to promote compliance with the law and to protect investors and creditors, the general scheme also sets out clearly the corporate governance duties of directors, company secretaries, auditors etc.  The general scheme also sets out the functions of the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority in ensuring compliance with the law and brings together the provisions relating to compliance and enforcement such as company investigations, compliance and protective orders, disclosure orders, disqualification and restriction of directors, and prosecution, offences and evidential matters.  The likely date of publication of the companies consolidation and reform Bill is September 2010.</P>
        <P>I would make the following summary remarks on the Bill before us.  The Government regards the US GAAP provision and the scope to designate other internationally recognised accounting standards as a practical measure.  It demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s forward-looking approach to industrial promotion and stimulating foreign direct investment.  We consider the provision <Col N="496"/>removing the upper ceiling on court costs that can be recovered from applicants under section 7 of the Companies Act 1990 is a balanced and fair approach to this issue.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the Bill he has introduced.  The impression can sometimes be given in this House during discussions on competitiveness and the action that needs to be taken to increase job security and number of jobs in our economy that what is needed is a grand sweeping strategy focused on one particular element.  However, the opposite is often the case.  What is required is a bundle of many different initiatives, each of which may be small but when taken together can create a more favourable environment for job creation and retention.  This Bill appears to be a measure of that nature.  It is about creating a more favourable accounting environment in Ireland for a period that will increase, to an extent, our competitive advantage.  For that reason, the Bill and the provisions in regard to company inspectors, on which I will comment shortly, are to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The issue of accounting standards, the changes that are taking place and the differences they can have on a company are a pretty dry subject.  When preparing for the debate on this legislation, I came across an example that brought home to me the importance of this legislation for companies and the importance of accounting standards.  I read an article that compared the effect that two different accounting regimes would have on the annual reports of BAA at the time.  It offered as an example the annual report it filed for 2006.  If the GAAP, generally accepted accounting principles, standards had been applied during that period, the annual net income of that company would have been &pound;148 million sterling.  However, if the IFRS, international financial reporting standards, had been applied, its annual net income would have been in excess of &pound;450 million sterling.  That is a significant difference based on the two accounting standards in place.  There is nothing devious or underhand about it because it is all about how the financial standards account for assets and liabilities and how they are measured.  It appears to be very sensible for the economy to recognise this and try to create a more agile environment, given the pressures on our competitiveness.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I will refer to several specific points related to the Bill and put several questions to the Minister of State.  Before doing so, I wish to comment on the general environment in relation to accounting standards because, as the Minister of State indicated, it provides an important background to the Bill.  For many years there has been consensus on the need to move to global accounting standards.  However, what is unique is that the consensus appears to be moving into action, as moves are afoot to put in place the global accounting standards to which the Minister of State referred.  We are all aware of the collapse of such companies as Enron and the role played by financial reporting standards.  More recent examples include the experiences of multinational banks with different reporting standards and how they can create ambiguity in the way assets and liabilities are reported.  This environment has created a once in a lifetime dynamic to move to a common platform throughout the world for the way in which accounting should be done.  This must be welcomed because the quicker we move to common standards for the way in which economic activity is reported, the more likely it is that we will avoid some of the great difficulties we have encountered recently and confer fair standards for how such matters are accounted for and measured.  I welcome the creation of the global environment within which the Bill is placed.</P>
        <P>That leads me to one of the first questions I have for the Minister of State and I would appreciate his response.  I understand the Securities Exchange Commission, SEC, in the USA, the body responsible for accounting standards, has recently given guidance to American companies to the effect that it wants them to begin the migration to international reporting stan<Col N="497"/>dards.  Given that it appears accounting bodies in the USA are being given guidance on the need to migrate to a more common accounting platform, how many companies does the Minister of State expect this legislation will affect in Ireland?  Will it deliver the competitive advantage we might have believed initially, given that the American accounting bodies now want American companies to move to what, in effect, will be accounting standards that resemble those in Europe, including Ireland?  To make the point more clearly, given that it appears American companies will migrate to an international accounting framework, how many companies will benefit from the concession the Bill offers?</P>
        <P>Section 1 clarifies the companies for which the concession will apply.  I note the legislation does not refer to companies resident in Ireland.  It makes the point that they should have securities registered with the SEC in the USA and makes reference to the fact that these companies were not compelled to provide accounts for the registrar of companies in the jurisdiction.  However, it does not indicate they should be registered in Ireland in the first place.  This may be an oversight on my part, as it may be inferred in the legislation or made explicit elsewhere.  However, should it not be explicitly spelled out in the legislation that these companies must be resident in Ireland to take advantage of the concession the legislation will create?</P>
        <P>I refer to a point made by the Minister of State.  He indicated that on Committee Stage he would introduce a concession to allow companies to defray or receive assistance in defraying enforcement costs that might arise in the implementation of US accounting standards.  Given that the Bill already provides for a concession in this regard, is it necessary to offer a further financial advantage to companies?  Must we do even more to make matters advantageous for such companies, given that the legislation will create an advantage in the first place?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the fact that we must avoid a jurisdiction within which so-called brass plate operations are set up, that is, operations with a nominal presence in Ireland to allow them to take advantage of our tax regime and corporation tax rate.  Is there any way in which this legislation could be taken advantage of by companies which might wish to have a nominal presence in Ireland to take advantage of the accounting standards in place?  It is unlikely but I recall reading an appalling article in which Ireland was referred to as the Wild West of financial services and in which reference was made to the environment that had been created.  It was an appalling and inaccurate article and I recognise the Government went to great lengths to repel and rebut it.  Nonetheless, we have no wish to do anything that could create the impression that there is such an environment in Ireland such that further opportunities could be created.</P>
        <P>I refer to the welcome provision in the Bill related to company inspectors.  It is the right thing to do for the taxpayer.  Does the Minister of State expect an increase in the number of such applications before the courts and his Department?  Does he believe any of these inspection requests will come from the banking industry?</P>
        <P>Those are my five questions and I would appreciate answers to them from the Minister of State.  I welcome the Bill.  It is a minor measure but it will assist us.  It must be seen in the context of change in global accounting standards, which I support.  It will create an environment within which the country will be able to flourish.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, and his departmental officials to the House for a debate on the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  I propose to share time with Senator Carty.</P>

<Col N="498"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is relatively short and I understand it covers two different issues.  One is the US GAAP, the transitional accounting standards and regulations.  From listening to the Minister of State, the provision will allow companies that relocate parent companies to Ireland to continue for a limited period to draw up group accounts and individual parent company accounts using the US accounting standards.  This is a question posed by Senator Donohoe.  The period is four years for each beneficiary company, with an end date of December 2015.  Companies incorporated in Ireland were heretofore expected to use Irish or international financial reporting standards.  The legislation also includes provision for the Minister to make regulations, if appropriate, for the same category of companies using other internationally recognised accounting procedures and standards.  I do not see any great difficulty with this measure.  Listening to the Minister of State, everyone will sign up to the importance of attracting foreign direct investment.  The Minister of State mentions that we cannot afford to miss out on these possibilities or we may lose investment to other destinations.  If this tool will assist us to attract, integrate and retain foreign investment projects in Ireland, it is a welcome move and one to which we all sign up.  The legislation is designed to facilitate companies with certain operations in Ireland to add activities and substance to these operations.  This will contribute to additional economic activity here and, it is hoped, provide valuable employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>Most of the companies that will avail of this mechanism already have substantial investment in Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister of State can indicate the level of this investment and the benefit that accrues from it, such as employment and participation in our export and import markets.  Perhaps he can indicate also the expected target market that will follow from this measure.  Most of these companies are listed on US stock exchanges and report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  They will have to continue to prepare US accounts to remain compliant in the US.  In addition to that procedure, as Irish registered companies they will have to prepare Irish accounts.  This is where standards followed by companies in this State are generally accepted accounting practices, known as Irish GAAP, or international financial reporting standards adopted by the EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a lot of technical change to accommodate continued investment and that is why it is important for the Minister of State to clarify the current levels and the likely benefits that will accrue.  He might clarify whether a particular group of people or companies sought this measure.  If so, how was this brought to the attention of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?  What will be the likely cost to Revenue?  The Minister of State referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and costs in that regard but I refer to the bigger picture.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State asked for urgent accommodation of the Bill and asked if we could finalise a framework that would not delay its enactment.  I hope the House will give the Minister of State a green light on this matter.  We will accommodate this Bill which will be on Committee, Report and Final Stages in the House on Wednesday.  I am pleased to indicate that Members on this side of the House will accommodate this.</P>
        <P>We are all under pressure at the moment.  Internationally, Ireland is under pressure and the issue of competitiveness is critical.  When we have the opportunity to do so, we should do what we can to assist in attracting foreign investment, especially in respect of the transatlantic benefit Ireland has enjoyed for a considerable period of time, although perhaps not as much over the past eight years as we did before.  The US and Ireland have a special relationship and most leaders of America have encouraged and developed the special relationship.  It is interesting to note that the current US President, Barack Obama, has tapped into his Irish roots which happen to be in the same county as the Taoiseach.  Arising from that special relationship with the US, it is appropriate that we try to accommodate the US in whatever way we can to develop the relationship and tap into the investment potential.</P>
<Col N="499"/>
        <P>I am a little concerned that, in the current economic and financial climate where we are under pressure, we have seen individual states respond to their needs in a particular fashion.  We hear about trillions of dollars going into a particular industry in the US and figures for some European Union member states with which Ireland cannot compete.  Senator Donohoe referred to global accounting practices but I would like to see a partnership approach to the transatlantic response to the current financial and economic difficulty.  I say this because the representatives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are present.  Ireland should avail of the special relationship that exists between the US and Ireland.  There is a great opportunity to have a transatlantic response.</P>
        <P>Regarding the second unconnected issue, we are limiting the potential exposure of the Exchequer to costs of certain court-appointed investigations into the affairs of companies.  This relates to the Companies Act 1990 which provides that a variety of prescribed interested parties can petition the High Court to have inspectors appointed to investigate the affairs of the company. At present, there is an upper limit on the amount that the applicants for such an appointment can be required to pay towards these costs by way of security that can be demanded in advance of the investigation or by way of the applicants having to bear the eventual cost of the investigation.  I understand the Bill provides for the removal of the statutory absolute limit on the costs applicable to applicants.  This would leave the courts with total discretion on costs and would place applicants on the same general footing as other parties.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  I thank Senator Callely for providing me with a little of his time as I must attend another meeting.  I welcome the Bill.  It is important in the times we are in to do everything possible to ensure that foreign investment in the country is kept to the fore.  It has stood us well for many years and I hope it will continue to do so.  I welcome section 3 of the Bill as the taxpayer must be protected.  As the Minister of State said, some cases can cost up to &euro;10 million.  An upper limit of &euro;317,000 is very low and I welcome the amendment.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s point of view it is not expected the Bill will give rise to additional staffing requirements and this is important in the times we are in.  The Minister of State mentioned he will table amendments and I look forward to hearing what they are.  I am sure they will be constructive and will work to the good of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the heavy-hitting advisers he has behind him.  I know well their expertise in this area and I have discussed and argued issues with them over many years.  I must declare an interest as a member of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  This is an issue of great interest to me.  The question of standards in accounting and auditing has to do with trust and confidence.  It is a simple issue of people being able to trust the figures they see, the names written at the bottom and the regulation in place.  In this regard the Bill is welcome and necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">After listening to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and going through it in great detail I had to sit down outside and take a rest.  A line in it states, &ldquo;The likely date of publication of the companies consolidation and reform Bill is September 2010&rdquo;.  I know the T&aacute;naiste would never lie or deliberately mislead the House but on her previous occasion here when debating the Companies (Amendment) Bill, I had tabled a number of amendments to that Bill, supported by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, on matters about which we felt very strongly.  We argued intensely until, with her most beguiling of smiles, the T&aacute;naiste stated she could not accept the amendments on that occasion but that she could deal with the issue in the company law consolidation and reform Bill, which was in its final stages and would be with us by next spring.  Now, I see it will be published six months after that.</P>
        <P>This may not seem an important issue but on that occasion I made the point that the previous occasion we amended the Companies Acts was in 1990 and it took two years to get that legis<Col N="500"/>lation through the Houses.  In fact, it took so long that one section had to be taken on its own to deal with a crisis in the meat industry.  I am not making this point to be critical of the section of the Department that deals with this but because it is important.  Let us put on hold what is in the Bill and consider the entire area of regulation.  The most recent important matter to issue from Europe on this is the famous eighth directive on accounting and auditing standards and the quality assurance that goes with it.  Accounting and auditing are about quality assurance and nothing else.  We are one of the last countries to transpose this directive.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister of State or the country &mdash; it is not good for us to do so &mdash; but it is an embarrassment whatever way we look at it.  We are way behind on the quality assurance that is required in accounting standards.</P>
        <P>To take this matter further let us consider how it works.  Much reference has been made to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  I might not be too enthusiastic about it but I do not object in any way to us having an intervening period in which United States based companies will be allowed to stick with US standards.  What I do have a problem with is that the US has been so reluctant to buy into international standards for as long as we remember.  It is only in the past two months, as was pointed out by Senator Donohoe, that they are moving to international standards.  This is a major win for Europe.</P>
        <P>I will now consider how this works in reverse and how it is policed in other countries.  In other counties, a check is carried out.  The supervisory authority in countries with many companies based there, such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Luxemburg in particular, visits companies and checks standards to ensure they are complying with the applicable US, Irish or GB GAAP, or the international standards.  This happens in every country except Ireland.  Despite all that has happened over the past two years, the people checking how this is implemented are in the accountancy bodies themselves.  This creates a difficulty because the Department will encourage many Irish companies to register in places such as Japan or other countries where we are trying to build up industry.  This means those countries must have trust and confidence in our system.</P>
        <P>Around the world, checking accountancy and auditing standards is done by an independent State oversight body or supervisory authority.  In Ireland, it is done by the accountancy professional bodies themselves.  That is a mistake.  Those of us who are aware of this feel it is completely wrong and we have been speaking to the Department about it for years.  It should be changed.  I honestly believe the accountancy bodies, which are very important and have much influence, have managed to influence the Department because they have been working with it for the past 100 years, since before the foundation of the State, and they are listened to more than other groups.  It is a mistake and we will pay a price for it somewhere along the way.  I could write the advice being given to the Minister of State because I know exactly what the answers are but there is no answer to the general principle that supervision of accountancy standards should be done by the State.</P>
        <P>The Bill quite rightly raises the limits to which people must contribute and I welcome this.  Let us apply it to the Irish situation.  In the past week, two or three questions have been raised on investigations into various banks and heads of banks in the news &mdash; they need not be mentioned.  The oversight body has a choice under the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  It can insist that the accountancy bodies themselves conduct the investigation into whether members of a company fulfilled their obligations.  This is different to the checking of standards that I mentioned earlier.  The supervisory authority has an oversight role to ensure it is done properly.  However, the legislation also allows the oversight body to investigate a body such as Anglo Irish Bank.  As was indicated, these investigations can cost millions of euro.  There is no money available in Ireland to conduct them.  I have listened to the debates in these <Col N="501"/>Houses and among commentators regarding why this area is not being investigated.  One of the reasons is that section 3 of the Bill, welcome though it is, would not be available if the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, which is the body appointed by the Minister, chose to act by itself.  I am not saying the Department would refuse to act but that it would not want to provide the money.  It would only be due to public embarrassment that it would act.  If Anglo Irish Bank was a UK institution, that country&rsquo;s Financial Services Authority would investigate and the cost would be carried by the accounting bodies.  In Ireland only 60% of the cost of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority is covered by the accounting bodies but this does not include the matters to which I refer.  This is an important issue in terms of trust and confidence.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan and I have on many occasions raised the issue of protecting the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;.  The matter has been considered by the Department and the company law review group.  Everybody agrees it should be protected and we have at least progressed beyond the silly arguments about not putting bookies out of business by confusing the term with &ldquo;turf accountant&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; remains open to abuse, however.  Anybody can put up a doorplate claiming he or she is an accountant and there is nothing we can do to stop it.  Such people would not be entitled to conduct audits but they could present themselves as accountants to an unsuspecting public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to outline the difference between the approaches taken in the US and Europe in regard to accounting standards.  The legislation introduced in the US in the aftermath of the Enron affair is called the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  That Act provides for prison terms to be imposed on the chief financial officer of a company.  However, the weakness of the American system is that it is rules based.  If an issue is not covered by a rule, the system is silent on it.  In many cases, the reports produced under rules based systems are meaningless.  It is preferable to have a principles based approach which tells people to act honestly and prudentially.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In an ideal world, there would be no need for company law.  In the middle ages, shopkeepers were hanged if they did not behave honestly and prudentially.  As that came to be considered somewhat barbarous, more polite concepts such as limited liability were introduced.  These were seen as democratic gifts which would allow business people to pursue opportunities and take reasonable risks.  The key concept was reasonableness.  I recall a time when exchanges in the stock markets were conducted on the basis of a nod and a handshake.  That no longer happens because of the question of trust.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill for its aspirations towards trust and confidence but wider issues need to be considered.  One such issue is amending the Companies Acts to require that directors issue a compliance statement that to the best of their knowledge they are presenting a fair and accurate reflection of their companies&rsquo; accounts.  The Minister previously stated this matter was best provided for in the forthcoming company law consolidation and reform Bill.  This was recommended by the audit review group, which I chaired in 2002, but it seemed to put a bomb under accounting and business professionals.  They asked how anyone could dare to make such a demand of company directors.  However, any reasonable person would consider it an appropriate requirement.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials, who are hardworking and highly knowledgeable about this area.  Although I argue with them regularly, I would not gainsay their contribution to companies legislation.  I wish them well in their efforts on the company law consolidation and reform Bill.  I have given out about delays to that Bill but I do not wish it to be rushed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 is a reaction to recent controversies which diminished the international reputation of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate and <Col N="502"/>financial services sectors.  It is the second amendment to the Companies Acts in the wake of these controversies.  This is to be regretted because, despite Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggestion that we might be better off without company law, we were looking forward to the consolidation of the legislation in the near future.  Consolidation is badly needed because the law has given companies a legal personage without encouraging them to observe the principles of corporate social responsibility.  Companies tend to act amorally but the existing law does not allow us to hold them properly to account.  We could argue about the failure of political will to put stronger legislation in place but we must also admit to cultural issues in our corporate practices.  In tandem with legislative change, we must redouble our efforts to change that culture.</P>
        <P>This Bill reminds me of the spoonerism coined by Myles na gCopaleen for his characters Keats and Chapman, &ldquo;dogging a fled horse&rdquo;.  We are trying to shut a large stable door after the damage has been done.  The Bill will give us confidence that we will prevent such damaging events in the future but it will do nothing to assuage public concern about what has happened.  Public anger about the lack of ethical standards in financial services companies is justified.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to exemptions for American multinational companies in Ireland.  I am uncomfortable about putting dual standards in place and hope the company law consolidation and reform legislation will address the anomaly we are creating with the Bill before us.  It might be useful, however, to adopt American standards in respect of malfeasance in financial institutions.  The idea of arresting, charging and prosecuting someone would be welcome if it fostered higher corporate standards.  It is unacceptable that 18 months after our controversies arose, we are no nearer to bringing prosecutions.  In the United States, people have been identified, arrested, prosecuted and processed in the courts.  Ireland&rsquo;s body of corporate law is extremely weak in terms of securing results within a timeframe that would achieve the public confidence required.  The position is even worse in that public confidence is so low that people believe prosecutions will never brought in the case of activities that we all know have not been for the common good.  I hope this view will not become a self-fulfilling prophesy as it would indicate that corporate law has failed.  If the necessary action is not being taken because certain aspects of corporate law preclude it, sufficient resources are not available in the Office of the Director of Corporate Affairs or there is a reluctance to identify individuals who are presumed to have been involved in the practices that caused the current economic calamity because these persons would expose and compromise others, we must act to address these issues.  We must not allow such perceptions to exist.</P>
        <P>The Bill reflects a sincere effort to address flaws in the companies legislation, for example, in areas such as loans to directors, residency requirements and the use of legal privilege.  I accept, however, that the approach is one of applying a band aid.  The Government must indicate its plans to strengthen companies legislation further through the promised consolidation Bill.  By reacting to events and taking relatively quick action to strengthen the law in areas in which it was viewed as weak, we miss areas where further abuses may occur.  More encompassing legislation will provide an opportunity to address these areas.</P>
        <P>The Bill is welcome but I would have liked stronger measures.  The Government should commit to making available whatever resources are necessary.  I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that legislative measures providing for directors&rsquo; statements of compliance should be introduced as quickly as possible.  Regrettably, the Bill reflects the fact that in the current corporate environment, especially in financial services, the inclination to do good or recognise the concept of the common good has been superseded by the cult of the individual and greed.  We must recognise this change in legislation rather than relying on gentlemanly agreements.  We must move on from the concept of allowing companies, notably in the financial services industry, to be self-policing in terms of auditing and accounting.  We must recognise that the role of the <Col N="503"/>State is, in a sense, to legislate for Murphy&rsquo;s law-type scenarios.  In other words, it must operate on the basis that if something can go wrong morally and ethically, it will go wrong.  We need to provide the legislative means to ensure all such circumstances will be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  This is a short Bill, although the Minister of State spent considerable time setting out the context for its introduction.  I was not sure before this morning whether to welcome the legislation and decided to await greater clarity on its purpose.  However, the Minister of State did not provide greater detail than that contained in the explanatory memorandum.  It appears the legislation is motivated by a requirement to address urgent matters and that these could not await promised legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate and clarify the reasons for the introduction of the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The two key elements of the Bill are the measures to allow the use of United States generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, on a temporary basis for certain categories of company and to remove the cap on the contribution of companies towards costs incurred in court cases and reduce the State&rsquo;s exposure in this regard.  While these measures are welcome, I seek greater clarity on the reason for the introduction of the measure on GAAP.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the key differences between US and Irish generally accepted accounting principles.  Greater clarity is also required on which category of company may use US generally accepted accounting principles.  It appears the measure will apply to the parent undertakings of companies based in Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s request for information on the number of companies affected by the measures and the potential level of exposure.  I also ask the Minister of State to give specific examples of the companies affected.  He indicated that we need to avail of opportunities to attract foreign direct investment.  Obviously, everyone supports foreign direct investment.  Given that the arrangement for the use of US GAAP applies to companies already operating in Ireland, to what extent will it encourage new companies to invest here?</P>
        <P>In light of the urgency with which the legislation is being introduced, is there a danger that companies based here may pull out of if the measure is not introduced?  To what extent do other European Economic Area countries provide flexibility of this nature to investing companies?  Why will the transitional arrangement cease to have effect from 31 December 2015?  What will be the position regarding companies seeking to invest after that date?  I am a little uncomfortable with this arrangement and ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter.</P>
        <P>Section 2 gives the Minister the power to make regulations providing for the use of other international accounting standards.  If the Minister chooses to exercise this power, the matter should be debated in the House.  I am aware that United States accounting standards are high, having experienced the introduction of Sarbanes-Oxley standards in a previous employment.  For this reason, I have no fear of US standards in terms of the hoops they put companies through, although they are costly and create considerable stress for some people.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State elaborate on the reason the legislation is being introduced with such great urgency?  Senator Boyle suggested the Bill has been introduced in response to recent controversies.  I do not detect a link between the new measures and recent controversies.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ryan for his contribution.  He is anxious to learn more about the differences between United States and Irish GAAP or generally accepted accounting principles.  I must put up my hands as I am not an accountant or lawyer.  My officials will prepare a short <Col N="504"/>note on the matter and communicate directly with the Senator.  Accounting standards are difficult and complex and there are differences between them.</P>
        <P>The reason for the urgency is that we like to be agile and respond quickly to the needs of industries and companies based in this country.  We were approached by a number of substantial companies, one of which is one of the largest accountancy companies in the world.  They need certainty on this issue because they need to know if they will have to produce two sets of very complex accounts in order to be compliant with their obligations in the United States under the Securities and Exchange Commission and those regarding their regulated presence in Ireland.  The matter is urgent because we do not want to impose an additional cost on such companies because it can give them a bad feeling about the country, namely, that we are excessively bureaucratic.  We want to facilitate them and the ease with which they can move to the US standard before they move their parent companies here.  When a parent or holding company locates here, it is good news for Ireland Incorporated because moving a holding or parent company here involves extra work in Ireland, much of which concerns immediate servicing where a holding company which runs a series of global companies rather than a headquarters operation is established.  At the very minimum, such a move involves extra work for accountants, solicitors and back office staff servicing the operations of a global holding company which might have operating companies elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I understand Senator Boyle had particular concerns about our acceptance of a non-Irish standard but Senator Ryan dealt with that point when he outlined his own experience of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation.  The American standard is very high.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan raised another issue, on which I wish to respond, namely, the reason for the transitional nature of the provision.  It is hoped that by 2015 we will converge to a world standard of accounting, a point to which Senator Donohoe referred.  We have been debating this issue for years.  If one reads financial newspapers such as the <i>Financial Times</i> or the <i>The Wall Street Journal, </i>the idea of converging to a world accounting standard has been discussed for 20, 30 or 40 years.  Therefore, there are no financial or economic problems caused as a result of people reading different sets of accounts in different parts of the world or opportunistically availing of loose or weak accounting standards in order to avail of an opportunity not to be honest in their disclosures.  As a result of the global crisis, there seems to be a will to move more rapidly towards convergence.  Globalisation, not just in terms of the recession and difficult experiences of recent months and years, has also driven this process.  When there is greater globalisation, there is a need to move to higher standards on a global scale, rather than applying regional or local standards.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan raised the possibility of allowing existing companies such as Intel to benefit from the Bill.  It is not intended to extend the scope of the measure beyond those covered by the definition of &ldquo;relevant parent undertaking&rdquo;.  Measures are focused and tightly defined in terms of duration in order to accommodate companies which find themselves faced by the prospect of having to prepare their accounts in accordance with the IFRS or Irish GAAP standards within a very short timeframe.  The circumstances of companies operating for a number of years are, therefore, not comparable and, consequently, there is no basis for providing for their inclusion.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment appreciates the comments made by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Boyle today and in the debate on the Companies Act earlier this year.  I am speaking on her behalf and she is actively considering the appropriate response to the question on a director&rsquo;s compliance statement.  She will bring this view and the resulting legislative proposal to the Government before the Bill is published. The House will consider and decide whether to adopt a final Bill in this regard.</P>
<Col N="505"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the transposition of the eighth directive and quality assurance recommendations.  The issue is being considered in the context of the transposition process, while the quality assurance proposal was considered in detail with all the relevant parties, including the IAASA.  The Senator also raised the issue of the review of accountancy standards.  We are examining the issue, as is the director of compliance.  How we protect the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; is being discussed in the context of ongoing discussions in this regard.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator McCarthy for his brief intervention, in which he asked if extra staffing would be required.  Extra staff will not be required as a result of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised an interesting matter which I was encouraged by, that is, avoiding the pitfalls of the US system, in other words, moving towards a rigid rules based system in terms of how we deal with regulation.  I am not making another argument for light touch regulation but some confuse robust regulation with rules based regulation.  One of the great tragedies is that sometimes regulations encourage people to break the rules.  For example, the Enron case revealed a multitude of mission statements, regulations and recommended best practice.  If a highly intelligent workforce comprising 50 to 100 accountants is presented with ten or 20 tight rules on how they should behave, the first thing on all their minds in how they can find their way around them.</P>
        <P>There is a profound issue in terms of regulation regarding trust and confidence, to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred.  Changing behaviour in companies is far more important than regulation.  Leaders or those in senior management positions should act as exemplars of proper behaviour.  Asking people to change their behaviour and behave in a moral fashion is preferable to having a mountain load of regulations.  Regulation can often present a challenge rather than a restriction on their activities to highly intelligent people.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Senator Callely and a number of other Senators asked if the Bill would attract more inward investment.  I inform Senator Ryan that we are not suggesting there is a pot of gold behind the Bill.  Its essential purpose is to facilitate companies which have already located here in order that they will not be loaded with an additional burden.  Our ability to be urgent in our response and nimble enough in responding to the concerns of large companies with a substantial presence here which have a particular issue is something we are proud to promote.  There are not many other countries which offer such a service.  We go the extra mile to facilitate inward investors because it is something from which we will greatly benefit.  This is the foremost location of choice for US foreign direct investors in Europe.  In my role in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment I have found the ease with which people are able to meet decision makers in Ireland to be a distinct advantage.  I met a gentlemen recently and when I asked the reason he was locating here, he said it was that I was there, as Minister of State.  He was not flattering me by saying I was a wonder kid in terms of business promotion but in the country he had come from one would have no chance of meeting somebody at my level in the political or administrative scene.  It is a significant advantage; therefore, we should not be bureaucratic to the point where it is a competitive advantage we might lose.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Senator Callely asked how many companies the proposed measure would attract to Ireland.  I have answered that question.  The measure is not designed as a massive inducement for companies, rather it is designed to facilitate companies already located here.  It is to be hope other companies may decide to move their operations here in the future.</P>
        <P>Some Senators asked about the companies involved.  I do not want to name the ones involved but they are well known and have a substantial presence here.  One of them is one of the largest accounting companies in the world.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe asked some very interesting questions on numbers.  We do not want to put numbers on this measure.  A handful of companies made representations and it is to be hoped <Col N="506"/>others can be facilitated in the fullness of time.  The Senator also asked if we had introduced the Bill because we anticipated a series of further section 7 investigations.  That is not the motivation for the change in the legislation, rather it is simply a cost saving measure.  We do not want the cost of investigations to go out of control.  We have seen this happen with the tribunals of inquiry initiated by the Oireachtas.  We want to reduce the exposure of the State or the Exchequer in relation to these substantial investigations.  As I said in my opening remarks, these investigations are costing approximately &euro;10 million.</P>
      
        <P>Senator Donohoe also asked whether these companies can be said to be resident, or registered, in Ireland.  Residency is related to tax.  The companies in question have to be registered here.  He also asked whether this legislation will facilitate brass plate operations, or allow companies to have a nominal presence here.  We are very anxious not to facilitate that.  The Senator is aware that Ireland has an enviable reputation as an overseas destination of choice for financial and other companies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The media often does a great deal of damage to Ireland by depicting it as some sort of tax haven.  It is important to state that Ireland is not a tax haven.  Our low rate of corporation tax is very attractive to overseas investors.  Articles expressing all sorts of fear and loathing were published in the Irish media in advance of last year&rsquo;s US election.  It was suggested that Ireland was one of the tax havens against which Mr. Obama would move in the event of his election.  The purpose of the legislation that has been introduced in the US is to move against traditional tax havens in the Caribbean and elsewhere.  It is not a move against Ireland, which is not on the black list of international tax havens.  I accept that our low corporation tax regime is attractive.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe asked whether this legislation will give Ireland a competitive advantage.  I do not want to overstate the case.  This legislation is a tidying up exercise, at best.  It is not something that IDA Ireland will include in its brochure as a great advantage.</P>
        <P>I hope I have answered all the interesting questions that were asked by Senators.  I thank them for their interest in this complex area, which does not lend itself to being easily explained as an example of the worthy work of the Seanad.  Members have asked sharp questions and expressed genuine concern about this complex legislation.  I do not think the viewing public will take a particular interest in it.  I thank Senator Donohoe, in particular, for his sensible contribution.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 6, to delete lines 18 to 20.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On Second Stage, I predicted that the Bill would be heavily amended as it went through subsequent Stages.  I felt the Bill was very incomplete as has been borne out by the number of Government and Opposition amendments.</P>
        <P>Regarding amendments Nos. 2 and 5 to 7, inclusive, Fine Gael has a fundamental difficulty with everything being defined on the basis of a core strategy that is then referenced in development objectives as being consistent with the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines.  We acknowledge that improvements are needed in the planning and development area and these need to be made through legislation.  The continued references to core strategy and requiring that development plans must comply with the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines appear to be an attempt by the Minister to manage planning from the top down, rather than from the bottom up, which was the case heretofore when local authority members elected by their communities had a defining say on the strengths and weaknesses of their particular local development plan.  Those strengths and weaknesses can be clearly outlined in the development plan, which is compiled through a very thorough process of public consultation with reference to the elected members and also incorporates recommendations and advice from the professional staff of the planning sections, which in principle should give a good bottom-up approach to planning.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately there has been a lack of co-ordination through various development plans and strategies.  It is through this lack of co-ordination that we see the difficulties with planning.  We have seen development take place without transport links, or school or community facilities.  We would have liked a more co-ordinated approach to that.  I accept a genuine attempt is being made here.  However, our specific difficulty is how the national spatial strategy is formulated and adopted.  Fine Gael agrees we need a national spatial strategy or a national plan.  However, the Bill gives it a new status given that all development plans are required to comply with it.</P>
<Col N="508"/>
        <P Just="Left">I was provided with a very good document from the Houses of the Oireachtas Library and research service, which defines the national spatial strategy as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020 is the national strategic planning framework aimed at achieving a better balance of social, economic and physical development across Ireland, supported by more effective and integrated planning (Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, 2007).  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for leading implementation of the NSS.  The commitment to prepare the Strategy was included in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We would agree with much of that and we agree with the implementation of the national spatial strategy.  However, as far as I am aware it has never been approved by the Oireachtas.  In other words, the legislation we are discussing requires all development plans to comply in law with a document that has not received the approval of the Oireachtas.  Moreover, in the formulation of that document, there has been no consultation with the public similar to that which occurs in respect of local authority development plans.  In any democracy the public should have a strong say in how plans relevant to the national economy and national development are formulated.  The national spatial strategy was never subject to the thorough degree of public consultation which takes place in respect of regional development plans, yet under this legislation, all development plans are to be based on the national spatial strategy.  While the current strategy includes many positive aspects, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a future Minister from changing that strategy at a whim, thus affording him or her direct power to influence all development plans arising from it.  That is why we are proposing amendments to delete many of the references to the national spatial strategy and the regional development objectives.</P>
        <P>The Bill will give new and much enhanced powers to regional authorities.  Heretofore, they prepared regional development plans which offered guidance to local authorities on how a region should develop in a proper and sustainable manner.  The reality is that every region has its unique strengths and weaknesses and one size does not fit all.  My own region, the south east, is no different.  For example, one of the weaknesses is that it is the only region in the State without a university, but we also enjoy many advantages.  These provisions suggest the Minister is seeking, through the national spatial strategy and the regional authorities&rsquo; plans, to micro-manage all development plans throughout the State.  That is not the way to go.  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this issue, as well as those of other Members.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 2 proposes the deletion of the definition of &ldquo;core strategy&rdquo;.  However, the evidence-based core strategy is a cornerstone of these provisions and ensures a sound development plan, key to ensuring good planning at local level and a central plank of zoning reform.  Decisions taken at the development plan stage affect all other planning decisions.  Therefore, the amendment is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The core strategy and the development plans will provide relevant information on how the plans and the housing strategy are consistent with regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  The location, quantum and phasing of proposed developments must be shown, as well as projected population growth, details of transport plans and retail development, and proposals for developments in rural areas.  This more strategic approach to zoning will allow development to take place at the right time and in the right place and will allow the State to plan for the provision of infrastructure with much greater certainty.  It will facilitate an evi<Col N="509"/>dence-based rationale for future development in terms of what needs to be done and where and why it should be done.  All of this is key to the economic renewal agenda.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Government amendment No. 5 proposes the insertion of new subsections (1A), (1B) and (1C).  Subsections (1A) and (1B) are proposed to obligate planning authorities to vary development plans not later than one year after making regional planning guidelines to provide for a core strategy within existing development plans.  Subsection (1C) provides that where a planning authority is already commencing preparations for a new development, namely, four years after making the existing plan, the requirement to prepare a variation is not necessary and the core strategy can be incorporated as part of the preparation of the new plan.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 propose the deletion of provisions regarding the core strategy.  On the basis of our commitment to these provisions, the amendments are not acceptable.</P>

	<P>As I said, it is unacceptable that statutory development plans and regional guidelines should have to be compliant with what are non-statutory documents such as the national development plan and the national spatial strategy.  These documents are prepared without public consultation or democratic approval and can be amended at the whim of the Minister.  That is my fundamental difficulty with the legislation.  We acknowledge that the current national spatial strategy includes a good number of positive and sustainable planning directions, but its contents can be changed by the Minister or his successors.  That is why we are opposed to this part of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 3 provides for a definition of &ldquo;flood risk assessment&rdquo;.  Put simply, it is a study to assess and, if appropriate, manage a flood risk taking into account relevant issues such as current and potential future land use and development, and possible changes in climate.  The First Schedule to the principal Act is to be amended to provide for the inclusion in the development plans of an objective in respect of the carrying out of a flood risk assessment as part of the control and regulation of development in areas at risk of flooding.  This is to ensure that, where appropriate, a flood risk assessment is fully integrated into the planning process.</P>
        <P>To facilitate the provision of information for stakeholders on these new mechanisms for incorporating a flood risk assessment into the planning process, the Department, in association with the Office of Public Works, will, following a comprehensive public consultation process, publish guidelines for planning authorities on the planning system and the flood risk assess<Col N="510"/>ment, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, on 30 November.  These guidelines will explain in detail how to assess and manage flood risk at all stages of the planning process.  They will include a commitment to a review of the exempt development provisions in the planning and development regulations which currently allow for paving of residential gardens to provide off-street car parking or hard landscaping.  This review will be conducted as part of an overall review of the regulations to follow enactment of the Bill.  The review will consider ways of ensuring future exemptions only apply where such developments comply with sustainable drainage principles.  It should be noted that the Bill allows for the provision of an additional four-week period for the assessment of planning applications, accompanied by a flood risk assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the proposal to require local authorities to carry out flood risk assessments.  We are all aware of cases where conflicts have arisen in regard to development plans where, for example, development has been allowed in areas where significant Exchequer investment has been required to guard against flooding.  This provision will oblige local authorities to focus on flood risk assessments in areas particularly vulnerable to flooding.  It is a welcome inclusion in planning legislation which should have been in place long before now.</P>

	<P>It is important to note that there are people who have invested large sums of money in developing land.  The investment predates the legislation and this particular division but I welcome this important development.  Some people will not like the amendment because they have invested a great deal of money and they will find they have a less valuable resource.  At the same time, the flooding risk assessment in an important provision for planning and I support it in that context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this amendment, which gives us an insight into the thinking behind the legislation.  The draft wording used was &ldquo;urban settlement hierarchy&rdquo;.  I raised a concern on Second Stage that the planning law was moving swiftly towards urbanisation.  The mindset and the language of the Bill, as drafted, clearly outlines that.  The reference was to &ldquo;urban settlement hierarchy&rdquo; but somebody must have spoken to the Minister of State and his officials in the meantime to make them realise two thirds of the country is rural.  Many people live in rural areas and they should be acknowledged in a settlement hierarchy and, therefore, I welcome the amendments to remove the reference to &ldquo;urban&rdquo;.  It is important to do so.  Urbanisation was one of my basic concerns and the failure to take into account the settlement <Col N="511"/>needs of those who were born and bred in the countryside.  There are many thousands of people like that.</P>

	<P>I support and welcome the amendment as someone who was born and bred in the countryside.  I argued <i>ad nauseam </i>as a member of Westmeath County Council for due recognition to be given to sustaining rural developments and communities.  Such communities are driven by people and one of the greatest barometers of the declining population in many parts of Ireland is where a number of parishes have to come together to field a football or hurling team.  Where a number of houses are clustered in a rural area, help should be given to local authorities to confer village status on them because, at the end of the day, there has been a great decline in the number of rural shops, which are an integral part of rural infrastructure together with the Garda station, the school, the church and the post office.  The Minister should act to sustain rural communities.  The amendment is a step in the right direction and I commend the Minister of State for that.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(vi)  aggregate projected population, other than population referred to in subparagraph (v), in&mdash;</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 9 extends the requirement of the settlement hierarchy to provide details of aggregate projected population growth of villages and small <Col N="513"/>towns with a population of under 1,500 persons and open countryside outside of villages and towns.  These figures would be derived by each city and county council from within the regional planning guideline population targets.  Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, provide for the renumbering of these in light of the insertion arising from the amendment No. 9.  Amendment No. 12 provides for the deletion of the words &ldquo;rural areas&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 13 alters the consequential reference in light of a new paragraph inserted to take account of the aggregate population growth of the remaining areas referred to above.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I mentioned on Second Stage, development plans will be required by law to refer to projected population statistics.  It is fundamental that whatever projected population statistics are used are credible.  I am sure the Central Statistics Office and other such organisations will be referred to.  As we have seen with the compilation of the electoral register, many of the statistics we use are out of kilter with the reality and official records do not reflect the true population.  However, we will require development plans to refer to those statistics.  It is fundamental that statistics are credible and that local authorities which use them are sure they are accurate.  If they are not and if we draft development plans based on projections which are not accurate, those plans will not be accurate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This will have a detrimental effect on smaller towns which want to develop.  There is a hierarchy of towns.  I come from a county with two hub towns &mdash; Castlebar and Ballina.  Those towns will have to grow to the projected populations to the detriment of smaller towns.  Unless the hub town reaches the projected population, nothing will happen to the smaller ones in regard to water and sewerage schemes.  Some of the smaller towns require their treatment plants to be upgraded or require pipelines and treatment plants.  This measure will be to the detriment of less populated areas.</P>
        <P>As Senator Coffey said, the CSO figures are static and, in some cases, they have fallen.  We should look seriously at this measure as it will affect development.  Rural counties such as County Mayo need smaller towns to develop if we want to build infrastructure for buses and a proper bus service between smaller towns and the larger hubs.  We need a certain population in smaller towns to enable them to grow and make services such as shops viable.  It is fine to let the centres grow but it should not be at the expense of the smaller towns.  As Senator Coffey said, CSO figures are down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The councils will decide on the figures.  They will not take figures willy-nilly from anywhere, including the CSO.  It is a matter for the councils whether they have a local area plan.  There is no attempt in the legislation to impose area plans on them.  This is an opportunity for councils to bring in area plans but there is no legal requirement obliging them to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that there is no legal requirement on the councils but that could be a problem.  I see no reason smaller towns and villages should not be legally required to have area plans in the same way as larger ones.  Every town and village should have the opportunity to grow or exploit its potential to grow.  A legal requirement on a town or village to provide an area plan would help that process.</P>
        <P>I and many other people are aware of instances where councillors have stated that their town or village has been ignored in a county development plan.  That could be because they do not have the number of elected representatives other towns or areas have.  For that reason, a town or village might believe it is being left behind.  Officials can decide and recommend to members of the council what towns or villages have a local area plan but when there is no legal require<Col N="514"/>ment, some towns or villages could be neglected or ignored because of their size, social history, etc.  We make this point to safeguard against that.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>No matter how small a town or village, it should be entitled to have a development plan and not to be excluded.  As I said previously, every town, community and individual should have aspirations to develop and grow.  It is an aspiration every village community or individual should have.  We should encourage that at all times, including in legislation.  I do not see why smaller towns and villages should be excluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>If any town, small or large, was precluded from having a town plan, I would raise my eyebrows but I understand that is not the case and they can have a town plan or an area plan.  I am reasonably satisfied this measure will not stultify the progression of towns and villages.  If I thought otherwise, I would say so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a hierarchy of towns.  The gateways and hubs must grow to a certain level of population, as specified in the national spatial strategy.  As Senator Coffey said, the CSO figures are static.  Nothing can happen to the smaller towns until the hubs and gateways grow to the projected populations, as specified in the national spatial strategy.  There will be no activities in the smaller towns.  It will be a waste of time putting any plan in place in those smaller towns until the protected population is achieved in those hubs and the gateways.  This is a farce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no requirement on any local authority, its members or its executive to bring in an area plan or a local plan up to a population base of 5,000.  We all know that in almost every county, councillors and the officials have moved in regard to those small villages.  Villages with populations of 200 or 300 have area plans.  There is still that entitlement.  They will have the same opportunity to do this next year as they had last year.  There is no change in that respect.  </P>
        <P>The other point worth noting is that what we are proposing in respect of gateway and hub towns are targets to which one should aspire to achieve.  We cannot invent people.  Targets are as much as we can propose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the Minister of State saying that in a rural county such as Mayo with a designated hub or gateway town, the smaller towns, if they have a plan in place, can develop without the hub or gateway town reaching the targeted population figure?  The senior Minister has clearly said in this House that the targeted population figures for hub and gateway towns must be reached before anything can done in the smaller towns.  Therefore, we are at a crossroads in that respect.  I understood the senior Minister to say the projected population figures for hub and gateway towns must be reached before anything can happen in the smaller towns.  We should be clear about what he said because we are getting mixed messages on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the exact wording used by the Minister to hand but in this context, he mentioned the targets for gateway and hub towns.  As I said, they are simply targets.  Local authorities make their plans for different areas and a target for the main town in County Mayo, County Westmeath or County Sligo is simply that.  That is what the Minister said.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to harp on about this issue or waste any more of the time of the House on it, but the Minister rejected some county development plans because <Col N="515"/>the local authorities concerned had not taken the status of the national spatial strategy into consideration in terms of hub and gateway towns when adopting their plans.  It is clearly spelled out that there is a hierarchy of towns.  It is also clearly spelled out that the targeted population figures have to be reached.  I interpret this differently from the Minister of State in terms of the advice he has received from the officials present.  When a local authority moves to adopt a county development plan, the executive will tell members that there is a hierarchy of towns, that the national spatial strategy has to be implemented and that the targeted population figures for gateway and hub towns have to be reached before any activity or development can take place in the smaller towns.  We can have all the plans possible but nothing will happen.  It will be a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; time and councils&rsquo; resources to put all these plans in place until the targeted population figures are reached, unless a change in that respect is made in the Bill.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, lines 40 to 48 and in page 10, lines 1 to 4, to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>).</P>
        <P FLI="0">I note the Minister made the not unreasonable point on Second Stage that section 6 proposes to deal with the question of the scope of the submissions and observations on a development plan.  He sought for the scope to be more strategic in nature at this early stage of the preparation of the development plan.  He remarked on Second Stage that the development plan process should be more transparent and should move away from being distracted by zoning, especially zoning of land parcels, to a more strategic land use planning approach.  There is a good deal of merit in the Minister&rsquo;s proposal in this regard.  That said, I wish to test the issue to establish whether he is going too far in respect of what is proposed to be included in section 11 of the principal Act.</P>
        <P>I have no great difficulty with first part, that is, the time allowed for consultation and so on.  However, as a general point, it has often occurred to me in respect of the preparation of a development plan that notices must be published in newspapers and that the various interested parties must be contacted by the local authority.  I refer to the extent and level of information and notice imparted to the wider community in the run-up to the preparation of a development plan, although I have no wish to visit any particular criticism on anyone.  I am a former member of a local authority, admittedly in a suburban area, which may have contrasting issues from those of colleagues who are more familiar with local authorities in other areas.  However, there is a level at which material appears in the newspaper but not much attention is paid it by most of us.  That is the reality of life.  As practising politicians we know that planning issues only <Col N="517"/>come to the attention of people when they see a proposal for a zoning or development further down the line.  When somebody tells them there is an application, people object and get exercised about planning.  The idea of a development plan in the original legislation we are now amending is that the wider community is involved at an earlier stage.  It should be proactively involved in commenting on, debating, considering and planning how the area will look, what its physical state will be and what services will be provided.  This may occur to people over a period of time but they never assimilate or deal with it when considering the development plan.  My general point is that we must examine the extent to which we involve people in the early stage of planning.  I am not sure I have the answer to this point but the question is worth exploring.  We have been involved in situations where people suddenly wake up to a planning problem and one can point out that the proposal was included in the development plan or that the person could have made a submission on the matter at an earlier stage.  With the best will in the world, people do not do this because they have busy lives and do not have the opportunity.</P>
        <P>I agree with the general thrust of the intention of this measure.  The earlier stage should be the strategic stage, with a wider vision of the area or the county.  The motivation for this amendment, to delete the new section to be inserted by the Minister of State, is that it goes too far.  I refer particularly to the second part of the amendment on page 10: &ldquo;indicate that the submissions or observations referred to in paragraph (<i>b</i>) shall not relate to a request or proposal for the zoning of specific lands for any purpose&rdquo;.  I understand the Minister of State wants to exclude proposals for rezoning at this stage but to go so far as to say that submissions or observations cannot refer to them is perhaps excessive at this early stage.  If there is a zoning proposal on the agenda, the dogs on the street know about it.  It is excessive to exclude reference to it.  I can understand the thrust of this initiative but what motivates my amendment is the question of whether this goes too far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 15 proposes to delete the proposed amendment in the published Bill, which requires that in seeking initial views from the public on strategic issues to inform the initial preparation and drafting of the draft development plan, the planning authority can specify that it will not consider submissions or proposals related to the zonings of specific land.  Planning authorities must maintain strategic focus on the preparation of the draft development plan and, if they are drawn into considering specific proposals for the zoning of specific plans, they are exposed to losing sight of the strategic objectives.  Section 11(2) provides for focusing the scope of submissions or observations on strategic issues in preparation of the draft development plan.  It requires that submissions or observations are aimed at objectives and policies to deliver an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of an area of the development plan and that submissions for observations must not relate to a request for a proposal for the zoning of specific lands for any purpose.  It is the intention that the local authority will provide issue papers that will involve the public at the onset.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will those issue papers be published?  The Planning and Development Act 2000 refers to the notice given to the Minister, to other authorities, to adjoining planning authorities, to the board and other people and stipulates that it shall be published in one or more newspapers circulated in the area.  Should these issue papers be given wider circulation than simply making them available or uploading them to websites?  I do not denigrate the idea of using a website.  People are becoming used to monitoring what is happening in an area through websites.  The South Dublin County Council website is particularly good but I am sure others are very good.  I do not denigrate the approach but it is not enough for many people.  It is not noticed in the newspaper.  A bald notice in a newspaper to the effect that the authority is going to prepare a development plan is not enough when people have so much else on their minds and complexity in their lives.</P>
<Col N="518"/>
        <P>I will not press this amendment on Committee Stage and I will consider what the Minister of State says before possibly reintroducing it, or some version of it, on Report Stage.  Another point supports my proposal.  If we completely eliminate this approach, there will not be proposals for rezoning at this stage.  I accept that this should be the case.  Perhaps developers have been publicising a proposal and it may be discussed widely in an area.  Where there is a live proposal or a publicised intention to make an application for rezoning, one excludes any commentary by concerned citizens about this.  My worry is that this goes too far.  It is almost censoring any reference to the prospect of a rezoning application, concerns in respect of it or opposition to it.  That is excessive.  I agree with the basic thrust of the Minister of State&rsquo;s suggestion but to exclude anything about rezoning is excessive and may work against local residents and citizens.  My concern is that it will force discussions about zoning and informal discussions into a less transparent area.  There may be discussions and meetings taking place off-line rather than on-line.  That is my worry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my understanding that an advertisement will be placed in the public press, indicating that the issue papers are available from the local authority.  I am sure it will appear on the website as well.  Those who have an interest can get access to the issue papers.  Senator White has picked up on the same message we are trying to get across, namely, that there is public engagement from the very start.  It is better that there is a strategic overview first, rather than focusing on a particular piece of land to be zoned at an early stage of deliberation.  This is our intention and we hope it will work.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 22 are related and will be discussed together.</P></Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 16:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 11, lines 27 to 43, to delete paragraphs (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) in subsection (7)&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(i) by the substitution of the following for subsection(7)(<i>a</i>):</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) Subject to paragraphs (<i>aa</i>) to (<i>ad</i>) in a case where the proposed amendment would, if made, be a material alteration of the draft concerned, the planning authority shall, not later than 3 weeks after the passing of a resolution under subsection (6), publish notice of the proposed amendment in at least one newspaper circulating in its area and send notice and a copy of the proposed amendment to the Minister, the Board and the prescribed authorities.&rdquo;,</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(ii) by the insertion of the following paragraphs after paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (7):</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>aa</i>) In the performance of its functions under regulations made under section 10(5), the planning authority shall determine if there is, or may be, a requirement to carry out an assessment of the effects on the environment of one or more than one of the proposed amendments that would, if made, be a material alteration of the draft development plan.</P>
<Col N="519"/>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>ab</i>) The manager, not later than 6 weeks after a determination under paragraph (<i>aa</i>) shall specify such a period as he or she considers necessary following the passing of a resolution under subsection (6) as being required to facilitate an assessment referred to in paragraph (<i>aa</i>).</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>ac</i>) The planning authority shall publish notice of the proposed amendment and where appropriate in the circumstances, the making of a determination that an assessment referred to in paragraph (<i>aa</i>) is required, in at least one newspaper circulating in its area.</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>ad</i>) The planning authority shall cause an assessment referred to in paragraph (<i>aa</i>) to be carried out within the period specified by the manager under paragraph (<i>ab</i>).&rdquo;,</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(iii) in paragraph (<i>b</i>), by the substitution of &ldquo;A notice under paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>ac</i>) (inserted by <i>section 7 </i>of the <i>Act of 2009</i>)&rdquo; for &ldquo;A notice under paragraph (<i>a</i>)&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This proposes to provide for the notification of the Minister, the board and the prescribed bodies at the draft amendment stage of the development plan.  This is to rectify the anomaly that while the Minister, the board and the prescribed bodies are provided for as statutory consultees in the making of a draft development plan, it is only implicit thereafter that these should be consulted at the draft amendment stage.  A further amendment on Committee Stage will allow additional time for both the strategic environment assessment and habitats appropriate assessment of proposed material amendments to a draft development plan and to allow the manager to decide how much additional time is required to carry out such assessments rather than prescribing a specific additional period.  This will enable the authority to meet fully the requirements under EU directives.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 17 provides clarity that the resolution relates to any resolution as opposed to a specific resolution.  Amendment No. 22 is proposed as a consequential amendment to that proposed above to allow the discretion of a manager to decide on additional time for an assessment, to allow the existing timeframe of two years where no environmental assessment of proposed amendments is necessary and where such an assessment is necessary to allow a maximum of four months.  If appropriate in the circumstances it also provides flexibility to the manager to decide on a period of longer than two years or four months to facilitate such an assessment.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(other than a resolution accepting an amendment which has been approved by the Manager)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is concerned with a possible defect in the Bill&rsquo;s treatment of amendments to the development plan, which it proposes will require a two thirds majority.  Sometimes amend<Col N="520"/>ments are proposed by the manager and sometimes the manager will accept an amendment suggested by somebody else.  The effect of the Bill as it stands is that the manager&rsquo;s amendments will be defeated unless two thirds of members vote for them.  A case can be made that a simple majority would be more than adequate for amendments accepted by the manager.  The matter of amendments opposed by the manager is dealt with in a separate amendment.  The Bill as drafted seems to be quite bureaucratic and will make it very cumbersome to pass an amendment to which no one is opposed.  It cannot even be passed by acclamation because a roll call would be legally required to show that two thirds of the overall membership voted for it.  An issue seems to arise and the Minister of State might consider responding to it and addressing it.  Amendment No. 24 is on the same point.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;a vote of not less than two-thirds&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a majority&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Fine Gael tabled this amendment because we do not see why the existing legislation should be changed.  At present, a simple majority of the council can make a resolution to amend a development plan.  That is local democracy in action.  In this section, the Bill proposes that the passing of a resolution will take not less than two thirds of the members of the planning authority.  In his Second Stage speech, the Minister stated the Bill would strengthen local democracy and I agree that many measures in it do so.  However, we feel this section will strengthen a minority in a council and could create a minority rump that could hold up a development plan or amendment to it if it is not in agreement.  A simple majority of the council might be in full agreement with a plan or an amendment to it but will be outvoted if this measure is passed into legislation.  The existing legislation is more than adequate and reflects democracy in action as a simple majority of a council can pass a resolution to amend a development plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I fully support the amendments tabled by my colleague and the Labour Party on this.  Having one third, or less than one third, of a local authority dictating the planning policy of that local authority is undemocratic.  I see no problem with requiring two thirds for a material contravention but surely a simple majority is more than sufficient for drawing up a development plan for a particular local authority area.  It would reflect the democratic wishes of the people.  Seeking a two thirds majority for development plans is undemocratic and should be viewed as such.  People elect local authority members to act on their <Col N="521"/>behalf.  A majority of members elects a chairman and dictates much of the business of the council, therefore why in the case of a development plan, which is a reserve function of the members, is the Minister trying to dictate that we should have a two thirds majority instead of a simple majority?  Perhaps it suits his party, which has one or two members throughout the country.  What the Minister is proposing in this regard is a negation of democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues.  I am concerned about the possibility of a minority rump in a council determining the outcomes of these very important issues.  The rationale for having a two thirds majority as opposed to a simple majority is worth further debate in the House because it is one of the more important proposals in the Bill.  I am not stating that I could be persuaded by the Minister of State but I cannot exclude the possibility that I might be if he puts forward a strong enough argument on why he regards it as so necessary.  The Bill is good, the Labour Party supported it on Second Stage, the thrust of the legislation is progressive and correct and I believe the Labour Party will support the vast bulk of it.</P>
        <P>I am open to argument on this question but as Senators Coffey and Cummins stated, it is proposed to change the existing situation and as such the burden falls on the Minister of State to set out why it is so necessary to change such a significant provision in the planning Acts.  I am not excluding the possibility of the Labour Party being persuaded but it would require time, careful analysis and a careful explanation from the Minister of State.  It would be a significant change to how these decisions are made in local authorities.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Glynn.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for permitting me to the raise this important matter.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, who ably served as a Member of this House.</P>
<Col N="523"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to comment on the reduction in the number of acute beds in Mullingar Regional Hospital and indicate her intentions with regard to rewarding the most efficient hospitals in the country in the context of annual case mix adjustments.</P>
        <P>The status of Mullingar Regional Hospital is a major cause of concern to people in counties Longford and Westmeath, the staff and patients of the hospital and those who have worked diligently to make it one of the most efficient hospitals in the country in the context of the annual case mix adjustment.  There are major concerns that the Health Service Executive is pursuing a policy to downgrade the status of this fine hospital.  We have been informed that 41 acute beds are to be closed.  I am horrified that the decision to close these beds was taken without discussions with the consultant physicians charged with the care of patients.  Physicians, nurses and other staff are greatly concerned that the number of beds being closed is grossly excessive and disproportionate.  This decision will cause them immense problems in providing an acceptable level of care to patients.  I am appalled that the HSE failed to engage in discussions with hospital staff before making its decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are entering the winter months when more, not fewer, acute beds are needed.  It is beyond comprehension that the HSE plans to close 41 acute beds at such a critical time and in a hospital with regional status.  This is extraordinary behaviour and I fear the measure is part of a covert plan to downgrade a great hospital.  Mullingar Regional Hospital has been one of the top ranking, best performing hospitals in recent years.  In 2008 it broke even in terms of expenditure.  The staff of the hospital consistently achieve high standards of care and efficiency, a fact which the Minister for Health and Children and Health Service Executive have not acknowledged.  Instead, when the hospital was due to receive &euro;2 million because of its case mix efficiency, it received only &euro;500,000. I want to know why money due to Mullingar Hospital was diverted elsewhere.  I also want to know why the Minister and the HSE have failed to reward the hospital as promised.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children stood in this House and gave a commitment that the hospitals which performed best would be rewarded.  I call on her to stand by the commitment she gave here and for Mullingar Regional Hospital to be rewarded for being the most efficient hospital in Ireland and the second best hospital in terms of hygiene and cleanliness.  The high standards and excellent work in the hospital are a credit to Trevor O&rsquo;Callaghan and the administrative staff of the hospital</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are fortunate in Mullingar Regional Hospital to have a complement of consultant physicians including Professor Sean Murphy, and an excellent clinical director, Dr. Ron Charles, who, together with their respective teams, have set up a stroke unit and have a medical assessment unit which is admired by the midlands and treats more than 180 people per month.  This unit is visited by the staff of hospitals from all over the country.  Our consultants are also working hard to establish an intervention cardiology unit where services can be provided and stents inserted without patients having to travel to Dublin.  Where is the recognition for this commitment and hard work?</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s statement that 13 additional day beds are to be made available from Monday to Friday for elective procedures is absurd.  These 13 beds will be of no practical use to patients requiring emergency admissions.  As the population is increasing in midland areas and the hospital is adjacent to Dublin, and with the difficulties being experienced in counties Longford and Westmeath we should be increasing the number of acute beds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a former member of the health board, as was Senator Glynn, I and other colleagues including the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, got a categoric assurance from the Department of Health and Children when Longford Hospital closed that Mullingar Regional Hospital&rsquo;s services and facilities would be sacrosanct and suitable for a hospital serving two <Col N="524"/>counties.  This was a commitment made to the people of County Longford and I want to put on the record it is a commitment which we have not forgotten.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister to urge the HSE management team and relevant bodies to enter talks with the physicians, nurses and administrative staff in the hospital and endeavour to reach agreement on an allocation of acute beds which would be safer, fairer and which would satisfy the growing needs of the wider community.  I acknowledge the funding of &euro;20 million which has been given by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for the shelled-out building which stood for 12 years, which included funding of &euro;5 million for finishing and fitting out level O.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support this Adjournment matter.  I have spent more than 30 years in public life.  During all that time I have been active in defending the hospital and urging the powers that be such as the health board, of which I was a member for 23 years and chairman for two years, and the Minister for Health and Children, to ensure Mullingar Regional Hospital received due recognition for the great services it provide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a flagship hospital and one of the top three performing hospitals in the country.  Recently, following many complaints I received from people in the hospital and those living in Mullingar and Longford, I met with Professor Drumm in my office in Leinster House.  I urged him to come to Mullingar and meet the staff of the hospital, which he did.  At that time I asked him why Mullingar Regional Hospital had an allocation of X amount of euro but other hospitals which are performing below the standard of Mullingar in terms of output have a greater allocation.  His response was that the HSE wanted to bring the other hospitals to which I referred up to the standard of Mullingar and not bring it down to the standard of the other hospitals.</P>
        <P>All of the beds in the old hospital which was vacated have been moved into the newly fitted-out phase 2B shell.  Mullingar Regional Hospital had 220 beds and now has 199.  Included in the 220 beds were 11 day beds.  There are now 24 day beds.  This is linked to the practice of treating people on a day patient basis.</P>
        <P>I accept that Mullingar is not getting a fair crack of the whip.  In the past number of months the dermatologist left and went further afield because she did not get the resources with which she should have been provided.  I am pleased to inform the House there is now a temporary dermatologist in place who will be seeing current patients and a permanent post will be advertised shortly.</P>
        <P>I agree with what my colleague said.  I strongly endorse the great service provided by the physicians in the hospital, who are led by Professor Sean Murphy and Dr. Ron Charles, the clinical director, and by all the ancillary and back-up staff.  It must be remembered there is a moratorium on the recruitment of public sector staff.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the old hospital which has been vacated.  It might be a good story.  I strongly support Senator Cassidy and deplore the reduction of 21 beds and it should not have happened.  A central staff changing area, a laundry and distribution area will be provided and an area to provide stock for a top-up system which will make the stock management more efficient in order to save money will be established in the old hospital.  All of this relates to the non-pay sector.</P>
        <P>Ward 1 will be used as a mass vaccination site for administering the swine flu vaccine for the foreseeable future.  Ward 3 will be a diabetes day care centre to support the endocrinology service, a very important service.  I was responsible for a debate in this House on the levels of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  Ward 4 will be used to develop women&rsquo;s health, with particular <Col N="525"/>reference to foetal assessment, something which was looked for by Dr. Bates and other members of his team.</P>
        <P>I am less than satisfied with the manner in which Mullingar Regional Hospital has been treated.  It is a flagship hospital providing one of the top services in the country and performing at a level far above that of other hospitals which are receiving a greater allocation of money.  It is important that the beds which have been removed are replaced.  I accept we are in difficult times but Mullingar needs to be treated fairly and, in this case, it has not been.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy and Senator Glynn.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  The Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar provides an extensive range of quality-driven acute services to the population of Dublin, the midlands and, in particular, to people in the Longford and Westmeath area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased to say that the transfer of patients to the upgraded ward areas, which are part of phase 2B of the capital development at Mullingar, has been completed.  The total bed complement now comprises 158 inpatient beds, 24 day beds, six medical assessment unit beds and 11 observation unit beds, giving a total of 199 beds overall.  A key priority has been to move patients from the four old Nightingale wards in the 1930s building to the recently completed wards.  These wards are a major improvement in terms of the standard of care which can be afforded to patients.  The rationale behind the reconfiguration of inpatient beds to day beds involves encouraging a greater emphasis on the practice of day care medicine which forms part of the HSE&rsquo;s transformation programme.  The reconfiguration of the bed complement in the new hospital which will include a significant increase in the number of day ward beds will reduce the cancellation of inpatient elective surgical work at the hospital.  This will be done through the ring-fencing of day beds in the surgical ward for surgical procedures.  The reconfiguration will also facilitate the treatment of gynaecology patients at the hospital on a day basis.  The provision of additional day ward beds for such procedures will help to reduce the level of cancellation of inpatient gynaecology procedures at the hospital.  The reconfiguration will also increase the availability of medical day ward procedures in areas such as cardiac intervention and colonoscopies.  This will reduce the need for inpatient admissions to the hospital.  The reconfiguration will also increase the throughput of the existing medical assessment unit which has received much favourable comment.</P>
        <P>The revised bed complement has been fully endorsed by the consultant surgeons and obstetricians at the hospital.  In addition, the focus for the hospital, by agreement with all relevant consultant staff, is to increase the throughput of surgical and gynaecology work at the hospital.  The provision of additional day ward beds I have detailed will facilitate this increase in workload.  This approach is in line with the proposals at national level to increase the usage of day beds in our acute hospitals.  The current usage of day beds in Mullingar hospital is still behind the international norms for bed utilisation.  The adjustment in beds taking place will help to improve the situation, thereby making the hospital even more effective in providing care and treatment in the future.</P>
        <P>The increase in the provision of day beds will ensure the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar will treat more patients in 2010 than in 2009.  It should be noted that inpatient activity in the hospital to the end of September was 0.2% ahead of last year, while day case activity had increased by 6.2% year on year.  Hospital funding is linked with performance through the national Casemix programme which compares costs and activities across the 37 hospitals which participate in the Casemix budget model and reviews the allocation of over &euro;4.5 billion in acute <Col N="526"/>hospital funding.  The programme continues to be developed and rolled out in new hospitals as well as hospitals which are already within the programme.</P>
        <P>The budgetary allocation for the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar has increased significantly by 17.9% in the last four years, from &euro;54.8 million in 2006 to &euro;64.6 million in 2009.  The hospital has been recognised as one of the most efficient in the country in the context of the annual Casemix adjustment.  The increases I have mentioned include the positive Casemix adjustment figures in respect of each of the last two years.  The extra money gained by the hospital was &euro;2.01 million in 2008 and &euro;1.9 million in 2009.  I am confident the hospital will continue to provide the best possible quality of care for all its patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I am concerned about the treatment of people with intellectual disabilities or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome within our legal system.  Before the policy of mainstreaming was adopted, there was more of a tendency for children with mild intellectual disabilities to attend special schools, or special classes in mainstream schools.  Traditionally, such children were not able to avail of an automatic link to disability services when they reached the age of 18 years and left school.  As a result, a considerable number of young people with a mental handicap have fallen between two stools and lost contact with support services.  They tend to come to the attention of the authorities once more in their early or mid-20s.  Young men in such circumstances may experience legal difficulties within the criminal system, while young women in such circumstances may have to attend the family courts.  If a young woman with an intellectual disability has a child, concern might be expressed about the care of the child.  The authorities may seek to take the child into care without realising the woman has an intellectual disability.</P>
        <P>I would like speak specifically about those who come before the criminal law system.  Owing to their special needs, they often do not fully understand what is going on around them.  I have experience of people who have difficulty in understanding what their solicitors and barristers are saying.  Many do not reveal that they have an intellectual disability.  There has not always been as much awareness of Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome as there is now.  International research has shown that a number of individuals with undiagnosed Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome have been tried before the criminal courts and sentenced to imprisonment in mainstream prisons.  As a result, a trawl of the UK prison system has been undertaken in recent years to identify individuals with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.  Are any statistics available for the number of people with intellectual disabilities or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome in this country&rsquo;s mainstream prisons, or awaiting trial?  We do not have a special secure unit for individuals with intellectual disabilities or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.  When such persons go to trial and are found guilty, they are frequently sentenced to spend time in mainstream prisons such as Mountjoy Prison and Wheatfield Prison.  They find it extremely difficult to cope in such circumstances, as a result of their particular needs.  They are vulnerable to being bullied or picked on by other individuals.</P>
        <P>I recognise that as a civilised society, we face a significant challenge in identifying the supports we could put in place when people with specialised needs interact with the courts system.  I accept that people with mild intellectual disabilities or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome can face criminal charges for legitimate reasons.  If found guilty, it may be accepted that they should lose their freedom for some time.  In such circumstances, it is important for us to be able to provide <Col N="527"/>separate, secure and relatively safe facilities in which their specific needs can be met.  I suggest it may be possible to consider such a development in the context of the forthcoming major overhaul of our national forensic mental health services.  It may be possible to make provision for a secure unit, as other countries have done.  I emphasise that although I am speaking about individuals who come into contact with the law in the context of criminal law, it is important to note that we also need to meet the challenge of providing supports for people with intellectual disabilities who come before the family courts, or are victims of crime or abuse.  Such persons cannot access the courts unless the supports we make available to other vulnerable people such as children are made available to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Corrigan for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on the developments within the national forensic mental health service.  At the outset I should explain that statistics are not available regarding the number of people with an intellectual disability or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome who are at present in prison or awaiting trial.  As the Senator will be aware, the Irish Prison Service must accept all persons committed into its custody on foot of legal orders of the court.  A person committed to prison may have an intellectual disability, or have or develop a mental illness while in custody.  It is acknowledged that severe mental illness is more significant in the prisoner population than it is in the general population.</P>
        <P>However, if clinically appropriate, prisoners have access to a range of therapeutic services within the prison system including medical, nursing, psychiatric and psychological services.  In this regard the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, in particular the national forensic mental health service, work closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Irish Prison Service with a view to ensuring the necessary mental health interventions are available to prisoners.</P>
        <P>Under current arrangements the Central Mental Hospital provides 21 consultant-led in-reach forensic mental health sessions weekly in Arbour Hill, Cloverhill, Wheatfield, Mountjoy, the D&oacute;chas Centre, training unit, St. Patrick&rsquo;s, Portlaoise and the Midlands Prison.  In Cork, Limerick and Castlerea, specialist in-reach services are also in place for consultant led mental health sessions.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with special responsibility for disability and mental health, Deputy Moloney, is acutely aware of the limitations of the prison environment and is of the view that prisoners with a severe and enduring mental illness should be afforded care in the most appropriate setting.  In these circumstances he fully supports the use of the court diversion system to divert mentally ill people from the criminal justice system.  The Central Mental Hospital prison in-reach and courts liaison service is a multidisciplinary psychiatric service designed to assist District Courts in identifying defendants with mental illness and to provide practical solutions to accessing appropriate mental health care in the community.</P>
        <P>The diversion system ensures as far as possible that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the alleged offence reflects an underlying mental illness, are referred to local mental health services for appropriate treatment.  In 2008, some 91 persons were diverted in this manner to the mental health service.</P>
        <P>I commend the Central Mental Hospital on the huge strides it has made in developing the court liaison service and congratulate all concerned on the great achievement in winning the award for best hospital project at the Irish Healthcare Awards 2009 and the overall An Duais Mh&oacute;r trophy.  The service is a fine example of collaborative working.  It succeeds because all concerned co-operate effectively &mdash; the Garda, District Court judges, staff of the Irish Prison Service and staff of the forensic mental health service.</P>
<Col N="528"/>
        <P Just="Left">However, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, accepts the need to provide secure therapeutic facilities for some vulnerable persons with an intellectual disability or a mental disorder as not all cases are suitable for diversion to local services.  The Senator will no doubt be fully aware of the Government&rsquo;s proposals to redevelop the Central Mental Hospital.  While the Government originally approved the development of the new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, Dublin, that decision is currently under review.  Since the original decision was taken the HSE has identified a need for an intellectual disability forensic mental health unit along with a child and adolescent forensic mental health unit which should ideally be co-located with the Central Mental Hospital.  However, the 20 acre site at Thornton Hall is not large enough to allow for these additional developments.  As neither of the proposed new units would be viable as a stand-alone facility and the construction of these units at a location separate from the Central Mental Hospital would incur increased costs, the redevelopment of the hospital at an alternative site is currently under consideration and a decision is expected shortly.</P>
        <P>The decision to develop an intellectual disability forensic mental health unit is consistent with the recommendation in a Vision for Change &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, which recommends that a ten-bed residential unit with a fully resourced multidisciplinary mental health team should be provided for the care of intellectually disabled persons who become severely disturbed in the context of the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>I trust I have addressed the Senator&rsquo;s concerns regarding persons with an intellectual disability within the criminal justice system and I assure her that the Government is fully committed to the development of the national forensic mental health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.  I am pleased that an alternative site to Thornton Hall is being considered as the location for the Central Mental Hospital.  I also welcome the provisions being made for a child and adolescent forensic mental health unit, which will be very useful for those who suffer a disorder and become disturbed.  The Minister of State said that statistics were not available.  I remain somewhat concerned about people with an intellectual disability who do not become disturbed or do not have an accompanying mental disorder.  They may not be deemed to be eligible for admission to this new unit because they would not be disturbed.  I ask the Minister of State to consider a way in which we could gather statistics to establish how many people in the prison system have a mild intellectual disability or a high-moderate intellectual disability.  Further down the road it might be worth considering having a facility that would be appropriate for them.  This is very welcome.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  The matter I am raising falls under the responsibility of his Department and I know he is aware of the issue, which is the future of the O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens regeneration project.  This is one of the large-scale regeneration projects located across Dublin.  It is in central Dublin and was one of the lead public-private partnership projects that suffered enormous damage because of the difficulties experienced by a number of high profile builders approximately six to nine months ago.  As a result of the difficulty Dublin City Council, which is the lead authority for the area, needed to take <Col N="529"/>the plan back to the drawing board and develop a new plan based on the reality of the state of the property market and the economy in general.  It is now in the final stages of putting that new master plan together.  I believe the Minister of State has visited the area.  Even a brief visit reveals how desperately this community needs support and deserves a regeneration project to allow people to live in a safe and secure environment that can give them a decent quality of life.  Some of the experiences people there have are appalling.  The only way to turn it around for a good community full of decent people is through a regeneration project that gives them a decent standard of life and a decent place in which to live.  I have raised the matter previously with the Minister of State and will not dwell on it much longer.  Once this phase of the regeneration plan is completed and once the council and the community come up with a plan for the future which reflects the times in which we now find ourselves, will the Department have the money to fund it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Donohoe for raising this important issue.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to social housing supports the development of sustainable communities in existing local authority estates through various improvement and regeneration initiatives.  Regeneration is focused on addressing social, educational and economic disadvantage experienced in some of the most challenging areas of the country.</P>
        <P>My Department supports an ambitious regeneration programme for which Exchequer funding of &euro;190 million was allocated in 2009 alone, with projects ongoing in Dublin and other cities and towns throughout the State.  The scope of the projects varies significantly, depending on the size of the estates involved and the particular challenges of the areas concerned.  Regardless of scale, each project addresses not just the physical improvements to the estate but also facilitates vital social inclusion measures.</P>
        <P>In regard to the regeneration programme for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Dublin City Council is engaged in a process to decide the most appropriate type of regeneration proposal for the area and how the project should now be delivered.  I understand work has been under way in 2009 on the council&rsquo;s December 2008 master plan document.  The first phase of the project will be lodged as a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in accordance with section 175 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  An environmental impact statement will accompany the phase one submission and will assess that proposal and the cumulative impact of the overall master plan.  Work has commenced on the environmental impact plan and the environmental assessment of the master plan</P>
        <P>A scoping report will be submitted by the council to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in December 2009 in accordance with section 117 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Feedback from An Bord Plean&aacute;la is valuable at this stage of the project as it will allow any concerns to be addressed before an application is lodged.  The council is beginning a series of local area consultations from this evening to keep the on-site and adjoining residential community updated and to ascertain their views.  This consultation work is valuable to ensure the planning application, when lodged, can take appropriate account of significant issues raised by the residents and local community.  Dublin City Council is committed to this consultation process and will continue it at key milestones in the project.</P>
        <P>A series of briefings and consultations with all relevant stakeholders and Departments, including my Department, will be arranged shortly by Dublin City Council to show progress and the emerging plans for the site.  It will then be a matter for the council to prioritise the project in the context of its future social housing investment programme and to submit a formal proposal in the usual way to the Department for project approval and funding from within future annual funding allocations.

        <P>It was a source of regret to us all that the original public private partnership proposal for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens did not proceed.

I assure the Senator that I will afford this project priority within the Department&rsquo;s budget once it is submitted as a priority project by Dublin City Council.</P>
