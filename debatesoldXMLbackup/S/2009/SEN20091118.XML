        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are seeing a continuation of the confusion between the Government and the banks when it comes to exerting authority.  This is serious.  The Minister for Finance is struggling to exert his control.  We discussed these very matters during our debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009.  There is confusion over the cap on salaries and it appears that AIB has ignored the Minister&rsquo;s request that banking chiefs should not be appointed from the existing pool of directors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Serious questions arise regarding the Minister&rsquo;s authority and influence.  Taxpayers are investing &euro;54 billion in our banking system to make it function properly again.  Last week, we discussed whether the guidelines had any statutory weight but it now appears they are voluntary.  The small businesses and mortgage holders who followed the Cabinet&rsquo;s deliberations on whether money would be put aside for them must be concerned about the extent of the Minister&rsquo;s influence on AIB.  What faith can they have that action will be taken on the flow of credit and helping mortgage holders with negative equity if there is doubt on these two issues of principle, namely, the cap on pay and insider appointments?  I oppose the Order of Business and ask that the Minister come to the House today to discuss these critical issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment proposed to the Order of Business on holding a discussion on the relationship between the State and AIB.</P>
        <P>People are planning to go out on strike next Tuesday.  This is another nail in that coffin because they are saying that the Government is prepared to pay any amount of money to bankers while crucifying public servants once again.  The logic is irrelevant because that is how the matter is perceived.</P>
        <P>In regard to how this information entered the public arena, I have always maintained that the juicier the leak, the higher the source.  In my view this leak came from a very high political source.  The media predictably, incorrectly and ridiculously focused on the quantum when that was a secondary issue to the appointment of an insider to the position.  AIB can claim it is unable to find anybody else in the entire world to do the job and nobody can prove it wrong because there was no process for making the appointment.  The bank will now concede publicly to the Government in respect of the &euro;500,000 while offering its man a non-cash package to make up the difference.  The bank will get its man, he will get his money and the Minister will be sidelined.  Once again, the score will be banks one, people nil.  The only language the banks understand is pain.  If they are going to get what they seek, they must sign up to an agreement.</P>
        <P>I am aware the current situation is equally unacceptable to Government Members.  I ask my colleagues on the benches opposite to take a stand by accepting the proposed amendment to the Order of Business so Senators can go on the record and ordinary people can see how we feel about the issue.  What harm can it do?  It would be good for the Seanad and the Government.  We should be at one in finding a resolution and showing ordinary people that somebody cares for them.  The banks simply must be brought to heel on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to support the calls that have been made for a debate on the economy in advance of the Budget Statement.  Yesterday the Leader indicated his intention to schedule a debate for 1 December but perhaps we should also hold discussions next week.  My colleague, Senator Hanafin, was unhappy with my comment that I did not know whether <Col N="379"/>to laugh or cry at his suggestion to trade ideas about what to cut.  I am fortified in not taking his suggestion seriously by what happened yesterday in the other House.  It is clear the Government, perhaps correctly, has not the slightest intention of providing specific details on where it intends to find &euro;4 billion in savings.  To suggest that the Opposition would be invited to set out its detailed list prior to the Government doing so is to live in fantasy land because it is not going to happen.  On 9 December, the Minister for Finance will stand up in the D&aacute;il to set out his budget and when he sits down the Opposition spokespersons will make their responses.  If Opposition parties disagree with the Government regarding where the savings will be found, it is incumbent on them to explain what they would do instead.  However, the notion that we would engage in a trading exercise in which the Opposition would jump first is fanciful.  Let us be serious about the debate we want to hold, which should concern principles and vision.  Leadership is not just an accountancy exercise; it involves giving the entire community a vision for the future.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report suggested the abolition of the Law Reform Commission, which has brought forward proposals on reforming medical negligence claims to allow for an apology or other restitution from doctors.  I have direct professional experience of the effect that the incredible delays and enormous costs arising from medical litigation have had on the medical profession in terms of defensive medicine.  The commission&rsquo;s proposals should be considered.  The right to bring a case to court to seek compensation for injuries clearly should not be removed but the matter can also be addressed in other ways.  We have deliberated on similar reforms in the area of defamation.  The commission has performed an important public duty in this area of law reform and I agree with the T&aacute;naiste that many of the proposals contained in the McCarthy report simply do not make sense.  I suggest the abolition of the Law Reform Commission is one such proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to convey our best wishes to the Government&rsquo;s nominee to the European Commission, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, with whom I served in government.  She was the first Minister since Countess Markievicz to be appointed by Charlie Haughey in 1979.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>She acquitted herself extremely well.  She is from the west.  I am sure Senator Norris would agree that she was a very progressive Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We know she introduced legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Members should speak through the Chair to the Leader, not to other Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>She also acquitted herself very well in the European Court of Auditors.  However, <i>The Irish Times</i> is knocking her before she is even officially appointed.  That newspaper&rsquo;s articles are available on the Internet free of charge around the world.  It is a shame that one of our own is being knocked. This is akin to knocking the Irish soccer team as it prepares to play in Paris tonight.  Why are people knocking Ms Geoghegan-Quinn before she takes up her position?  As Ireland&rsquo;s nominee, she should be supported by Members, <i>The Irish Times</i> and all other newspapers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a free press. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Ms Geoghegan-Quinn will be a competent, able Commissioner.  Having worked with her in the House, I know she will excel in her work and I am confident she <Col N="380"/>will be successful.  She was the most decisive Minister one could meet.  She knew when to act and took difficult social decisions in all the Ministries she held.  I extend my best wishes to her and her husband and look forward to her appearing in the House.  I ask the Cathaoirleach and Leader to issue an invitation to her early next year to address the House on the important portfolio she will be given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter I raise was discussed in the House yesterday.  Following the comments made by Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole, it is more important than ever that the Minister for Finance clarify beyond doubt his position on all outstanding banking questions.  I understand a salary limit was imposed on the banks as part of the banking guarantee scheme passed into law in the Houses.  Is the limit being breached in the case of the insider appointed in the other major Irish bank?</P>
        <P>The State owns 25% of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland and is likely to own significantly more by the time recapitalisation is complete.  As Senators noted yesterday, the Minister&rsquo;s authority is an extremely important aspect of interaction between the State and banks as we rebuild confidence in the banking system.  Without such confidence, the economy will not function again properly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Questions about corporate governance arise from the apparent agreement on a person assuming a dual role in AIB.  One newspaper suggested this morning that this was a phoney war.  That such a suggestion has been made on such a serious subject brings the matter into disrepute.  It is crazy and the position must be clarified beyond doubt.  The Minister must, if necessary, have more public interest directors on the boards of the banks.  He must speak about the rationalisation and restructuring programme on which he has been silent recently.  I support calls for a debate on this matter.  Perhaps the Cathaoirleach will accede to our request and arrange for a debate to be held today.</P>
        <P>On another matter, the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 is languishing on the Order Paper.  It is a long time since the Second Stage debate was held.  When will Committee Stage be taken?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not intend to comment on the appointment of Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn as Commissioner.  However, as my friend and colleague, Senator Leyden, raised the issue and congratulated Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on her future appointment, as a close friend of Ms Geoghegan-Quinn who has been familiar with all aspects of her life, I, too, will comment.  As a person of great ability, Ms Geoghegan-Quinn will make a superb appointment and will do her job extremely well.  She has presence, superb academic ability and is in touch with all the leaders of the European Union member states.  I have great confidence that she will represent Ireland with panache and ability and will not let us down.  I hope and believe she will be given a good brief given her contacts with Commission President Barroso.  I wish her the best of luck.  I cannot allow Senator Leyden to assume the role of issuing an invitation to Ms Geoghegan-Quinn to visit the Seanad.  As a close friend, I would like to invite her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole in calling for a debate on a live and topical issue which the House should discuss.  I declare a personal interest inasmuch as I have been a customer of Allied Irish Banks for many years and know the people involved in this matter.  I was impressed by Mr. Ed Walsh&rsquo;s comment the other day that the Seanad <Col N="381"/>should be used to appoint successful business people to the Cabinet.  This has been done in the past and should be considered an option for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the United States few people would run for the position of Governor or Senator unless they had been successful in some other venture, probably in business.  Worrying about where to get money to pay employees&rsquo; wages at the end of the week is an important element of decision making.  I am concerned about the lack of balance in this regard, both in the Opposition and Cabinet.  Few members of the Opposition or Cabinet have ever had to worry about where they will get the money to pay wages at the end of the week.  Decision making would be much helped by having people with this type of experience.  As I stated, in the United States one usually requires experience or success before being appointed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the importance of previous success, I am concerned when it proves impossible to attract someone to a job paying a set salary.  We do not want the top jobs being taken by somebody or other; we want the best person.  In the case of Allied Irish Banks, the nominee for the position has achieved success, as the figures published today show.  I am concerned that this issue may be used as a political football.  We want the banks to succeed to ensure they advance money to small and medium-sized enterprises.  As taxpayers, we are owners of and investors in the banks and we want them to be profitable.  We do not want to support banks by requiring them to act in a manner which causes them to fail to make a profit.  I am worried that if we start to run banks in that manner, we will not act in the best interests of taxpayers.</P>
        <P>We cannot tax ourselves out of recession.  The Government is proposing to find &euro;4 billion through cuts to help return the country to its former position and tougher decisions will be required next year.  Let us not put these decisions on the long finger, procrastinate or delay.  Let us take tough decisions now and solve this problem much more quickly than would otherwise be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the comments of Senator Quinn and note the sensible observations he made on banking.  There is no doubt about the deficit of business experience on all sides in the Oireachtas.  This imbalance needs to be redressed and we must have an input from a sector which can play a constructive role in developing Government and public policy.  The Minister has recognised this requirement by availing of the advice of individuals with business expertise.</P>
        <P>We can get hung up on the issues which have arisen in the banking sector.  The only essential requirement in all of this is that we have the best possible prudential management of our banks to ensure they extricate themselves from the severe difficulties being experienced by the banks and, as a consequence, the country.  That is the priority and any action the Minister takes in this regard should be supported.  We should not allow this matter to become a political football.</P>
        <P>The Leader has promised an early debate on budgetary issues.  I believe such a debate should be held next week rather than the week after next.  Many Senators justifiably take satisfaction from the quality of debates in this House.  Someone in the debates section who had observed All Stages of the debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill in both Houses told me that the Second Stage debate in this House superseded anything that took place elsewhere.  The House can repeat this in the debate on the budget.</P>
      
        <P>I listened yesterday to the debate in the D&aacute;il, especially the contributions from the Opposition.  We have a responsibility because we are paid by the taxpayer to bring to bear whatever experience we have to influence the policies the Government takes on budgetary matters.  That responsibility also applies to the Opposition and some of its contributors pretended they had <Col N="382"/>ideas but hid behind not disclosing them in the interests of political partisanship.  It is a foolish approach and will be recognised by people, and will bring no credit to the Houses or the parties involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Quinn.  Some very interesting and good Ministers could be appointed to the Cabinet if we took the opportunity to appoint people from outside or inside this House and elevated them to such roles.  It is something which is done in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Gordon Brown has elevated many people from the world of business to the House of Lords and then taken them into his Cabinet.  There are many individuals such as Michael O&rsquo;Leary and Ivan Yates whom it would be very interesting to see getting on in Cabinet with people like the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I am sure they would help to generate new ideas.  I would hate to see Senator Quinn join them but as one of the most successful businessmen in the country, I am sure a space could be found for him at the Cabinet table and that he would perform very well.  I ask the Leader to consider raising this matter with his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also wish to raise the issue of our overseas development aid budget.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today noted that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, returned from a meeting yesterday and announced a commitment we entered into in 2005 as part of the European consensus on development pact means that we have to provide 0.51% of GDP for development aid next year.  We are currently below that level but the Minister of State, Deputy Power, said our contribution needs to rise if we are to meet our commitment, a comment I am grateful to him for making.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, for his views on this commitment and whether he will meet the obligations we entered into and ensuring the aid budget reaches its target of 0.51% of GDP by next year and come back to the House as soon as possible with his answer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I revert to the issue of a cap on the pay of banking executives.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan attempted to explain the sequence of events regarding the cap on the pay of the new chief executive or managing director of AIB.  He said when he was informed of the matter he made no decision on it and, as any Minister for Finance would do in the circumstances, he brought it to the attention of his colleagues in Government yesterday morning.  Why does the Minister need to bring a matter to Cabinet in regard to his guidelines, if there are guidelines in place and a cap on the executive pay of bank officials and senior executives?  Is it not normal that a Minister, if he is going to take up the time of a Cabinet meeting, would come with a recommendation?  It would seem the Minister went to the Cabinet yesterday with recommendations on the person to be appointed as managing director and the pay of &euro;633,000.  I find the explanation of the Minister for Finance on how this matter emerged yesterday entirely unconvincing.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise an issue concerning the Department of Transport and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, namely, a bus service between Dalkey and the airport.  It is a matter which I raised previously in this House.  The Patton Flyer is an excellent bus service which was set up in 2007.  It applied for a bus licence to operate on the route under the Road Transport Act 1932 but no decision was made on the granting of a licence.  We now have a situation whereby another operator has been granted a licence for the same route.  Something is not right about this situation and there is skulduggery in the way the Patton Flyer is effectively being run off the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.  I ask that the Minister come to the House and explain the situation.  A new licence was granted in record time to another operator and a local businessman who took the initiative of setting up this excellent service has been done down by the Minister for Transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my call for a rolling debate on the economy which would obviate the situation which happened here again today, namely, that the entire Order of Business is distorted by legitimate concerns about the economy.  While I agree with much of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, I do not agree that the matter of quantum may not be as relevant as it might appear to be.  It is extremely relevant when a group of people inside the discredited banks believe that &euro;500,000 is not enough income for a year in a period when we are cancelling the Christmas bonus, introducing prescription charges for people on medical cards and have a strike next Tuesday.  It will not calm matters.  The same bank announced it underestimated by &euro;1 billion the write-off of its current bad loans.  What does that say about the Government&rsquo;s figures for NAMA?</P>
        <P Just="Left">A major property developer whom I will not name said at the launch of Fintan O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s book yesterday that the Government&rsquo;s figures are off the wall.  I put on the record the views of Mr. Peter Matthews.  He has communicated with me since and believes he was seriously misrepresented by the Minister and, perhaps inadvertently, the House was misled.  I have seen his figures, which seem to be perfectly clear, and state &euro;77 billion is made up of &euro;30.8 billion in performing loans and &euro;46.2 billion in non-performing loans.  If one gets every single penny of the &euro;33.8 billion and 25% of the other figure, there will be an overshoot of some &euro;11 billion, a bill with which the taxpayer will be hit.  That is a generous series of figures and does not take into account the roll-up of bank interest or the fact that there are a large number of property loans under &euro;5 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In those circumstances, I ask the Leader if he will invite Mr. Peter Matthews, who is a person of sufficient significance that the Minister for Finance had a lengthy meeting with him, into the House.  As he feels he has been misrepresented in this House and the House has been misled, it is important to invite him into the House, which is provided for under Standing Orders, and allow Members to have a question and answer session so we can be fully informed as to the real situation.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise a very serious issue, namely, the fact there is an exclusion from the Health Research Board which is the database which covers research and disability services in Ireland.  It is independent and there are details of 25,600 people on the national intellectual disability database and 29,500 people on the national physical and sensory <Col N="385"/>disability database, which was established in 2002.  People with autistic spectrum disorders are not included on the national physical and sensory disability database, however.  A database of such information is needed.  I suggest that a question should be included in the census so we can have an idea of exactly how many children in this country have been diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum.  That would help us to organise the provision of services.  The manner in which we are dealing with children with autism seems to be sporadic, from both a diagnostic and a management point of view.  It differs in all parts of the country.  We need to compile a comprehensive plan setting out how we will deal with these children.  We should know exactly how many of them there are.  The paediatric and education services should work together to establish how many children we are dealing with and what kind of procedure we need to put in place for them.</P>

	<P>The UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Mr. Ed Miliband, recently announced that ten new nuclear power facilities are to be developed in that country.  Some of the proposed sites are on the west coast of England, which would pose dangers for the east coast of Ireland.  Two of the ten new nuclear plants are in Cumbria, which is very close to this country.  I have a difficulty with the UK Government&rsquo;s vague explanation of how it will deal with nuclear waste from these facilities.  No provision for nuclear waste seems to have been outlined in Mr. Miliband&rsquo;s announcement.  I am aware that new technology is evolving in the nuclear sphere.  I agree with Mr. Tom McGurk, who said in a newspaper article last Sunday that we already have nuclear power in Ireland, in effect, because we are so close to some of the nuclear power stations in Britain.  We have the same level of risk we would have if we had nuclear power in this country.  We need to open a debate on nuclear power.  I ask the Leader for a debate in this House on the siting of nuclear power plants in parts of the west coast of England that are close to Ireland.  We should discuss the vagueness of the relevant authorities in providing for nuclear waste to be dealt with.  The level of nuclear waste that is currently going into the Irish Sea will increase tenfold.  We need to debate this serious situation, which has passed under the radar in this country.  The Government has not been sufficiently strong in its dealings with the British Government in this regard.  I would not oppose a debate on the possibility that we may be ready to embrace nuclear power very soon, as science evolves.  As things stand, however, the serious matter of nuclear waste needs to be discussed.  All views need to be brought to the table.  If this House is to be relevant, it should deal with this issue soon.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a serious issue.  It is time the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government came to the House to discuss the delays in paying student grants.  I have been in contact with a student in Cork who has been living in a car for nine weeks.  I am aware of the case of a student in Galway who was allowed by the college to repeat his exams on medical grounds after he required surgery, but was not given a grant for this year.  The colleges&rsquo; welfare officers have given me information about these cases.  I have heard about a student mother who is having to live off free food so that she does not starve.  She is using her welfare payments to feed her children.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, must address the untold hardship that is being caused by the delay in paying grants.  It seems that <Col N="386"/>local authorities will not have the money to make grant payments until January.  It is not fair on the students, it is leading to drop-outs and it is increasing poverty and stress levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Can the Leader clarify whether the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is proposing to withdraw child benefit from Irish children in the forthcoming budget, while continuing to pay child benefit to foreign children who do not reside in Ireland?  I understand that back payments have been made in some cases, to cover each child&rsquo;s entitlement since the day his or her parents started to work in Ireland.  It would be grossly unfair if the Minister were to take such action in the budget.  Child benefit has been a poverty proofing measure.  We know from this country&rsquo;s history that the wives and partners of certain high profile people with large incomes have had to depend on child benefit payments to feed their children.  I would like the Leader to answer the question I have asked.  I would have a huge issue with any proposal to make Irish children take second place behind children who live outside this State.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are facing a serious set of circumstances.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to explain to the House how the maintenance of roads, drains, ditches and undergrowth will be funded in the months to come.  We are now in November &mdash; one can imagine what the roads will be like in April or May, following a winter of rain, frost and snow.  Councillors are struggling with local authority budgets.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, are abdicating their responsibility to maintain our roads.  This is a matter of extreme importance.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should come before the House to explain his position as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Healy Eames on the issue of student welfare.  I hope she does not think I have trivialised the issue, as that is not the case.  I asked the Leader yesterday when the Student Support Bill would be brought before the House.  Many students and their families are living from hand to mouth on a daily basis because they have not received their grant payments and are therefore unable to pay their weekly rents.  Some students are opting out of college for that reason.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as a matter of urgency.</P>

Members of the Opposition have been very kind this morning in recognising that Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn is a woman of great vision, integrity and high intelligence.  Most importantly, she is a very hard worker.  Over the years, she has proved that she has such good characteristics.  I wish her well.  I do not doubt that she will bring great esteem, respect and honour to our nation.  I am sure she will be given a good and weighty portfolio.</P>
        <P>When does the Leader intend to bring the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health issues, Deputy Moloney, to the Chamber?  The Joint Committee on Health and Children had an excellent engagement with the Minister of State at its meeting yesterday.  Perhaps the Leader will try to ensure the Minister of State comes to the Chamber soon, if <Col N="387"/>possible, to discuss mental health issues, including child and adolescent psychiatry and adult psychiatry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in welcoming the appointment, for the first time, of a woman Commissioner by the Taoiseach.  As others have said, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn is a person of immense ability and has a great track record.  While I am delighted that a woman has been appointed, I have to say I am sorry it is a Fianna F&aacute;il woman.  I think she will do a very good job.  I hope this House can have a more general debate on women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  Perhaps the new Commissioner could be invited to address the House on that topic.  I remind Senators that M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn came to Leinster House last December, at my invitation, along with many of her former colleagues from both Houses who are women.  Indeed, many current women Members of the Oireachtas were also in attendance.  We had a great day during which we filled nearly half the Chamber with women representatives.  I would like to see a debate in this House on women&rsquo;s participation &mdash; Senator McDonald called for it last week &mdash; particularly on foot of the report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights that recently made an all-party recommendation for various changes to enable more women to be represented in politics.  I ask the Leader for an early debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Feeney I ask for a debate on mental health.  I saw the newspaper report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which was advised by the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, that the Central Mental Hospital would be moving to a new site, the announcement of which would be made early in the new year, but that this new site would not be at Thornton Hall.  On many previous occasions I have asked for a debate on prisons and particularly what would happen with Thornton Hall.  I have been assured many times that every aspect of the Thornton Hall development would go ahead.  I am delighted the Central Mental Hospital will not be moving to Thornton Hall.  It was always regarded as inappropriate that a central mental hospital would be in a prison complex.  However, we need to have a debate on what will happen with the Central Mental Hospital and with those in the prison population who have mental health issues.  As colleagues know, Professor Harry Kennedy, the director of the Central Mental Hospital, will speak in the AV room at noon at my invitation facilitated by the Irish Penal Reform Trust to discuss mental health in prisons.  It is a very important issue given the high level of mental illness among prisoners and given the question mark over the future of the Central Mental Hospital.  I ask the Leader for a debate on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Reilly in calling for a debate on the nuclear issue, a matter previously raised in the House by Senator Quinn.  I ask the Leader for a general debate on the matter, which would be very useful given that we are in a nuclear area.  There are new facilities for nuclear reactors to be much safer, where the irradiated material is held in steel spheres.  It is even possible to shut down the cooling reactor and there is no meltdown.  That being the case it is time for us to have that debate and keep it in the context of clean energy, nuclear energy and what the way forward is now.</P>
        <P>I ask for clarification from the Leader about our role within Europe.  We get many benefits from Europe.  We also have responsibilities that are legally binding.  One of the responsibilities includes allowing people from countries abroad to come here and get work.  It is not good for any politician, particularly senior politicians, to be saying that they should be sent home after a few weeks if they do not have the means to support themselves.  That is unacceptable today.  Clearly people should be aware of the laws regarding the rights people have by virtue of our membership of the European Union and the rights to social welfare in other countries by virtue of ministerial orders that implement EU directives.  It is as simple as that.  We do not have discretion in this matter.  However, we trade at a rate of &euro;85 billion a year and our imports are <Col N="388"/>in excess of &euro;60 billion.  We gain a huge advantage by trading with these countries.  Naturally we would like to pick what is best for ourselves and not to have what does not suit us.  However, we signed up for it and we must comply.</P>

	<P>I join many colleagues in congratulating our new Commissioner on her nomination to her new role.  I wish her the best of luck.  The comments made here this morning and the commentary in the media about our new Commissioner tell a story about our relationship with Europe.  When any European job is to be filled, there is considerable media and political interest in it.  Today&rsquo;s newspapers are full of speculation about who might be doing what and so on.  However, when those jobs are filled that interest in Europe recedes and the interest in what those people are doing and the jobs they are meant to be doing recedes, and an information gap develops.</P>

In so doing no doubt she will do very well for our country.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on banking here this afternoon.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct in what he says.  I am asking myself whether this entire thing is not a set-up.  Is he not correct in saying that the contours of what will happen are already apparent?  The bank will get who it wants at a lower salary.  It will appear chaste and humbled in front of the nation, but it will have got what it wants.  It will have got an insider appointment and the corporate governance principles it wants.  This issue of how much the person is being paid is a smokescreen to that bigger agenda.</P>

        <P>On a serious matter, we have had very robust debates on many different issues at Oireachtas committees in recent weeks.  I feel we are lacking something in this Chamber.  Other than on the Order of Business, when we come to discuss the serious issues in our society, the debates are somewhat flat and there is no dialogue or engagement with the Minister.  All we can do is make a statement and there is no discussion between the Minister and Senators.  To some extent the Oireachtas committees are getting better and we need to get our act together to be innovative and have proper dialogue on the social and economic issues in our country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the top issues, which I mentioned last year, is the interim report of the National Social and Economic Forum chaired by Dr. Maureen Gaffney on child literacy and social inclusion.  The report highlighted that one in three children in disadvantaged areas has serious literacy problems.  In the 21st century the importance of literacy cannot be overstated.  It opens the door to education, economic and health benefits for the individual and for society as a whole.  Not only does it affect the children who are illiterate, but also their children.  I would like to have a proper discussion and dialogue between the Minister for Education and Science and ourselves here in the Seanad on this serious social issue.  One in three children leaves national school with serious literacy problems.</P>

Only yesterday we spoke about the good news about the decline in the number of road deaths and then overnight we received the sickening news of four young women on a road I know very well being struck down in the prime of their lives.  At a time when they should be enjoying life and profiting from their studies, they are no more and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones this morning.  We all need to refocus on the need to go easily and safely on the roads, particularly in the bad weather conditions we are experiencing at the moment and will have in coming months.</P>
        <P>The happy news is M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn&rsquo;s appointment.  It is good to see bean mhaith, Gaelg&oacute;ir, bean stuama appointed to the post of European Commissioner.  I am not sure whether it does her any service for the Taoiseach to say that the gender balance requirement influenced the choice.  I have significant concerns regarding those types of gender balance considerations.  We should certainly encourage maximum participation by both genders in politics, but I wonder whether anybody&rsquo;s credibility is served where gender is a factor in his or her appointment.  Ms Geoghegan-Quinn has talent aplenty to perform this role without reference to her gender.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Hannigan for raising the issue of overseas development aid.  Last week the Taoiseach noted that Ireland has been commended by the United Nations on our commitment in this area.  However, the reality is that our overseas development aid allocation as a percentage of GDP has been reduced through swingeing budget cuts.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, deserves credit for bringing forward an interim commitment to achieve a target of 0.51% by 2010, which will require an increase in our current percentage contribution.  Not only should there be no further reductions in our overseas aid commitment but our allocation should be ramped up.  Notwithstanding our domestic troubles, we must not forget the truly parlous circumstances in which many people throughout the world are living.</P>

        <P>At yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, turf cutters from Westmeath, Roscommon, Galway, Mayo and elsewhere explained why they have such an axe to grind with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  We had a meeting with representatives of that service some time ago and it seems clear that people who want to cut turf for their own use, and who are not exceeding the 10% threshold, are not getting a fair deal.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a debate on this matter?  What is happening is absolutely unjust and the lack of communication is entirely unsatisfactory.  One particular councillor who was part of the delegation gave an example of an advertisement being placed in the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>, which is not a newspaper that circulates to any great extent in the south of that county, which is where the turf cutters he represents are from.  I ask the Leader to arrange that debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>

Four of the victims were young women in their 20s who died in an accident on the N17 in County Galway.  The reduction in road deaths was acknowledged in the House yesterday but this accident is a tragic reminder that we must continue to focus on the condition of our roads and road safety in general.  I support Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s call regarding the resourcing of our national, regional and secondary roads and ask for a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I share other speakers&rsquo; concerns regarding developments at Allied Irish Banks in recent days.  The appointment of senior managers from within the organisation, despite the concerns and wishes expressed by the Minister for Finance, smacks of arrogance.  Today we are informed of the sudden increase in the bank&rsquo;s bad debts from a previous estimate of &euro;4.3 billion to &euro;5.3 billion.  Where does this leave the Government&rsquo;s projections in respect of the National Asset Management Agency?  It is strange that these appointments and announcements, which affect our economic reputation both at home and abroad, are made the week after the NAMA legislation was passed by the Oireachtas.  The Government and the banks must be up-front with the public because the decisions they are making will have a knock-on effect on everybody&rsquo;s economic prospects.</P>

However, I will endeavour to facilitate a debate as soon as possible and certainly before 1 December.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has excelled since taking over the finance portfolio at a very difficult time.  He clarified his position in a straightforward fashion when he indicated on the late television news last night that nobody in the banking sector will be paid more than &euro;500,000.

        <P>Senator Alex White spoke about medical claims and referred to the report by the Law Reform Commission.  I was surprised to hear him call for the abolition of that body.</P>

	<P>I have always held the commission in high regard.  I apologise if I misunderstood the Senator, particularly the last part of his contribution.  I have no difficulty in setting time aside to discuss the issues he has brought to the attention of the House.</P>
        <P>I will get back to Senator Coghlan regarding the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009.  As I said, Senator Quinn made an outstanding contribution on banking issues.  Senators Hannigan and Mullen referred to the views expressed by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, regarding overseas aid.  We have been international leaders in terms of our commitment to overseas aid.  I am certain the Government will do all it can in the current very difficult circumstances to ensure the greatest possible allocation is made available to assist those most in need in developing countries.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan, Buttimer, Mullen and Coffey called on the Minister for Transport to address the bus service between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.  Senator Regan outlined his experiences and I will convey his views to the Minister later.  On behalf of the House, I appeal to all motorists, given the inclement weather forecast for this week.  Roads are badly flooded.  As I drove to Leinster House earlier, the speed to which some motorists were pushing their cars was unbelievable.  I call on everyone to reduce their speed to 100 km/h at least, particularly in <Col N="392"/>this bad weather, to give themselves a chance and protect everyone else using the roads.  It is a difficult time and, as many colleagues said, the weather forecast for this week is appalling.  I experienced difficult conditions travelling to Dublin earlier; therefore, motorists should slow down.  Taking five minutes extra would still get us all to our destinations on time.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast referred to the database that excludes autism sufferers.  I will convey her views to the Minister for Education and Science and will have no difficulty in scheduling a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Hanafin raised concerns about the ten new nuclear sites proposed in the United Kingdom and called on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come to the House for a debate.  This is a good idea and a timely call for a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Healy Eames and Buttimer called for student grants to be made available sooner.  They asked for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to address the difficulties being experienced by students in these tough times and the delays in making grant payments.  I will convey their views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to child benefit payments and the budget.  There will be a pre-budget debate in the House on 1 December, during which I ask the Senator to bring the issue to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  I will also convey her views following the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators Feeney and Bacik have called on the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, to update the House on the good work he is doing and the progress he is making on mental health issues and the issues they raised.  I will have no difficulty in providing time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin raised the issue of our role and rights within the European Union.  He has stated that when we sign up, we must comply.  That says it all in a nutshell.  I will have no difficulty in arranging a debate on European affairs at a future date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Buttimer called on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House for a debate on roads funding.  That is a worthy call and I will ensure this happens at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White has referred to the interesting debates that take place at select committee meetings.  The toing and froing between Members and Ministers on Committee Stage at select committee meetings is the same as on Committee Stage in the House.  I agree with her that this is the most interesting Stage in the passage of a Bill through both Houses.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on turf cutting and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  With only 10% of bogs used for turf cutting, this would be a timely debate.  It is a major problem in the midlands and while turf can be cut anywhere with a sle&aacute;n, other turf cutting methods, including sausage machines, are creating a difficulty.  I will try to arrange a debate on the matter before Christmas, if possible.</P>

    <Title>Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the Seanad and thank Members for agreeing to take it at short notice.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill which gives effect to the provisions of the national declaration on the Lisbon treaty relating to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in certain activities of the European Defence Agency, EDA.  It also puts in place approval procedures for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in permanent structured co-operation.  It introduces the requirement for prior approval of the Govern<Col N="394"/>ment and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for participation by Ireland in certain projects run by the EDA and permanent structured co-operation.  In accordance with the terms of the national declaration, it also provides that any participation must be for the purposes of enhancing capabilities for UN mandated missions for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  The Bill also introduces a triple lock mechanism in relation to any decisions regarding Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these initiatives.  This is similar to the triple lock we have for the deployment of Defence Forces personnel on peacekeeping operations overseas.  As is the case in regard to all defence issues within the European Union, any decision by Ireland to participate in the projects of the EDA or in permanent structured co-operation remains fully and completely within Ireland&rsquo;s control.  Also, participation in either will not affect Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.</P>
      
        <P>The Bill provides that participation in EDA projects and in permanent structured co-operation can only take place where the Government is satisfied that such participation will enhance capabilities for UN mandated missions.  Under the Bill, any decision by the Government must be endorsed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Before I outline the provisions of the Bill, as useful background information I would like to outline briefly the EU&rsquo;s role and that of the EDA in the development of capabilities and provide Members with an overview of permanent structured co-operation.  The EU is developing a range of capabilities and capability standards to support the EU in deploying military capabilities in support of the Petersberg Tasks.  As Members are aware, the Petersberg Tasks are an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s European security and defence policy, ESDP.  They cover humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The European Defence Agency was established under a joint action of the Council of Ministers on 12 July 2004, during the Irish Presidency &ldquo;to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future&rdquo;.  The EDA affords EU member states the opportunity to keep track of best practice in modern technology in the development of capabilities.  This process is designed to address and overcome shortfalls in capabilities.  Such shortfalls could impede the efforts of EU member states to achieve the capacity to undertake appropriate crisis management missions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has participated in the framework of the agency since its establishment.  It is important to note that participation in the framework of the EDA imposes no specific obligations whatever on or, indeed, commitments by Ireland other than a contribution to the budget.  This is used to fund the agency&rsquo;s day-to-day operating expenses.  Participation in the EDA means that Ireland has access to research and information on developing and maintaining professional capabilities and research that we cannot self-generate.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s objectives in participating in the agency is to achieve economies of scale in defence procurement and to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, especially as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  It is vital to the protection of our troops when they are deployed on UN mandated peacekeeping operations that the Defence Forces have access to the latest developments in these fields.  My primary concern as Minister for Defence is that we can provide the best protection possible for our troops.</P>
        <P>Since 2007, Ireland has participated in the joint investment programme on force protection run by the EDA.  This project is an important enabler in the development of technologies to <Col N="395"/>protect troops from threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised explosive devices.  Body armour, sensors and systems to counter explosive devices are key elements of the programme.</P>
        <P>As part of the EDA&rsquo;s annual work programme we are also involved in ongoing work on defence against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear explosives threats; improved communications systems for use on the ground in operations; health and medical support for EU military operations; and the development of improved counter-improvised explosive devices.  This is a capability that enables military forces operate safely in an environment where such devices are present.</P>
        <P>In regard to permanent structured co-operation, this simply allows for a group of member states to come together under the EU umbrella to make available to the Union higher-end capabilities for the more demanding EU operations.  It is not clear at this stage how permanent structured co-operation might work as no such arrangements currently exist.  However, it could be the case that a number of member states may come together to provide the Union with, for example, large aircraft or helicopter transport capabilities.  Permanent structured co-operation could also facilitate the sharing or pooling of assets like helicopters.  This would eliminate duplication and allow these capabilities to be made available more economically for ESDP operations.</P>
        <P>For Ireland, the important thing is that any participation in permanent structured co-operation arrangements will be entirely voluntary and the legal guarantee puts this beyond any doubt.  As I already stated, it is not clear how this operation will work in practice.  However, this is an issue which will be discussed in greater detail at appropriate level in the EU where Ireland can ensure its values and principles are fully represented.</P>
        <P>Member states recognise that they have an obligation to ensure their troops have the necessary capabilities when serving on ESDP crisis management operations.  As such, member states&rsquo; participation in permanent structured co-operation arrangements and EDA projects is a mechanism to ensure these capabilities are available.  Member states working together within the EU can do this more effectively.</P>
        <P>The Bill recognises that Ireland already participates in the framework of the agency and notes the purposes for which it was established.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the framework of the agency is not subject to the provisions of the Bill.  The main provisions are contained in sections 2 and 3.  Section 2 deals with Ireland&rsquo;s participation in projects or programmes established under articles 20 and 21 of the joint action establishing the agency.  Section 3 deals with Ireland&rsquo;s participation in permanent structured co-operation.</P>
        <P>Section 1 is a standard provision in regard to the terms mentioned in the Bill.  It sets out definitions for the Council joint action establishing the European Defence Agency, the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty of Lisbon, and United Nations mandated mission which, as outlined in the guarantees, is authorised by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>Section 2(1) provides that participation by Ireland in projects and programmes established under articles 20 and 21 of the joint action will be subject to prior Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval.<b>  </b>Article 20 of the joint action allows for the establishment of a project or programme which shall presume general participation by the participating member states unless a member state specifically opts out of so doing.  Article 21 of the joint action allows for the participation of a group of interested member states to come together to establish, finance and develop specific projects of mutual interest which are within the remit of the agency.</P>
        <P>Section 2(2) requires that the Government should only approve participation if it is satisfied that such participation will contribute to enhancing capabilities for UN mandated missions for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with <Col N="396"/>the principles of the United Nations Charter.  The text of the provision is drawn directly from the national declaration by Ireland annexed to the Lisbon guarantees.</P>
        <P>Section 3(1) provides that any decision enabling Ireland to participate in permanent structured co-operation shall require the prior approval of the Government and the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The national declaration by Ireland on permanent structured co-operation does not contain a similar UN qualification to that pertaining to the EDA.  It seemed to me that the arrangements in regard to permanent structured co-operation should be consistent with the arrangements for participation in EDA projects.  I have, therefore, included the qualification that participation in permanent structured co-operation will contribute to enhancing capabilities for UN mandated missions for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security.  This qualification is set out in section 3(2).  Section 4 sets out the Short Title.</P>
        <P>European security and defence policy is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy.  This encompasses the EU&rsquo;s international obligations in regard to the maintenance of international peace and security.  Military capabilities are but one element among a wide range of instruments which the EU can deploy in this regard which include economic, political, administrative, rule of law, etc.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in UN mandated peacekeeping operations is undertaken within the framework of the EU&rsquo;s European security and defence policy.  This is a continuation of our long and honourable tradition of support for multilateral arrangements in the maintenance of international peace and security.  While military capabilities are but one element among a wide range of instruments which the EU can deploy in its international obligations in regard to the maintenance of international peace and security, it is a very important element.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Defence, I am committed to ensuring we can contribute effectively to UN mandated operations.  I am also committed to ensuring the Defence Forces have the best protection and the best equipment possible for participation in UN mandated operations.  In this regard, where an EDA project or a permanent structured co-operation arrangement has the potential to assist in the enhancement of capabilities for UN mandated operations, then I will consider the merit of such a project or arrangement in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s participation.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Defence.  Before I speak on the Bill, I wish to be associated with the congratulations to a former Member of the D&aacute;il, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, on her appointment as European Commissioner.  I wish her the best of luck.  I have no doubt that with her experience as a politician, a former Minster and a member of the European Court of Auditors, she will have no problem carrying out a great job for this country.</P>
        <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the families of the four young girls killed in a tragic road accident on the Mayo-Galway border yesterday.  I to express my deepest sympathy to their families.</P>
        <P>I welcome this short Bill which Fine Gael supports.  There are two main parts to it, one covering procurement and research and design and the other State participation in programmes of permanent structural co-operation.  I note from speeches the Minister has made that the triple lock mechanism provided for in the Bill is consistent with the policy position of the Government on the deployment of Defence Forces personnel on peacekeeping operations overseas.  There is no change in that respect.  The other two basic issues are covered in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members of the Defence Forces who have participated in peacekeeping missions overseas have done magnificent work for many years, the latest mission being to Chad where conditions have been very difficult.  We have paid a hefty price through the loss of life and injuries sustained by personnel in our peacekeeping forces.  It is only correct, therefore, that the best <Col N="397"/>equipment be made available and that our Defence Forces receive the best possible training and advice.  We all agree with this.  I thoroughly agree that they should receive training and have such equipment at their disposal, however that will be done.  It is not clear from the Minister&rsquo;s speech how it will pan out.  He referred in this regard to procurement.  How will the most up-to-date technology and equipment be made available on the ground?  Will Irish forces be sent to other countries?  Will a European centre of excellence be provided?  Will some countries have expertise in one area, while others will have it in others?  Will forces be sent from one country to another, or will a centre of excellence be provided?  I note the Minister has said the full details are probably not yet known.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On procurement, will there be group purchasing of equipment?  Will Ireland be able to purchase equipment such as helicopters, guns or whatever surveillance equipment will be required at the same price as the larger member states of the European Union whose forces are participating in peacekeeping missions?  It is important that we have the same purchasing power as the larger member states.  As the Minister said, at this time, when there are great demands on very scarce resources, it is important that we are able to purchase the best technology in the world at the same price as the larger forces in Europe.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides legislative autonomy for the State to engage in procurement and research and design programmes under the auspices of the EDA.  This will allow the State to join in programmes designed to achieve economies for the Defence Forces and share in research and design among participating members.  I presume this relates to the research and design aspect.  I also presume a centre of excellence will be provided, otherwise I do not know how matters will pan out, other than that personnel will be sent from one country to another.  I question if that would be the best practice.  However, it is only right that the best technology will be made available to the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill.  I note from the Minister&rsquo;s speeches in this House and the D&aacute;il that the State&rsquo;s participation in each individual programme will depend on Government and D&aacute;il approval.  I have tabled three minor amendments to the effect that such participation should depend on the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure such a proposal would have to come before the Seanad as well as the D&aacute;il.  I hope that when we come to deal with Committee Stage, the Minister will accept these amendments.</P>
        <P>There is very little more to the Bill.  Fine Gael is in total agreement with its provisions and hopes the Minister can push it through as quickly as possible and that it will be implemented as quickly and as smoothly as possible for the benefit of the Defence Forces, especially those that will participate in overseas peacekeeping missions.  The Minister might indicate if a centre of excellence for training will be provided within the European Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator Kieran Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  He was here last week when we dealt with one of the most detailed and complex Bills ever to go through the House.  Today&rsquo;s welcome appearance by him is very much in contrast, as he has introduced one of the shortest and most straightforward of Bills.  I suggest it may be one of the least contentious Bills ever to have been brought before us, as Committee and Report Stages were passed in the D&aacute;il without any amendments being tabled to it.  It received broad acceptance and support across the D&aacute;il and I hope we can demonstrate a similar consensus here.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes it crystal clear that our participation in the European Defence Agency is voluntary and will be decided on a case by case basis.  It also puts beyond doubt the fact that our focus in the agency will be on those areas relevant to the protection of our troops when deployed on peace support operations.</P><Col N="398"/>
        <P>While the title &ldquo;European Defence Agency&rdquo; may sound a little sinister to some, its intent and purpose are not.  Put simply, the agency provides a means of ensuring interoperability with our EU partners, especially those with whom we often serve on peacekeeping missions, as well as ensuring access to all new developments in peace support operations.  I learned during my research on the Bill that &ldquo;interoperability&rdquo; was one of the major buzzwords in peacekeeping.  In essence, it means the communications, protection and other equipment used by troops of different nations involved in peace support operations matches and works in tandem.  In practice, it means ensuring our communications equipment can talk to and work with the communications equipment of other forces.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the European Defence Agency will also help the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence to achieve economies of scale when it comes to purchasing new defence equipment and to keep up to date with best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on crisis management operations.  It is also worth reminding ourselves that the agency was established during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union in 2004.  Its primary role is to help the member states to develop their defence capabilities in order that they can contribute to crisis management operations launched by the Union.  It also has a role in improving the structure of the European defence industry to eliminate duplication and improve the effectiveness of existing research investment.  It is hoped the initiatives of the agency will help to reduce the cost base in the industry and, thus, lower the cost to member states of acquiring and maintaining defence equipment.  The Minister has often said the cost of purchasing defence or military protection equipment by the European Union is up to two and half times the costs incurred by the American Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year the Irish defence budget was just over &euro;1 billion.  While over 70% of this is accounted for by wages, allowances and pensions, it still leaves us with a capital, equipment and supplies budget in excess of &euro;250 million a year.  Therefore, it is particularly important in light of the current difficult economic environment that the Government should pursue any economies we can achieve without compromising the quality of the protective and support equipment we make available to those who serve on very dangerous missions.  We have a duty of care to our men and women in uniform to ensure the equipment, support and training they receive is the best available and is at least the match of our European partners.  I note that Ireland has participated in the past in the EDA&rsquo;s joint investment programme on force protection.  The Minister has made it clear the Defence Forces&rsquo; main interest in this programme was the development of technologies to protect troops from such dangers as snipers, booby traps and improvised explosive devices.  The programme also included such important elements as body armour sensors and systems to encounter explosive devices.  I understand Ireland, as part of the EDA&rsquo;s annual work programme, is involved in ongoing work on defence against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear explosive threats, improved communications systems for use on the ground in operations, health and medical support for EU military operations and the development of improved counter-IED, improvised explosive devices, capability to enable military forces operate safely in an environment where such devices are present.  As the legislation now puts beyond doubt, our participation in EDA programmes is in areas relevant to the protection of our troops when they are deployed on peace support operations.  This is important work.  It is essential the Defence Forces have access to the latest developments in these fields such that we can provide the best protection possible for our troops.  This is and must continue to be our primary concern.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied the Bill does absolutely nothing to diminish our traditional policy of military neutrality.  As I stated at the beginning, this is a short Bill and adequately sets out the very <Col N="399"/>specific conditions under which we may participate in projects undertaken by the European Defence Agency or in permanent structured co-operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any proposed participation will be based on the triple lock of Government and D&aacute;il approval, coupled with the qualification that such participation would contribute to the enhancement of capabilities for United Nations mandated missions engaged in peacekeeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  I believe this is a very sensible and measured approach and I am pleased to support the Bill and recommend its endorsement by the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I thank him for the explanation because I was not aware of the reason for the Bill beforehand.  Those of us in the Seanad believe ourselves somewhat snubbed because we are not required to declare war or for anything in that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill confirms that Ireland can only participate in certain EDA programmes, projects or permanent structured co-operation subject to the prior approval of the Government and the D&aacute;il, of which we were already aware.  I refer to one or two matters which concern me in this regard because Senators Burke and Kieran Phelan have covered the areas referred to by the Minister in his contribution.  At the end of September EU defence Ministers met in Sweden, which held the EU Presidency at the time, to consider ways to connect national civilian and military radar and satellite systems to better deal with incidents at sea.  Such incidents cover a range of areas.  The defence Ministers considered a data sharing model used by nations in the Baltic Sea, where some 500,000 ships transit every year.  At the meeting it was stated that the greatest challenge would not be financial but legal.  The legislation among the 27 European nations differs greatly on matters of maritime surveillance and the exchange of data.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We intend to make a large financial contribution to the European Defence Agency.  Last year the contribution was &euro;300,000.  Ireland has participated in the EDA&rsquo;s joint investment programme on forced protection since 2007, to help boost Europe&rsquo;s efforts in defence research and technology.  It has committed &euro;700,000 to the budget.  Should we insist on more help from Europe and from the EDA to patrol our coast?  Mr. Javier Solana, the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, made clear the requirement that all countries in the EU should spend more money on the European Defence Agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Naval Service has only eight vessels.  However, it faces the task of policing more than 340,000 sq. km of coastal waters, a figure of which I was unaware before I researched the matter.  That is four times the area of the island of Ireland, which is very interesting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have only two container scanners.  Last week representatives of the Irish Cancer Society were in the Houses for a discussion on cigarette smuggling.  I mentioned there was only one container scanner but I was informed by them that there were two because a new one had arrived recently.  It surprises me that we know how many scanners there are because smugglers would be interested to know as well.  I would like to believe there are many more such scanners.  However, to the best of my knowledge there are only two container scanners for the entire country.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that cigarette smuggling alone costs the Government between &euro;500 million and &euro;700 million in lost revenue.  It is growing at an incredible rate.  Recently in the House I raised the matters of cigarette smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes.  I seek a view from the Minister on how Ireland can get help to protect our coast.  Obviously, we do not have the resources to do it on our own.  Can we engage with the EU in some way such that we can properly protect our coastline?  I refer not only to cigarette smuggling but to several very high profile cases of drug smuggling.  The high profile cases are such that we praise the Defence <Col N="400"/>Forces and the Coast Guard when they help in this area, but it is a reminder that this may be only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the extension of EU operations in such countries as Somalia.  At the two day summit of defence Ministers at the end of September to which I referred, it was stressed there should be more EU involvement in international operations.  The defence Ministers referred to increased EU involvement with Operation Althea, the EU led operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There was widespread agreement that future military operations should focus on training the armed forces of countries.  However, certain concerns were also raised at the same meeting.  The EU is involved in fighting piracy off the coast of east Africa and there has been much publicity in recent times in this regard.  The EU defence Ministers stated they wished to engage in state-building, a term I had not heard previously, and development work in mainland Somalia.  The flexibility of the battle groups was also discussed.  In recent days EU defence Ministers met in Brussels to discuss the various foreign and defence missions under way.  They are expected to prolong Operation Atlanta, the naval operation in Somalian waters, and approve the principle of a training mission for security forces at the request of the transitional government in Mogadishu.  This mission, which will include fewer that 200 European police officers and will take place in Uganda, could train up to 2,000 police and military operatives, interesting information that only came to light on the Internet yesterday.  To many, it appears the EU is ramping up its involvement internationally.  It seems very risky to enter a place such as mainland Somalia given the recent events in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Given that the EU appears to be willing to incentivise a project in a country such as Somalia, what incentives will it offer Ireland for increased international involvement?  Are there incentives for us?  Is there an encouragement for us to do so?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion on the European Union&rsquo;s pledge to get involved in state-building, especially in mainland Somalia?  Is the Minister in favour of such a move?  I thank the Minister for his attention and for informing the House.  It was interesting to learn so much about the matter and I was unaware of the involvement in other areas until now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill, while small in scale, has a particular importance for re-affirming the Government&rsquo;s and country&rsquo;s attitude towards its involvement in foreign affairs, international and national defence.  It was a key component in the recent debate in terms of the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  It is important that the promises made on the introduction of the Bill and in today&rsquo;s debate match the expectations of many, although there are alternative views on where this country should position itself in these areas.  The overwhelming view of the majority of the Irish people and the Government which is reinforced by the Bill is that Ireland does not want to be associated with or participate in the use of force to achieve political ends.  The opposite is the case &mdash; this is a nation that uses its expertise in peacekeeping and conflict resolution.  This has attained particular importance in recent years because of European Union treaties that have led to the fading away of the Western European Union and the development of the European Defence Agency.  This creates potential conflicts for countries with a neutral status such Ireland.  In a European Union of 27 member states, many of which are involved in a military alliance in the form of NATO, how this development might conflict with the foreign policy and defence needs of Ireland must be articulated and enshrined in legislation.  We hold one advantage in that our neutral status is shared by a number of other EU member states, including Finland, Sweden, Austria and Malta.  We need an ongoing detailed debate on the nature and quality of neutrality.  It has often been argued that our definition and that of other member states differ wildly.  For instance, a former Finnish Prime Minister went so far as to say he no longer considered Finland to be neutral but a non-aligned country.  That debate takes place regularly in Finland.</P><Col N="401"/>
        <P>The role of the European Defence Agency and Ireland&rsquo;s involvement or otherwise in it, with the necessary distance Ireland, as a participating country in the European Union, needs in engaging with the agency, must be addressed in legislation.  I, therefore, welcome the publication and content of the Bill and recognise the role in coalition Government that has given rise to its genesis and, I hope, eventual implementation.  While the European Defence Agency, in my opinion and that of the Green Party, complements what many European Union member states see as an important part of foreign and defence policies, it unnecessarily complicates such policies for Ireland which is involved in Partnership for Peace actions and with other member states in many UN peacekeeping missions.  In recent times there was a successful EU mission to Chad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has a history of being colonised.  Our involvement with the international grouping of the European Union, some of whose member states have a certain history and approach to defence matters, has been governed by the fact that they have been colonising powers.  The use of force to achieve political ends, even in the 20th century, is something we have seen too frequently in Europe.  The danger in the European Defence Agency and the reason we need to keep our distance from and interact with it to the smallest degree possible is that for some defence equipment procurement and the development of a war economy, in which weapons can be produced and sold, are seen as a viable economic basis of the European Union.  This must be questioned.  We need to say the thinking behind the agency is not in keeping with our definition of what &ldquo;defence&rdquo; means as a neutral country.  That said, there are useful and important roles in defence equipment procurement and the standardisation of the equipment that can be used for specific means, particularly in international peacekeeping operations.  As we opt in and out of peacekeeping operations, particularly where there is an EU mandate, there is a need for effective interoperability.  We must achieve this balance.</P>
        <P>We have chosen neutrality and I hope the country chooses to maintain it.  Therefore, we have a special need for legislation such as this, although there has been a reaction against this in the past.  It has been said constitutional provisions, such as they are, and ongoing Government policy are sufficient barriers to prevent us from going too far down the road that we would be compromised, with many citizens uncomfortable about the direction we are taking.</P>
        <P>The Bill is important.  Its provisions will go a long way towards reaffirming our traditional policy of neutrality.  This will give great confidence to the citizens to ensure that as we fulfil our international obligations in peacekeeping, we will not be drawn into a situation where we will become a belligerent in a global context in meeting the resource needs of this part of the world.  On those grounds, I welcome the Bill and look forward to the continuing detailed debate on the wider issue of neutrality and how it can be made more firm in the public consciousness through whatever legal and constitutional means are necessary to meet the ongoing belief of the Irish people.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and confirm that the Labour Party will support the Bill.  I reiterate the statements made by my colleague in the other House, Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea, who commended the Minister for the speedy way in which the Bill was published in September.  It is impossible to discuss it without placing it in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality.  One point that came across in the first Lisbon treaty referendum concerned the depth of feeling about a perceived threat to our neutrality which, rhetorically, is enshrined in the national mindset.  However, it is clear that there are gaps in our shared understanding of what neutrality means.  Many assume that Irish neutrality is protected in the Constitution but that is <Col N="402"/>not the case.  Such a misunderstanding means that policy changes such as those proposed and introduced in the Lisbon treaty can be misrepresented by groups and individuals to suit their own agendas.  We saw this clearly in the first referendum and, to a lesser degree, in the second when various groups on the far left and far right introduced red herrings in respect of conscription and the formation of a European army to confuse and scare the electorate into voting against the treaty.  Policy discussion in the public sphere is hampered by a soundbite oriented news media and a lack of trust in many of our institutions, elected officials and politicians.  Neutrality is just one good example of a policy frequently misrepresented by those wishing to promote their own agendas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On that basis, I welcome the opportunity to have a meaningful discussion on Irish neutrality and the implications for how we see the world and how it sees us.  As part of that discussion, I would welcome an honest assertion by the Government and others that a policy of neutrality, as recognised in its purest form, is not and has not been exercised by the State.  Rather, Ireland follows a nuanced, flexible and legally ambiguous form of non-alignment.  This policy has served us well and I do not criticise it <i>per se</i>.  Rather, the misappropriation of the term &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; has unnecessarily created confusion, fear and mistrust.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is generally agreed that Sweden constitutes the best example of a European country which is genuinely neutral.  Its position is reflected in the self-defined position that the country is not allied with power blocs in peacetime in order to remain neutral in wartime.  Sweden has not participated in any war since 1814. In addition, Sweden has maintained a relatively high average spend on defence.  Along with Switzerland it takes its position on armed neutrality very seriously.  While it is rarely discussed, it is very clear that Ireland exercises no such policy.  From the benevolent neutrality of the Second World War to the legal passage of an immense army through Shannon Airport, it is clear that our approach to neutrality is bespoke and represents an Irish solution to an Irish problem.</P>
        <P>Bryan O&rsquo;Boyle of NUI Galway sets out a similar view when he states, &ldquo;The flexibility of Irish neutrality has enabled successive governments to affirm or elongate the policy of neutrality in appropriate situations and, on other occasions, to contract or diminish and even ignore neutrality to comply with other policy considerations.&rdquo;  The Shannon stopover debacle highlights the frustration of the people at our willingness to abandon the central tenets of a traditional neutrality.  It also indicates the Government&rsquo;s willingness to utilise the flexibility of our approach for political and economic gain.</P>
        <P>I recognise this flexible approach also has advantages and these lie in our role as peacemaker and peacekeeper throughout the world and the Labour Party fully supports Ireland&rsquo;s role in peacekeeping duties on the international stage.  I refer to the sentiments expressed by the security correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Tom Clonan, late last year.  He stated that participation in EU military structures has allowed Ireland to continue its tradition of UN service under an EU flag.  Such participation has also provided Ireland with unique leadership opportunities, such as our lead role in the EU&rsquo;s mission in Chad.  In that vein, I welcome the development of permanent structured co-operation which addresses capacity building and synergies among other issues.  It is important to note that Ireland retains a veto and the right not to participate in future missions.  Additionally, formal UN, Government and D&aacute;il and Seanad approval would be required for any such missions.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle that the European Defence Agency could be a relatively benign development in the context of Irish foreign policy.  The development and pooling of defence capabilities in areas of key concern to EU peacekeeping missions is a positive development as is the capability to share procurement and promote specialist research and development.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <P Just="Left">Nothing in the Bill negatively affects Irish neutrality.  However, I encourage a realistic debate on the practicalities of our nuanced and ambiguous position on neutrality.  Arguing in defence of something that does not obtain is unlikely to become any easier in the years ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">N&iacute; chuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Bhille seo, a thagann amach as an reifreann is d&eacute;ana&iacute; a bh&iacute; againn.  Is &eacute; seo ceann de na f&aacute;thanna gur chuir mo phairt&iacute; in &eacute;adan chonradh Liosp&oacute;in.  Cheapamar go raibh an t&iacute;r seo ag sleamhn&uacute; isteach in Eoraip n&iacute;os m&iacute;leata.  Bh&iacute;omar in &eacute;adan an European Defence Agency nuair a buna&iacute;odh &eacute; i 2004.  The European Defence Agency is the armaments industry of the European Union.  While in his speech the Minister outlined some of the benefits that come from this, such as ensuring our troops are supplied with the best equipment for peacekeeping missions under UN approval, the European Defence Agency also has a darker side.  The Minister also stated that the only commitment we have to the EDA is a budgetary commitment but we should not participate in this.  We should not be funding an armaments industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other Members spoke about neutrality and the Minister also mentioned our traditional policy of neutrality.  Will the Minister outline what is that traditional policy of neutrality?  It was raised during his contribution today, referred to with regard to the Lisbon treaty and it will be lodged with the United Nations.  Will somebody please define for me what is Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of neutrality?  Neutrality is defined in international law and it is clear that if we did have a policy of neutrality, Ireland would have breached it time and again.  One could not allow one&rsquo;s land or airspace to be used for the movement of foreign troops and what we see in Shannon would be a complete breach of this.  As a previous speaker stated, we do not operate a policy of neutrality, we operate a traditional policy of neutrality.  It is about time we defined Irish neutrality.  I would like to see a referendum on neutrality.  Even though the Government makes up the traditional policy of neutrality as time goes on and various events occur, I believe the heart of Ireland would like to see a real policy of neutrality such as that under which other countries operate.  This is why I do not see the European Defence Agency playing a part in it.</P>
        <P>Enhanced structured co-operation also allows us to slip further down the road of a militarised EU.  While I acknowledge that we do not have to opt in to any such co-operation and it would be with the consent of the D&aacute;il and the Government and not the Seanad, as was stated, it still allows for a number of member states to come together and organise under the name of the EU and carry out operations.  They would be doing so in our name as well as in their own because they would do so with the support of the European Union and the European Defence Agency to which we would contribute financially.  There are serious questions to be answered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Europe is moving in the wrong direction.  Ireland has a crucial role to play in conflict resolution throughout the world.  The expansion of the Petersberg Tasks under the Lisbon treaty takes in far more than peacekeeping and intervention and includes joint disarmament projects, which is what President Bush called the invasion of Iraq.  Quite alarmingly, in his contribution, the Minister acknowledged that it is not clear how enhanced structured co-operation will work.  It is ambiguous and it cannot be said for certain how it will work and how various countries will come together to operate in an international military context, using the support of the European Defence Agency, which we will fund, and under the <i>imprimatur </i>of the European Union, to carry out actions in our name.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an area in which we have a unique history and we could provide a specific role in global conflict resolution.  Ireland is a former colony, has had a peace process and has international goodwill; these could be used in the best way to deal with conflict resolution.  Supporting the enhanced structural co-operation of the European Defence Agency, which will allow <Col N="404"/>other powers to come together using resources to which Ireland will contribute, undermines this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately the Minister is hell-bent against it but I would like to see a proper internationally accepted definition of neutrality being put to the people so that they can decide.  It is great that the D&aacute;il and the Government &mdash; which amount to the same thing &mdash; will decide but let the people decide whether the country should be neutral and not just have the traditional policy, which is made up by the Minister of the day.  If the Minister does one thing in answering my questions I ask that it is to outline exactly and legally what is the State&rsquo;s traditional policy of neutrality.  It would clear up many issues for us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea.  As was pointed out by my colleague, Senator Kieran Phelan, the Minister was here last week to deal with NAMA.  I will probably make the Minister blush but his involvement in such a complex issue as the NAMA Bill brings to mind his roles as an accountant and a lawyer.</P>
        <P>I am delighted with the speedy way in which the Bill is being brought before the Houses.  As other speakers stated, it follows from our commitment under the Lisbon treaty and puts on a legislative footing our involvement in the European Defence Agency.  We all know the EDA was the subject of huge misrepresentation.  I am sorry Senator Doherty did not stay because his party was one of the main instigators in putting out the misrepresentation and lies during the recent Lisbon treaty debate.  Some groups even suggested that the EDA was the beginning of a European army.  While canvassing, I met women who were frightened that their 16 year old sons would be conscripted into a European army.  A lot of talking was required to convince them otherwise.</P>
        <P>The European Defence Agency provides a framework for member states to co-operate on matching equipment and strategy.  This co-operation on dangerous but necessary peace missions reflects the best traditions of the European Union.  The agency plays an important role in reducing the cost to member states of acquiring and maintaining defensive equipment.  Standardisation will allow significant economies of scale to be achieved in the purchasing of equipment.  Given that more than &euro;250 million of the Department of Defence&rsquo;s annual budget of &euro;1 billion is spent on equipment and capital purchases, the savings made through standardisation are to be warmly welcomed, especially in the context of our current economic constraints.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was nominated to the Seanad by the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Associations.  The Minister will be aware of this because I have worn a path to his door in recent weeks to discuss issues on behalf of members of the conference.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The members of the Defence Forces have served their country with distinction in the most dangerous areas of the world. They have put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way to protect others with professionalism and dedication. As the Minister rightly recognised, they have forged a peacekeeping reputation that is second to none. They have actively contributed to rebuilding communities in Kosovo and East Timor. Last week, the Minister and I discussed certain issues which are affecting the Defence Forces at present and I have shared the outcome of this discussion with the Defence Forces members whom I represent.</P>

I appreciate the conversation that the Minister had with me last week, particularly in regard to maintaining numbers in the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to describe briefly how I feel when I come into the Seanad to pass legislation such as the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  There is an air of comfort and security in passing such legislation because our Defences Forces are so finely tuned and professionally run.  I thank the Minister for his contributions to our defence.  In 2006, I observed from a stand on O&rsquo;Connell Street as the men and women of the Defence Forces paraded in celebration of the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  For the first time in my memory, I watched Irish troops marching down O&rsquo;Connell Street.  I was hugely proud of the way they presented themselves to the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not agree with Senator Doherty in regard to a referendum on neutrality.  The nation feels safe because the Defence Forces acquit themselves well as peacekeepers and peace enforcers.  I question the need for a referendum on neutrality at this point in our history.  I am glad to say there is only one army in the State.  The Defence Forces have an outstanding record.</P>
        <P>As a nation, we feel grief and shock when something happens to members of the Defence Forces.  Last month, two young Air Corps pilots died in a crash.  One was a cadet from County Wexford and the other was an instructor from Dublin.  The nation went into mourning at their deaths.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to contribute to Second Stage of this Bill and l look forward to debating any amendments that may be proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The Defence Forces have undergone major changes in recent years and the manner of this reform has received favourable comments from the Minister and his predecessors.  Numbers have fallen significantly and a spate of barracks closures has caused great inconvenience and hardship to families and communities.  Some members now have to travel in excess of 80 miles owing to these closures but they have taken this inconvenience and added financial pressure on the chin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given that members of the Defence Forces have taken such strong medicine in recent years, surely they should be spared from any additional cuts.  They cannot be expected to take any more pain, especially when many of them are on relatively low wages.  The fact that hundreds of personnel qualify for family income supplement is evidence of the low wages they receive.  The Minister should be fighting to protect their standards of living, which cannot be described as extravagant.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s threats against PDFORRA when he had a firm undertaking from it that it would not be part of the Frontline Alliance was reprehensible.  He should be fighting its members&rsquo; corner and praising them for their continued loyalty and bravery in defending this country and on peacekeeping missions abroad.  These men and women deserve great praise and support and threatening their representative association is no way to treat them.</P>
        <P>The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 envisages that Permanent Defence Force personnel will work abroad to develop enhanced capability with other co-operating states through permanent structured co-operation, PSC.  Will the Minister explain how this co-operation will operate?  Will he confirm that members of the Permanent Defence Force who joined before the enactment of the legislation will not be liable to be sent abroad on PSC work unless they volunteer to do so?  This is a matter of concern to the membership of the Permanent Defence Force.</P><Col N="406"/>
     
        <P>In general, I welcome the Bill.  It will, for example, ensure members of the Defence Forces have access to modern equipment.  We do not have anything to fear from the European Defence Agency which provides assurance that European soldiers participating in peace support operations will have modern, safe equipment.  This is of paramount importance to our soldiers.</P>
        <P>Participation in the European Defence Agency is entirely voluntary.  Under the legislation, any proposed participation will be brought to the D&aacute;il and, I hope, the Seanad for approval.  I hope a Fine Gael Party amendment requiring Seanad approval for any proposal for Irish participation in other European Defence Agency programmes will be passed on Committee Stage.  Participation in the European Defence Agency will deliver advantages for Ireland given that the pooling of military resources will result in economies of scale for all countries involved.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made a valuable and significant contribution to peacekeeping throughout the world.  It is important that everything possible is done to ensure the safety of our troops abroad who operate in dangerous and volatile circumstances.  I pay tribute, in particular, to our forces in Chad who are doing an excellent job in difficult conditions.  I commend the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House with such speed.  The Fine Gael Party fully supports the concept of the legislation and hopes the Minister will accept our amendments, especially the proposal providing for a role for the Seanad.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in favour of this legislation which will greatly assist the Defence Forces in developing their capabilities to serve the cause of peace and justice in support of the United Nations.  Ireland&rsquo;s record on UN peacekeeping gives us a great deal of which to be proud.  More than 750 young Irish men and women are serving on United Nations mandated peace support missions in places as diverse as Chad and Bosnia Herzegovina.  Ireland is taking leadership roles in these missions.  For example, we provided the commander for the original EUFOR mission to Chad in the person of Lieutenant General Pat Nash and, until recently, held command of the task force central area in Kosovo.  We have been able to take these crucial and important roles as a result of the considerable investment in training and equipment the Government has undertaken since the late 1990s.</P>
        <P>In recent years, massive improvements have been made in the personal and protection equipment available to our troops, whether the provision of new armoured personnel carriers, personal protection equipment, communications equipment or weaponry.  The recent missions undertaken by members of the Defence Forces have been characterised by their multinational nature.  We increasingly serve and deploy on UN mandated peacekeeping and peace support missions in close co-operation with other small like-minded countries such as Sweden, Finland and Austria.  This co-operation has highlighted the need to ensure different equipment and systems are able to work in tandem without incompatibility issues arising.  Known by the Defence Forces as &ldquo;interoperability&rdquo;, this issue was addressed by Senator Kieran Phelan.</P>
        <P>As has been evident from the mission in Chad, Europe has much to contribute in the field of crisis management and peace support operations.  Any assistance the European Defence Agency can give member states in this regard will be welcome.  As all of us who canvassed for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon treaty referenda will recall, many fears and concerns on defence and military matters were raised by some on the &ldquo;No&rdquo;<b> </b>side, particularly during the first referendum campaign.  While these fears, especially those concerning conscription and the creation of a European army, were not founded on reality, they needed to be allayed.  The guarantees negotiated by the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs went a long way towards addressing the concerns of many during the second referendum campaign.</P><Col N="407"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill before us provides further vital reassurance.  It stems from the importance of recognising that military neutrality is important to Irish people who take pride in the fact that the Army is dedicated to peace making and peace building across the globe.  While not every man and woman in the street will be able to identify the key components of the triple lock mechanism, the requirement to secure a United Nations mandate and Government and D&aacute;il approval before Irish troops may be deployed, all of them know and understand that the triple lock is an important safeguard and a cornerstone of our policy of military neutrality.  I commend the Minister and his advisers on providing a similar triple lock mechanism in the Bill for proposals to participate in European Defence Agency programmes.  The approach the Minister has adopted is clear, simple and concise.</P>
        <P>To be parochial, from my contacts with personnel serving in D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks in Cavan town, I have become aware of the importance and centrality of peacekeeping duties to the men and women of the Defence Forces.  Almost 60 privates and non-commissioned officers from the barracks have served on peacekeeping duties over the past two years in places as diverse as Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo and Chad.  Eight members of the Defence Forces from the barracks are serving with the 100th Infantry Battalion in Chad.</P>
        <P>D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks and the men and women of the Defence Forces who serve in it are central to the social fabric of Cavan and its community and sporting life.  This is evident from the significant community engagement made by personnel.  Almost 200 local schoolchildren have visited the barracks on school trips so far this year.  Personnel at the barracks also facilitated 24 students on transition year work experience programmes.  As part of its summer training programme, the Youthreach training centre in Cavan had 20 early school leavers based at the barracks for a two-week training course.  I will provide the Minister with details of this successful project after the debate.  I commend the Army personnel in D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks, especially Lieutenant Damien Kelleher, Corporal John Wall and Corporal Darren McCarthy, on their enthusiastic approach to the project.  A number of the young people who participated have expressed interest in joining the Defence Forces.  In this connection, I ask the Minister to comment on the recruitment procedure for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Personnel from D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks are also to the fore in local fund-raising efforts, for example, in so-called rowathon events organised by troops.  This year&rsquo;s rowathon in which 20 troops participated raised more than &euro;7,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  A previous event in 2006 raised almost &euro;12,500 for GOAL&rsquo;s Pakistan relief appeal.</P>
        <P>I express my appreciation and thanks to the commanding officer and personnel of D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks for all their hard work and dedication both at home and abroad.  The people of Cavan are proud of them.  I pay special tribute to Councillor Patricia Walsh, a tireless advocate on behalf of the personnel based at the barracks.  I thank the Minister and his officials, particularly Derek Mooney and Suzanne Coogan, for the assistance they have afforded me since I was elected to the House.  I ask the Minister to address the decision not to require consultation with the Seanad on the triple lock mechanism.</P>

	<P>We have learned from the last three speakers that no politics are international.  I welcome the Minister who has outlined the objectives of the Bill.  While I fully support what is included in it and have no difficulty with it, it raises wider issues.  In that regard, I would like to pick up on some of the points raised by Senator Doherty.  I have long wanted a debate on neutrality, something I have never seen.  We need to challenge ourselves by asking questions.  I have been on the side of neutrality all my life, although I have never been comfort<Col N="408"/>able with it and have often felt conflicted.  Every year I celebrated the actions and history of the 15th International Brigade which fought against Franco.  I saw no conflict between attending such an event and supporting a policy of neutrality which forbade involvement with any other country.  I wish to ask the Minister a serious and fundamental question.  Nobody could disagree that it was pragmatic and sensible for us to be neutral during the Second World War.  However, can anyone explain the morality of our decision to be neutral when Hitler was killing millions of people for all the wrong reasons, if there ever was a right one, in concentration camps and other places?  Is it a policy to be proud of?  Is it one to be sustained or which can be explained or defended?  In more modern times when Pol Pot did the same, what questions did we ask?  Where are the role models for democracy?  </P>
        <P Just="Left">A fair question on Irish neutrality was asked by Senator Doherty which I ask the Minister not to attempt to answer today but to come back on another day.  I do not know what &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; means.  As I walked into the Chamber a Senator made reference to Sweden and Switzerland.  I do not know in what context that comment was made, but if I were to choose two countries which would not under any circumstances be role models for neutrality as I understand it, I would begin with Sweden and Switzerland.  Sweden which has blithely and openly declared a policy of neutrality has seen nothing wrong with selling arms to both sides in every war in the last century.  Switzerland which has an attitude of &ldquo;I am alright, Jack&rdquo; and has been at the centre of Europe for the past five centuries has seen nothing wrong with laundering the ill-gotten gains of every corrupt regime for the past 100 years.  I know what &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; is not, but I am not certain what it is.  I am certain, however, that it is not the taking of a passive position.  Rather, it is an active state.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hear people speak of the Irish people being committed and attached to a policy of neutrality, the majority among which I find myself.  Having said that, the people have a great sense of the need to right a perceived wrong, defend the defenceless and protect the persecuted.  I remember some years ago when we watched the killings in the Balkans and saw what was happening in Srebrenica, Sarajevo, Kosovo and other places, people cried for the European Union to intervene and do something about it.  I do not know what the answer is, but I do have ideas, to which I will come.</P>
        <P>I do not profess to be a Christian or support any religion, but how can a practising Christian have a policy of neutrality?  How can one be neutral in the face of a wrong or something which is completely unfair?  Surely, there must be a demand to act in an honest fashion and if we see something wrong, there is a need to say it is wrong.  Views such as those of the Christian good samaritan or the &ldquo;I am alright, Jack&rdquo; approach have to be considered in a debate on neutrality.  An article of the Constitution which states we should take our lead from and work under the generally recognised principles of international law as our mode of conduct with other nations is very interesting and fits neatly with the Bill before us.</P>
        <P>In the same way that a country needs to be policed, the world also needs to be policed.  There is only one way that can be done and it cannot be done via the one-sided approach of NATO, the European Union or others.  The obvious way it can be done is through the United Nations.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations, like Christianity, has never been allowed to work.  It is not currently democratically controlled, but if it was and the Security Council did not call all the shots, it could operate as a world police force which could take decisions on when we needed to intervene.  It is the most appropriate body and very close to the way we operate.  We <Col N="409"/>could demand a UN position and then operate the triple lock mechanism.  The word &ldquo;interoperability&rdquo; was used.  One could then have a situation where the two policies would fit snugly together.  The Irish Army or any other would no longer need to exist.  There could be a UN army with Irish members, which is what happens when the Irish Army serves abroad.</P>
        <P>I would like to develop some of these ideas in greater detail but will conclude by saying we cannot stand idly by if something needs to be done.  We should be prepared to play our role as a State in the world order in a controlled, democratic fashion.  It is important to recognise that members of the Army at commissioned officer level and below support the action of front-line workers next Tuesday.  I agree they should not be allowed to strike, but they should be able to articulate their views.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my gratitude to Senator O&rsquo;Toole and take up his question.  I claim to be a Christian.  I know it is a large claim, of which I am unworthy, but I can answer the Senator&rsquo;s question.  Christ reproved the disciple who had cut off the centurion&rsquo;s ear and made him return his sword to the sheath when he was in danger of inevitable death.  </P>
        <P>On the triple lock mechanism, many think both Houses of the Oireachtas are involved, but that is not the case.  This House is disbarred from involvement in such a decision.  It is ridiculous and infantile; we should be involved because this is where one will hear the dissenting voices.</P>
        <P>I believe in neutrality which is a very difficult concept.  I was able to support the Lisbon treaty because I had received assurances from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we would not engage with the European Defence Agency, formerly the European Armaments Group, given its previous track record of trying to develop a Europe-wide armaments export industry.  I will hold him to that agreement and will table amendments to seek a veto for Ireland to veto any such arrangement.  This is a central issue.  I do not trust the European Defence Agency and the European armaments groups, particularly in the light of the debate on an Adjournment matter a number of weeks ago when I raised the question of the acquisition by the Minister for Defence of surveillance equipment worth some &euro;2.37 million from Elbit Systems Limited, a Haifa-based Israeli company which has produced equipment which has been used in illegal surveillance operations along the illegal wall in Gaza.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the Norwegian finance Minister, Kristin Halvorsen, in referring to this company, stated Norway did not want to fund companies which so directly contributed to violations of international human rights law.  Why is Ireland doing so?  It is completely wrong.  It worries me that the equipment concerned has been adapted for use in armoured vehicles built in South Africa because that brings us back to the apartheid regime when it collaborated with the Israeli military authorities in the development of weapons systems.  We are still stuck in this system and I call on the Minister to revisit the issue.  We know it is subject to an open tender process and supervised by the European Defence Agency, but that is another reason I am deeply suspicious.  We need to look carefully and coldly at this issue and not get ourselves involved in disgraceful antics.</P>
        <P>Why was Declan Ganley involved in the debate on the Lisbon treaty?  It is perfectly obvious that he was against the Lisbon treaty because he was up to his ears in the American arms industry.  Of course, he did not want us to enter into an exporting competition with the United States.  That is what I am still gravely suspicious of.  If my friend from Cavan can be parochial, <Col N="410"/>I will be just as parochial by saying, like the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i>, I will have my eye on the Minister and the European Defence Agency.</P>

He works in conjunction with the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, General Dermot Earley, and has acquitted himself well in his current Ministry.  In the context of the proposed amendment, it would be worthwhile considering whether we should use both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If it were possible to do so, that would give us a role in the matter.  Perhaps it is tradition that the Seanad is excluded from the approval&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Bill before the House is another example of EU legislation interacting with domestic law.  I welcome the Bill which gives Ireland an opportunity to influence the actions of the European Defence Agency.  During the campaign in advance of the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty real concern was expressed about the perceived militarisation of the European Union.  I will be interested to hear the comments of Senator Donohoe who was involved in the process of responding to the outcome of the first referendum on the treaty.  I concur with the views expressed by Senator Feeney when she mentioned such fears.</P>
        <P>I have had an opportunity to review the context within which the European Defence Agency sits, as part of the Lisbon treaty as a whole.  I have also examined the Council joint action establishing the agency.  I recommend that Senator Norris read the Official Journal of the European Union, specifically in so far as it relates to Council Joint Action 2004/551/CFSP of 12 July 2004 which established the agency.  The document in question sets out the exact role of the agency.  I would like to dispel the concerns of Senators about the oversight role of the agency.  Participation in projects of the agency, as envisaged in Articles 20 and 21 of the Council joint action, is voluntary.  Ireland can opt in or out as it sees fit.  One of the agency&rsquo;s significant purposes is to ensure the European Union&rsquo;s humanitarian work is made easier.  Another goal is to ensure soldiers involved in EU missions are better protected.  The Lisbon treaty does not change these aims.  It is clear that membership of the agency does not compromise the neutrality of Ireland or the other five neutral EU member states.  Any suggestion to the contrary was clearly dispelled during the debate on the Lisbon treaty which was passed on 2 October last.</P>
        <P>The Irish people and the Irish Army have had a long and successful relationship with the United Nations.  I am glad that the Bill makes explicit reference to the United Nations.  Articles 42 and 45 set out the role of the European Defence Agency, one of the objectives of which will be to assist and support member states in developing the necessary capacity to undertake peace support and crisis management missions, in the context of humanitarian and rescue missions and peacekeeping tasks, etc.  Lieutenant General Pat Nash was the first head of the Chad mission.  We should be very proud of the role of the Army which has acquitted itself extremely well in that troubled region.  It is possible that there would be genocide in Chad if <Col N="411"/>the Army was not participating in the mission.  We have prevented future conflict.  It is clearly evident that Ireland&rsquo;s role as a neutral nation is held in great respect throughout the world.  I refer to our work in difficult circumstances, for example, in Kosovo.  The participation of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in missions in certain regions is also welcome.  When I travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina as an election monitor after the war, I learned more about the slaughter that had taken place in the region.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, the rest of Europe stood idly by.  I hope that will never happen again.  The European Defence Agency will help to prevent such events.</P>
        <P>There is concern about the worrying trend, whereby approximately 500 officers and other members have decided to leave the Defence Forces in the last nine months.  The possible taxing of gratuity sums and forthcoming wage reductions have been floated as great concerns.  I assure the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues that PDFORRA and RACO are deeply concerned about these matters.  Taxation is acceptable to all our citizens.  However, we do not know what level of taxation will be decided on.  Wage reductions will have a knock-on effect on future pensions.  I do not minimise the importance of raising &euro;4 billion to deal with the country&rsquo;s difficulties; it is an enormous task.</P>
        <P>The number of personnel in the Defence Forces has decreased from 10,500 to less than 10,000.  It is difficult to sustain overseas missions and domestic work when numbers are declining.  I appreciate that there is an embargo on public service recruitment.  I am aware that the Minister has to make the case for every appointment within the Defence Forces, for example, at officer level and I will support him as he undertakes his difficult task.  However, I ask him to bear in mind the worries and concerns of ordinary members of the Defence Forces as they contemplate their futures.  They are not the best paid in the world, but they have big responsibilities &mdash; they put their lives on the line every day in defence of the civil authority.  I am sure the Minister will do his utmost to defend them.  I understand that during the last round of economic discussions, he opposed any reduction in the number of Defence Forces staff.  He agreed to the amalgamation of Army barracks to prevent a cut in the numbers of officers and enlisted men and I am sure he will continue to take such action.  All we can do is support him in every way possible.  I commend him on bringing the Bill to the House so speedily and I am confident that it will be passed expeditiously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>As a native of a garrison town, I welcome the Minister.  There were three Army barracks in counties Longford and Westmeath until, sadly, the barracks in Longford was closed earlier this year.  Although I opposed that decision tooth and nail, I have to accept it and move on.  I acknowledge that it is taking a great toll on staff to have to travel 20 miles from Longford to their new workplace every day.  </P>
        <P>As my grandfather was a sergeant major in Athlone until he retired in the late 1950s, I have a keen and sincere affinity with the Defence Forces.  Some 200 members of the Defence Forces are based in the Army barracks in Mullingar, the only remaining artillery barracks in the country.  Over 600 members of the Defence Forces are based in Athlone.  The two institutions form the mainstay of the two towns and I cannot over-emphasise their importance to the local economies.  I remind the Minister, in case he is thinking of organising FCA camps, training for overseas missions or other such events, that the military authorities in Mullingar are ready, willing and able to accommodate a further 200 troops.</P>
        <P>The Irish Army which has served all over the world is regarded with great respect everywhere.  Irish troops are serving in Chad and Kosovo.  There are small deployments in Afghanistan, Western Sahara, Congo, the Ivory Coast, the military headquarters in Brussels, Vienna, Belgrade and Georgia.  I have probably forgotten some places where they are serving. <Col N="412"/> We are recognised as being reliable and respected across the world.  I commend the resources put into the Defence Forces by the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides that all deployments should have Government and D&aacute;il approval and must operate under a UN mandate.  I welcome the triple lock mechanism that governs the participation of the Defence Forces in all deployments overseas.  The Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006 provided the legislative authority for Irish troops to train abroad, take part in humanitarian operations and participate in Nordic Battlegroup missions.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about our Christian ethos.  When I was researching for this debate, I looked at the Petersberg Tasks, which I believe come under a Christian ethos, including the idea of humanitarianism, rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management.  All these areas represent extending the hand of friendship and support to those less well off in the world who are struggling.  I feel very comfortable in supporting the Bill from that point of view.  It is logical and practical and allows the State to engage in procurement that will strengthen capacity thereby facilitating our Permanent Defence Force participating in a safe way in United Nations-mandated missions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Capacity building and training can only benefit the Defence Forces.  We need to consider the morale of our troops.  They all want to work hard, be trained properly and have appropriate facilities.  The supply of the best and safest equipment can only be welcomed.  I ask the Minister to continue to invest so that our equipment is the best.  Following from the White Paper in the past ten years the latest equipment has been provided, including APCs and LPAVs coming on stream.  We have new helicopters and uniforms.  We are all aware of the very hot and humid conditions our troops have needed to endure in Chad.  They have had the proper uniforms etc. allowing them to participate in these missions.  I urge the Minister to continue with this funding stream even in these difficult times and not to allow the Defence Forces&rsquo; very high standards to diminish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke about morale.  Other Senators spoke about how our soldiers are struggling in these very straitened and difficult times.  From speaking to those who come to my clinics I am only too well aware that they depend on family income supplement to make ends meet.  I ask the Minister to be aware of this because they are civil servants and are absolutely stymied by not being able to participate in a strike.  It is incumbent on us to look out for and watch over these people.  These soldiers are the mainstay of our towns.  They are feeling the pinch like everybody else but have very little voice.  I am also concerned about the brain drain with the fear of tax on retirement lump sums.  I am aware of many people who are retiring.  I ask the Minister to try to find ways to keep the <i>cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</i> within the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>I also acknowledge the major community involvement of the Defence Forces.  Last week I attended a fund-raising concert in Mullingar organised by the Mullingar Army barracks for the hospice.  Last year it was the stroke fund.  An amazing amount of community events take place in Athlone also.  I commend the Bill which is a mechanism to provide for the Army to co-operate in missions associated with the European Defence Agency and I entirely welcome it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Donohoe for apparently giving way, probably operating on the age principle.  From his attendance at debates in the Seanad the Minister will notice that interesting little nuggets of information often emerge.  I was interested to learn that my colleague, Senator McFadden, has sergeant major blood in her.  An immediate word of warning will need to be issued to Deputy Bannon in case of there being a skirmish at the bridge of Athlone.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael welcomes the legislation which provides clarification.  If this legislation had been passed in advance of the Lisbon treaty referendum, many of the irrelevant debates and spurious arguments from the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners would have been unnecessary.  In a sense this legislation <Col N="413"/>might be a tidying-up operation, but it allows us the opportunity to say a few words on our views of the Army, where it stands internationally and what its role should be.  There have been some interesting observations on our neutrality.  I listened with great interest to Senator O&rsquo;Toole in outlining his difficulty, which I believe we would all share, in trying to classify neutrality.  We can wrap the word around ourselves like a shroud from time to time.  It becomes one of these Irish phrases that can mean what one wants it to mean.  In today&rsquo;s complicated modern world where Ireland plays a major role in Europe and Europe plays a major role in the politics and economics of the world, we should have a debate in the future about what neutrality means particularly for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces, of which we can be very proud, play a major role in the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations worldwide.  This legislation will allow them to continue to do so.  We need to clarify the grey area between peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  Senator McFadden spoke about Army equipment.  At a time when the economy is in a significant state of distress we need to be careful that our Army personnel and particularly those going overseas are not only trained to the highest standards as they have always been, but also enjoy the finest standard of equipment.  While I know the Minister has spoken about this matter previously, it is important to put the equipping of the Army to the fore of the debate.  We need to ensure it has the highest standard of not just military equipment, but also safety equipment.  In that regard it has been interesting to watch certain channels covering other armies in other wars.  Some of the armies at present engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan appear to suffer from the disadvantage of having inadequate equipment and most importantly inadequate safety equipment.  We need to try to ensure that the Irish Army when engaged on peacekeeping missions does not suffer in that regard.</P>
        <P>Regarding the state of the economy, one of the traditions in this State was that in many towns, including Fermoy, Athlone and Longford, the Army was seen as a significant local employer and generator of economic activity.  As a result of the refocusing of Defence Forces policy in recent years, their personnel numbers have been reduced.  I hope the Minister would still have the capacity to expand in so far as is possible the prospect of people again having a career in the Army, with young people of 17 and 18 having the chance to enlist, perhaps not for a lifetime, but at least for a short period of their lives.  It would allow them to develop new skills, a sense of discipline and a sense of community.  The phrase &ldquo;national service&rdquo; tends to frighten people and is perhaps a concept that we have moved beyond.  However, the Army and its structures can play a significant role in terms of community service.  At a time when 400,000 to 500,000 are unemployed, there are tens of thousands of people who would like to play a proactive role in the life of their community.  I am not suggesting we should have men and women marching up and down the streets of every town and village claiming to be community activists.  Such activity is generally aligned to a particular political grouping.  However, there is scope for the Army to engage in community work in towns and villages throughout the State.  Will the Minister consider how the Army can play a role in that regard?</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, which underpins the ability of the Defence Forces to continue to play a significant role in international peacekeeping.  Our amendment No. 1 relates to the role of the Seanad in respect of the triple lock mechanism.  The Minister has written recently about the role of this House.</P>

At the beginning of the year, in the aftermath of the defeat of the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty and in the run-up to the second referendum, one of the options being considered in public by commentators who have an interest in these matters was that Ireland might seek to opt out of certain defence arrangements as personified by the European Defence Agency.  If media reports are correct, this option was considered by the Cabinet, and the Minister played a significant role in ensuring it was rejected.  That rejection was welcome.  During my time as chairman of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, we spoke to various delegations from Denmark, where an opt-out arrangement has been in place for the last 15 years.  I was struck by how willing the delegates were to speak out against such an option for Ireland and how open they were in pointing out the disadvantages arising from the position they took in terms of their status on the world stage.  They also referred specifically to the disadvantages it conferred upon their army.  If for no other reason, we should all welcome this legislation because it signals that a course of action which would not have been to the advantage of our armed forces or our country was not taken.  That is certainly to be welcomed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose to deal with five aspects of the Bill, on the first of which I may well be a voice of one in the House.  I differ strongly from my colleagues who have offered their support to the triple lock mechanism.  I do not support the concept of a triple lock because I do not understand why members of the United Nations Security Council should have a veto on decisions regarding where our armed forces are deployed.  Such decisions are a matter for the elected Government.  I am aware of one example in 2003 in regard to Macedonia &mdash; perhaps the Minister will clarify this &mdash; where our inability to secure the full support of the United Nations Security Council meant we could not follow a particular course of action.  I wonder whether the successful work of our forces in Sudan might have begun much earlier had we not required the support of the United Nations Security Council and the explicit consent of China for that mission.  In the context of the extensive discussions we have had regarding the pooling of sovereignty on the European stage &mdash; which I support &mdash; I do not see why we would propose to abrogate our sovereignty to the extent that we are willing to offer a veto to an outside agency in respect of decisions on whether our troops will participate in an overseas military operation.  An Irish Government of any political persuasion is elected by the people in order to take those decisions.</P>
        <P>An alternative arrangement is that a simple majority of the Oireachtas, whether in the D&aacute;il or in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, be required in regard to the deployment of our troops abroad.  If we are serious about having a comprehensive discussion in respect of the work done by our military forces abroad, why does the Government not agree to seek the consent of at least one Opposition party before making any decisions in that area?  This would facilitate a more rounded discussion regarding the role played by our forces abroad, the support they need and the environment within which they are operating.  I assume all Opposition parties would always be supportive of the role played by our forces abroad.  It is far preferable that elected represen<Col N="415"/>tatives should have responsibility for decisions in this area rather than the Chinese Government.</P>
        <P>That relates to the second issue I wish to raise, which is the importance of a more comprehensive discussion in regard to neutrality.  Other Members have spoken at length about this.  There is a valuable distinction to be made between being a non-aligned country and a neutral country.  There must be scope for debate in order to clarify the role of our forces abroad.  It is important to bear in mind that we are discussing a concept that does not have statutory footing; it is not enshrined in legislation but is rather a matter of policy.  We should be more engaged in refining that policy for a world that is very different to the one in which that policy was created in the 1930s.</P>
        <P>The third issue relates to the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  I welcome his acknowledgment that what is involved in permanent structured co-operation requires fleshing out.  This is a new concept that will be ushered in by the Lisbon treaty.  The latter makes clear that permanent structured co-operation arrangements must respect the military and foreign policy heritage of every participating country.  I am pleased the Minister has recognised that we must do some work to figure out what is involved in this regard.  It is important that we have that discussion in public, as argued for by colleagues on the other side of the House.  There was genuine fear among a substantial minority of the population regarding what that would involve.  We will do ourselves and the country a service if we ensure that discussion is conducted in public.</P>
        <P>The fourth issue I wish to raise is the role of the European Defence Agency.  Unlike my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, I welcome this institution as something that will be of benefit to the country and to the work done by European forces abroad.  The agency should have a role in strengthening the regulation of the arms trade within Europe.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, if we are to increase efficiency in how armaments or the facilities European armies need are purchased and to achieve value for money, there is an opportunity to improve the transparency in regulation within which those purchases take place and the EDA could play a role in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden made the point well that because our forces are unable to participate in the civil arrangements open to other members of society, it is incumbent on us to do what we can to respect that and to protect them.  There is a growing trend abroad and in the UK, in particular, for former members of the defence forces to take on political roles when they retire.  David Cameron recently appointed a former chief of staff to serve him.  The non-willingness of members of our Defence Forces to get involved in politics must be commended because it would do them and the support they enjoy a grave disservice.  As Senator McFadden said, it is incumbent on us all to recognise their needs, given their proud lack of involvement in domestic politics.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I sincerely thank all Members for their interest in the Bill and for their contributions to the debate.  The effect of the legislation will be to increase openness and transparency in decision-making at EU level.  It will provide for appropriate public debate on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in EDA projects and, in the future, on permanent structured co-operation, should that prove to be a worthwhile endeavour for the State.  The qualification that such participation in EDA projects or in permanent structured co-operation be consistent with our participation in UN-mandated operations provides the appropriate safeguard for those concerned regarding our bona fides on those issues.  The Government&rsquo;s sole purpose in participating in the agency is to ensure the Defence Forces have access to capability improvements and developments, which will support them in undertaking the roles assigned to them by the Government, in particular, in their overseas missions.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Seanad has consistently taken the view that the Defence Forces should have the best, most modern equipment available and it has sought reassurances regarding the level of force protection provided to our troops.  I take these key considerations into account in reflecting on our participation in EDA projects and programmes and this informs Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the agency.  It is important to reiterate that decisions on involving ourselves in specific EDA projects or participating in permanent structured co-operation will remain the sole prerogative of the Government and the Oireachtas.  It is reassuring that Senators appreciate that where an agency project will assist the enhancement of capabilities for an operation to which Ireland contributes troops, it is important to consider the benefits the State can obtain from such participation.</P>
        <P>In addition, while we may not be involved in specific projects, it is nonetheless essential that we are supportive of initiatives to improve capabilities for overseas operations generally.  In a climate of diminishing budgets, Senators will also agree there is a need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in spending.  The focus of the EDA on assisting member states in obtaining better value for existing spending and securing greater efficiencies will be particularly beneficial.  If involvement in EDA projects affords us an opportunity to achieve economies of scale in defence procurement, that would be valuable from a defence expenditure perspective, especially in the current economic environment.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke and others praised the role of our troops in peacekeeping abroad.  I appreciate that and I will pass on these sentiments to the Army.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke also wanted to know how the EDA will work in practice, whether there will be a centre of excellence and whether there will be group purchasing of equipment and so on.  With regard to how the agency works, all members have access to significant research it conducts on developing capabilities for operations abroad.  Ireland has only participated in one project, which was related to force protection and how to develop better body armour and anti-improvised device, anti-booby trap and anti-sniper mechanisms.  In other words, the project we have engaged in is solely related to how best to ensure the safety of our troops in hostile environments abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of group purchasing, the European armaments market has traditionally been fragmented.  Research I referred to in the Lower House was quoted, which indicates the Pentagon achieves four times the value for every dollar it spends on armaments compared to European countries that participate in UN operations.  One of the central purposes of the EDA is to regulate and centralise the market in order that we can buy the best equipment at the cheapest rate and that is working.  Whether that evolves into a European centre of excellence or group purchasing will probably be tied to permanent structured co-operation.  It has not been developed yet.  A list has been prepared by different members under the aegis of the EDA to show what the capability requirements will be in the next two decades and how we can access them.</P>
        <P>Senator Kieran Phelan referred to interoperability, which is important.  We operate aboard with other armies and interoperability decrees that our weapons systems are compatible, otherwise troops cannot operate effectively if different components of the UN authorised missions have different weaponry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn raised the issue of radar protection for naval operations, which was discussed at the meeting of defence Ministers in Sweden recently.  That work is ongoing.  The Senator was anxious that we would secure more help from the EU to patrol our coast but the purpose of the EDA is to allow us to develop systems, both through research and purchasing, to carry out such functions ourselves.  On the other hand, the maritime centre established in Lisbon has <Col N="417"/>provided wonderful intelligence for the Naval Service and it has enabled the conviction of a number of people for the biggest attempted drugs importation into the State ever, as the centre was able to go back and track the shipment from the Caribbean.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn made interesting comments on the need for more focus on helping countries to help themselves and get back on their feet rather than sending in troops to keep the peace.  That is the emphasis of UN mandated operations since the definition was expanded in the Petersberg Tasks.  There is more emphasis on not only helping to re-establish civil society but to provide assistance to these countries to train their armies, police forces and so on to look after themselves.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle said we must be careful about the general role of the EDA and where Ireland sees itself.  Ireland sees itself as a neutral country and an often overlooked fact is that decisions of the agency require unanimity.  That means that if one or more member countries such as France or Germany want to take European defence policy in a certain direction, we can block that because it can only move in that direction with the unanimous approval of members of the EDA board.  That enables us to protect our principles and our world view at EDA level.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the question of the transit of troops through Shannon Airport.  Shannon has been used as a stopping-off point during various conflicts.  I am reliably informed that in 1962, Russian troops <i>en route</i> to Cuba at the start of the Cuban missile crisis refuelled in Shannon.  When American troops began to transit through Shannon at the outbreak of the Iraq war some other countries loudly proclaimed their neutrality.  In one such country an outgoing government won an election on the basis of its neutrality in these matters.  However, when there were protests in Ireland about the transit of troops through Shannon those very countries rushed to offer their facilities, because of the revenue that was going to be generated.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole dealt very well with the record of some of those countries such as Sweden and Switzerland which are held up as models of neutrality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Doherty wanted to know what our definition or concept of neutrality was.  I could give a long dissertation on this subject but I will keep my remarks simple.  Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of neutrality is that we do not participate in any military alliance, such as NATO or the old Warsaw Pact, and that we do not become involved in any mutual or common defence agreement.  In fact, we are prohibited by the Constitution from doing the latter.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty also expressed scepticism about our membership of the EDA.  Other Senators dealt very well with the reasons why we should be part of the EDA.  Senator Doherty is also, predictably, fearful that we might become involved in enhanced structural co-operation.  We recently had a difficulty in Chad because the United Nations, which had promised to supply air support for us, failed to do so, even after a number of force generation conferences.  We had hurriedly to acquire air support ourselves and a mistake was made in the procurement procedure, for which we all hold our hands up.  My idea of enhanced structural co-operation is that a number of countries should get together to provide a pool of assets which could be used <Col N="418"/>by whichever countries were participating in the peacekeeping mission.  This is at a very early stage of development and we do not know how it will pan out.</P>
        <P>If a number of European countries get together in the form of enhanced structural co-operation, they will not be able to launch a mission on their own.  Any decisions on defence and security must be taken unanimously.  Every country will have a veto, regardless of whether it is part of the enhanced structural co-operation group.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney pointed out, correctly, that the EDA helps to reduce the cost of equipment and provides for interoperability and so on.  I also support what she said about the scare created about a European army.  During the first Lisbon treaty referendum campaign I got the impression I had missed something and that no sooner would the ink be dry on the treaty than press gangs would arrive at 4 o&rsquo;clock the following morning, as in the days of the old British navy, break into people&rsquo;s houses, seize their younger children, conscript them into a European army and land them in the front line in Afghanistan within 24 hours.  The main advocates of that point of view came from Senator Doherty&rsquo;s party.  I was engaged in a debate on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s radio show with the former MEP, Mary Lou McDonald.  She trotted out those old arguments while I pointed out to her that there were various guarantees, that there would not be a European army and that the Constitution precluded us from becoming involved in mutual defence.  There was a certain familiarity about her arguments.  When I did some research I found they are the very same arguments Sinn F&eacute;in has used in every European debate since 1973.  They simply change the date.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins was worried about barracks closures.  There will be a certain amount of dislocation and there is a change of station allowance of &euro;3,500.  Much money has been spent, and more remains to be spent, on making the new barracks acceptable and suitable.  However, a deeper policy is involved here.  It is not simply a question of cost cutting.  The Army high command takes the view that collective training and a smaller number of bigger units is now preferable.  This is particularly advisable in the case of force protection.  When people go abroad it is important that they would have trained together previously.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins also mentioned a threat I am alleged to have made to PDFORRA.  I assure the Senator there was no threat.  I simply pointed out what PDFORRA is entitled to do under the arrangement my Department has with it.  That arrangement is enshrined in law and the organisation fully accepts it.  I can assure the House that PDFORRA and RACO are well able to represent themselves.  I keep my door open to them at all times.  In fact, I received correspondence from them in recent days asking for another meeting, although we had one very recently.  I will certainly accede to that request.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson also referred to the spectre of conscription which was conjured up during the Lisbon treaty debate.  Senator Wilson also asked me about the current recruitment policy.  The White Paper provides for 10,500 serving men and women in the Army, Naval Service and Air Force.  The McCarthy report recommended reducing that to 10,000 over a two to three-year period.  We have not accepted that recommendation and no Government decision has been made to reduce the appropriate size of the Defence Forces to 10,000.  On the other hand, the embargo on recruitment operates very harshly on the Defence Forces due to the large turnover in all military organisations.  We are now down to 10,018.  I have made a case to the Minister for Finance to allow me to resume recruitment to ensure we do not drop below 10,000.  I expect a response to that request before the week is out.  I hope it will be positive.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the question of neutrality and pointed out that the EU was powerless to intervene in the slaughter in the Balkans.  That would not be the case now.  There have been a number of developments such as the expanded definition of the Petersberg Tasks and the <Col N="419"/>new tendency for organisations such as the EU and the African Union to get UN sanction and then organise missions.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the Israeli company from which we acquired parts at a cost of &euro;2.3 million.  This is not a Government operation.  It is a private company.  As Senator Norris acknowledged, we must go to tender in these matters.  If one were to try to find a company selling arms which had not at some stage in its existence sold arms for some purpose with which one did not agree, one would have a very hard job and might not get the best value for money.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the question of recruitment to the Defence Forces.  I hope my representations to the Minister for Finance will be successful in that regard.  Senator Leyden also raised the question of promotions in the Army, which is a very relevant matter.  I have asked the Minister for Finance to allow me to make a number of targeted promotions so as to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden asked me to continue to invest to ensure the best equipment for the Army.  I will do that.  Her concerns about the brain drain will be dealt with by the promotions I hope to make.  The Army has a community involvement.  Unfortunately, resources have forced the Army to cut back on this area of activity in the past year or so but it will be maintained as far as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford mentioned the conflict between peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  They are, obviously, two different things.  The Petersberg Tasks now allow the United Nations to sanction missions for peace enforcement in addition to traditional peacekeeping.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe referred to the opt out of defence arrangements.  Many issues were discussed by the Cabinet, in particular in the lead-up to the second Lisbon treaty referendum campaign.  However, the Cabinet never gave serious consideration to opting out of the European defence arrangements.</P>
        <P>I take Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s point about not supporting the triple lock.  I had this debate with his colleague, Deputy Timmins, when he was defence spokesman in the previous D&aacute;il.  The majority of European countries seek a United Nations mandate.  I take the point that any member of the UN Security Council can veto a decision.  If one looks at the original proposal, it was that it would be the UN Security Council or the UN General Assembly.  Effectively, that has never worked.  In practice, it has always been the UN Security Council.  This has more to do with how the United Nations does its business.  We see the United Nations as the lodestar in this regard.</P>
        <P>I do not necessarily agree with Senator Donohoe that we would have been able to intervene earlier in Chad but for the triple lock.  What really held up our involvement in Chad was the question of force generation.  We had an unprecedented five force generation meetings before we got sufficient equipment and sufficient troops in the field to make the mission doable.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for taking this Bill at short notice.  I join in the kind sentiments expressed by various Members for the Defence Forces generally and, in particular, in regard to service by the Defence Forces in overseas peace support missions.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, subsection (1), line 36, to delete &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I had not realised the Minister had written extensively to Seanad &Eacute;ireann until Senator Bradford pointed it out.  We must pass this legislation to provide for the security and betterment of the Defences Forces when they go overseas and to ensure they have proper training and the best equipment.  However, if we participate in a project, whether a European Defence Agency one or permanent structured co-operation one, that it does not have to come to this House for approval is peculiar to say the least.  We are dealing with the primary legislation but if we participate in a project, it need only go before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister accepts this amendment in order that Seanad &Eacute;ireann as well as D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is notified if the Government makes a decision.  There is no reason it could not go to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the same time.  A number of Senators are nominated by Defence Forces&rsquo; unions to run for election to the Seanad.  There is a direct link between this House and the Defence Forces.  I urge the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  I echo Senator Burke&rsquo;s sentiments, in particular as somebody who receives a nomination from the Defence Forces.  As I said earlier, I would not be here if I did not.  The Minister will be heartened by today&rsquo;s debate and the number of Senators showing interest in it.  That has always been the way in regard to his Ministry.  It is heartening for those of us on this side of the House to see Fine Gael table such an amendment, in particular in light of its leader&rsquo;s comments a few weeks ago.  Obviously, Seanad &Eacute;ireann has a future.  If participation in a project must go before the D&aacute;il, why should the Seanad not be involved too?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment in principle.  It is the very point I raised on Second Stage.  The triple lock mechanism does not include Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  If there was a method to provide for consultation with Seanad &Eacute;ireann, that would be very welcome.  The reason I did not table an amendment was that I was advised there was a constitutional prohibition of some kind.  If a referendum of some sort is required for reform of the Seanad, which I do not believe would be necessary, then this is something that should be contemplated by the Government, that is, to include the Upper House of Parliament in these very important matters. <Col N="421"/> I understand there is a constitutional prohibition but the Minister, along with his advisers, may be able to find some mechanism for at least consultation with Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  That is very important.</P>
        <P>These are vital matters and could be matters of life and death involving Irish citizens risking their lives.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann certainly has a role to play in this.  It might have a voice which would be of use.  Although we do not have a role in this matter, I have been contacted by a member of the Defence Forces whose material was anonymous.  He is very concerned about the state of readiness, equipment and investment in the Army.  It is very difficult to raise these issues at this point because the country is in such economic difficulties.  I would not be able to urge them strongly.  However, it is significant.  Previously, I have been contacted about various military matters and to neuter Seanad &Eacute;ireann in this way in the 21st century is absurd.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments.  It is very important Seanad &Eacute;ireann is consulted on such important matters.  We made several comments on safety issues in Chad in debates in the House and we were proved right on several of them.  In regard to the aside from Senator Feeney, I assure her Fine Gael will work as usual to ensure Seanad &Eacute;ireann works in a proper manner as long as it is in being.  We will do everything possible to improve the institution as long as it is here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The effect of the three amendments would be to require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of any decision to participate in an EDA project or programme or in a permanent structured co-operation one.  Much as I would like to accept the amendments, my advice is that I cannot.  The proposal that any such decision would require the approval of both Houses was considered by the Government in some detail during the discussions on this Bill.  It was rejected by the Government, which had access to the advice of the Attorney General, on the basis that it was incompatible with the provisions of the Constitution in regard to the role of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in defence matters and the provisions of the existing Defence Acts.  Under the Constitution a declaration of war is a function reserved to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann alone.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann has no role in the matter.  In the Defence (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1960, as amended, decisions regarding the deployment of the Defence Forces on UN-mandated overseas peace support operations is reserved to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann alone where such approval is required.  Consistent with the provisions of the Constitution in regard to a declaration of war, Seanad &Eacute;ireann has no role in the decision process regarding the overseas deployment of the Defence Forces.  Against that background, it was felt to be entirely inappropriate that a decision to participate in an EDA project or programme or to participate in permanent structured co-operation, a decision of much lesser significance than a declaration of war, or a decision to deploy troops on a peace support operation, would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Decisions on the EDA or permanent structured co-operation cannot have a higher decision threshold than a decision in respect of a declaration of war or the overseas deployment of Defence Forces personnel.  Therefore, I am compelled to reject these amendments on the basis of proportionality, compatibility with the Constitution in the Defence Acts and on the basis that the matter has already been considered and rejected by Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I point out that while there is no requirement for the Seanad to approve Ireland&rsquo;s participation in any of these missions, there is nothing to prevent it from debating it, asking questions about it, etc.  I am advised that is what happened in regard to the deployment of troops to Chad.  The world does not end on the day the Government takes a decision to deploy troops.  It is an ongoing situation.  As Minister for Defence and having been very much involved with the Chad operation, I know many of the suggestions and comments made in this House <Col N="422"/>in regard to the Chad mission were extremely useful to us and, as has been said by Senator Cummins and others, extremely valid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>My initial response is far be it for me to go against the advice of the Attorney General.  The Finance Bill has to come before the Seanad and if amendments to it would pose a charge on the Exchequer, they would be ruled out of order, but the amendments to this Bill have not been ruled out of order.  Therefore, I find the Minister&rsquo;s response peculiar.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice appeared to suggest the amendments I tabled should have been ruled out of order, but they were not.  The Minister has the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice in regard to what I propose.  As Senator Cummins said, we had a debate in this House on the Defence Forces before our troops were sent to Chad and a number of important matters in regard to the mission were raised, which the Government took into account at that time.  I would like to hear the comments of other Senators on this amendment before I might put the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that.  That was what the Minister said.  I am simply taking him up on that and emphasising the point.</P>
        <P>It is curious that an amendment in my name was ruled out of order on the basis that it was outside the scope of the Bill, whereas the Fine Gael amendments, although apparently unconstitutional, were not ruled out of order and were permitted to be discussed.  That appears to be all of a piece with the chaos that we have here today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand Article 29 of the Constitution comes into play here and perhaps the Minister could confirm that.  Even though we are galloping ahead, perhaps an amendment could be tabled on Report Stage.  I will happily collaborate with my Fine Gael colleagues or perhaps the Minister will table an amendment.  I am happy to table one stating that &ldquo;the Government shall consult with Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  That does not require the approval of the House but it would enshrine in legislation what apparently is already the practice of the Government.  The Minister might comment on that because he has been generous in his comments about the useful role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in discussions, for example, about sending troops to Chad.  He instanced that as a matter where, although it was a requirement that there should be approval by the Seanad, at the same time useful advice had been given.  The Minister has already said that consultation with the Seanad was useful.  Will he bring forward an amendment, which would take only a few minutes to prepare, which enshrines in legislation the existing practice to ensure it does not conflict with anything in the Constitution or in Government policy?  I strongly urge the Government to take that on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the analogy drawn by a distinguished colleague on the Fine Gael benches, Senator Paddy Burke, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, with regard to the Finance Bill, I might slightly cavil with what he said.  They are not amendments.  We are not allowed to table amendments; we are allowed to put recommendations.  If an amendment to the Constitution is considered, that should be something that should be examined by Government.  If we want to strengthen the role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, first, it should be required that we express a clear view, and perhaps even to the point of approval, in respect of military adventures of various kinds, and, second, why on earth should we not be entrusted with some degree of financial responsibility?  We have a number of very distinguished people, particularly on the Independent benches, who <Col N="423"/>have commented widely, most of it regrettably outside this House, in the newspapers and on radio and television because Members do not have the authority to do it here.</P>

	<P>I hope we will not make a bags of these amendments.  The Minister mentioned the advice of the Attorney General in regard to going to war.  I do not believe we have any intention of going to war.  Would the advice in regard to peacekeeping be different from that in regard to going to war?  Would a different clause apply in regard to peacekeeping duties, which is what we are speaking about in this case?  If the Minister is prepared, as Senator Norris has proposed, to table an amendment on Report Stage providing for consultation with the Seanad in this respect, we would go along with that.  We want to co-operate.  Otherwise, we will take our chances and vote on the amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Minister replies, I would like him to comment on one brief point.  I believe there is a defect in his logic because he said that since we were not permitted a role in the major and most serious matter of declaring war, we are therefore debarred from having a role in a minor matter.  I do not see the logic in that.  I would have thought that it would be appropriate perhaps if we were untrustworthy, but we could surely be trusted with even the lesser task.  I do not follow the Minister&rsquo;s logic, although I am sure a man of his intellectual agility will manufacture one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Flattery will get the Senator everywhere.  A copy of the Constitution has been handed to me.  The relevant article is Article 28.3.1&deg;.  Whatever about the Finance Bill, Article 28.3.1&deg; of the Constitution states: &ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  The article goes on to deal with what happens in the case of actual invasion and states the Government may take the appropriate action and call the D&aacute;il together as quickly as possible.  This is the only area of policy where there is such a provision in the Constitution.  Elsewhere, the Seanad is involved to a greater or lesser degree.  We did not seek formal advice but we discussed the matter at Cabinet and, as I understand it, the view of the Attorney General appears to be that if one could go to war with the consent of one House of the Oireachtas, namely the Lower House, <Col N="424"/>then for something less serious, such as participation in an EDA project or in permanent structured co-operation, it would be illogical to have to surmount the higher barrier of requiring approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the reasoning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the Attorney General is incorrect in his view.  I will tell the House precisely why and I can substantiate it.  The Attorney General is relying on the absence of a requirement; he is not relying on a prohibition.  I call on the Minister to take back to the Attorney General the undoubted fact that the 1937 Constitution is an organic entity.  It did not stop on the day it was signed into law in 1937.  As has been demonstrated in serial fashion by many litigants, including myself, it contains what have been described in textbooks as unenumerated rights.  In other words, the door is by no means closed on this House.  The Attorney General is wrong.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Norris.  We should introduce an amendment on Report Stage, even if it is to change the need to consult from a war situation to that of a peacekeeping capacity.  There is no question about it; we are not going to war.  The missions under discussion are peacekeeping missions and I urge the Minister to accept that.  I will withdraw the amendment in favour of the words of Senator Norris if the Minister will accept them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unlikely for such an amendment to be tabled in time for Report Stage.  It would have to go back to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If it would help the Cathaoirleach, will the Minister indicate if there is any possibility of it?  If not, the matter is finished but it would be good if there were such a possibility, even if it meant coming back for ten minutes or so at the end of the sitting.  It would show the Seanad is doing its duty and there can be no possible conflict with Government policy or existing practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about the divergence of views on the Constitution between the Attorney General and Senator Norris, I must proceed with the Attorney General&rsquo;s view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a second point.  Under the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, the deployment of troops overseas requires only the consent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The deployment of troops would be regarded as a more serious matter than simply getting involved in a particular EDA project and the same argument applies in this case.  Even before the amendment was acceptable in any case and even without the constitutional argument, we would have to amend the Defence (Amendment) Act 1960 first.  Otherwise, the situation would be totally illogical.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
       <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am operating on the basis of the advice I have.  There is a legislative problem as well.  The 1960 Act only requires the D&aacute;il to approve the deployment of troops overseas.  If the D&aacute;il alone can authorise the deployment of troops overseas, how could there be a situation in which there was a requirement involving both Houses of the Oireachtas for engagement in some very minor EDA project relating to forced protection, the type of uniforms, etc.?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no requirement.  It is called consultation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept a legal obligation to consult.  It is the practice now to bring these matters to the Seanad and, indeed, the Seanad can initiate such matters.  I assure the House that as long as I remain in this job that situation will continue to pertain.</P>

	<P>I received the usual courteous note from the Cathaoirleach indicating that amendment No. 1<i>a</i> had been ruled out of order on the basis that it was outside the scope of the Bill.  It is difficult for me to understand how it is, as it seems to be very much part of the general considerations.  The European Defence Agency is the central element of the Bill; therefore, it remains very obscure to me how a vital matter, on which I emphasise I received clear undertakings from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, remains outside the scope of the Bill.  Is the Cathaoirleach in a position to advise me from where this direction came?  Of course, I accept the wisdom of his experience and the views of the Attorney General, but I ask whether this view came from the Department, the staff of the House or the Attorney General?  As a result of the very chaotic ordering of business today, I only entered the amendment 25 minutes ago; therefore, I do not know how wide or serious the consultation was.  This highlights the great defects of railroading legislation through in this astonishing way with such extraordinary speed.  I do not believe it allows time to engage in proper professional consultation or receive advice.</P>

	<P>The Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2009 will transfer certain <Col N="428"/>foreshore functions from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In addition, it will transfer responsibility for the Dumping at Sea Acts to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Other than the transfer of functions and the modernisation of certain phrases and references, the Bill makes no significant amendments to these Acts.</P>
        <P>When forming the Government in 2007, it was decided to transfer certain coastal functions from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The marine functions and staff of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources transferred directly to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  At the time the Attorney General advised that primary legislation would be required to effect the transfer of the foreshore functions.  That is the basis on which the Bill is presented.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The foreshore consists of the land from the high water mark to the 12 nautical mile limit and comprises roughly 57% of the land area of the Twenty-six Counties.  In recent years the size, scale and complexity of projects developed on the foreshore have changed considerably.  At one time foreshore consents covered primarily small piers and jetties but more recently an increasing number concern major State and private sector infrastructural projects such as municipal wastewater treatment plants, large commercial harbour developments, gas pipelines and large-scale offshore wind, wave and tidal energy projects.  In dealing with such scale and complexity it is vital that the development of these large projects accord with the development plans for the functional areas of the local authorities to which they are contiguous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Land based and offshore developments in the coastal zone impact on each other in significant ways notwithstanding the different environmental conditions in each zone.  Balancing the impact of a development on another zone is a major component of the impact assessment of such projects.  At a higher level it is also essential to align and integrate the strategic development plans for both zones.  The integration of developments in the coastal zone has been an issue throughout Europe, leading the European Commission to issue recommendations in this regard.  In all countries the integration of the onshore and offshore development processes has proved difficult.</P>
        <P>With the integration of onshore and offshore developments foremost in mind, the Government decided on the transfer of certain marine functions from my Department to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This will allow for the development of a framework approach to planning in the coastal zone which seeks to integrate and balance the various planning and development requirements on either side of the high water mark.  In deciding the transfer of these functions the Government is guided by the primary function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which is pursuing sustainable development.  The modernisation of the development consent process can best be served by aligning the onshore and offshore consent processes within a single Department, particularly given the nature and scale of recent infrastructural project applications.</P>
        <P>At the same time, the support of aquaculture and sea fishing related projects needs to be secured, given the often isolated locations of the coastal communities which these industries support.  The grant of a foreshore licence for an aquaculture project is currently an outcome of detailed consideration of the aquaculture licence application which must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement.  It would be inappropriate and inefficient if two Departments were required to license the same aquaculture installation based on the same environmental impact statement.  For this reason, the assessment of foreshore consents for projects <Col N="429"/>which are for the support of sea fishing or aquaculture will remain in the fisheries division of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>The transfer of the foreshore functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been the subject of ongoing discussion and planning between officials from both Departments.  The transfer of the relevant functions has been dealt with in two phases.  The first phase did not require legislative change and took place in November 2008 when the shellfish waters directive and integrated coastal zone management functions transferred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This Bill will complete the second &mdash; legislative &mdash; phase of the transfer process.</P>
        <P>Certain sections of the Foreshore Act 1933 concern the overall management of the coastal zone rather than the licensing of developments on the foreshore.  For example, section 6 of the Foreshore Act 1933 provides the means to prohibit the removal of beach material, while section 11 of that Act provides for the removal of dilapidated structures.  In order to provide for the coherent management of the coastal zone under one administration, these and other coastal management functions are being transferred in full to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In addition to transferring the relevant functions, the Bill contains a number of necessary amendments to support and manage the transfer of functions between the Ministers.  In drafting the Bill an opportunity was taken to update and modernise the terminology and references in the Foreshore Act 1933.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides the mechanism, whereby the functions transferred by the Bill may be recombined under a single Minister at any point in the future.  This section provides for the functions to be recombined by means of an order under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.  This would obviate the need for primary legislation to recombine the functions.  Section 5 of the Bill contains amendments and additions to the definitions in the Foreshore Act 1933.  These are necessary to give clarity to the respective areas of responsibility of the Ministers concerned.</P>
        <P>The primary mechanism in the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill to give effect to the transfer of the functions concerned is contained in section 6.  This section defines the type of foreshore consents to be considered by each Minister.  Where a foreshore application concerns a development which is for the support or development of sea fishing, aquaculture or a development in a fishery harbour centre, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will consider it.  In all other cases the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will consider applications.  Throughout the Bill there are references to the &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo;.  In each section the appropriate Minister is determined by reference to section 6.</P>
        <P>Sections 7 and 8 provide for a consultation mechanism between the two Ministers.  In addition, the annual payment limit at which each Minister may agree a licence or lease without reference to the Department of Finance has been increased from the &pound;10 stated in the Foreshore Act 1933 to &pound;50,000, or &euro;63,250.  This reflects the administrative arrangements in place between the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Section 9 modernises the reference to the Judiciary in the Act.  Section 10 is an amendment to the environmental impact assessment legislation, as a consequence of the meaning assigned to &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; in section 6.  Section 11 deletes from the 1933 Act a reference to the Irish Land Commission as that body is no longer in existence.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides a mechanism for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make regulations to specify bodies and timeframes for consultation where he or she is considering a foreshore consent.  This reflects the existing practice in the foreshore <Col N="430"/>application process, whereby a wide range of bodies are consulted before consent is granted or refused.</P>
        <P>Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, are amendments to the foreshore public participation regulations.  This is as a consequence of the meaning assigned to &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; in section 6.  Section 16 updates the reference to local authority in the Act in line with recent legislation.</P>
        <P>Sections 17 to 19, inclusive, give the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the ministerial role of applying to the courts for prohibitory orders for the protection of the foreshore and adjacent seashore and the prosecution of offences.  Sections 20 and 21 are consequential amendments to the Fisheries Acts as a consequence of the meaning assigned to &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; in section 6.  Sections 22 to 27, inclusive, are transitional measures to provide for the transfer of the ongoing work between the Departments which have been working together on the drafting of the Bill and the administrative arrangements necessary for the ongoing support of the functions transferring.  Agreement has been reached between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the reallocation of the necessary staff and resources for the functions being transferred.  The officials in each Department are committed to working together to ensure the continuity of service and to develop a modern framework for managing the foreshore functions.  The two Departments will work together through an interdepartmental committee to ensure the effectiveness of the measures implemented in the Bill.</P>
        <P>It is intended to develop a new framework for the management of the coastal zone which will provide a modern, effective and integrated legal framework for the management of the State&rsquo;s foreshore estate.  Such a framework will take account, <i>inter alia</i>, of the public participation directive, the principles in the EU recommendation on integrated coastal zone management, the outcome of the EU maritime Green Paper, the marine strategy directive and the EU roadmap on maritime spatial planning.  These matters are under active consideration by the marine co-ordination group.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the administration of the Dumping at Sea Acts will transfer to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Part 3 of the Bill provides for this transfer.  The Dumping at Sea Acts ban incineration at sea, the dumping of radioactive waste and offshore installations and all toxic, harmful and noxious substances up to 350 miles offshore to coincide with Ireland&rsquo;s portion of the Continental Shelf.  The Acts enable the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to grant permits for certain dumping, as specified in the permits and subject to such conditions as the Minister may specify.  They also empower the courts to impose such monetary penalties and-or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years as they may decide on conviction on indictment of any person for illegal dumping as defined by the Acts.</P>
        <P>All applications for dumping at sea permits are carefully considered by the Department with the assistance of specialist advisers from the marine licence vetting committee which meets frequently as business demands.  Detailed guidelines have been published by the Department to assist applicants.  Copies of the guidelines are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Applicants are obliged to consider thoroughly all non-dumping at sea options and, in particular, other beneficial uses such as beach nourishment and land reclamation.  Non-dumping solutions have been successfully pursued in a number of cases and are addressed in the context of five year dredging plans by ports and other harbours in agreement with the Department.  Material for dumping at sea is thoroughly assessed prior to dumping.  Approximately 12 dumping at sea permits are granted each year.</P><Col N="431"/>
        <P>The type of material which may be disposed of at sea is governed by the international OSPAR agreement, titled &ldquo;Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic done at Paris on the 22nd Day of September 1992&rdquo;.  Dumping at sea permits are granted exclusively for the dumping of dredge spoil at a specified site.  Generally, this is as a result of port and harbour dredging which is carried out for maintenance and development purposes.  Details of the permits granted are published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>  on an annual basis and kept in a public register in the Department as required under the 1996 Act.  Details of these permits are also published on the Department&rsquo;s website on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is the primary caretaker of the environment in the State.  The key role for the agency in licensing the disposal of waste is managing the impact of the waste on the environment.  Waste licensing involves the control of large-scale waste and industrial activities to ensure that they do not endanger human health or harm the environment.  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has the lead role in managing water quality in the State.</P>
        <P>The EPA, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is responsible for the implementation of the European Union water framework directive.  The directive is important EU environmental legislation which aims to improve our water environment.  It requires governments to take a new holistic approach to managing their waters and applies to rivers, lakes, groundwater, estuaries and coastal waters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The transfer of the administration of the Dumping at Sea Acts from the Department to the Environmental Protection Agency will provide the agency with the opportunity to integrate fully the disposal of dredge spoil at sea with its current waste management licensing system and will assist in the delivery of the water framework directive project.  Part 3 provides for the transfer of the dumping at sea function from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Environmental Protection Agency.  A number of minor consequential amendments are necessary because of the transfer of the functions to the agency.  In addition the opportunity has been taken to revise the powers of authorised officers in line with the powers of authorised officers in other, more recent legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 29 transfers responsibility for dumping at sea to the Environmental Protection Agency and vests the functions in the agency.  Section 32 amends section 4 of the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 to provide that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland rather than the Minister will prescribe radioactive substances or material as below low level.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland must consult the Environmental Protection Agency before so prescribing and the Environmental Protection Agency must give notice of the prescribing by having a notice published in the <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  As a transitional measure, the existing low level standing prescribed for radioactive substances or material will remain in force.</P>
        <P>Section 33 provides for the substitution of the Environmental Protection Agency for the Minister, as appropriate, in various instances throughout section 5 of the Dumping at Sea Act 1996.  It also provides for the addition of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the list of Ministers who must be consulted on an application for a permit to dump at sea.</P>
        <P>Section 34 contains amendments to section 6 of the 1996 Act to update the powers of authorised officers to accord with current legislative best practice and take account of technological advances in methods of record keeping, for example, electronic data recorders, digital photographs and such like.</P>
        <P>Section 35 enacts Schedule 2 of the Bill.  Schedule 2 lists by section the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 where the Environmental Protection Agency is substituted for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and a Minister of the Government are substituted as specified in that Schedule.</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>Section 36 contains an amendment to section 7 of the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 to enable the Environmental Protection Agency to bring summary proceedings in respect of offences under that Act.  Section 37 repeals section 13 of the 1996 Act which provided for the payment to the Exchequer of fees collected under the Act.  The effect of this repeal is that these fees may now be retained by the EPA.</P>
        <P>Section 38 contains transitional measures for dumping at sea permit applications which have not been determined by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and for permits granted by that Minister and in force before the commencement of EPA involvement.  Undetermined permit applications will be treated as applications to the agency and permits already granted and in force can be dealt with by the agency as if they had been issued by it.  This section also provides for the continuance of existing authorised officers, post-enactment, and the substitution of the agency for the Minister in any pending legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>The function of the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill is to transfer specific foreshore functions from this Department to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and transfer the dumping at sea functions to the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
        <P>The Bill will assign responsibility for foreshore licensing for commercial and infrastructural projects together with certain coastal zone management functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This will commence the process of aligning marine spatial planning with the onshore spatial planning system.  In addition, responsibility for the Dumping at Sea Acts 1996 to 2006 is allocated to the Environmental Protection Agency which, in conjunction with measures implementing the water framework directive, will provide greater coherency in the sustainable management of water quality in the coastal zone.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill are intended solely to give effect to the allocation of specific foreshore functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the transfer of functions under the Dumping at Sea Acts to the Environmental Protection Agency.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  In also welcoming the Bill, I express disappointment that it has taken many months to have the legislation prepared for debate in the House.  I understand from the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution that the Bill has its genesis in the negotiations to form a Government in 2007.  While I appreciate a number of Departments and agencies were involved in producing the legislation, the inordinate time required to draft it is indicative of the bureaucratic obstacles at the core of our economic difficulties.  The failure to have this Bill enacted sooner has cost jobs.  If we are to learn a lesson from this failure, it is that we must prevent similar delays when enacting other necessary legislation in the pipeline.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given that the political side of the equation appears to have been settled two years ago, it is disappointing that it has taken such a long time to bring the Bill before the House.  There are indications that renewable energy projects, notably in wind and wave energy, have been delayed as a result of the failure to produce this legislation earlier.  The Bill must be passed and sent to the other House for approval as quickly as possible.  In the current economic climate we cannot afford to delay as to do so would cause further job losses.</P>
        <P>I note from the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution that the foreshore comprises 57% of the land area of the Twenty-six Counties.  As such, the Bill may be light in terms of page numbers but it is significant in terms of impact.  The Minister of State correctly noted that foreshore applications and arrangements were previously confined to minor projects such as small piers, jetties etc.  Advances in project development and other areas mean foreshore projects now <Col N="433"/>include wastewater treatment plants, commercial harbour developments, gas pipelines, wind, wave and tidal energy projects.  For this reason, it is vital that we enact the legislation and send a strong signal that Ireland is open for business in terms of these types of projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, which is chaired by my party colleague in the other House, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, has presented legislation to the Government for consideration.  This is the first time an Oireachtas committee has published legislation for consideration by Government.  The proposed legislation focuses heavily on the desirability from an economic and environmental point of view and from the perspective of addressing climate change of making progress on renewable energy projects.  One of the issues raised by the joint committee is the need to modernise our antiquated licensing system.  The committee will no doubt welcome the passage of this legislation as it will allow some of the projects in the pipeline to be considered at an early date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to outline the reasons for the significant delay in bringing the legislation before the House.  While I appreciate that widespread consultation is required when a number of Departments are involved, a delay of two and a half years is excessive.  As I said earlier, it is the sort of delay we must try to remove because, as we often hear, red tape and bureaucracy are stifling enterprise, development and many projects.  We should remove them from all layers of society, especially Departments.  The pace of production for this Bill could have been significantly better.</P>
        <P>One statistic which is presented to us as a possible cost in terms of financial delay and loss from investment in renewable projects over recent years is the creation of 10,000 jobs or &euro;16 billion.  It is to be hoped that when we look at the stark reality of that, we will recognise that we must try to get Bills such as this through the Houses and to the Departments as quickly as possible so these types of projects can come to fruition.</P>
        <P>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State on the consultation periods which will be required under the new legislation.  There is a suggestion that the involvement of the EPA in determining foreshore licensing applications may increase the time needed to process the licences.  I am told the Minister or a Minister of State will have the right to stipulate a statutory period of time within which named organisations have to respond.  I ask the Minister of State to advise on that point and try to ensure delays are kept to a minimum.  I appreciate when one is dealing with licensing, environmental or sensitive marine issues we have to allow an opportunity for all concerns to be raised but there must be some limits put on delays and the windows of opportunity for objections and concerns to be communicated.  There should not be an infinite period of time for consultation and delay.  I ask the Minister of State to advise us on that issue.</P>
        <P>Another matter has been brought to my attention, namely, that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have the right to apply to the High Court to prevent breaches of the Act.  Are there cases before the courts relating to the Act?  How long have they been in train?  Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, inherit a large bill in the transfer of responsibility for foreshore licensing?</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the part of the Bill concerning dumping at sea, I ask the Minister of State to advise me on how many prosecutions have been made under the various Dumping at Sea Acts in recent years.  The EPA will have a new significant responsibility arising from the legislation.  Is it adequately staffed to deal with its new responsibility?  Dumping at sea is a sensitive environmental and marine issue so we must be assured the EPA will have the financial and staffing resources in place to deal with its new responsibilities</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, I welcome having the Bill before us for consideration.  It would be surprising if it was not passed quickly through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is to be hoped that once it is <Col N="434"/>passed there will be much greater certainty and definition regarding the sort of renewable energy projects the country needs such as wave energy and wind farms.  There is an aspiration at Government level and across the entire political establishment that 35%, 40% or 45% of our energy supplies in the future could be secured from renewable sources.  Wave and wind energy would be two key targets for renewable energy.  Therefore, we need to put a proper regulatory framework in place to allow such projects to come to fruition.  This Bill will play a role in that regard.  I welcome the Bill and ask the Minister of State to respond to the issues I raised at the end of the Second Stage debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill and wish to make a few points.  The Bill concerns a provision for the transfer of functions which will help to expedite the issue of foreshore licences.  The current system is antiquated and cumbersome.  As a local authority member and a Deputy in the other House I have experienced severe delays in progressing sewage treatment plants.  For example, in Bantry there was a delay of almost two years before a foreshore licence was issued which delayed the project.  The same happened in Schull, Baltimore, Kinsale and Courtmacsherry, to name but a few cases.  I am being parochial in this regard but those delays cost the State money because on one side a Department pulled back and on the other the Department which had finance wanted to drive the project forward.  The sewage treatment plant in Bantry came 20 years too late.  Raw sewage went into a bay which was the capital of the mussel industry.  The matter has been resolved.  The local authority and the county manager spoke about these schemes and were deeply concerned about the delay and the logistics of how the process operated in the past.  It is to be hoped this might help to resolve the current situation.</P>
        <P>On coastal zone management and the transfer of responsibility for dumping at sea to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I do not want a situation like Lanigan&rsquo;s ball, where I step in, you step out and we all step in together and we are shifting the onus of blame from one person to another.  I am concerned about this issue, which is an old chestnut of mine.  The Minister of State might be able to give some answers before Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I am deeply concerned about the dumping and abandoning of vessels off the south-west coast, which is a serious issue and one which I am not sure is addressed in the Bill.  Between Bere Island and Castletownbere a massive vessel called the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> lies in state with its mast sticking up.  It is a danger to fishermen and the islands.  The vessel was scuttled for an insurance scam but is still there.  Who will remove that wreck?</P>
        <P>The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, one of the largest freight vessels ever built in the history of the world and registered in eastern Europe to carry ore, was in Bantry Bay and we were afraid for our lives because it was a massive ship.  The crew decided to take it 70 or 80 miles off Mizen Head in bad weather, called for help and abandoned the ship.  The iron ore carrier sank to the bottom of the sea and ended up lying off the Stag&rsquo;s Head in a beautiful part of Baltimore.  The <i>Tribulus</i> was another large vessel, owned by Shell, and in connection with which a diver lost his life when he came into Bantry Bay for shelter.  Another vessel, the <i>Ranga</i>, was washed ashore at Slea Head and left there as an eyesore for years.  This Bill may not address these issues but the ugly, rotting heap of metal lying between the harbour in Bere Island and Castletownbere should be looked at and perhaps the Minister of State might return to me on this issue in the future.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State in his capacity as chairman of the interdepartmental committee known as the marine co-ordination group.  It is not before time and is something for which I have always argued.  It brings together various Departments to address coastal matters.  My home town of Bantry is a tourist hub and places such as Whiddy Island attract <Col N="435"/>tourists.  There is an oil industry there as well as a very viable fish farming industry.  We have the beautiful island of Garinish.  There are many different links.  Such matters have always been the focus of a single Department that has not been interested in what other Departments are doing.  I hope the new co-ordinating group will be of benefit to people living in rural Ireland, especially in coastal areas.</P>
        <P>I would like to make a point about Bantry Bay, which is the second biggest and finest bay in the world, without in any way being pejorative or awkward.  The bay is about 20 miles deep and some parts of it are eight or nine miles wide.  As far as I am aware, all the foreshore rights in the bay are traditionally vested in Bantry House or Lord Bantry.  If that is the case, it is wrong and legislation should be introduced to correct it.  Perhaps the Minister of State will check in advance of Committee Stage whether it is the case.  My colleague, Senator Keaveney, recently made a similar point about Lough Foyle.  Our links with colonial Britain should be severed once and for all.  If Bantry House has to get some <i>quid pro quo</i>, so be it.  These rights are of importance in Bantry if one is extending the pier, for example.  When a new sewerage pipe scheme was undertaken along the foreshore recently, permission had to be sought and the rights had to be bought out from Bantry House.  Some of the rights are now vested in Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  If this is the case in Bantry, it may be replicated in Kenmare, with Lord Kenmare being involved, and in other areas.  It is something we should look at because it may cause headaches down the road if wind farms or wave energy projects are being considered.  These issues should be resolved sooner rather than later in case there is a big find of oil or gas off our south-west coast.</P>
        <P>I agree we have to be careful to protect our environment from dumping at sea.  The Minister of State will be aware of the difficulties that were encountered when a &euro;40 million fisheries harbour and pier project, which was funded by the Government and its predecessor, was being developed in Castletownbere.  A contaminant known as TBT was found when the inner harbour was being dredged in advance of the project.  The poisonous and toxic substance in question was skimmed from the silt residue and rolled into big lumps of concrete.  We have to export such toxic waste to a recognised dump in Germany which is the only place in Europe that can accept it.  The exact same problem is developing in Bantry.  Under this Bill, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will continue to be responsible for places like Castletownbere, Killybegs and Dunmore East.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be responsible for ports that are not primarily associated with sea fishing, such as Bantry, Kinsale, Baltimore and Schull in west Cork.  I do not have a problem with that.</P>
        <P>The issue of contamination is an old chestnut of mine.  I remember raising it with the then Minister for the Marine, John Wilson &mdash; God be good to him &mdash; when he visited Bantry in 1989.  At the time, I was getting a few bob to do some hydrographic surveys, to see whether we could get our pier extended.  Unfortunately, those tests indicated that this famous contaminant was present in Castletownbere.  The tests also showed that mercury, which is a lethal contaminant, was present in the inner harbour.  We have plans to dredge the inner harbour.  I hope the necessary &euro;3.5 million will be provided.  The Minister of State might ask his colleagues whether that fund, which I fought for in the last D&aacute;il, is still available.  I am concerned about it.  I accept it is expensive to skim off six or 12 inches of contaminated material, mothball it into a kind of concrete bollard and export it.  The rest of the material can be dealt with easily.  I hope a system of dealing with such issues can be put in place in the future.</P>
        <P>I would like to be parochial for a moment by speaking about the issue of coastal zone management in south-west Cork and south Kerry.  The Minister of State, who visited that area recently, will be aware of the huge potential for fish farming there.  I was unable to be present on that occasion, unfortunately, because I had another commitment.  I am sure the Minister of State had a wonderful visit to Cahermore, on the Beara Peninsula, which is the home of what <Col N="436"/>is probably the biggest abalone farm in the northern hemisphere.  I hope the farm can provide a few jobs in the area.  We must not damage the potential for the aquaculture and mariculture industry to provide jobs, for example, in the farming of rope mussels, salmon, trout and abalone.  I suggest that the industry is still in its infancy.  It should not be sold out to the environmental lobby, for example, in the form of EU regulations or domestic guidelines relating to coastal zone management etc.  If we are serious about trying to sustain jobs in remote parts of rural Ireland, we cannot allow a Department to cause problems by saying this and that cannot be done.</P>
        <P>Similarly, at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a delegation made the point that there are astronomical delays of five, six or seven years in the issuing of aquaculture licences.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify whether that is the case.  I am not trying to be awkward.  If there are underlying reasons such licences cannot be issued more quickly, we should know about them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I attended a four-hour meeting with representatives of the fishing industry about the Common Fisheries Policy earlier today.  Along with my colleague, Senator McCarthy, I supported the case that was made by the fishermen.  There is huge potential in rural Ireland not only for the development of wind farms and wave energy, etc. but also for the development of fish farming.  When I go to Schull or Skibbereen to buy sea bass for my dinner, I am surprised to learn it was farmed in Cyprus.  It seems we are importing farmed fish from Indonesia, other parts of Asia and from South America.  As an island community, we should be to the fore in this regard.  Any regulations that are introduced should not cramp, stifle or put obstacles in the way of the development of the fish farming industry which has huge potential.</P>
        <P>I would love to say much more about these matters.  I might propose a couple of amendments on Committee Stage, which I normally would not do, to tease out issues like the foreshore rights in Bantry.  Beidh l&aacute; eile againn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House.  The previous speaker referred to aquaculture licences.  I intended to raise the same issue on the Adjournment last week, but I withdrew the matter when the debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 continued into the early hours of the morning.  I decided that the presence in the Chamber of those of us who had to be here was sufficient without bringing other people in unnecessarily.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for compiling and making available to me the text of the reply that would have been read into the record of the House last week.</P>
        <P>I thank the staff of the Oireachtas research and library service for providing Senators with an extensive and informative debate pack on this legislation which deals with quite a technical area.  While it might seem like an innocuous and straightforward Bill, I have a number of concerns that I would like to scrutinise in greater detail at the various legislative stages.</P>
        <P>I refer to a 1997 document, Coastal Zone Management &mdash; A Draft Policy for Ireland, in the context of what has been said about foreshore issues.  It is significant that the document was issued by the then Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Page 12 of the document, which relates to the development of the foreshore, states that some of the legislative framework is out of date and inadequate to the task at hand.  It refers to the Foreshore Acts as an example of legislation that requires review and suggests that a major review of the Acts is planned.  The document argues that the system illustrates the difficulty of administering the coastal zone and highlights the need for a more integrated approach.  In my view, not much progress has been made since that document was published in 1997, despite the long series of publications and debates in the meantime.  It is <Col N="437"/>like Seanad reform.  It has been the elephant in the room for too long without any action being taken for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>I note that some sections of the Bill allow for the transfer of certain responsibilities from the Department to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This chips away at responsibility.  We do not have a department of the marine and therefore do not have an integrated co-ordinated strategy on marine issues.  I have made this point consistently.  Many different aspects of marine are being dealt with by separate Departments, including the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and Transport.  The Ministers in all those Departments have introduced legislation into this House or have made statements on those areas.  It is not good not to have a joined-up and cohesive strategy on the marine.  Some time ago when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, was asked a question on the marine, she turned around and did not know which Minister had responsibility for that issue.  Invariably the marine will suffer from the lack of joined-up thinking and a cohesive co-ordinated integrated approach to the marine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Donovan mentioned that the Federation of Irish Fishermen and the Irish Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation attended this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It was startling to listen to the very immediate issues that challenge not just the industry but also coastal communities across the country.  It is inappropriate not to have a single Minister with Ministers of State in a dedicated Department.  I am obviously very cognisant of the economic difficulties we face and the different recommendations for cuts in various services.  Proposing the creation of a new Department is probably not as worthwhile as it might have been a year or two ago.  Nonetheless expanding the role of quangos and organisations that are not inherently accountable is not appropriate.</P>
        <P>This is an elected Assembly, albeit with 11 lucky people, one of whom will be making a contribution shortly and another of whom is chairing proceedings.  The other House is an elected forum.  All our local authorities are elected by the people.  We have a public duty responsibility to represent issues brought to our attention and raise issues of concern to our sectoral interests, communities and society as a whole.  That is a fundamental part of our democracy and something we cherish and value.  We built a modern democracy, opposing the alternative to what we have now.  In many ways adding to the role of bodies such as the EPA chips away at the responsibility of the democratic system.  It also takes from the full impact of our democratic roles.</P>
        <P>Most Members of this House will have had experience of trying to deal with the NRA or HSE.  In my case I ask colleagues in the D&aacute;il to table parliamentary questions on issues affecting people in my area.  I will give one example.  While it is not marine-related, it emphasises the point I am making about the deliberate strategy of quangos and organisations taking from our role as public representatives.  Applications for medical cards for the over 70s are now being dealt with by the HSE in Finglas.  A person in Skibbereen supplied information last June and as recently as last month got a letter from the HSE stating the information was never passed on.  Previously such applications were handled by a local democratic body by the superintendent of community welfare, who was based in the town, knew the applicant and the system, and could deal in a very effective and efficient manner.  The superintendent could deal with my representation and I would get a response within two, three or four days.  However, we are now dealing with faceless bureaucracy based as far away from west Cork as it is possible to get.  That breaks the connection between elected representatives and people on the ground.</P>
        <P>This Bill is another example and in many ways mirrors some of the aspects of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill that was passed during the last session in this <Col N="438"/>House.  It creates a body or adds to the role of a body that is not accountable and is not as accessible to the ordinary people as we are or as ordinary Departments are.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While wind energy is a great notion and there is considerable debate on the issue, there are many other issues in that regard which require as much forensic examination as other issues that are more widely known about.  We need the statutory involvement of local authorities.  With normal planning applications there is an opportunity for ordinary members of the public to make their observations on the planning application known.  They can approach public representatives who have an involvement &mdash; albeit a limited reserved involvement &mdash; in the planning process with local authorities.  None the less it keeps open that connection between the ordinary individual and the statutory body.  When that decision is made there is an opportunity to make another observation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which may go against the point I have been making for the past four or five minutes.  Nonetheless there are processes, including the statutory involvement of local authorities that ensure and guarantee the rights of the individual that the points of view people need to raise on planning applications can be recorded and can be made known.  Another issue is the public right of appeal, which exists through An Bord Plean&aacute;la and serves a very useful purpose.</P>
        <P>Marine spatial planning based on the ecosystem approach is another very significant issue as are coastal landscape safeguards.  How many of the coastal zone management committees of our local authorities were consulted in advance of publishing the Bill?  How many of the stakeholders had an input into the Bill?  The Government&rsquo;s promised national landscape strategy must expressly include seascapes, included in the European Landscape Convention definition of landscape.  Many such issues require forensic examination.</P>
        <P>I will be tabling amendments to this legislation as I see fit.  I have a major issue with removing our role as public representatives and expanding the role of quangos, particularly at a time when politicians are being questioned over value for money.  The effects and the roles we have in the political process are equally important.  I have an issue with expanding roles.  The absence of a department of the marine is another issue.  We will see other Ministers on other occasions pushing through legislation on different aspects of the marine issue.</P>
        <P>At this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food I made the point that we now have an opportunity with the appointment of the former Minister for Justice, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, as our European Commissioner.  I believe we should seek the fisheries portfolio for her.  It would say much about Government strategy in this area.  However, it is an area around which we do not have a bureaucratic structure in terms of a single department of the marine.  If there was a department of the marine perhaps the ban on public sector promotions might not apply to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and he might find himself in Cabinet.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator needs to have faith that the services and the institutions we establish are sufficiently robust.  It is our function to ensure that shortcomings we might <Col N="439"/>perceive in the legislation are ironed out here so that the services can be provided.  The necessity for a public representative to work on behalf of the citizen in interfacing with Departments should be cut to a minimum.</P>
        <P>To a large extent I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  However, I believe it represents a missed opportunity.  While I welcome Senator Bradford&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the Bill, I do not share his level of belief in it.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, to which he referred.  We have spent considerable time dealing with the question of offshore licences, on which I wish to focus.  In the two years since its establishment, it has taken up a considerable amount of our time.  We have repeatedly heard from witnesses telling us about missed opportunities because it is impossible to get a quick answer from the Department.  I welcome the Bill because it makes more sense to transfer the responsibilities to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I hope to God it will mean we will get a quicker response.  Given that Ireland is well placed for this type of investment, it has been deeply frustrating for the committee members to deal with people repeatedly telling us that we are about to lose this enormous investment to Scotland or some other area because there is a lack of enthusiasm or interest on the part of Government to smooth the path and make it easier.</P>
        <P>Given the economic turmoil in which we find ourselves, the Government certainly would not wish to be an obstacle to progress and investment.  As I said, it has been deeply frustrating for members of the committee and for lobbyists outside the Oireachtas that so much of our focus has had to be on removing this obstacle so that we can secure those types of investments.  One of the briefing documents relating to this legislation notes the comment by the director of Sustainable Energy Ireland that we do no not want to be the ones sending out the sandwiches and watching what others are doing because we have not legislatively equipped the State to exploit the opportunities that exist.</P>
        <P>We must take whatever action is necessary to expedite licensing and to ensure there is opportunity to exploit our resources, whether wind, wave, mineral or whatever.  I hope this legislation will be the vehicle to expedite licensing arrangements.  If there is an impediment in this regard I am interested to hear what it is.  Through the course of Committee and Report Stages, I hope we end up with legislation that will facilitate people who want to invest in a substantial way &mdash; we are talking about billions of euro &mdash; in our smart economy.  It is an area in which Ireland can move to the fore.  There are opportunities not only in terms of our ability to export to other countries but also in terms of reducing our dependency on oil and gas and the major impact that will have in respect of our carbon footprint.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his contribution, the Acting Chairman, Senator McCarthy, spoke about how long we have been waiting for this legislation.  My focus is very much on the energy side, whereas the Acting Chairman is particularly interested in fisheries.  It is deeply frustrating from the energy perspective.  We are all grateful that the legislation is finally before us but we must be sure to take the opportunity &mdash; I do not mean any disrespect in saying this &mdash; to make it as good as we can.  It is generally the case that legislation deals with issues that we can see or can expect.  In this case, however, we need to expect the unexpected, that is, we must think outside the box.  The legislation must accommodate, in so far as possible, issues that may not be relevant today.</P>
        <P>For example, when the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 was being debated in the D&aacute;il, I remember thinking it should include something about offshore wind generation and so on because that is where the future lies.  Although something may not be economical today, it certainly could be in the longer term.  Our responsibility is to frame legislation for a 30-year window.  Proposals regarding offshore wind generation were not taken seriously in 2006 because they were considered uneconomical at the time.  The view in that <Col N="440"/>regard has changed in the meantime and although it is not nearly as economical as onshore wind generation, that is not a good enough reason not to legislate.  We had the opportunity in that instance to make legislation that will stand the test of time, but we did not take it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is why I hope this Bill will take on board the work of the Oireachtas committee.  Senator Bradford spoke about how it is one of the first times that a committee of the Houses has put forward legislation.  We were adamant that we would do worthwhile work on this important issue, but it apparently fell on deaf ears.  I am a great fan of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, and have every faith in his commitment to this area.  I am confident that the shortcomings in this Bill are not a result of his unwillingness or reluctance to accept our proposals.  Nonetheless, I do not see a great deal of them in the Bill, which is unfortunate.  I expect the Minister of State will reassure me that there will be time to include such provisions at a later date.  That frustrates me because they are needed now; we cannot afford to let any more investments stall.  However, I welcome the fact that progress is finally being made on the transfer of certain functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the updating of the provisions regarding dumping at sea.  I am pleased to support the Bill but would be even more pleased to make it a far more robust and rigorous proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not often in agreement with Senator O&rsquo;Malley but I agree with most of what she said today.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and his officials for this debate.  I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill but, like Senator O&rsquo;Malley, I am not sure that it goes far enough.  It is an attempt to address very outdated legislation, going as far back as the Foreshore Act 1933.  It is not before time, therefore, that these provisions were updated.</P>
        <P>As a member of Waterford County Council for seven years, I found that the issue of foreshore licences tied up the business of  many council meetings.  The background was that the council had submitted an application to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for a sewage treatment scheme covering seven villages.  The council was encouraged by the Department to band the seven villages together in order to make the scheme more efficient.  Unfortunately, it was not foreseen when the application was made that the foreshore licensing issue would hold up the entire process not only for the two or three villages that required those licences but in respect of all seven villages.  I joined the council in 1999 and some of those sewerage schemes have still not been delivered mainly because of the bureaucracy surrounding the processing of foreshore licences.  Council officials were tearing their hair out and councillors could not understand why there was such toing and froing between the various Departments without any progress being made.  That is very frustrating when one is trying to deliver essential infrastructure that will also improve the environment.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State consider, by amendment or otherwise, imposing some type of timeframe on the issuing of foreshore licences?  This might be similar to a planning process whereby there would be time limits not only for applicants but also for those who are vetting the applications within Departments such that they must get back to local authorities with a definitive response within a reasonable timeframe.  Such a requirement would alleviate much of the excessive delays and frustration in the issuing of licences.  It is illogical and nonsensical that entire projects have been held up in this manner.  Along with a timeframe provision, will the Minister of State also consider an accountability measure that would allow applicants and any interested bodies or stakeholders to track the licensing process in order to ascertain exactly where they stand?</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Malley, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  I have learned much from the delegates who have attended meetings of that committee who are genuinely interested in investing in renewable technologies.  They are tearing their hair out in seeking to progress their initiatives because of the lack of clarity around the licensing issue.  The bottom line is that unless there is clarity and defined direction from Government, investors will not commit to renewable projects.  As an island nation with huge submarine landbanks under our jurisdiction, we have substantial natural resources to exploit.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley that those resources must be exploited now and not in ten years&rsquo; time.  We must be ahead of the curve in getting entrepreneurs and investors in the area of renewable energy into the Irish market so that they will create jobs and establish energy channels that are sustainable and renewable.  Unfortunately, our bureaucratic system does not allow for that to happen in an efficient and clear manner.  I am hopeful the Bill will go some distance in addressing these frustrations but I am not sure it will go the entire way.  As Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, this was one of the first occasions on which a joint committee presented a Bill relating to these issues as it sought to clarify the foreshore licensing regime and provide a more efficient model to process applications.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I fully accept environmental impact assessments should be conducted and every stakeholder should have a say but applications should not be held up because civil servants do not understand who is responsible for what or they are left sitting in Departments for years.  This was a huge missed opportunity for investment in the State and the development of foreshore licensing.  It is the job of government to manage our coastal zones and the foreshore.  Surely an efficient and effective system can be put in place in order that when people make applications, they can receive prompt responses, whether they are positive or negative.  At least the applicants and other investors would then know where they stood.  It is important that the Minister of State and his officials listen to Senators who are making this case.  That is what we heard from industry representatives at committee hearings.  Will the Minister of State contemplate tabling amendments to make the foreshore licensing application process more efficient and accountable and to provide for definitive timeframes?</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention our visit to the Marine Institute in Oranmore, County Galway.  This State agency does tremendous work in the field of marine research.  It is available to the Minister to deal with coastal management, marine planning and foreshore licensing.  Institutions such as this should be exploited to the full to promote Government initiatives to assist the private sector and investors in this area.</P>
        <P>It is essential that all legislation in this area is modernised.  It is a pity that more provisions in the joint committee&rsquo;s Bill are not included in this legislation.  Perhaps there will be further opportunities for this to happen in the near future.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask his ministerial colleagues to listen to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  It is a cross-party committee with genuine concerns and is trying to proactively engage with State agencies and the Government to encourage investment in this area and improve the lot of the State.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to introduce deadlines for the processing of  licence applications in order that applicants, industry representatives and local authorities know where they stand.  The current regime is open-ended.  Applicants have no idea when projects will be delivered.  That is not good for the delivery of vital infrastructure such as wastewater treatment systems which are vital to every town and village or for investors, given that investment is badly needed in the renewable energy sector to fully exploit and capture the potential of our natural marine resources.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="442"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill and hope it is implemented as early as possible.  It is important in a number of respects.  It provides for rationalisation in that it makes sense of the question of how the foreshore can be used sustainably and who is responsible for making sure it is used sustainably.  There has been a great deal of confusion and, as a result, unnecessary delays in dealing with the question of how applications can be made for the use and protection of the foreshore through a licensing process.</P>
        <P>This dual purpose Bill also has another important role which has not been referred to in the debate to date and which was not mentioned in the press release that accompanied its publication.  It relates to a commitment in the 2007 programme for Government which was reiterated in the revised programme recently agreed.  Ireland is the last country in Europe to sign the Aarhus declaration on freedom of information on environmental matters.  This cannot evoke a great deal of pride for an island nation that presents itself as a green country in appearance, if nothing else.  In passing the Bill we will overcome an important obstacle and will at last ratify a declaration signed several years ago and which we have been too slow to implement.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of the ratification of the Aarhus declaration because it will change the nature of environmental law in the State and offer a different perspective for citizens who campaign on environmental grounds for the sustainable protection of our environment.  We will witness the fruits of this within a short period.</P>
        <P>As previous speakers correctly said, unnecessary delays were caused by the confusion about which Department was responsible for foreshore licensing.  Up to five Departments had responsibility for such licensing at different times.  The rationalisation of the licensing process to be overseen by two Departments and ensuring one State agency has responsibility for monitoring dumping at sea makes eminent sense not only in the context of environmental protection but also in that it provides for the proper sustainable use of the foreshore for economic purposes.  Several Senators referred to the potential of renewable energy projects and how they have been stymied by this confusion.  I refer to the delay in the Oriel offshore wind farm project, the backers of which are waiting for the confusion to be dispelled and for this legislation to be passed.  I encourage Members of both Houses when examining this legislation to ensure it ultimately is passed to allow important economic and energy projects to develop.</P>
        <P>This Bill is linked with the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009.  There has been a question about how to link the need to control and protect the environment with the need to develop economically.  I am not sure whether other Senators made their contributions from a proper perspective.  I represent the Green Party which has an environmental perspective.  Historically, we have got that perspective wrong.  We need an appropriate rebalancing of our legislation.  We need Departments and State agencies to properly reflect the need to strike the correct balance about what is seen to be an economic need to achieve economic development, environmental sustainability and protection of our environment.</P>
        <P>It is especially important at this time in our history as we go through such a serious economic adjustment that we do not make decisions which are panic reactions to our economic circumstances to achieve a short-term economic gain by promoting projects that will result in long-term environmental damage.  We have a responsibility, as legislators, to make sure our legislation is framed in such a way that this temptation is avoided and to make sure not only that the wording of legislation is clear in order that those who must implement it know what needs to be done but also that the legislation itself informs the culture needed to sustain national environmental assets in the long term.  We want to benefit many generations to come.</P>
        <P>These simple principles should inform legislation such as this.  As Senator Bradford said, it has been delayed for too long.  I am frustrated that it has taken two years to present such a simple, short Bill to the House but I am glad it has finally been introduced.  I am especially <Col N="443"/>pleased about the doors it will open by setting down new markers for legislation and the cultural standards we want to apply to the protection and sustainability of our environment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I read this Bill, not knowing exactly what it contained.  It makes considerable sense to transfer the powers from where they reside.  I was delighted to hear the Minister of State speak about aquaculture and the shellfish sector.  I had experience of this industry years ago when Bord Iascaigh Mhara asked me to be one of three judges in a competition to find the best oyster in Ireland.  There were 24 oysters to be opened, tested for cleanliness and so on and eaten.  There were three judges and we each ate 24 oysters.  Unfortunately, there was a tie and we then had to eat six more to decide which was best.  When I got home for dinner that evening, I was fortunate that my wife did not give me something similar to eat.  I mention this because of the importance of the foreshore, from the point of view of exports.  Almost all of the oysters from the oyster farms in that competition were exported the following day, mainly to France.  </P>
        <P>One of the main benefits of the Bill is that it will help to boost the wind power industry, of which Senator Dan Boyle has just spoken.  It will move responsibility for both planning permission and the foreshore licence to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which Department is said to be in a position to streamline and quicken the Government&rsquo;s renewable and wind energy policies.</P>
        <P>The European Investment Bank announced on Monday that it would provide up to &pound;700 million for new loans to eligible onshore wind farms in the United Kingdom.  The remainder will be matched by a number of banks: RBS, Lloyds Banking Group and BNP Paribas Fortis.  The scheme is supported by the UK Treasury and UK Department of Energy and Climate Change.  This project could enable approximately &pound;1.4 billion of onshore wind energy projects to move to construction in the next three years.  Are similar negotiations being undertaken to receive similar loans for Ireland from the European Investment Bank?</P>
        <P>Earlier this year the Royal Dutch Shell, rated the largest corporation in the world by <i>Fortune</i> magazine in 2009, announced that it would no longer invest in renewable energy projects such as wind, solar and hydro power projects because they were not economic.  Three years ago I was asked what business I would go into if I were starting out now.  I replied that I would become involved in the renewable energy sector.  I now find that the biggest companies in the world are stating it is not economic.  Does the Minister think this is a strong indication that investment in wind energy projects is futile, especially in the short term?  I do not believe it is but it appears that a number of wind energy projects, in Ireland and elsewhere, are no longer going ahead.  I, therefore, have a concern.  From where I live in Howth I can see the seven wind turbines off the coast of County Wicklow.  They seem to be working all the time.  However, it appears we have not moved in the direction we should have for renewable energy projects.  Is this a planning matter?  Is it something we can do something about?  If renewable energy technologies are not economical, can we do something to enable us to make them so?</P>
        <P>On the wider issue of planning, we all know how planning applications for large projects can be held up by an individual objector.  In a number of cases the individual holding up the construction of, say, a wind farm does not even live in the area in question.  This is one of the major reasons incinerators have never been introduced, even though many experts say they are much needed.</P>
        <P>I was very impressed when I learned that a new body had been set up in the United Kingdom last month called the Infrastructure Planning Commission, IPC.  It is an independent body which will assume responsibility for planning nationally important projects from March 2010.  It is hoped decisions which used to take years will take just months or even weeks.  It also means that inputs from the public will be more limited.  That may sound undemocratic but <Col N="444"/>perhaps we have gone too far the other way and too many objections are causing delays in pursuing worthy projects.  It is hoped the new planning system will help to build much needed projects such as new airports, roads, incinerators and sewage plants.  A planned high speed rail line connecting London with Scotland could also be initiated.  The United Kingdom is also pressing ahead with numerous proposals focused on energy, including schemes for wind farms, power lines, gas pipelines and clean coal projects, thanks to the new planning system.</P>
        <P>What is most interesting is the plan to replace many of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s old nuclear power plants with new ones in order to help cut the country&rsquo;s emissions of greenhouse gases.  The companies which will be contracted to build these new nuclear power plants have made it clear they will not tolerate delays in planning.  It is a real worry that the power plants will not be completed on time, as it is estimated that electricity supply in the United Kingdom could begin to fall short of demand as soon as 2015 and the new nuclear plants will not be in operation until 2017.  This idea was summed up by the UK Secretary of State, Mr. Ed Milliband, when he said, &ldquo;We are not going to be able to deliver a 21st century energy system with a 20th century planning system&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is time we looked at our own planning system in this regard and had a real debate on nuclear power.  I have tabled a motion on the subject and hope the Seanad will have a discussion on it.  I am not sure it is right but the refusal even to discuss the subject is dangerous.  Professor Colm Kenny of Dublin City University said during the week, &ldquo;The Republic of Ireland already buys nuclear and other energy from Britain via<i> </i>the underwater Moyle interconnector to Scotland&rdquo;.  The new connector to Wales is expected to begin operation by 2012.  There is no way of knowing exactly how much of the electricity from Britain which Ireland already uses is generated at nuclear power plants.  With Ireland buying electricity from Britain, as we are at present, it is not easy for Government Ministers to raise strong objections to Britain&rsquo;s new nuclear power plant expansion.</P>
        <P>James Lovelock, former chief scientist for NASA and the person who discovered the hole in the ozone layer, believes that in the short term, &ldquo;Only nuclear power can now halt global warming&rdquo;.  He argues that we &ldquo;should regard nuclear energy as something that could be available from new power stations in five years and could see us through the troubled times ahead when the climate changes and there are shortages of food and fuel and major demographic changes&rdquo;.  That is not to mention the fact that nuclear energy would free Ireland and Europe from dependence on middle eastern or Russian oil.</P>
        <P>I am using this debate as an opportunity to make sure we give consideration at least to debating the subject of nuclear power.  Last year a number of senior Green Party members in Britain changed their attitude to nuclear power.  They now believe it is not only safe but also environmentally acceptable because no fossil fuels are used in its production and it is the only way to achieve greenhouse gas emissions targets in the years ahead.  We need to move into the 21st century and have a proper debate on nuclear power and the issue of planning major projects in this country.  This legislation will help us to move in that direction.  Therefore, I encourage its passage.  The Minister of State has taken the right step, although we have a long way to go to achieve what we must achieve.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to debate any issues connected with marine matters.  I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad.  He has adopted a hands-on approach to marine matters and is not afraid to travel long distances to meet fishermen in any port.</P>
        <P>On Monday last I was in Brussels meeting two of the directors general which deal with marine and rural development.  We were looking at how EU funding would be distributed after 2013.  The Baltic states have united on a number of projects which do not necessarily involve <Col N="445"/>new funding but which co-ordinate existing structures to maximise their potential and draw down new funding, should it become available.  The question with which we are trying to grapple is, with an expanded Europe, if European Union funding will be given out on the basis of people working in co-operation with each other.  If so, where do our natural bonds lie?  To which countries should we look?  Marine was very much at the centre of that debate.  Maritime issues were also very much part of it.  Our question was whether the new British Irish Council would be able to form an entity which would be able to draw down enough support at EU level.  The answer we received was that more than two states would need to work together and that it should be three or four states.  The question then was whether we should work on an Atlantic axis &mdash; north-western Europe &mdash; and with which states we should work.</P>
        <P>It is very easy to talk about France and agriculture and the mutual issues on which we fight together.  However, if we look at the marine sector and our shared space, much of that shared space is water.  We have shared opportunities but we also have shared issues, including marine security, the peddling of drugs and human trafficking.  Wales and Ireland have interconnectors to ensure the supply of gas.  However, we do not have a wind farm which would lay cables and ensure a supply to these interconnectors.</P>
        <P>A number of issues were raised at that meeting and one might ask what they have to do with the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea Bill.  The fundamental message with which we came home was from one of the directorates which threw its hands in the air and asked us how we could start to deal with other countries in regard to the marine if we did not have a Department of the marine.  While I very much welcome the idea of a cross-departmental body announced earlier this year &mdash; I know the Minister of State was driving the concept &mdash; the marine area is diverse.  The concept of working interdepartmentally is the way things need to go.  If we talk about energy supply, we are talking about the environment and if we talk about fishing, we are talking about the marine.  Smuggling and justice issues concern the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In some respects, we are wrong not to have a Department of the marine but we are right to work interdepartmentally.</P>
        <P>This needs to be driven by one core ministry.  I know it is not within the Minister of State&rsquo;s gift to rejig current Departments but the value and opportunities in the marine sector need to be re-evaluated and reprioritised at Government level.  This is an island and our potential is in our island status.  There is an element of the marine attached to many of our current difficulties and to the challenges we face in terms of the economy, climate change, security of energy supply etc.</P>
        <P>Many Members spoke about the co-ordination and co-operation necessary at that level but I wish to return to the Bill and the issue of the foreshore.  In the Foyle, a third party is claiming the foreshore, namely, the Crown Estate.  The Crown Estate was like a tax collection agency for the Queen.  Now it is more like a private industry which, to all intents and purposes, lifts money on behalf of a private company.  When I receive information from the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Finance, I am told they are working with the British Government and that it concerns the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>My difficulty in regard to the foreshore and who owns and operates it is in the context of the Foyle and its tributaries.  A Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should speak to his or her counterpart in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the North and not to the Crown Estate.</P>
        <P>I started my contribution by talking about many countries with a shared space working together.  There are two jurisdictions in the Foyle and its tributaries operating a shared space.  We also have the Loughs Agency.  Let the Crown Estate prove its entitlement to the foreshore of the Foyle.  I do not believe it would be able to do so.  In 1920 Ireland was given back its <Col N="446"/>islands, coast, rivers and tributaries but the Six Counties were taken out.  The Crown Estate or anyone else has very shaky legs on which to stand when claiming the foreshore.  I have received very unsatisfactory answers in this regard.</P>
        <P>For some years the economy of the north west has been bleak.  We have a great opportunity with the Foyle and its tributaries to develop in a co-ordinated and clear fashion many marine-related, although not marine specific, opportunities.  I would like one agency to look after the air above the Foyle, the water of the Foyle and the seabed beneath the Foyle.  I would like the Loughs Agency to be expanded and to have a role in regard to the marine, jet skiing, justice, planning and environmental matters.  In other words, it should have full responsibility for the Foyle.</P>
        <P>When I challenged the Crown Estate as to its entitlement in regard to the Foyle, I was told it would make no claims on the Foyle until such time as the two Governments made a decision on the jurisdictional issue.  Let us not make a decision on the jurisdictional issue.  Let the joint body which exists have total responsibility for the Foyle.  We must not let any other body, whether the Duke of Abercorn, the Honourable the Irish Society or the Crown Estate, claim the foreshore unless they can prove their claim beyond doubt but I do not believe any of them could do so.</P>
        <P>While it might not seem relevant to this Bill, we have a significant foreshore problem in the Foyle.  It is leading to people who have fished on the Foyle and its tributaries being alienated.  I would like the Minister of State and the other Departments which have some responsibility in this regard to intervene because I cannot get answers.  Each time I ask a question, I am told another Minister is responsible.  I wish the Bill well and hope it has positive implications for me in the foreshore difficulties I have in my area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation.  My party fully supports the Bill.  In fact, Fine Gael published plans in its New ERA document which would create 100,000 jobs in this country.  From research done, I was amazed to see that the foreshore covers 49,000 sq. km. or the equivalent of 57% of the landmass of the Republic of Ireland.  That is a huge area.  I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Wind and wave energy will be very important for the economic development of this country.  This country could export wind and wave energy.  My county has the highest wind speeds in Europe, wind speeds that are far in excess of those in any other county, even though County Donegal is a little further ahead than County Mayo in developing wind energy projects.  However, those involved in wind energy projects have problems connecting to the grid.  I hope the Government will put energy into sorting out these problems as quickly as possible.  As an island nation we should be exporting wind energy.  We have a golden opportunity to develop wind energy projects.  Various Ministers have commented in recent years on the potential for the development of wind and wave energy projects.  A pilot scheme is being run in County Mayo off the coast of Belmullet.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, approved grant aid for it and visited the project recently, having previously visited it on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>A basic element of this legislation will be the granting of foreshore licences and charting a way to provide quicker access for projects to come on stream.  If that transpires to be the case, this legislation will be welcome.</P>
        <P>My Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Coveney, has produced a policy document which proposes the creation of 100,000 jobs in the development of wave and wind energy.  It is a sector where there is massive potential for growth, job creation and energy exports.  Every effort should be made to fast-forward wind and wave energy projects that are in the pipeline, of which there <Col N="447"/>are quite a number along our coastline. We should be a world leader in such development given our geographical position.  It is suggested that one project off the coast of Galway could generate enough electricity to power half the country.  That is only one of several such projects that could be developed off our coastline.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and what the Minister of State had to say.  I have no doubt that the many concerns raised by various Senators will be taken into account and that will give us a clearer definition of how we should progress in this area.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of difficulties in regard to the granting of foreshore licences encountered by various county managers in bringing forward wind and wave energy projects within their counties along our coast.  I hope this legislation will help to address that issue.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.  I hope it becomes law as quickly as possible and will help to bring to fruition the many wind and wave energy projects that are in the pipeline throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Members of the Seanad for facilitating the introduction of this Bill at this stage because, as a number of speakers said, there is some urgency attached to dealing with the matter.  I am delighted to have this opportunity to introduce the Bill and I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford asked about the reason for the delay in introducing it.  It is important to point out that the transfer of responsibility has been done in two phases.  The first phase occurred just over a year ago when a number of areas of responsibility were transferred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the remaining phase is provided for in this legislation.  However, it is important to stress that in the intervening period and prior to the 2008 transfer there has been very close co-operation between the two Departments and a number of officials in both have been working together to ensure the transfer goes smoothly and that people are aware of all the issues that arise.</P>
        <P>A critical point is that 57% of the land area of the country is the foreshore.  Relative to other countries in Europe and internationally our foreshore constitutes a very high proportion of the land area of the State.  In terms of correlation with the population and resources of the country, it poses a daunting challenge, having regard to all the European legislation and directives that have to be taken into account, to try to move to where every Senator who spoke would want us to be at, which would be to have at least an adequate, and perhaps the most modern possible, regime for the foreshore.  It is also important to remember that in other countries, not only in Europe but elsewhere, this is a challenge that has been faced with considerable difficulty.  It is no harm to learn from other people&rsquo;s mistakes and also to learn from best practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to the work that is being done by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security across a range of areas but especially on the proposed Bill.  I am sure that is something the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will examine when he moves to the next phase.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford asked about consultation periods.  The fact that there was not a defined period has caused frustration for Senators, Deputies and local authority members throughout the country.  Section 12 of this Bill provides for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce regulations to specify the period within which the statutory consultees must respond.  If one were to ask me how this would make things happen more quickly, this would be an important element in delivering in that respect.</P><Col N="448"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bradford also asked a number of questions about proceedings before the courts.  I do not have the detailed answers to those but I will try to get them for him.  A considerable number of cases are before the courts.  He also asked about the transfer of responsibility to the EPA and whether the resources of the authority will be sufficient to take on that challenge.  In the first instance, the Vote for the EPA comes under Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but there is a provision in the Bill specifying that the charges go directly to the EPA rather than the Exchequer.  I hope that will be of some assistance.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked if the legislation would help to expedite licences.  The provisions in section 12 will be a move in the right direction in that respect.  He also asked if this legislation is an exercise in transferring the blame.  It is important to remember that it tries to align the responsibilities for spatial planning on land with the responsibilities for spatial planning in the sea.  The local authorities have responsibility for their own county development plans and the Department to which they respond, in the main, is the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  That is the appropriate place to have most of the responsibilities, apart from the ones that are directly concerned with sea fishing, aquaculture licensing and the six designated fishery harbour ports.  That is what is being done in this case.</P>
        <P>On the issue of wrecks, which Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised, it is a matter for the receiver of wrecks, which comes under the Department of Transport.  The Senator also raised a question about foreshore licences held by private individuals.  I will get the answer to that question for the Senator because I do not know about that matter.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the issue of the dumping of noxious materials, which is an important issue.  The dumping at sea functions, which are technical in any event, are transferred, properly in my view, to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Senator made the important point that we must not sell out the potential of aquaculture.  I think he was blaming the environmental lobby, in my view somewhat unfairly, because we must be cognisant of the fact that we have a European Court of Justice judgment of December 2007 on our record in matters of this nature.  We must take account of that and deal with it.  We are trying to advance that and I am happy with the level of co-operation I am getting from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It is a complex challenge.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator McCarthy for not forcing me to get up at 2 a.m. to take the Adjournment debate last week.  I was more than happy to provide the answer.  I do not mind going to bed at 2 a.m. but I am not too happy about getting up at that time.</P>
        <P>The Senator quoted the 1998 report which stated that fundamental change was needed in this area.  That is the case but we are trying to learn from experiences elsewhere, and other countries are having as much difficulty as ourselves.  The marine co-ordinating group, with which I work closely and which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach but which I co-ordinate, has brought together sometimes as many as 12 Departments which have responsibility in the marine area.  We are beginning to develop a framework that will enable us to have a much more coherent all of Government approach in this area.  It will take some time but we are moving in that direction.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy made a comment about the diminution of democracy in extending the role of the EPA.  It is important to distinguish pretty technical areas such as those dealt with by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the EPA and some of the other areas where lay people such as ourselves might have a positive input.  In this instance, the EPA is the appropriate authority.  Under the OSPAR Convention we have obligations in that regard. <Col N="449"/> I wish it were correct for the Senator to state that the Irish EU Commissioner had responsibility for fisheries.  It would certainly make my job a good deal easier.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred to the issue of offshore licences, which has been discussed at considerable length at the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  Some very interesting submissions have been made.  Some people refer to missed opportunities in the area of offshore wind.  It is worth remembering that offshore licences have been granted and approved for 420 turbines but only seven have been built.  Some of the licences date back a considerable period.  There are issues related to grid connectivity and other issues which might not spring to mind immediately, including the availability of highly developed engineering works and a sufficient level of port accessibility and suitability for some of the very large work involved in the offshore area.  This has been one of the relevant factors in the debate.  <?oasys _dc18- ?>Ultimately, the important point is that the Bill will align marine spatial planning with onshore planning.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>Senator Coffey argued that the legislation does not go far enough.  It is important to draw a distinction between what is intended, that is, the alignment of the functions, and what will take place when the determination is made in respect of the way with which the entire offshore area will be dealt.  That will take place some time in the future.  The Senator called on me to ask my Cabinet colleagues to listen to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  Since I am not in Cabinet, they are not my colleagues in that sense but I would be pleased to pass on the message.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to the Aarhus Convention.  I am unsure but my understanding is that Ireland has already signed the declaration and that it applies to foreshore issues already, although it may need to be ratified and implemented in other areas.</P>
        <P>Several Senators pointed out there has been confusion in respect of the responsibility of various Departments up to now.  However, the matter is somewhat more deep-seated.  An amount of work remains to be done to bring us to the stage where we can deal with applications that relate to foreshore matters in the same manner as those on land.  As I mentioned, there are grid connectivity, engineering and port resources issues that must be dealt with.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the potential of aquaculture, which I welcome because we are somewhat in danger of being adherents to the attractions of technologies that in some cases have not produced one watt of electricity yet, while perhaps overlooking those nearer to us which have tremendous potential.  For example, let us consider the salmon farming industry.  At present, Ireland produces almost 10,000 tonnes, most of which is produced to a very high standard and which yields a premium price because it meets the standard.  We began the enterprise at the same time as Scotland, which currently produces approximately 140,000 tonnes, some 14 times our production and at the same time as Norway, which produces 750,000 tonnes.  A great deal of potential has not been realised and it would be a great pity were we to overlook our potential in the offshore area.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also referred to the fact that the European Investment Bank and others are prepared to support wind projects in the UK.  He asked if the same could be done here and I believe many players are considering this.  Let us bear in mind that the price of electricity from renewable energy is supported by Government guarantee.  This may not always be in place.  The question of viability was raised, a difficult question to address.  It is dependent on the price of and access to fossil fuels.  This is one of the determinants in respect of whether wind energy and other renewable energy sources are as viable as they appear to be in the long term.  My strong view is they are the way to go and that we must proceed with as much enthusiasm as we can muster and ensure the interests of the taxpayer are looked after simultaneously.  The Senator referred to delays caused by planning objections.  The section 12 provisions will address <Col N="450"/>this matter in respect of the foreshore.  He also raised an important issue in respect of generating capacity in the UK and there is a similar potential problem here in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney referred to the funding post 2013 and the fact that some of the Baltic nations have come together to bring forward proposals for their foreshore and offshore resources, an issue the marine co-ordination group has been examining.  I commend the Dublin local authorities because they have done some very positive work in this regard and the matter is worth examining.</P>
        <P>I refer to the vexed question of Lough Foyle, the Loughs Agency and the Crown Estate.  This matter is being dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments.  Some progress is being made, although I understand it is not at the negotiating phase at present.  Senator Burke mentioned the size of the foreshore and its potential but he also referred to the challenge in terms of resources.  He referred to grid connection, a particular difficulty in Mayo, and the potential to export energy ultimately.  This will determine whether the area is as viable as it is represented as being.</P>
        <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  I was very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Bill in the Seanad.  Clearly, people have given considerable thought to the issues.  It will be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to bring forward the next tranche of legislation.  I will try to ensure the marine co-ordination interdepartmental group does everything possible to facilitate this and to provide whatever information may be needed.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the Government initiative to introduce a biofuel obligation scheme in July 2010, in view of the benefits accruing in terms of emissions reductions from transport, in terms of increased security of supply for road transport fuel, and the increased potential for employment and economic activity from domestic production of biofuel.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The motion is a consequence of the renewable energy directive from the European Community.  This places an obligation and a requirement on all member states that 10% of energy used in transport shall be renewable by 2020.  It is recognised that bio-fuels will have a central role to play in this.  Bio-fuels will not be used exclusively because there is developing technology in the area of electric vehicles.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a point of order.  This concerns Standing Order 41, which suggests that every amendment must be relevant to the motion to which it is proposed.

      <?oasys _cl14- ?><Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to continue without interruption and I would like the Leas-Chathaoirleach to consider my point.  There is merit in what I say if one reads the motion and the amendment.  The amendment has no relevance to the motion.</P>
        <P>In supporting the motion, we have moved a great deal in a short space of time towards embracing green energy and the requirement to reduce our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  Our compliance with the renewable energy directive is another significant step in this direction.  The Government has recognised this in the past.  In 2005 the first pilot programme for mineral oil tax relief on bio-fuels was introduced, covering three bio-fuel categories and amounting to &euro;6 million in revenue forgone.  I was pleased that two of the initial three companies, including Biogreen Energy Products Ltd, were based in Wexford.  I know the work they have done in this regard.  This was followed, in the 2006 budget, by an extension of the scheme, which was valued at approximately &euro;200 million in excise duties.  That embraces four categories of bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>Bio-fuels will be one part of this and we must also consider developing technology.  The Minister and his party have been strong on the matter of electric vehicles.  This appears to have significant potential.  A decade or more ago bio-fuels were seen as very significant players in moving towards greener energy policies.  However, embracing that policy, particularly in the United States and elsewhere, raised ancillary or peripheral difficulties.  Using land for bio-crops had an impact on agricultural products and the growth of food and, as a consequence, on commodity and food prices.  I understand the European Union is examining a more sustainable approach in this area and this needs to be done.  However well intentioned policies are, they can have unforeseen knock-on effects in other areas which need to be taken into account and factored in in what we do.  Having said this, it is accepted by everybody that bio-fuels will have a contributory role to play in our energy policy.</P>
        <P>The new scheme will have four product types, including bioethanol which will be used in a blend of up to 5% in petrol and EN 590 which will contribute up to 5% in the blending of diesel.  In the pure plant oil category, rape and other such products, including wheat, can be fully converted and used in vehicles.  Some movement has been made towards this but I am not sure to what extent.  Overall, the success of the policy has been underpinned by the fact that approximately 200 million litres of these products combined have availed of mineral oil tax relief and this will make a significant contribution to achieving the targets we have set and which the European Union obliges us to meet.  The main product is EN 590 which is mixed with diesel and has significant potential.  In the White Paper on energy policy the Government set a 10% target and committed us to this bio-fuel obligation.  I welcome the fact that the Minister and the Department embarked on a consultation process and received more than 40 submissions.  Their input to the final drafting of the bio-fuel obligation Bill which is taking place will be reflected in the Bill when published.  It is also significant that almost half of EU member states have introduced bio-fuel obligations; therefore, we are playing our part in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister and the Department appointed the National Oil Reserves Agency to be the administrator of the scheme.  It is heavily involved and has a responsibility to ensure we meet EU and international requirements for maintaining emergency oil supplies.  It leased an oil tank farm in New Ross from a local company and filled it with emergency oil supplies.  As an aside, the port of New Ross would prefer if the product was not being stored but moving in and out and generating activity and revenue in the port.  However, it is worth noting that it is being stored.  The agency is funded by a levy on mineral fuel which will be extended to cover bio-fuels and meet the additional costs attached to administering bio-fuel obligations.  The levy includes a bio-fuels element and increased from 1 cent to 2 cent.  It is important and careful consideration is being given by the Minister and the Government to ensuring this transformation is made in a way that does not significantly increase costs for the transport industry.  This <Col N="453"/>is essential at all times.  Competitiveness in the economy is a major issue and challenge for us.  We all recognise that there has been slippage in the past decade with the economy in a very significant growth graph.  It is important that in anything we do by way of the levy or transference into the green energy sector we ensure we do not add too significantly to our cost base.</P>
        <P>We must have regard to what is happening in other countries.  As this is taking place in other countries, it should underpin our competitiveness.  At local government level and in State agencies there is a propensity to load costs, which are expenditure items.  If these expenditure items are not managed very tightly and efficiently, it means inefficient costs are being added to the economy.  We need to be mindful of this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the introduction of a bio-fuels obligation certificate which I understand will be electronic.  A certificate will be claimed and awarded for the supply of each litre of fuel oil.  Conditions are attached to how people will qualify for them.  The administrator will be involved and have evidence.  He or she will have the power to reject or revoke certificates if information is subsequently found to be false.  These will be tradeable in the industry at an indicative selling price of approximately 45 cent per litre.  This will assist those specifically involved in the green fuels sector as distinct from the hydrocarbon sector.  It will also enable the hydrocarbon sector and industry to comply by being able to purchase certificates and ensure they meet the requirement and play their part in reaching the 10% target.  The Bill is being drafted and will come before the House.  I look forward to debating it when it does.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very happy to second the motion.  I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I have great admiration for the man because every time I hear him in a radio interview he has his facts and I heard him discussing this issue recently.  Nobody is ever able to nail him on anything; he always has his facts right.  In politics one never knows what tomorrow will bring but I wish him well.  He is doing a great job so far.</P>
        <P>The renewable energy directive has placed a requirement on all member states for 10% of the energy used in transport to be from renewable sources by 2020.  Bio-fuels have a central role to play in the delivery of this target as one of the few available and effective means of reducing emissions from transport, with developing technology and electrical vehicles.  This morning I heard a debate about electrical vehicles which is creating spin-off industries as people are going into business because they believe electrical vehicles are too quiet and cannot be heard.  Perhaps the Minister has a comment to make on this aspect.  Somebody is in the process of developing various sounds for electrical vehicles.</P>
        <P>Following the success of the scheme, a second and more ambitious scheme was announced in the 2006 budget.  Scheme II will run until the end of 2010 and is valued at over &euro;200 million in excise forgone.  The scheme set out four categories of bio-fuel.  A total of 102 applications were received under the scheme, including 11 applications in the bio-ethanol category.  I understand that as the scheme was oversubscribed, a number of applications were not facilitated.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on that issue.</P>
        <P>The Government White Paper on energy policy commits to the introduction of a bio-fuel obligation which will underpin the delivery of national bio-fuel targets and take account of EU developments.  Farmers are being encouraged to grow bio-fuels such as rape seed on unutilised land.  I recently spoke with farmers on this matter while attending an IFA meeting at the Davenport Hotel.  Farmers will not grow a crop if it is not profitable, no more than I would open a furniture shop tomorrow if I could not sell furniture.  What incentives will be offered to farmers who grow bio-fuels?  Farmers are on their knees at present and there is no way they will enter a business which might be loss making.</P><Col N="454"/>
        <P>A number of member states have introduced bio-fuel obligations.  For example, the UK introduced a renewable transport fuels obligation in April 2008.  Why do public transport companies and State bodies such as the Army and An Post continue to use diesel rather than renewable energy sources to fuel their fleets?</P>
        <P>The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, is responsible for ensuring that Ireland complies with its EU and international requirements for emergency oil supplies.  The agency is funded by a levy on mineral fuel collected from oil suppliers.  It also enters into contracts with oil suppliers for the purposes of leasing oil storage.  On that basis, it was deemed that NORA &mdash; I do not mean the song &mdash; was by far the most appropriate administrator for the bio-fuel obligation.</P>
        <P>Farmers have also made the argument that we will experience food shortages within the next 20 years if we do not utilise the land for food production.  We should not be speaking about pie in the sky because farmers will not grow bio-fuel crops if they are not profitable.  The Minister is doing an excellent job and I am confident that anything he tackles will work out successfully.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to that issue presently.  Fine Gael welcomes in principle the 4% bio-fuel obligation scheme for the stated objectives of achieving security of supply, increasing employment and economic activity and reducing carbon emissions.  Crops such as corn, soya bean, flax and rape can be grown for bio-fuel production.  Animal and vegetable oils can also be used.  However, the difficulty with achieving the 4% obligation, which is necessitated by the renewable energy directive, is that 70% of our bio-fuels are imported.  The carbon footprint incurred by the transport of large quantities of bio-fuels from South America or Africa would defeat the overall objective of the obligation and make a mockery of climate change policy.</P>
        <P>I understand the obligation will increase the price of petrol and diesel by 1 cent per litre.  The chief executive of Maxol has already warned that the charges will be passed on to consumers.  If drivers are going to incur a charge, it is important that domestic production is maximised.  However, the motion proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il does not contain a roadmap for achieving 100% domestic production of bio-fuels.  The Irish Bioenergy Association estimates that meeting the bio-fuel obligation from Irish production will lead to &euro;170 million in direct economic activity and create 1,700 jobs.</P>
        <P>The option of domestically producing bio-fuels is becoming more attractive as fossil fuel prices increase.  In its job creation strategy, Fine Gael set out a roadmap for domestic production of bio-fuels.  Senator Walsh missed that point in his reading of our amendment.  I am <Col N="455"/>happy that his point of order was rejected because our amendment is very relevant to the motion to the extent that it underlines the absence of a roadmap.</P>
        <P>We welcome the motion but propose a new strategy.  Bord na M&oacute;na, Coillte and the National Council for Forest Research and Development should be brought under the same umbrella to create and finance a new State company called bio-energy Ireland which would invest &euro;800 million between 2010 and 2013 in next generation bio-energy technologies in the area of bio-mass, combined heat and power generation and transport.  We would develop five new production plants to produce an additional 150,000 tonnes of bio-diesel, a reforestation programme on an estimated 20,000 hectares and bio-mass combined heat and power plants at high energy demand locations such as hospitals, industrial estates and hotels.  The return on this investment will come from diverting the resources we currently spend on imported fuels in these sectors.  To the extent that these plans will achieve the objectives set out in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion, the amendment is extraordinarily pertinent and necessary.  I am sure Senator Walsh will on mature recollection &mdash; to use the hackneyed phrase &mdash; see the point of my argument and support the amendment.  Unanimous support for the amendment would give the motion real relevance.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>When we discuss bio-fuel we must be conscious of the food versus fuel debate.  Bio-fuel production must not displace food production or cause price inflation in food.  The food versus fuel debate came into sharp focus with recent food shortages and inflation in food prices.  Bio-fuel production must, therefore, be controlled to ensure it does not displace food production.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Teagasc has estimated that up to 100,000 hectares of land could be used for bio-energy crops without damaging, interfering with or putting at risk our food production targets.  Ireland has food surpluses and has the capacity to grow sugar cane and flax.  A significant amount of land in my constituency, which I share with the distinguished Acting Chairman, Senator Wilson, was traditionally used to grow flax.  Much of this land is not suitable for growing arable crops and would be more appropriately used to grow flax.  In addition, land previously used to supply the sugar industry, which has since closed in this country, could be used for bio-energy crop production.  Ireland has the advantage of having land available to produce bio-energy crops without prejudicing food production or placing at risk the volume of food the country produces.  Maintaining current food production levels and feeding the world&rsquo;s population must take precedence over other objectives.</P>
        <P>Senator Brady was correct that no credit institution will support someone seeking to establish a furniture store or other enterprise that is not viable.  Incentives are required to encourage farmers to produce crops used in bio-fuel production.  Investment in this area will provide a return and will be labour intensive, a key advantage when jobs have been lost in construction and other areas.</P>
        <P>Bio-fuel production must not lead to increases in the retail cost of petrol and diesel.  This is a major issue in Border areas.  If one adds 1 cent per litre to the cost of fuel, as envisaged under the obligation, introduces a carbon tax and factors in normal increases in the price of fuel, it is possible the price of fuel could reach a level that would put retailers along the Border and further south out of business.  This issue needs to be addressed and I ask the Minister to raise it at Cabinet level.</P>
        <P>I ask the House to adopt the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s plan as a positive and constructive means of achieving the objectives of the motion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="456"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I wish to share time with Senator Paddy Burke.  I welcome the Minister.  It would be relatively difficult in a spot the difference competition to identify significant differences between the proposals set out in the Government motion and Fine Gael Party amendment.  As the Minister will acknowledge, the Fine Gael Party has in recent months produced substantial policy proposals and documentation on alternative energy generation.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate this topic has been at the top of the Minister&rsquo;s agenda since taking office in summer 2007, it is time to move from words to deeds.  Alternative energies such as bio-fuels, biomass, wind and wave power have been part of political debate for the past decade.  Senators will concede, however, that progress has been limited, although progress has been made on wind farms and, to a lesser extent, on wave power.</P>
        <P>If we are to solve the energy crisis and tackle global climate change, we must not allow this issue to go unheeded.  Through this amendment and, more important, its policy proposals, the Fine Gael Party is highlighting that we have a once-off opportunity to address the issues of climate change and energy security by providing an Irish response to the global energy crisis.  This can be done by producing energy on Irish soil through wind, wave and bio-fuel production.</P>
        <P>I come from the north Cork area which for many years enjoyed the benefits of a sugar processing industry.  Interest among farmers in the opportunity to produce bio-fuels is substantial.  Hundreds, if not thousands, of farmers could be given a financial lifeline if we introduced plans to develop a bio-fuel industry.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s warning not to ignore the debate on food versus fuel is valid.  Three or four years ago our embrace of bio-fuels may have been excessively enthusiastic.  However, closer scrutiny of significant progress made in South America, particularly Brazil, revealed that forests were being destroyed and the natural food chain affected by the introduction of crops used for bio-fuels.  We must maintain a balance.  We may not be able to use every acre of land for fuel production but a vast amount of land could be used to grow crops for fuel production without affecting the supply of food.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his colleagues must make the transition from words, reports, proposals, promises and projections to action.  There is general agreement on the scale of the economic crisis and the need to solve it immediately, starting with next month&rsquo;s budget.  In all the darkness and gloom surrounding the economic debate, the energy crisis and global warming we should be able to work together to bring plans to expand bio-fuel production to fruition.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to reflect seriously on the Fine Gael Party amendment.  He will have debated this topic in the Other House with my party&rsquo;s representatives.  A great deal of hard work has been invested in producing the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s policy proposals.  They provide a basis for the action required to address the energy crisis.  I welcome this debate on an issue that must remain at the top of the political agenda in the coming months.  I hope, however, we will be able to move from words to action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for sharing time and enabling me to contribute to the debate on this interesting topic.  I welcome the Minister who has a great attendance record in the House, particularly for debates on bio-fuels and wind and wave energy.  I extend my best wishes to all those involved in a project off the coast of Belmullet in west Mayo.</P>
        <P>I am not surprised Senator Jim Walsh was excited by the Fine Gael Party amendment given that it is more positive than the Government motion.  The Minister should incorporate this positive amendment in the motion.  Deputy Coveney should be congratulated on the work he has done on researching and developing the plans set out in the NewERA policy document, under which Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte would be merged in a new semi-State body known as <Col N="457"/>bio-energy Ireland.  This plan would create 100,000 jobs and generate large sums for the economy.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister have plans to have the railway network electrified?  Electrification of the rail network is under way in a number of other jurisdictions where rail is recognised as the greenest transport sector.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that approximately 30% of bio-fuels in Ireland are produced by Irish companies.  However, the 4% obligation for bio-fuels which the Minister has proposed will represent a significant increase.  We will not be able to produce such a level of bio-fuels locally.  Therefore, a majority of it will be sourced abroad.  This will incur a cost in terms of the miles required to transfer the fuel to Ireland.  Senator Bradford raised an important point, namely, the issue of farming and the closure of sugar factories in Carlow and Mallow.  There is a golden opportunity to put in place alternative farming practices to produce bio-fuels in those locations.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, we have to be conscious of the food for fuel debate in this area.  Does the Government have any plans to generate locally the 4% bio-fuel obligation it has put in place rather than importing bio-fuel?  We are trying to increase our own resources and export bio-fuel in the long run.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of licences were issued to various people for the production of bio-fuels.  Some have not started production or seem to have no plans to produce bio-fuels.  Others, some of whom operated schemes which were up and running, sought licences but did not receive them.  The Minister should re-examine the issue of to whom the licences were allocated.  If those who did not receive a licence have continued to operate their schemes and need a licence, their situation should be regularised.  The Minister should examine the licensing issue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am glad to be here to debate this very useful motion which allows us to review what is happening in this complex and important area.  It is important for a number of reasons.  In a world where we will see increasing difficulty in accessing cheap, reliable supplies of oil we have to start providing for the security of the country and develop an alternative supply to light sweet crudes which have been available for the past 100 years.  The provision of bio-fuels is a key strategic objective behind the develop of such a strategy.  In terms of meeting our climate change targets, which include reducing our emissions, it is one of the elements which will provide us with an opportunity to cut back on our emissions to the extent scientists say is needed.</P>
        <P>Transport and the other areas where emissions occur, especially in the energy area, are probably the most difficult, the fastest growing and therefore the most important for us to pay attention to in order to see how we can make reductions.  We are doing a number of things.  The changes in the VRT system have worked in terms of making our vehicles more efficient.  Senator Brady referred to the switch to electric vehicles which will be a very significant component in our move away from the use of oil.</P>
        <P>The sustainable transport plans in place will achieve the same objective.  No matter what way one looks at it, even adding those initiatives and changes does not provide us with the reductions in emissions we need.  On that basis, properly sourced bio-fuels which have real emissions reduction results in their production are an important part of our strategic intent.</P>
        <P>In terms of where we are going, it is very much part of a European initiative.  The European Union, as part of the overall 20-20-20 target of emissions reductions, renewables development and efficiency gains which was agreed by Heads of Government earlier this year, set out within that a target for 10% use of renewable energy in transport for all member states by 2020 which sets our objective in terms of what we wish to achieve and is the reason this new obligation scheme has been introduced.</P><Col N="458"/>
        <P>It is recognised that this is a sensitive, difficult and complex subject.  A number of developments in recent years have drawn attention to the complexity and sensitivity of the development of bio-fuels.  There is a real concern bio-fuels may be connected to the recent spike in global food prices, particularly the effect of the American policy on the development of bioethanol and its effect on wheat prices.  It is something of real concern and has to be examined.</P>
        <P>It would seem that much of the speculative activity which took place in commodity markets during 2007 and 2008 is something of which we have to be aware and protect against.  The fact that land use changes may occur in the development of bio-fuels which have a significant detrimental effect in terms of protecting biodiversity and the sustainability of communities in distant parts of the world is a real concern against which we have to protect.  It is because of that reason, namely, the precautionary principle, that I revised our targets, which were set at 5.75% of bio-fuels in the supply in this country by 2020 to the new target of 4%.  However, there is a difference.  The target of 5.75% was not mandatory whereas the 4% target is obligatory and one which has real effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The role of the European Union is important because in addition to setting those targets it gives certain criteria for working with us in terms of developing sustainability criteria to address concerns such as land use changes and emissions reductions.  Its suitability criteria will be in place early next year, in time for us to apply them in any new obligations scheme.  It is clear they will include a provision whereby there must be a measurable 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in any new fuels which are supplied.  These will be done on a &ldquo;well-to-wheel&rdquo; or &ldquo;field-to-well&rdquo; basis, whereby one measures the entire supply chain in terms of the production, transportation and processing of crops for bio-fuels to find out the real emission reduction.  The effect of the use of fertiliser and chemicals is also taken into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The criteria the European Union sets also stipulate land use requirements to ensure we are protecting biodiversity and are not chopping down rainforests to grow palm oil to turn into bio-diesel here.  That would be the most short-sighted approach we could take.  Crucially, the European Union said it will include social conditions within the overall consideration of emissions reductions and the nature of the land use which is affected.  That wide range of conditions is a crucial first step in any bio-fuel development and we must ensure these conditions are introduced effectively and deliver on the protection criteria we have put in place.</P>
        <P>In terms of what we will do in this country in that regard, we will live within those criteria.  It will allow us to promote and see the development of indigenous fuel production which will meet the emissions reduction concerns and we will not have the same land use concerns which exist elsewhere.  There are limits to what we do.  A large amount of our fuel supply comes from waste products, which is beneficial in terms of emissions reductions and solving other waste problems.</P>
        <P>There is an opportunity for us to switch to the use of arable land for the production of feed stocks for bio-fuels.  However, the percentages and abilities are limited.  Certain targets can be reached but we do not have endless capacity to switch to arable production.  In response to what Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and others said, we are intent on developing indigenous opportunities for economic benefit and the security of our supplies.</P>
        <P>In terms of where we are going and what is changing, one of the main changes is a move away from the excise relief scheme which was termed the bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief scheme introduced in 2005 and 2006 and which awarded excise tax relief to 18 projects for the period up to 2010.  That scheme will come to an end next year.  The bio-fuels obligation scheme which will operate in tandem with it for a short period will eventually take over from it as the mechanism by which we will ensure the sustainable delivery of bio-fuel crops.  It is already evident that <Col N="459"/>the mineral oil tax relief scheme has led to the introduction of bio-fuels here.  It is typically allowing for blends of approximately 5%.  In 2008 the penetration or use of bio-fuels in the Irish oil market was approximately 1.6%.  We expect that figure to increase to approximately 2.5% this year.  The scheme has already served its purpose, which was to get businesses to set up here.  Five bio-fuel plants have been constructed and a number of others are at an advanced planning stage.  It has achieved its effect in terms of getting the supply chain up and running.  The 2.5% figure I have mentioned is in our tanks, without motorists having to bear the cost.  The price of oil has returned to a high level of between $80 and $90 a barrel.  I do not believe the figures quoted by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for the cost of bio-fuels.  One has to be careful in this regard.  It largely depends on what is the price of oil.  My prognosis, looking at the envisaged peak in global oil production, is that oil will become more expensive.  These bio-fuels can be delivered without additional costs being incurred by Irish motorists.  In effect, this mechanism will help to keep prices down.</P>
        <P>One of the problems with our excise tax relief system was that it did not provide for a very stable market.  The difficulty for Irish suppliers, or any supplier, was that they were bidding in a very volatile market, even with the tax relief system in place.  It was impossible for companies, other than the 18 bidders, to actually get into the business.  The benefit of the obligation system is that it provides a much more stable market because its graduated increases are mapped out.  It is not a market that can go on the basis of changes in oil prices.  It is guaranteed that a certain percentage of our fuels have to come from bio-fuels.  That stability will help producers here.  The tradeability of the certificates will allow small indigenous producers, in particular, to get into the market and develop their businesses.</P>
        <P>We have engaged in a widespread public consultation process, in terms of how our new bio-fuel obligations will work.  We have received approximately 40 submissions.  We are following the examples of obligation schemes in other countries, including the United Kingdom, which have introduced similar schemes.  We are introducing a scheme by applying in this jurisdiction the good experience of operations elsewhere.  It is an effective and relatively easy system.  It is not bureaucratic or complex.  As I said, it is based on tradeable certificates.  Every litre of bio-fuel brought to the market earns a certificate, regardless of who brings it.  At the end of each year mineral fuel suppliers will be required to surrender certificates to a value of 4% of the volume of mineral fuels brought to the market.</P>
        <P>The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, is responsible for ensuring Ireland complies with its EU and international obligations for emergency oil supplies.  The agency is funded by a levy on mineral fuels collected from oil suppliers.  It enters into contracts with oil suppliers for the purposes of leasing oil storage.  On that basis, I determined that NORA was the best and most appropriate administrator of our new bio-fuel obligations.  Oil companies and consumers currently make returns to my Department.  The levy applicable to individual companies is articulated by NORA based on these figures.  NORA charges companies accordingly.  The cost of administering the bio-fuel obligation will be met by extending the NORA levy to cover bio-fuels currently exempt.  Obligated parties will be required to apply to the scheme administrator for a bio-fuel obligation account and provide details of their fuel sales on a monthly basis.  Obligated parties and other suppliers of bio-fuels may apply for certificates for the bio-fuels they place on the Irish road transport market.  A bio-fuel obligation certificate is awarded for the supply of each litre of bio-fuel as long as certain conditions are met.  If the administrator believes these conditions have not been met, or if the information or evidence on the basis of which the certificate was issued is subsequently found to have been false, he or she will have the power to revoke the certificate.</P>
        <P>Bio-fuel obligation certificates may be traded across account holders.  Obligated parties who have not been able to fully meet their obligations by supplying bio-fuels will be able to purchase <Col N="460"/>credit certificates from other obligated parties and thereby meet their overall targets.  An obligated party who has a shortfall in his or her number of certificates at the end of a defined calendar year will be required to pay a non-compliance levy, calculated on the basis of the number of certificates by which he or she is short, multiplied by the established amount per certificate.  These certificates have a number of roles.  Their most important role is to protect consumers from structural rigidities in the fuel supplies market which could result in episodic periods of high fuel prices.  Crucially, as I said, the certificates have a secondary role in allowing small suppliers, usually of higher blend bio-fuels, to access the market, particularly when the environmental value of their products is recognised.  As I said, we may have a large number of niche supplies from the waste system, or from agricultural products, which can meet the sustainability criteria and have a competitive advantage over other international products.</P>
        <P>I do not have any difficulty with the intent of the Fine Gael amendment which seeks to set out how best we can develop our resources.  We will have to look at a wide variety of options of how we can develop our bioenergy and biomass industry.  When the new obligation certificate is in place and we can see how the European standard system is being applied, we will have a clearer understanding of how Irish producers will fit into the market as it evolves.  I am committed to doing whatever I can to make sure Irish farmers and business people end up producing these supplies.  In such circumstances, we will have local fuel supplies in the event of a future oil shock, which is the best protection we can have.  The Government is committed to meeting its EU obligations and its equal obligation to provide and protect jobs and keep money in this country, rather than importing fuel supplies from elsewhere.  That is one of the main objectives of our energy policy.</P>
        <P>As I said, I welcome this debate.  This is not an issue without controversy.  It is not necessarily the case that bio-fuels are good and other fuels are bad.  One has to be certain where the bio-fuels are coming from.  One has to know what are the environmental implications of bio-fuel production, sometimes in very distant parts of the world.  I am committed to ensuring we do not damage other ecosystems for the sake of meeting our fuel supply obligations.  We can do this, while meeting our security and climate change emissions reduction objectives.  I welcome the debate as a means of advancing a wider understanding of what we are doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and this debate.  The motion before the House is an appalling one and the amendment is not great either.  When a motion welcomes something being done by the Government and an amendment welcomes something being done by Fine Gael, it is very hard for an Independent Member to find the middle ground.  I wish to make it clear to the Minister that I want the Green Party to implement the low cost part of its agenda immediately.  Senator Boyle has heard me say this many times.  Those who are committed to the green agenda are wondering why there is a delay with the introduction of a foreshore Bill that will allow the proper operation of the connection.  People across the road today told us why Shell could not bring its supplies ashore.  I will not open that debate again.  A guy who addressed the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security recently said huge work had been done on district geothermal heating in south-west Dublin.  His company is ready to attract investment, but it cannot do so until legislation that will allow it to go down 2 km or 3 km &mdash; perhaps under other people&rsquo;s properties &mdash; with the certainty that it would reap the benefit of its investment has been passed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not contradict the Minister and I am glad to hear it.  That has been suggested to me, but I have not yet seen the Bill.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s commitment.  I am saying people outside the Green Party also believe this is a really great idea and that it should be pursued.  I am sure the Minister would prefer if I did not mention that the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security has produced an all-party foreshore Bill that does not threaten the Government in any way.  I ask the Minister to accept that legislation and not to listen to the officials in his Department who are trying to slow him down on it.  Let them make changes on Committee Stage or the Minister could take charge of the Bill himself and bring it through.  It can be his Bill; it does not need to be anybody else&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>Earlier I heard reference to the various developments in Mayo.  I met representatives of the local authority in Mayo who outlined their plans for the 500 MW wind farm at Bellacorick.  They outlined their plans for bringing ashore wave energy and their plans on wind energy in the area.  They have problems with planning legislation.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act should be extended as quickly as possible to deal with these issues.  The French Government manages to get around all the rules.  In the past two weeks it has entered an agreement with Renault for the development of car batteries, which will be properly assessed for all this work.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Before the Minister goes, I wish to make one quick comment to him.  In 1927 when we needed considerable help to develop electricity, the company that did the work on it was Siemens.  I do not know whether the Minister has seen the recently completed study on sustainable urban infrastructure for Dublin commissioned by Siemens.  It makes fascinating reading and outlines the levers that could be put in place.  The research carried out independently by a group in University College Dublin indicated the levers that could be used to reduce the carbon emissions from Dublin.  It lists them one after the other and while the issue of bio-fuels is lower down the list, it is in there.  I am making the point that certain other things are more important.  I do not want to delay the Minister.  I ask him to recognise the issues in that independent research study.  It shows the things that can be done and would pay for themselves.  The study was completed from a commercial point of view and outlines what it would cost in investment and when it would pay back.  For each of these levers it outlines what it would save in millions of tonnes of carbon per year and how many years it would take to pay back.  This is what we need to do.  I thank the Minister for his attention in that regard.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  Before he came in I mentioned something in his constituency regarding the geothermal district heating project in his area.  I ask the Minister of State to kick out around him to ensure it is done.  This will allow us to lead in Europe.  I will return to the study commissioned by Siemens.</P>
        <P>We have the most harvestable wave energy in Europe off the north Mayo coast, where the average wave height over the year is 2.5 m.  We can now simply deal with these things.  I heard people here speak enthusiastically about the Spirit of Ireland project.  There is nothing wrong with that project.  It is not very efficient; it is only approximately 70% efficient to pump water up a hill and get it down again as is done in Turlough Hill, but it is a project that could work.  In the meantime Deputy Coveney and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security have done considerable work on electric cars as storage as opposed to all the other possibilities and while I am glad to see the Minister making progress in that direction, more needs to be done.</P>
        <P>I said Renault has a special deal with the French Government and is first into the market on this issue.  We could be doing that.  We were first in the market for wave energy until <Col N="462"/>approximately five or six years ago when we were overtaken by Scotland which now has wave energy connected to the grid in north-west Scotland.  There are things that we are not doing.</P>
        <P>The study funded by Siemens and carried out by a number of academics in UCD outlined a list of carbon abatement levers.  I do not have time to go into these in detail; I would like to have a longer debate on it.  Its top placed item, renewable energy generation, would save 1.4 million tonnes of carbon per year in the Dublin area.  It is followed by building retrofitting, basically various forms of insulation; Transport 21, the Government&rsquo;s plan to improve public transport; modified petrol cars; a city district heating scheme, which is what is going on in the constituency of the Minister of State; modified diesel cars; and various other items.  Vehicular bio-fuels appears ninth on the list, which is not unimportant but in the Dublin area it would only save 100,000 tonnes of carbon as opposed to renewable energy generation, which would save 1.4 million tonnes of carbon.  We need to look at these things.  I met representatives of Siemens to discuss the report because I was greatly impressed by it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What does the Government expect the price of oil to be in one year, two years and three years?  Some of the futures markets for next year are quoting $100 per barrel, which would make a significant difference.  As we know it went higher than that before.  If it went up to $200 per barrel, it would have a considerable impact on our plans.  We need to move the matter forward.  In addition we need to have a development particularly in photovoltaic solar panels, as opposed to water heating solar panels.  A rich harvest in that area is also available in Ireland.</P>
        <P>We are being hit by information coming from all sides.  I am impressed by this academic study outlining the changes that would need to be made for this to work in Dublin.  It has everything.  It deals with the environmentalists, the investor and commercial and planning issues.  It deals with the cost of investment, the period of payoff and the savings in carbon.  All we need to do is compare that with what we will need to pay Europe in fines for not reducing emissions.</P>
        <P>That brings me neatly to the importance of a climate change Bill &mdash; Senator Boyle will be surprised I have not mentioned it so far.  I am prepared to second his climate change Bill if he is prepared to publish one quickly enough.  If not, he might second mine, which might be somewhat more difficult.  A climate change Bill needs to outline what we will do in the following years.  We should benchmark the changes we need to make.  I have only just touched on the issue.  We need a business plan based on the various prices oil could reach in the next three or four years.  I do not pick Dublin for any reason except that it is an urban area and most of the carbon emissions come from urban areas.  It does not take from the need to deal with agricultural and other issues outside urban areas.  This deals with issues.  I recall Senator Butler speaking in very supportive terms of the Spirit of Ireland project in recent times.  However, here is an issue for Dublin.  It may not be as sexy as the Spirit of Ireland project which had everybody orgasmic about how important it was.  While I agree it was important, it is not the most important because it did not deal with storage in an efficient manner, but it could be done.  In order to get it going, first the wind farms need to be built.  We have problems in that regard.  <?oasys _dc18- ?>Everybody is in favour of wind farms until somebody in the local community objects.  What is going on is ridiculous.  There are people who claim to be environmentalists who are not environmentalists at all.  They hide behind the theory of environmentalists.  The environment is far less important to them than the intrusion on them of the sight of a wind farm on the top of a hill.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In the first instance I would like to agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in the sense that laudatory motions at Private Members&rsquo; time and knee-jerk reactions to them may not be the best use of this time.  The core issue of this debate is important to debate.  As the Minister has already said it is important to get a progress report on it.  On a personal basis I <Col N="463"/>am tickled pink that we have the two Civil War parties arguing over the new green agenda.  The reality is that we need to have this debate and consider its subject matter in its widest context.  If Senators will pardon the pun, bio-fuel is part of the mix but is no panacea.  We have learned that with great difficulty in a global sense.  The European Union, which established markers which have now been disassembled, has at least now honestly faced up to the fact that putting all the eggs in this particular basket brings about environmental hazards as well as dealing with issues of fuel security and economic savings.</P>
        <P>The bio-fuel market is an international one and is being pushed by those who see it as an economic opportunity.  In pushing forward that opportunity there has been a looseness in adhering to environmental standards.  The Minister is correct that in meeting the standards we have now laid down and which are enforced by the European Union, we must be aware of both the environmental and social consequences of how bio-fuel is produced and subsequently used.  That being said, we have an opportunity to grow a bio-fuel market which for several reasons we have chosen not to pursue to a significant extent.</P>
        <P>Excise duty exemptions have been in place for several years and serious questions must be asked about those who have chosen to avail of those exemptions, those who have not chosen to avail of them and the fact that among those granted the various exemptions, there is a total reliance on importing the bio-fuel itself.  I am aware of only one Irish-based company which is in the business of refining bio-fuel that is produced in this country.  It is ironic that this debate was introduced by Senator Walsh because I understand the company in question is based in New Ross and is not a beneficiary of the existing licensing and exemption system.  As this is something that is coming to a close at the end of 2010, the Department of Finance and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources must review it critically because we seem to have got it very badly wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Applicants must give a ten-year commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  In regard to the new standards, it is important that the average of 4% is being struck given that the Minister has shown how the 5% and other standards have oscillated as we have been experimenting with this policy approach.  With a 4% average there is a guarantee that in terms of cost savings and environmental benefit, as long as the bio-fuel can be shown to have a 35% improvement in terms of lower carbon costs, it is something we should go with.  It is a question of putting a blend into what will remain into the medium term the number one fuel force in terms of consumers&rsquo; transport needs.  That is a reality we must recognise.  However, that does not preclude the objective of achieving a higher percentage of bio-fuel in the blend or of developing 100% bio-fuel options, as has been done successfully by Carbery Milk Products in Inniskeen whose product is retailed through the Maxol network.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other speakers referred to the potential perils of a fuel for food approach.  There is no doubt, as the Minister indicated, that the rush towards bio-fuel in countries such as the United States and in emerging economies such as Brazil put great pressure on food prices in 2007 and 2008.  A very poor balance was struck whereby in seeking to meet our overall energy needs, we neglected the food needs of much of the planet&rsquo;s population.  On that basis, the question we must ask ourselves in an environmental sense, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole indicated, is not the extent to which bio-fuels can replace our existing consumption patterns in terms of transport and other usages of fossil fuels but rather to what extent our energy consumption is necessary, sustainable and likely to grow into the long term.  Those are the questions we are reluctant to ask because the assumption is that asking them will put at risk our future economic well-being.  However, if we do not ask ourselves those questions, then we are not serious about building a sustainable future in terms of energy needs, with a role for bio-fuel within that, and all we are <Col N="464"/>doing as a society is replacing something bad with something less bad.  That is not a solution to our long-term environmental problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must be serious in our approach to such issues as how we travel from A to B, the types of supports we are willing to give to public transport and the degree to which we can and will deal with renewable energies.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that there has been a degree of frustration in terms of the failure to implement many aspects of the programme for Government in a timely fashion.  However, with this debate, in the course of which the Minister has given a good exposition and progress report on what is happening in the bio-fuel area, we have also had today the Second Stage debate on the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2009 which represents an important legislative contribution in terms of how we deal with environmental campaigning in the future.  Without that, we cannot ratify the Aarhus Convention.</P>
        <P>If there is to be effective public engagement on the environmental issues that face us as a nation and globally into the future, there must be a cultural shift as well as changes in legislation and replacement products.  I continue to have trust and confidence in the Minister even though he chose to leave the Chamber before I made my contribution.  This part of the energy and environmental agenda has benefited not only from the Minister&rsquo;s and the Government&rsquo;s approach but also from the honest approach taken by the European Union.  The road on which we are embarked is of necessity paved with good intentions but we should never be afraid to turn back from that course and change tack as required.  The Minister&rsquo;s statement on Government policy in this area is predicated on that simple truth.  We must take the opportunity to get our proposals right.  As a society, an economy and an environment, we will benefit from that policy approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to the House.  I am pleased to participate in this debate which allows us to examine the pros and cons of the bio-fuel issue.  However, it must be looked at in a broader context because we can all too often get lost in a type of tunnel vision on this issue and drive on regardless of new insights.  Much of the information I will contribute to this debate is from the Oxfam website which I reviewed as part of my research for this debate.  There are many issues that are not immediately clear in respect of bio-fuels that must be taken into consideration when seeking to develop the sector.</P>
        <P>Deputy Boyle referred to the increase in food prices in recent years as a consequence of the increase in bio-fuel production.  There are many interesting articles in the newspapers which examine how we are living our lives and which explore how the recession presents an opportunity to re-evaluate where we are, what we are doing and how we do it.  There is all types of advice in terms of economic savings, recycling and so on which essentially boil down to returning to the Ireland we had before the Celtic tiger stuck its paws in us all.  In terms of being economical we are being advised to bring lunches into works, reuse leftovers and so on.  That is precisely what people in this country did for many years.</P>
        <P>Food prices have doubled in the last three years and people in developing countries are spending between 50% and 80% of their incomes on food, thus bearing the brunt of the food crisis.  Poor harvests in large food-producing countries such as Australia, probably as a result of climate change, have impacted food supplies.  Increased oil prices mean it is now more expensive to produce and transport food.  However, demand for food has increased owing to better diets in countries such as China and India, with the resulting increase in food prices drawing speculators to those areas.  We must be very mindful of the dangers in this regard.  Those speculators are not getting involved for the good of any nation&rsquo;s health but rather for the good of their pocket.</P><Col N="465"/>
        <P>This is a controversial and complex issue and no panacea is likely to emerge from this debate in respect of bio-fuels and other issues affecting developing countries.  Governments must take urgent action in this regard and we have an important role to play in that context.  Bio-fuels are supposed to tackle climate change but recent evidence suggests they can exacerbate it and can be an excuse in some respects for inaction on reducing carbon emissions.  The European Union has set a target that requires 10% of all transport fuels to be produced from bio-fuels by 2010, which is laudable, but when one teases out the issues, that is not as straightforward as it seems.</P>
        <P>According to the Oxfam report, the chairperson of the UN permanent forum on indigenous issues recently warned that 60 million people worldwide could face displacement from their land to make way for bio-fuel plantation, which is worrying.  Reports are emanating from Tanzania that vulnerable groups are being forced aside to make way for bio-fuel plantations.  Mtamba is one of 11 villages that skirts 9,000 hectares on which Sun Bio-fuels Tanzania Limited, a subsidiary of Sun Bio-fuels, a British company, is finalising an investment deal which will result in the company setting up operations there.  The 11,000 people living in the area use the land to make charcoal, which is a major source of income, to collect firewood and to collect herbs for food and medicine.  Most significantly, the land allocated for bio-fuel production includes a swamp, which is the only source of water for the villagers.  It is not clear what will happen to them and their water supply.</P>
        <P>Given the commercial interest in this land, will the business people be exercised by the water needs of the villagers or the commercial need to get the plant up and running?  We must be clear about this.  Rich countries must revise their policies now.  Ireland&rsquo;s bio-fuels policy must take cognisance of the origins of this issue.  Evidence of the damage it is causing is overwhelming and we need to be mindful of this.  Even in poor countries where bio-fuels may offer a new commodity and increased employment, the potential costs, including environmental damage, land displacement and diminished food and water supplies are severe and we should proceed with caution.</P>
        <P>I refer to our overseas development aid, ODA, budget.  If we get our strategy right and allow countries to develop economically, socially and environmentally, many of them will become self-sufficient and will deal with these issues themselves.  I do not teach the Minister to suck eggs but one of the main priorities of the Irish Aid programme is the reduction of poverty, inequality and exclusion in development countries.  Members have raised many issues in the context of budgetary cutbacks and the McCarthy report.  The NIMBY syndrome is at play in this regard, as none of us wants cutbacks in our area.</P>
        <P>Many fine contributions were made in the D&aacute;il last night as Opposition parties set out their stall but last week I honed in on the Social Justice Ireland pre-budget submission.  It referred to the McCarthy report recommendation to abolish Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  My constituency depends wholly on marine activity and coastal communities need the industry to survive.  Families are the target of the services provided by Social Justice Ireland, a fine organisation led by Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy and his colleagues who are committed to social justice.  They referred to the amount that would be saved by abolishing BIM.  However, the agency itself has identified savings in the context of budgetary cutbacks and we could cut off our nose to spite our face in this regard.  BIM is one of the few successes in the decentralisation programme and the full import of that statement will be borne out at the beginning of 2010.  If this brand is abolished, it will affect our seafood brand and our export markets.  The people who depend on the fishing industry live on middle and low incomes in coastal communities and they will suffer.</P>
        <P>The reduction in ODA, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be difficult but it will be most difficult for those in developing countries.  The UN Millennium Development <Col N="466"/>Goals require the international community to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality and ensure environmental stability among other equally important issues.  Since its inception in 1974 the Irish Aid programme has had a strong focus on sub-Saharan Africa.  Approximately 80% of our ODA budget goes to Africa.  Under the bilateral part of its programme, Irish Aid operates intensive and wide-ranging country programmes in six countries in this region, namely, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia and Uganda.  Malawi will become Ireland&rsquo;s seventh programme country in Africa.  Tunnel vision can come into play where bio-fuels are concerned.</P>
        <P>We must be cognisant of developing countries in the bio-fuels debate.  I refer again to the villages with 11,000 people who depend on water from a swamp for their needs.  We must be mindful of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the debate but the importance of bio-fuels could be overstated.  They are important to the farming community which has the opportunity to develop a bio-fuels programme for the country but I would like the sector to focus on home heating, blending and agriculture.  These three sectors have a huge future but as a long-term proposal, bio-fuels rate very low on the list in terms of what can be achieved.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the importance of us getting on with bigger programmes to find alternative energy sources.  The Spirit of Ireland project is an example.  He stated it is only 70% efficient but it is much more than that.  It is 85% efficient because the Senator has not taken the evaluations into account.  Wind blows periodically and it can only be harnessed when it blows.  Wind energy production has been shown to be 85% efficient and it also generates employment.</P>
        <P>Farmers have a great opportunity with bio-fuels.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, approximately 100,000 hectares could be developed in the State without affecting food production.  A conservative approach to bio-fuels should be taken because Ireland produces high quality food and the agriculture sector is important, given the number of people employed.  Therefore, it should be supported.</P>
        <P>I would like beet production to resume in this country.  That crop brought wealth to the country and farmers benefited hugely from it.  Ethanol can be made from beet but it can also be used to produce pulp for animal feed.  The two sugar refineries in Carlow and Mallow are lying idle and could be used for this industry.  I would like to see development in this regard.</P>
        <P>Pressing plants for rape seed oil could formulate a business.  We should also develop our willow crops.  Buffalo grass needs only be sown once and, like hay, grows repeatedly.  It can be manufactured into a bio-fuel.  Many excellent projects could be developed in the bio-fuel area.  One such is micro-wind energy.  A farmer&rsquo;s two biggest costs are electricity and diesel.  Bio-fuels could be used to produce energy on farms.  Micro-wind energy could be used to generate electricity, especially for dairy farmers.  Our small rivers are not used to their full extent.  Small hydro systems could be installed on small rivers.  They would be hugely beneficial to farmers.</P>
        <P>Heavy frost can cause bio-fuel to freeze.  This is an important factor which must be taken into consideration.  The blending sector will increase miles per gallon output by at least 5% and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by up to three tonnes, which is very important.  It will also help us to meet our Kyoto commitments and avoid carbon taxes.</P>
        <P>Bio-fuels have a place in the economy.  They play a small but essential part in the bigger picture.  Progress must come from people such as those involved in the Spirit of Ireland.  They have made proposals, are in the process of completing their business plan and have identified <Col N="467"/>two suitable sites in the west.  It would be a wonderful boost for the country to be able to produce our own energy from a natural resource.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  People are becoming more and more aware of the exciting new potential of alternatives to fossil fuels.  It is not long since none of us was aware of concepts such as biomass, bio-fuels, sustainability and renewability in the context of energy production.</P>
        <P>Many lament the problem of individualism which besets our society, despite the disappearance of the Celtic tiger which, in part, gave rise to it.  It is worrying that individualism continues in times of crisis when people become more fearful of their own economic security.  We must all pay attention to the need for a united approach to the problems which face us in our economic travails.  We must promote solidarity between people.  It is all too easy in times of fear to retreat into our own houses and seek to protect our own sectoral interests.  The only way to deal with the greater problems which beset humanity is to try to get human beings to unite, find common cause and make sacrifices for each other.</P>
        <P>It is in the area of environmental protection, energy security and developing clean, green forms of energy that one finds people uniting quite visibly.  In this area, we have a heightened consciousness of our obligations to each other, not only to the people who share the world with us now but also to future generations.  Intergenerational solidarity is growing in purchase.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s initiative to introduce a bio-fuel obligation scheme in July 2010.  I note what the Government said about the reduction of emissions and the increased security of supply, employment opportunities and economic well-being it entails.</P>
        <P>We are all familiar with the maxim that sometimes the perfect can be the enemy of the good.  I wonder if this is an occasion when the good might be the enemy of the perfect.  I think of bio-fuel as something that is better than fossil fuels, can generate employment and improve economic activity, is less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels and, therefore, has a lot going for it.  It is exciting to think of cars which are environmentally friendly, whether those fuelled by hydrogen or something like the Toyota Prius, whose combination of battery and fuel leads to lower emissions and higher mileage per litre.  We have a romantic image of filling our bio-fuel based cars with vegetable oil from the chipper, although I know we are talking this evening about something more industrially developed.</P>
        <P>It is apparent to many people that many questions remain to be answered in this area.  These questions have been well ventilated by others.  I heard with interest the concerns raised by Senator McCarthy.  For example, I am very conscious of the recommendations of the hunger task force.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will have a particular interest in this given a portfolio he once held with distinction.  I am very conscious of the work of the hunger task force and of Ireland&rsquo;s particular obligation to address issues around hunger.</P>
        <P>When one thinks of what non-governmental organisations such as Self Help have to say, they point out very clearly that we must support the farmers of the world.  I am thinking in particular of farmers in Africa.  There was a time when we had massive amounts of excess food and so on and food could be transferred to other continents but that is not the current reality where there is higher consumption of food worldwide in places like China and so on.</P>
        <P>The devotion of arable land to the production of biomass raises questions about biodiversity and about farming in poorer countries.  It is a known fact that in Africa, for example, the majority of the population live very close to the land.  There is huge potential for progress in helping people farm more effectively, more sustainably and more productively and thereby tackle hunger and build a better future.</P><Col N="468"/>
        <P>We must have regard to concerns about whether an unrestricted biomass industry would take account of the small farmer, the ordinary people and the people without power and influence.  This is a good which must be regulated and must not be subject to unrestricted market forces.  It must be regulated in the interests of the most vulnerable people of our<?oasys _jy ?>world.</P>
        <P>While welcoming progress in terms of environmental protection which bio-fuel can entail and the economic activity it can entail, the focus for Ireland must be on completely renewable and completely clean energy.  I commend Senator Butler, for example, on bringing in speakers from the Spirit of Ireland project.  I want to hear the Government talk about that project and about how and when Ireland will be at the cutting edge of all that is possible in the area of completely green and completely renewable energy from wind, wave and water and the wind and water combination which is at the heart of the Spirit of Ireland proposal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I intend to table an Adjournment Matter shortly in order that the Minister can explain the current position and the Government&rsquo;s attitude to Spirit of Ireland and all that needs to be done to develop our potential in an optimistic and engaged way in the area of production of clean, green energy through wind and water.  Are we serious about it?  Will we take risks to achieve our potential and become net exporters of energy in the very near future, which is achievable?  Will our Government invest the time and the resources and, crucially, have the imagination to make all that happen?</P>

	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  If one stays long enough in politics, first, one might live long enough to see one&rsquo;s dreams come true and, second, one might live to see that what one may have wished for is not necessarily the most beneficial thing.  In 2004, I tabled an Adjournment matter because I had been alerted to the whole bio-fuels issue which was in its early days.  I said the potential was enormous and I requested that the Minister bring forward a measure in regard to bio-fuels.  We are a little further on and a measure will be enacted.</P>
        <P>As Senators Mullen and McCarthy said, the first types of bio-fuels at which we looked are not necessarily very sustainable, both in Ireland and internationally.  We have moved on to the second phase of bio-fuels.  There is scope there but we need to do things differently.  That is what I meant when I said that one should be cautious about what one dreams for.  What may have appeared a fantastic idea might not necessarily play out as one, and this has come to pass.</P>
        <P>I am excited by this new type of fuel, dimethyl ether, DME.  This will be the new bio-fuel and in what Ireland needs to invest.  I encourage Members to look at the website <i>www.bluefuelenergy.com</i>.  This is the most extraordinary fuel.  It is clean and is a type of gas which can be used in housing and vehicles.  It is quite extraordinary and is very much at the cutting edge.  The added potential for our country is that wind generation can be used to get more out of<?oasys _jy ?>it.</P>
        <P>I speak very vaguely because it is literally at the cutting edge of science.  China and Korea, in particular, are leading the way in this regard.  If one looks at this website, one will see where <Col N="469"/>it is at.  This is where it is at for Ireland.  The Minister may not be fully aware of the potential in Ireland for DME and how to exploit it.  That is why I welcome this initiative.  While we are all still in the mindset of bio-fuels and of sticking the pump into the nozzle in the car in the same old way, Members should look at this <i>www.bluefuelenergy.com</i> website.  They will be blown away by what can be done.  It is fuel from air.  This is where we can really lead the way.  A very select group of academics are looking at it.  The cutting edge is in the east, in Indonesia and such places, and that is why Ireland needs to recognise the potential.  Much more can be got out of it through wind energy.</P>
        <P>I have concentrated on DME but I welcome this initiative and the fact we are finally bringing more conventional bio-fuels to bear in the country.  I hope it brings opportunities for our agriculture sector.  Farmers are entrepreneurs but they need to know there is a secure market.  This can be demonstrated by this initiative.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome it in so far as it goes but I urge the Minister to look at dimethyl ether, DME, because it is the way of the future.  I hope Ireland is at the cutting edge of this.  Some scientists here are looking into it and can see it has enormous potential.  I hope the Government gets behind it.  We debated the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill earlier.  There are a million ways in which the Government can kick-start initiatives and this is one of them.</P>
        <P>If I have done nothing else, I hope I have alerted Members to DME and the <i>www.bluefuelenergy.com</i> website.  I look forward to speaking to Members about it again because they will be very surprised at what Ireland could do.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House and commend him on his work in this area.  He is the right man in the right place at the right time.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Malley on her wonderful green speech.  She is more green than the Green Party Members, which is a wonderful tribute to her.  I was very impressed by her contribution.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This motion welcomes the Government initiative to introduce a bio-fuel obligation scheme in July 2010.  I have a few questions which the Minister of State may or may not be able to answer.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, referred to electric vehicles, the development of which is an important initiative being undertaken by the ESB.  In regard to the harnessing of hydrogen, the Minister has taken an interest in a project presented to him by an individual during the Fianna F&aacute;il think-in at the Hodson Bay Hotel in September.  The Minister has been extremely helpful to this man in working out his proposal.  The Minister has a very open mind on these issues. The potential of hydrogen is unlimited if it can be harnessed.  I have an open mind on this and I have been encouraging the young man involved.  He had entered into detailed studies and research with some eminent people in this field.  It is a very exciting area of alternative fuels.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>In regard to bio-fuel production, I note that the Minister made the point that he would rule out using bio-fuel produced on land of biodiversity value, including primary forests, highly biodiverse grasslands and wetlands.  Additionally, there is a substantial reporting requirement on the European Commission in terms of the effects bio-fuel production is having on social conditions and employment terms.  That is an important consideration.</P>
        <P>I do not see any advisers present which means the Minister of State may not be able to answer all my questions.  Will a separate pump be required in forecourts to provide the bio-fuel or will the fuel be mixed separately before it is delivered to the forecourt and then used <Col N="470"/>in regard to diesel and petrol?  Will there be a blending of the bio-fuel with diesel and the<?oasys _jy ?>petrol?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, additional pumps will not be required in forecourts and diesel and petrol will contain 10% of bio-fuel.  I presume that is the plan.  Otherwise, it would be complicated to provide additional pumps on small forecourt areas which would involve additional costs and planning.  This is an ambitious plan.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.  I thank the Minister of State present and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who was here earlier, for coming to the House.  The points made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley are worth pursing.  We should check the website to which she referred and I thank her for bringing it to our attention.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on his work on the development of hydrogen fuel cells.  He is most innovative.  I served in the Department he is in, although not in the science and technology side.  He has some great ideas.  I hope he will come to the House in the near future and outline some of his ideas and the work he is doing on the development of alternative<?oasys _jy ?>energy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  It seems I always put Adjournment matters to him and I trust he has good news for all the couples and families waiting to adopt babies from Russia.  </P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children to indicate when the blacklist regarding post-placement records of children adopted into Ireland from Russia will be cleared.  This clearance is necessary to allow new adoptions from Russia to proceed for Irish families with referrals for babies.  Russia is the second biggest provider of babies to this country.  Hundreds of couples are waiting to adopt babies from there.</P>
        <P>I have received an e-mail from an agent based in Ireland, representing Irish families, who cannot deliver because of the block resulting from the position on post-placement records.  The e-mail relates how a couple with a referral for a baby in Moscow on 15 October and were due to speak to the Moscow ministry of education on 24 November.  That would have been their third referral, or offer of a baby, the couple had received.  They received an initial referral for a baby in Guatemala in December 2007 but lost the opportunity due to closure in Guatemala, a matter unrelated to the position in Russia.  Another referral was arranged for 18 May this year but again they lost out as a result of Ireland being blacklisted because of non-adherence to the agreed protocol on post-placement reports.  The entire reason the couple need a second extension is the blacklisting.  The timeline runs from the original application made in May 2003 which means they are now waiting six and a half years for a baby.  They have been offered this opportunity on three occasions but because of the blacklisting of Ireland by Russia, due to the fact that the HSE has not completed 29 post-placement records, no babies can be adopted from Russia.</P>
        <P>How many outstanding post-placement reports remain to be completed?  What is the reason for the delay?  What is the Minister of State doing about it and what steps is he taking to ensure the blacklist is cleared?  When will this matter be sorted out?  I can cite many other examples of couples waiting for babies.  This is a painful and spiritual journey.  I say this from my experience.  It is very difficult for a couple to be refused a baby.  Each time a couple or family are offered a referral and it does not proceed, part of them goes with it.  I hope the Minister of State has good news.  I want to know when this matter will be sorted out in order that we can give guidance to Irish families on when it is likely they will have babies in their homes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for raising this matter.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, who is currently speaking in the D&aacute;il Chamber in the debate on human trafficking on Private Members&rsquo; business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s objective in regard to adoption is to provide a regime in which the child will be at the centre of the adoption process, whether inter-country or domestic, and that adoptions will be effected in a manner that is legal, safe and secure.  A key component in achieving this objective is the development of an appropriate legislative regime that recognises the changed and changing global situation with regard to adoption in the past 20 years.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill 2009, published on 23 January, provides an assurance for children, their families and the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was effected in the best interests of the child.  A core principle of both the Adoption Bill and the Hague Convention is that the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount.  The Hague Convention <Col N="472"/>which is given the force of law in the Bill effectively puts in place an agreement between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.  It is to put in place safeguards that acceptable standards are being applied in other countries over which we have no jurisdiction.  I am encouraged at the progress that has been made in the past year, including the publication of the Bill and its passage through the Seanad.  It is being debated today in the D&aacute;il and I remain hopeful Ireland will finally ratify the Hague Convention early in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Bill is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  The new legislation is designed to provide a framework to ensure appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  This applies in the case of adoptions from Russia and other countries that have not yet ratified the Hague Convention and seem unlikely to do so in the immediate future.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Bill when enacted.  Chapter 3 of the Bill sets out extensive provisions regarding non-contracting states and mirrors precisely the standards required for Hague Convention countries.</P>
        <P>There is no prohibition on adoptions from non-Hague Convention countries.  However, such adoptions must be carried out in the context of a bilateral agreement in line with the current policy position, as set out in the Bill.  For an adoption to be registered under the Bill, it must be effected in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement or have been effected prior to the commencement of the new law.  This applies to ensure a single standard applies and that applicants can have some degree of confidence in the systems in place in the sending country.  It provides a protection for children, their parents and adoptive parents.</P>
        <P>Neither the Adoption Board nor the HSE has a statutory function in the provision of post-placement reports, although they have facilitated and continue to facilitate the preparation of same.  The key commitment given concerns the legal affidavit, required of all applicants, to co-operate in the provision of such reports.  Recent discussions have focused on the completion and submission to the Russian authorities of a number of outstanding post-placement reports from adoptive parents of children adopted from Russia.  This issue is being followed up by the Adoption Board and the HSE with the parents involved.  I understand the greater number of the outstanding reports have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation.  In other words, the social workers have conducted the home visit and the report.  In a small number of cases parents have neglected to or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with the social worker.  Further contact has been made to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and this is being prioritised by the HSE adoption services to ensure parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy in Dublin.</P>
        <P>In the past few months the Minister has met regularly both individual prospective adoptive parents and representative groups.  The Government is deeply aware of the angst, frustration and emotion that prospective adoptive parents continue to experience at this time.  The Minister has communicated updates on these matters at every opportunity and is committed to continuing with this process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>From what the Minister of State said, the blame rests with adoptive families who have not facilitated home visits by the HSE.  Can they not be hurried?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending to respond to this matter.  It concerns the status of the Grangegorman development project, the DIT site on the northside of Dublin.  It is a project that has been in planning for many years.  Its aim is to have all DIT facilities across Dublin located on a single piece of land.  At present, that piece of land is occupied by St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital.  Bringing all of the facilities together will deliver greater efficiency to the way the DIT is run and will allow the various units and parts of the DIT to work better together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a very exciting project for my part of Dublin.  Not only does it offer an opportunity for a very successful and large third level institute to be located in the heart of it, but at a time when we are so desperately looking for innovation, ways to commercialise new ideas and new ways to employ people, the work the DIT is doing offers a very exciting vision as to how that can be done.  One of the many things it seeks to do is to provide training for the array of skills necessary for our entire economy to do well.  One can get training and education in the DIT for everything from nanotechnology to a trade.  Bringing all of the services and facilities together on one site offers an opportunity for it to become more of a dynamo for the development of Dublin&rsquo;s economy, for businesses to work side by side with that facility and for people who work in Dublin to access exciting new educational opportunities.  This is everything the Government speaks about when discussing moving the economy and our society forward.  This is a golden opportunity.</P>
        <P>Many rumours are now circulating, some of which were started by statements in the McCarthy report, that this project might be put on ice.  There are rumours about the status of the Grangegorman Development Agency.  All I care about is this project which will have such an ability to contribute to our economy and all of Dublin.  It is a living example of what the smart economy could look like.  I am looking for an update from the Minister of State and a guarantee from the Government that this very important project will go ahead in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the progress made by the Grangegorman Development Agency since its establishment in 2006.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, in 2001 the Government appointed an interdepartmental committee to examine the potential for the development of the Grangegorman site as a new Dublin Institute of Technology community campus.  Its report was presented to the Government in November 2001 and the main recommendation of that report was the establishment of the Grangegorman Development Agency.  Established under the Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005, the general aim of the agency is to oversee the development of the lands at Grangegorman on behalf of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Health Service Executive.  Grangegorman is a unique site and is of strategic importance to Dublin as a whole.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the agency was held in November 2006 and since that date the agency has done considerable work.  It has established links with all the relevant stakeholders and established a consultative group as required under section 22 of the Act.  The agency completed the drafting of a strategic plan and budget for the development of the whole site and submitted the draft plan and budget to the Department in October 2008 as provided in section 12(2)(<i>h</i>) of the Act.  Copies of the plan and budget were also forwarded to the Minister for Health and Children for her consideration.  Following receipt of the strategic plan, officials, in consultation with the Higher Education Authority, commenced an assessment of the proposals.  The Department also sought the advice of the National Development Finance Agency on the funding <Col N="474"/>portions of the draft cost-benefit analysis from the Dublin Institute of Technology and the draft strategic plan.</P>
        <P>In March 2009, the agency submitted a revised strategic plan and budget.  The revised plan takes account of the reduced prices that have materialised in the construction sector by updating construction prices to January 2009 values.  The agency also reduced enabling infrastructure costs and revised the estimated value of the DIT&rsquo;s property portfolio to reflect current market trends.  The revised plan proposes to deliver the complete project in phases.</P>
        <P>Having completed the draft strategic plan and budget, the Grangegorman Development Agency provided the Department with a clear indication of the overall costs and timeframe for the development of the Grangegorman site.  This has allowed the Department and the Department of Health and Children the opportunity to consider fully the costs and timeframes involved in utilising the Grangegorman campus to provide for the needs of both the Health Service Executive and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The strategic plan is being considered by the Department and it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to bring the matter to Government as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Grangegorman Development Agency was one of a number of agencies referred to in the proposals contained in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  I assure the Senator that all planned expenditure levels for the Department are being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010.  This includes consideration of the Grangegorman development and decisions on all issues arising will be a matter for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 17 of the Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 provides for the appointment of members to the board of the agency.  Fourteen members of the board of Grangegorman Development Agency were appointed for a three-year term in 2006.  The members&rsquo; term of office expired on 18 October 2009.  One member resigned in March 2009 and had not been replaced.  The Act provides that the ordinary members of the agency shall consist of two persons nominated by the Minister for Health and Children, at least one of whom shall be an officer of the Health Service Executive, two persons nominated by the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology, one person nominated by the city manager of Dublin City Council, one person being a resident of the Grangegorman neighbourhood following an election process, and one elected public representative being a member of Dublin City Council and nominated by Dublin City Council.  The Act provides that the remaining members of the agency other than the chief executive are nominees of the Minister for Education and Science and that all members of the agency are appointed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Act also provides that the Minister shall designate one member of the agency as chairperson.</P>
        <P>In compliance with the Act, the Minister sought and has now received nominations from the Minister for Health and Children, the President of Dublin Institute of Technology and the Dublin city manager.  The agency has completed the local election process for the selection of a resident of the Grangegorman neighbourhood and has informed the Department of the nominee.  Dublin City Council has also provided the Minister with its nominee for the new board.  Having completed the nomination process, the Minister is pleased to inform this House that letters of appointment have issued to new board members.  I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the up-to-date position on the Grangegorman Development Agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue, which perhaps is unusual and one which, in the main, people do not feel is one that affects them.  However, for those whom it does affect it is a serious issue.  This is the matter of airport security and airline regulations in general having become much tighter since 2001 and the effect this is having on musicians and their ability to get from A to B with their instruments intact.</P>
        <P>I have been on quite a learning curve since I began investigating this on behalf of a group of European creative artists whom I met recently at a conference.  My sister is an air hostess and she told me of an experience she had in the past week where members of a band were allowed take their instruments to Edinburgh and when they phoned ahead to ask whether they could bring them to Belfast as hand luggage, they were told there would be no problem.  However, when they were departing there were told they could not do so and that they would have to put them in the hold at a cost of thousands of pounds.  Ultimately, when the instruments arrived at the destination one of them was broken.</P>
        <P>A number of issues arise.</P>
        <P>They pay for a seat for their instruments if their instruments are large.  If they are lucky, they get as far as security before being asked for a passport for their instruments because they have been assigned seats.  Not many 1609 Stradivarius cellos have passports, however, because the boxes which one can click only go back as far as 1900.  When they look for air miles or meals for the instruments&rsquo; seats, they cannot get them.  Julian Lloyd Webber was one of the more high profile people to be told when going through airport security, after finally booking a seat, that the spike at the bottom of his cello was a security risk.  It was taken from him.  The security officials also wanted to take the strings off the instrument.  Anybody who knows anything about instruments is aware that one cannot take the strings off a professional&rsquo;s instrument and expect him to put them back on and that everything will be hunky dory within a short space of time.  The instrument takes time to settle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given my background as a musician, I have a great interest in this issue.  There are significant inconsistencies in the security arrangements at different airports.  A traveller may be allowed <?oasys _dc28- ?>to keep his or her shoes and belt on in one airport only to be required to remove them at the next.<?oasys _dc0- ?>  This is a real problem for musicians who need to travel globally.  I have come across a number of people whose violin bows have been broken because security staff thought they were hollow.  Nobody asked how much the bow cost in the first place or who would pay for a replacement.</P>
        <P>In 2008, a Canadian singer, Dave Carroll, was travelling to Nebraska for a tour when his Taylor guitar was broken by United Airlines baggage handlers in Chicago.  He wrote a song about discovering that his $3,500 guitar was severely damaged, the video for which can be seen on YouTube.  The song is very entertaining if one does not own the instrument in question.  United Airlines has used the video as a training aid on how not to treat instruments.</P>
        <P>I would like the issue of musical instruments to be included in the review currently conducted on the liquids ban.  If the instruments are small, it should be permissible to take on board an instrument as well as a piece of hand luggage.  This is allowed at security checkpoints in America but each airline decides whether travellers can carry one or two pieces of hand luggage.  Obviously we want good security but in many cases, security staff are checking the instruments themselves and will not allow the musicians to intervene to show the instruments have not been adapted.  Staff are unprofessional at times, which is leading to the destruction of a lot of instruments.  The onus should be on the airport to have on hand fully qualified specialists who can deal with musicians&rsquo; inquiries and carry out security checks.  If such personnel are not <Col N="476"/>available, the musicians must be able to show security staff that their instruments are not dangerous weapons.</P>
        <P>A method similar to the existing facility for requesting special assistance should be put in place.  If one needs a wheelchair at the airport, one can tick a box.  Where we need an instrument to be dealt with safely, we should be able to tick a box under the special requirements heading.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The matter needs immediate attention because music is at the heart of our culture.  If our talent cannot travel the world to entertain audiences in the confidence that their instruments will be transported safely with them, how can we share our culture?  It is not an Irish problem; it is worldwide.  Significant efforts are under way in America aimed at ensuring that the instruments of professional musicians and composers are transported safely from one country to another.  I ask the Minister of State to raise this issue at EU level in order to facilitate a co-ordinated worldwide approach on the issue.  I am sure anybody who travels extensively would appreciate any attempt to achieve unity and commonsense.  Nobody wants to be a victim of terrorism or to have something planted in a piece of luggage in the expectation it will not receive special attention.  However, we should not expect a valuable instrument to be ruined simply because somebody is not trained to deal with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Aviation security at EU airports is governed by EU Regulations (EC) Nos. 2320/2002, 300/2008 and 820/2008.  These regulations established common Community rules in the field of civil aviation security and have been in force since January 2003.  The regulations, with a series of supplementary implementing regulations, have been adopted into our national civil aviation security programme.</P>
        <P>All Irish airports with commercial flights are required to comply with the requirements of the regulations and the national civil aviation security programme.  These requirements include measures for the screening of passengers, cabin and hold baggage.  The regulations stipulate that all passengers and their cabin baggage shall be screened in order to prevent prohibited articles from being introduced into security restricted areas and on board aircraft.  Similarly, all hold baggage and cargo is required to be screened prior to being loaded onto an aircraft.</P>
        <P>The operation of aviation security at Irish airports is subject to monitoring by the Department of Transport&rsquo;s aviation services and security division to ensure that airports meet the requirements laid down in EU regulations.  However, the management of security practices and procedures at Irish airports is a day-to-day operational matter for the relevant airport authority.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport did not have the benefit of Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s contribution when he prepared his reply.  The Senator has raised an interesting issue and I will convey her views to the Minister.  I hope, however, that I have adequately explained the legalities of the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted the Minister of State was on the ball enough to realise he did not answer my question at all.  I ask that the Minister be made aware of the seriousness of the issue because I am disappointed by the blandness of the answer.  I hope for a more convincing response that makes us feel we are loved as musicians and that our instruments will also be loved.  In the meantime, I suggest that the Minister of State and the Cathaoirleach watch the aforementioned YouTube video.  The way some airlines deal with musical instruments is quite shocking.</P>
