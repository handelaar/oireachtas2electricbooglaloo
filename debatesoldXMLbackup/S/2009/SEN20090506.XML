	<P>I have received notice from Senator Phil Prendergast that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide funding for the Befriending Service for mental health in south Tipperary.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the campaign, if any, that exists pre the summer holidays to warn people about the dangers of melanoma from sun exposure or sun bed use.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the situation under which final year pharmacy students are being prevented from taking up necessary pre-registration pharmacy places by the moratorium on recruitment of public sector staff.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the educational thinking and approach he recommends so that two teachers can effectively teach English to 154 foreign national children in Scoil Mhuire, Oranmore, County Galway, and if he will reverse his decision to withdraw two EAL teachers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Prendergast, Keaveney and Norris and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Healy Eames may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, referral to joint committee of motion re Bord Bia, to be taken without debate on the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to adjourn not later than 5 p.m., if not pre<Col N="230"/>viously concluded, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, and Senators may share time; No. 3, statements on the swine flu epidemic to be taken at 5 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, and Senators may share time; and No. 29, Private Members&rsquo; business, motion 36 &mdash; efforts to prevent energy shortage in future years, to be taken at 6 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that the major concern for families is the appalling job losses which are affecting almost every family in the State.  However, there are other issues of concern with regard to children and I wish to raise three of those issues.  I wish to table an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Health and Children should come to the House today to discuss these issues which are of huge concern to families.  The first issue is the situation regarding international adoptions; the second issue is the suspension of the investigation by the Ombudsman for Children because, despite having the powers to do so, she is not getting co-operation from the HSE on the investigation into child abuse in the Catholic church Dublin diocese, and third, the absolute confusion surrounding the introduction of the Government&rsquo;s plans to provide child care places for three year olds.</P>
        <P>I will deal with these issues individually.  The Government appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for children and there is a National Children&rsquo;s Office, yet there are three areas in regard to children which are mired in confusion as far as the person in the street is concerned who is worried about these issues.  Why is this the case and what is happening?</P>
        <P>I will deal first with the international adoption situation.  As every Senator knows, there is great concern about the bilateral agreement with Vietnam, which expired on 1 May 2009.  We have had no clarity from the Minister of State with responsibility for children on this.  Families are deeply concerned about it.  I quote from one e-mail I received:</P>
        <P LI="1">We write to you to express our utter disappointment and heartache following the closure of Vietnamese adoptions from 1 May. [This also applies to the lack of a bilateral agreement with the Russian Federation]  Our lives have been on hold for the past five years on waiting lists for assessment by the HSE, then waiting for social workers, and now, when our waiting was almost over, we are left in limbo because this was not sorted out in time.  Why did the Minister let this go to the wire?  Why was the bilateral agreement not concluded before the last one expired?</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a very serious question and I want the Minister of State in here to explain to the hundreds of families affected by this what he will do and the problems and barriers to concluding this agreement.</P>
        <P>I quote from another person:</P>
        <P LI="1">This means that at least 1,000 children will, at best, spend longer in institutions and may be condemned to a lifetime in institutional care.  No matter how good it may be, institutional care is not a substitute for a loving family life.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That is the first issue which, as I said, is mired in confusion.  The second is the Ombudsman for Children suspending a serious investigation into the handling of child abuse cases by the Roman Catholic Church dioceses and the lack of information she appears to be receiving.  The Department of Health and Children has co-operated with her but the Health Service Executive, HSE, has not given her information on this.  Whom is the HSE trying to satisfy?  Why is this information not being given to the ombudsman who says she has the power to get this information?</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This is disgraceful, if we are putting children&rsquo;s rights at the centre of our agenda.  My final point is on the child care places.  Child care providers do not know how many places will be available, are not happy about the costings that have been done and feel they will not be able to run their centres with the costings the Department has put out.  These are three very serious issues about children and there is much confusion on each of them.  I ask that the Minister of State come to the House to address those issues which are at the top of the agenda for many families in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  I regret that the Leader on his own, without any contact or agreement with me or anyone else, changed Private Members&rsquo; time.  As he has made some time available to discuss an issue with the Minister for Health and Children, I suggest that time would be better spent discussing the row between the Ombudsman for Children and the HSE rather than swine vesicular disease, which the Government is handling very well.  That is my amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I especially want to do it because Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s point is correct.  There is a lack of information.  Subject to being corrected, it is my belief that the problem is that the HSE has documentation it got half-filled by the Roman Catholic Church which refused to give the full information in the Ferns and Dublin investigations.  This is the documentation solicitors and lawyers for the Roman Catholic Church are saying may not be made available to the ombudsman.  To the public eye the ombudsman and the HSE are involved in a row.  I would like to get it all out in the open.  There is an opportunity for the Minister to deal with that now and for us to be topical and useful in dealing with that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time when politics is at a very low ebb, when there was never so little trust or confidence in the political system, I express my admiration for all those people for putting their names before the electorate and standing out there and standing for something.  In welcoming Mr. George Lee for crossing over to our side, I wish to correct some of the wonder about it.  Whereas I admire and recognise that anyone might give up career prospects and salaries to come into Leinster House, both Houses are full of people &mdash; every lawyer, solicitor, barrister, doctor and many business people &mdash; who have put their careers on hold to come here.  That should be recognised.  What George Lee has done is perfectly admirable, but many people in both Houses have done exactly the same over the years.  That might come as a surprise to cynical commentators and callers to talk shows, but it is the reality.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="232"/>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Fitzgerald, we all have had hundreds of e-mails from families with regard to the bilateral agreements with Vietnam and Russia on adoption.  Hundreds of families are in limbo because of incompetence and inaction on the part of the Government.  I join Senator Fitzgerald in asking for the Minister to be invited to the House for a debate.  It is important that we take action on this as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I give a guarded welcome to the decision by the main retailer in the State, Tesco, to reduce the price of goods by an average of just over 20% in many of its stores south of the Border.  This is welcome news for shoppers and it is not before time.  However, before anybody goes away thinking this company is the champion of consumers, let us be clear that this is an attempt by Tesco to stem losses by encouraging people north of the Border where it has no shops to shop in its stores in the South.  It is very clear that the company is trying to move the shopping border 20 miles south, to places such as Drogheda, Bailieborough and Monaghan.  As a shopper in one of these stores, I welcome this.  I welcome the jobs that will remain in the country as a result and the lower prices, which is good news for local people, but let us be clear that this is primarily a business exercise.  Unless and until this company extends these price cuts throughout Ireland, we will see this move for what it is.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of the rip-off being imposed on its passengers by the Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s decision to charge passengers &euro;1 for the use of a small plastic bag.  This is just another example of how the authority continues to treat its customers with little more than contempt.  There is a differential between the prices one pays at the airport, whether on car parking charges, airport food or bottled water, and that will not encourage tourists who are leaving the country to tell their fellow country people to come here.  It will leave a bad taste in their mouths.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter because I see no additional passenger security from many European measures such as that relating to small plastic bags.  This is another revenue-generating exercise, masquerading as an attempt to improve passenger security.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Members of this House who are running for election to other places, particularly my colleague, Senator Bacik.  I believe she will do very well, as will other people.  As the Australians and New Zealanders said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the decision by pension investment managers to invest a &euro;7 billion fund in Government infrastructure.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister <Col N="233"/>for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House to discuss this issue, which will give a great boost to the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This follows on proposals I put forward in this Chamber for a &euro;10 billion international reconstruction fund which would be linked to pension schemes.  There is money in the economy and people want to invest their money but they want security.  This is a vehicle for achieving this.  I welcome the fact that we will be investing our pension money in guaranteed schemes such as roads, schools, hospital projects, Luas and metro north.  Those projects will kick-start the economy again.</P>

We have practically the best tax code in Europe as far as the Americans are concerned and we have attracted business and will continue to do so.  We do not want more knockers.

	<P>Now that George Lee has gone, no doubt the public finances will be all correct in the morning.  There is nothing wrong with the economy and everything is fine now that George Lee has left RTE.  George Lee reports on the mess Fianna F&aacute;il has made of the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>All I am saying in the light of Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments is that if these charges are to be made in this House, we do not really need to be lifting the duvet, as it were, in terms of looking at the connections between people in Fianna F&aacute;il and RTE or many news and media outlets.  Let us stay away from that because I assure Senator Leyden that Fianna F&aacute;il will come out of it the wrong end completely.</P>

	<P>Was that George Lee or George Glee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call on the Leader to reply to the Order of Business and take no one else if that is going to be the decision.  I am giving Members an opportunity to put questions to the Leader and I do not want to hear anything to do with elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully agree with the Cathaoirleach and I will only use this side of the House to defend individuals against whom wild charges have been made.</P>
        <P>On the wider issues we should be discussing, I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal on what is happening with children&rsquo;s services and how the Ombudsman for Children has been abused, to say the least, by the Health Service Executive.  I have often said this House was being discredited because we were not getting satisfactory answers from the Government.  That was tainting the perception the people have of all Members of this House.  When we have asked questions of the HSE about the investigation by the Garda into Leas Cross, we have got no answers.  When questions have been asked about what the Minister of State with responsibility for children has done with the report on the Dublin diocese or Ferns or any other report, bluff and bluster is all we have got until the answers have come out in the media.  That is not the manner in which this House is supposed to be treated.  If questions are asked about adoptions or about reports on the abuse of children in State institutions, we are supposed to get fully informed answers quickly from the relevant State bodies and not bluff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Fitzgerald for some progress to be made on the dispute that has arisen between the Ombudsman for Children and the HSE.  I am not going to take sides in this because I do not know the facts.  I hope there is not an element of grandstanding going on.  Equally, however, I was not impressed by the suggestion, which was stated by the Ombudsman for Children, that the HSE wanted legal representation.  We have all seen the cost of that.  This is an issue that should be resolved between two State agencies.  It reflects badly on both of them that the dispute should continue.</P>
        <P>I also wish to refer to the comments on adoption issues.  We have all been bombarded by e-mails in this regard.  One person kindly sent me an e-mail, which obviously was circulated to many others, asking me to join in ensuring we bombard Members of the Oireachtas to see if a head of steam could be created over this particular issue.  I am surprised at some of the comments made here because if anybody checks with the Minister and his Department, they will find there are serious issues which must be addressed in those bilateral talks.  Until they are resolved progress will obviously not be made, but it is a serious issue for the people concerned.  Having spoken directly to the Minister, I know he is taking a hands-on approach to it.</P>

        <P>I support the comments by Senator Leyden on the &euro;6 billion being made available by Irish pension funds for investment in infrastructure.  Hopefully, that will yield job creation.  That is the kind of thing we want to see happening.</P>
        <P>I regret the recent comments on, and the lack of progress among, the social partners.  Social partnership held us in good stead in difficult times in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Social partnership &mdash; I am excluding nobody from it &mdash; contributed to the extent of the challenges we are now facing.  We should have sought a package of &euro;1 billion for investment in job retention and creation.  I suggest that money could be obtained by suspending for three years the benchmarking process that applies across the public service, which they negotiated and for which they were responsible.  That would yield the bones of &euro;6 billion over three years for investment in the economy.  I hope that suggestion will be taken up by the social partners.</P>

	<P>While I wish all my colleagues well, I cannot join in the orgy of congratulation.  I have always deprecated the practice of using the Seanad as a diving board into the D&aacute;il and I continue to do so.  However, I strongly welcome the intervention of Mr. George Lee, a man of the highest integrity.  It is guaranteed to strengthen the gene pool in the other House, which seems to be made up principally of widows, orphans, eldest sons and local sporting heroes.

Attempts were made to smear the Shell to Sea people, which I think were completely disgraceful.  There were attempts to link them, quite incorrectly, with dissident republican violence.  In fact, violence was used against Willie Corduff who has been supported by groups like Afri and others.</P>

        <P Just="Left">With regard to the HSE and the Ombudsman for Children, I find it extraordinary.  I listened to Mr. Kane and it sounded like &ldquo;The Caine Mutiny&rdquo;.  Apparently, he would not talk and then <Col N="237"/>he wanted it done with lawyers.  This delay and waste is symptomatic of the HSE.  He is supposed to be protecting children, but actually seems to be protecting, first, the HSE and, second, the Church.  I do not think that is the duty of the HSE, so it must be cleared up.</P>
        <P>I join with other colleagues, including with Senator Fitzgerald, in expressing concern about the bilateral adoption agreement with Vietnam.  All of us who spoke on that debate expressed great concern about the possibility that this deadline would be missed and now it has been.  We have a good, intelligent and decent Minister of State.  I do not know how the current position came about and I will not blackguard the Minister of State who is a decent man but the position is not acceptable.  Yesterday, I received 60 e-mails on this matter, which is indicative of the level of public concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the issue of adoptions from Russia and Vietnam.  In particular, I am cognisant that the difficulty that has arisen could be ameliorated through serious bilateral negotiations, notwithstanding the fact that all organisations, including the Health Service Executive, have limitations.  Whereas normal criteria are applied prior to adoption, I understand post-placement requests have become extremely vigorous.  If a little understanding were shown, it could help the HSE and put the matter in context.</P>
        <P>I welcome Tesco&rsquo;s decision to reduce prices of products sold in its stores.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the retail trade.  If the decision by Tesco results in a reduction in the unjustifiable prices paid in the South compared to the North, it will benefit all consumers.  In addition, if the supermarkets were to enter a trade war, it would benefit consumers in this State and should be welcomed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Fitzgerald and second the amendment proposed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  As colleagues have noted, the number of messages and e-mails Senators have received in recent days indicates that major problems have arisen on the issue of adoption.  These problems must be urgently addressed as it is unfair to leave large numbers of parents in the lurch and suffering from despair and anguish as a result of the current circumstances.  The Leader will, I am sure, accept the urgent need for the Minister to come before the House to clarify the position and answer the many questions Senators have on the issue.</P>
        <P>I refer to the unfortunate and tragic accident which occurred on Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l some days ago when a visitor lost his life as a result of a fall.  The island belongs to the State and is in the care of the heritage section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  However, the guide service on the island is run by the Office of Public Works.  The Department and Office of Public Works must liaise better on this issue and, failing that, responsibility should be transferred in full to one or other body.</P>
        <P>Similar circumstances pertain regarding other national monuments, with the Office of Public Works having one role and the wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government having another.  Guides are not yet operating on Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l.  Given the paramount importance of safety and the steep incline of the island, I repeat the call made by Councillor Michael Cahill in County Kerry that, at a minimum, a rope bannister or other type of rail should be erected on the island.  We should not put lives at risk, as is clearly being done at present.  I ask the Leader to use his good offices to have the matter addressed.  I also intend to pursue it with both relevant Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s call for a debate on the retail trade.  The Tesco store in Sligo was among the outlets which changed its pricing structure to reflect the prices available in the North.  I spoke to people last night who visit the North once or twice per month to shop and now indicate they will shop south of the Border.  I welcome Tesco&rsquo;s <Col N="238"/>decision.  I heard a spokesperson for the company state on a radio programme yesterday that it plans to extend its new model.  We, in the Republic, especially those in the retail trade, will benefit greatly from the new pricing structure in the long run.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I also support calls by several Senators from all sides for a debate on the impasse which has arisen between the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, and the Health Service Executive.  I listened to both sides this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and could not get a sense that the HSE was complying in the way it should have been.  I felt the Ombudsman was correct in being annoyed with what was going on.  As Senator Walsh said, it is ridiculous that every time an issue arises the HSE would expect to have legal representation on both sides.  I say this with respect to the legal people in this House, but everybody knows that where one has legal people present very little will be said and very little can be achieved, particularly when one has an impasse such as this.  I ask the Leader, if we are not to have a debate on this matter over the next day or so, to make representations to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, and ask him to intervene in the dispute.  On other occasions when we have debated other issues such as child abuse in the House the layperson liked to see the issue resolved.</P>

	<P>Well said.  Hear, hear.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to ensure this Government gets its priorities right and the treatment of children should be uppermost in our priorities.  I support others who have called for those debates today.  It is essential.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a response to a question I have raised many times in this House regarding the Climate Protection Bill.  It is another matter which should be a priority for the Government.  We are entering very important international talks on climate change in Copenhagen this December, yet we still have no legislation to ensure binding commitments to meeting targets on carbon emission reductions is in place.  I put this issue forward in a Bill which came before this House in October 2007.  At that time I was promised more Government time.  I am sorry the Deputy Leader is not here because it was he who promised that to me on the record.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader for more time for the Climate Protection Bill and a guarantee we will debate it between now and when we send our negotiating team to Copenhagen in December.  It is essential we put legislation in place and I am backed by Friends of the Earth and a range of other NGOs in the Stop Climate Chaos campaign who will be lobbying all of us in this House to ensure we have binding legislation in place.  I ask the Leader for an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like my colleagues, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to come in and explain the difficulties faced by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, which led to her suspending her investigation into the HSE&rsquo;s handling of the child protection audit of Catholic church dioceses.  The HSE should be absolutely transparent as a public body and should be forced to co-operate fully with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation.</P>
        <P>I tremble when I think of the words of Archbishop Martin a few months ago when he said over the summer we would hear of thousands of cases of abuse of children in the diocese of Dublin.  I dread the thought of what is coming.  As I have said many times in this House, the 1916 Proclamation, which was read in Arbour Hill recently, has the sentiment that we cherish all the children of our State equally and I am afraid we are not doing that.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, was here to discuss the Adoption Bill he was exemplary in his understanding and comprehension of the legislation.  I remember my colleagues on the other side of the House praised him for his dedication and understanding.  It is critical we get to grips with the situation regarding adoptions in Russia and Vietnam.  When I spoke on the Bill I said we must have compassion for the parents who are waiting to adopt children and for the children who are aching to be brought into a loving family.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also raised the issue of child care.  The new scheme of universal access to preschool education for children aged between three years and three months and four and a half years is revolutionary.  It is precisely what I have been urging since I issued my proposals on a new approach to child care.  The detail will be worked out in the coming months.  If the <i>per capita</i> allocation of &euro;64.50 per week is inadequate, there is no reason the Government cannot increase it to &euro;75.  However, individual cr&egrave;ches should not be allowed to charge additional fees.  That will only lead to a situation where some facilities become exclusive because they are unaffordable for many.  Every child must have equal status in every community and private cr&egrave;che.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased there is support on both sides of the House for an urgent clarification by the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, on the adoption crisis currently being experienced by families in this State.  As an adoptive parent, I know what it is like to go through the process of adopting a child.  As we speak, the applications of 24 Irish couples are delayed in Hanoi because the Minister of State has dropped the ball.</P>
        <P>In the first week of March, we debated the provisions of the Adoption Bill 2009 in this House.  Senator Fitzgerald and I told the Minister of State it was critical that the bilateral agreement should be in place by 1 May.  His failure to act is hurting families, including the 250 couples who are ready to submit their applications to the Vietnamese authorities.  The Minister of State has also dropped the ball in regard to Russia.  Irish couples successfully adopted 484 babies from Vietnam and Russia last year, accounting for 84% of inter-country adoptions.  I implore Members on the other side of the House to come together us on this issue.  I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, be invited to the Chamber this afternoon to <Col N="240"/>update us on the situation.  I cannot answer all the e-mails I am receiving from people asking questions about it.</P>
        <P>I raise the next issue only after careful consideration.  As I participate in the canvass for the forthcoming elections, I am encountering great hatred and anger at foreign nationals, which seems to have become far more acute as the downturn deepens.  This hostility is emerging in the context of two issues in particular, namely, social welfare and its cost to the State and, above all, education and the effect of the withdrawal of teachers providing English language support.  In one school in Oranmore, for example, two teachers will have to provide English language support to 154 foreign national children.  That is an impossible task.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As an educator, it is impossible for such a system to work effectively.  The quality of education for both foreign national children and Irish children will be compromised.  It is absolutely imperative that the Minister of State with responsibility for integration policy, Deputy John Curran, be invited to the Chamber to debate this issue.  He must work with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Education and Science to address this reality.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I note the proposed amendments to the Order of Business.  I agree we should have a debate on issues relating to the Health Service Executive.  I heard the rather bizarre exchange &mdash; it was not so much an exchange as a series of interviews &mdash; concerning the dispute between the HSE and the Ombudsman for Children.  I do not understand what is at issue here.  However, if we are to have a debate, it should focus on more substantial issues than this argument and the fact that lawyers may be involved.  There is an all too frequent recourse to criticism of lawyers.  Sometimes lawyers are necessary, tragically.  We should ask if the HSE could say it was conducting an audit when circulating a questionnaire containing a section which could not be filled in.  That is the substantive question which we should be asking.  I certainly support the call for a debate on this subject.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn&rsquo;s motion on energy is timely and reasonable.  I cannot see why the Government brought forward an amending motion.  Could we not come to a new bipartisanship in discussions about such important matters, particularly at a time like this?</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Bacik, referred to the fact that Pope Benedict XVl was criticised in the <i>Lancet</i>  for his views on AIDS prevention and condoms.  It is worth noting that a leading expert, Edward C. Green, director of the AIDS prevention research project at the Harvard <Col N="241"/>centre for population and development says, &ldquo;the best evidence we have supports the Pope&rsquo;s comment&rdquo;.  Dr. Green is, by the way, a supporter of condom use.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join the many speakers who, in recent weeks, have called for a debate on banking and financial institutions.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate with specific emphasis on how financial institutions deal with people who fall into arrears in mortgage and hire purchase payments.</P>
        <P>I am aware of a case, the details of which I will give to the Leader after the Order of Business, of a young man, married with four children ranging in ages from 12 years to two months, who purchased a lorry.  The young man was encouraged by a financial institution to take out a loan.  He was, in fact, followed around by a representative of the institution and the documents signed in the car park of a local pub.  He took a loan of &euro;120,000 to purchase a lorry which facilitated his job delivering materials to building sites throughout County Cavan.  Through no fault of his own and due to the downturn in the building industry he was laid off at the end of last September.  He contacted the financial institution concerned and informed them of his predicament.  He missed three repayments on the loan but by the end of December had repaid &euro;67,000.  Having missed three payments and on the eve of the fourth payment being due, three thugs arrived at his house, harassed his elderly father and his wife and children and took the lorry.  They stole the lorry from the house.</P>

Such a debate would be valuable and worth holding.</P>
        <P>There have been calls today from all sides of the House for a debate on the issue of the impasse between the HSE and the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, and the resulting fall-out.  Clearly, there is a frustration on her part and the matter requires immediate debate.  I urge the Leader to consider the amendment that was put forward in that regard.  The matter is very urgent.  We are guardians of the Constitution and we should examine how best to ensure equality for all and to protect the children of the nation.  An immediate debate is required to help push the issue along.  If the Leader considered fitting in a Bill at some stage, it would be helpful.</P>

	<P>I also support the call of Senator Wilson for some financial control.  We have invested billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money in the banking system.  I do not wish to be crude about it, but we have effectively been given the two fingers by these people, who rode off into the sunset with our money.  We have bought little or no influence in day-to-day banking policy.  That is simply one example of the carry-on that the people have had to put up with in recent months.  Businesses cannot get overdrafts and people who are on punitive fixed-term rates cannot change over to variable rates.  It is simply a disgrace.  Last week, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, refused to even contemplate a discussion with the banks which might allow those on fixed-term rates to switch to variable rates.</P>
        <P>I refer to two issues raised by my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald.  This morning, I was appalled that the Ombudsmen for Children had to literally throw her hands in the air in utter frustration at not being allowed to do her job properly.  I believed we had left behind the time when such concealment of vital information was commonplace.  I believed we had arrived at a time when, as Senator Bacik remarked, the protection of our children was our utmost priority.  I commend the Ombudsman for Children for refusing to get involved in legal shenanigans between her office and the HSE, which would, as she said, cost up to &euro;4,000 per day.  She is entitled to that information from another arm of the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the matter of adoption.  I have much respect, as does Senator Norris, for the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  He has brought fresh thinking and enthusiasm to that Ministry.  However, the energy and effort invested in the attempt to get the agreement with Vietnam re-established took place far too late.  It began in earnest in March and the Minister of State should have made it a priority.  He should have gone to Vietnam to establish what the issues were and how they could be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the call of Senator Wilson for a debate on a very important issue.  I reiterate my call of last week for an urgent debate on the issue of unauthorised and illegal money lending, but also on some legal forms of money lending.  There are reputable UK plcs, calling door-to-door in this country, which are not using the normal underwriting criteria.  They are offering people, who are at their most desperate, money with interest rates in excess of 150% APR.  It is a disgrace.  We need to legislate on it very quickly, especially given people&rsquo;s urgent needs in these difficult days.</P>
        <P>Second, I am concerned about illegal moneylending, which came to my attention in a recent discussion with some members of the Garda.  I also mentioned it last week.  Elements from the criminal world are lending money to people, again when they are at their most desperate, and then heavy-handedly seeking repayment, threatening effectively to kill people or to perpetrate a variety of other crimes.  We are not providing adequate protection for people.  It should be enough to have a superintendent&rsquo;s testimony that a person is engaged in illegal moneylending and threatening behaviour of this nature.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should introduce legislation to deal with that as a matter of urgency.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could arrange those debates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join my colleagues throughout the party in arguing that we urgently need a debate on children.  I refer to the two points that my colleague Senator Fitzgerald made on child care.  We can discuss the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the <Col N="244"/>Catholic church, but ultimately it is the children who suffer and are the victims.  As Senator Mary White said, it is obvious what is going to come out.  I, too, shudder to think of that, but there is no point in hurling on the ditch and leaving it to fester for longer.  We need to deal with it as soon as possible.  It is wrong for the HSE to try to hide behind a legal curtain.  I ask the Leader to intervene and get the Minister for Health and Children to instruct her Department to get on with it.  She is well able to do that.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments on the bilateral agreement.  I agree with Senator Norris about the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews.  He is a good, caring Minister of State but why in God&rsquo;s name did he only start negotiations in earnest on 25 March?  Why did he not go to Vietnam, as Senator Cannon said?  We need to put ourselves in the position of the families who, after five years of negotiation, are going to get their packs, information and deposits back from Vietnam and such places.  That will be heartbreaking and soul destroying for people, not to mention the effect it will have on the extended families.  Given that 1,000 families are waiting in this situation, it is incumbent on us to sort it out as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Twomey, Walsh, Norris, Hanafin, Coghlan, Feeney, Bacik, Mary White, Healy Eames, Wilson, Regan, McDonald, Cannon and McFadden expressed serious concerns about proposed legislation and difficulties with issues regarding children.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister of State will be in the House next Wednesday with the Adoption Bill 2009.  No doubt Senators will be pleased to hear that.  Given the challenges facing the Department and the Minister of State in this area, no doubt colleagues will be able to give them the benefit of their invaluable experience.  On the HSE, the Minister for Health and Children will be in the House this evening.

The Bills that we will discuss today and tomorrow were urgently requested and required.  The Companies Bill 2009 is a huge and important Bill.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is in the House today, as was requested of me many times in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>In regard to what was brought to our attention today about the provision of child care places, Senator Mary White correctly pointed out the Government&rsquo;s position.  I congratulate her on championing the cause in this area.  I thank all the Senators who brought the matter to the attention of the House.</P>

        <P>Senator Leyden requested that the Minister for Finance be invited to the House to discuss the issue of the major investment proposal linked to pension funds.  The people can assist the country in its hour of need in the funding of major projects.  Many colleagues on all sides of the House would wish to make a contribution in this respect.</P>

	<P>Senators Wilson, McDonald and Cannon raised the serious issue concerning people who have been suddenly unemployed who cannot sleep at night because they are worried they will not be able to meet their repayment commitments.  Senator Wilson outlined to the House the case of an unfortunate man who purchased a truck for &euro;120,000, had repaid more than 50% of the cost of it and then three heavyweights came out to his ageing father to take away the truck.  No one is doing this in the name of us as legislators.  I will be in contact with Friends First immediately after the Order of Business.  The Government Whip in this House seldom brings to attention the affairs of this House.  An eminent economist represents this particular financial institution and he is also very well linked to a political party.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to this financial institution.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry called for a debate on moneylending and highlighted that moneylenders are demanding from people who have been made unemployed and who cannot make their repayments up to 150% APR.  This is a serious issue.  When we have a financial debate in this House we should seek unanimity in support of a proposal to park for up to 12 months the repayment of debts by people who have a good payment record but cannot make their repayments.  I refer to those who are not fly by night people and who have been making their repayments with banking institutions for five, ten and up to 20 years.  We have had 12 or 14 magnificent years of growth and deferring such repayment for one year would not, as the one-liner goes, break the bank.  It is time we as legislators started to act by making such a proposal.  I thank Senator Wilson for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  We hear of such cases in our clinics.  Senator Wilson represents an area that neighbours my area.  Heavy-handed tactics have started to be enforced on people who, up to now, have had a good record in making their repayments.  Some of these people have been captains of small and medium-sized industries across the country.  I will give this matter my urgent attention and will invite the Minister to the House to deal with it as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>I thank the Members of this House for facilitating the early discussion of this legislation.  I am very pleased to bring the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 to the House.  Irish company law is a significant part of the infrastructure underpinning the development of Irish business.  It provides the framework that governs how Irish companies conduct their business, communicate with shareholders and other investors and deal with creditors.  To remain fit for purpose, company law has to be, and has been, updated and refined regularly since 1963 in response to dynamic changes in the Irish and international corporate environment.  The Bill being introduced in this House today is the latest proposed revision of the sophisticated and interrelated suite of Acts and regulations that make up the Irish companies code.  Arising from recent experiences in the enforcement of company law in the banking sector in particular, I consider it necessary to introduce a small number of important changes to company law.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, a wide-ranging analysis of current company law is well advanced and it is my intention to publish very significant legislation containing 1,250 sections next year.  In the meantime the intention of this short Bill is to provide in primary legislation a framework to support the Director of Corporate Enforcement in his efforts to enforce compliance with company law by ensuring he has the range of powers required to support him in this task.  It will improve the transparency of loans made by companies that are licensed banks to their directors and to persons connected with them.  It will amend certain existing provisions relating to Irish registered non-resident companies to meet European Commission concerns.</P><Col N="249"/>
        <P>On my initiative, extensive consultations took place with the Director of Corporate Enforcement in drawing up the amendments contained in this Bill.  His experience of the operation of company law on the ground and of the issues that arise when carrying out investigations of possible breaches of these laws are a source of vital and practical feedback.  Recent experience has shown that compliance with company law could be enforced more effectively if a number of targeted amendments were made to existing company law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will explain each of the amendments proposed in the Bill in greater detail later but, in summary, the Bill will improve overall enforcement of compliance with company law by,<i> inter alia</i>, providing for the ODCE&rsquo;s right of access to certain company and third party records and allowing for extensions to search warrants granted to the office.  It will introduce a mechanism, together with appropriate safeguards, for an extended power of seizure so that large volumes of paper or electronic information that may contain relevant material can be removed for later examination.  It will lighten the evidential burden on the Director of Corporate Enforcement when taking action against companies in default of existing provisions regarding loans to their directors and will amend existing requirements relating to the disclosure of loans to directors in the annual accounts of licensed banks.</P>
        <P>One of the issues the Bill addresses relates to the large amount of documents and computer records seized by garda&iacute; as part of the ODCE&rsquo;s investigation into Anglo Irish Bank on the bank&rsquo;s premises.  This issue has general application and could be relevant to any large investigation.  Before examining the seized material, its legal professional privilege status must be determined.  To this end, on 13 March last, the ODCE applied to the High Court for its approval of a mechanism agreed by the parties whereby such privilege could be decided.</P>
        <P>While the High Court judge stated that the method of resolving difficulties in the manner outlined to the court was &ldquo;eminently sensible&rdquo;, he did not believe that section 23 of the Act as it stands provided the court with a statutory authority to outsource a function currently reserved to it.  The judge therefore could not approve the proposed procedure.  As I will be explaining shortly, section 6 will give legislative underpinning to an appropriate mechanism similar to the one proposed to the High Court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ODCE reports that the Anglo Irish Bank investigation is the largest and most complex investigation it has undertaken since the office was established in late 2001.  According to the director, a substantial amount of further work needs to be done to complete the examination which he proposes to conclude by the end of this year.  While company law governs the disclosure of directors&rsquo; loans in the annual accounts and elsewhere, it does not extend to regulating bank lending and other banking activities.  This task falls to the Financial Regulator which is also empowered under the Central Bank Acts to make rules to change conditions attaching to bank licences.  The Financial Regulator is proposing to amend its rules on disclosure of loans by banks to their directors and connected persons &mdash; areas that are also covered by the Companies Acts.  My proposed changes to the Companies Acts take account of the rule-changing powers of the Financial Regulator but do not seek to duplicate its role in determining how best to oversee prudential supervision of the banks.</P>
        <P>I turn now to the provisions of the Bill and explain what each is designed to achieve.  Section 2 affects the generality of companies and not simply the small number of companies that hold banking licences issued by the Financial Regulator.  Subject to certain restrictions, existing company law allows a director legitimately to have a private interest in contracts or proposed contracts with his or her company.  However, a director must declare any such interests to his or her fellow board members.  Failure to do so could make him or her liable to a fine and to have to account to the company for any profits gained.</P><Col N="250"/>
        <P>The company is obliged to keep a record of directors&rsquo; declarations of interests in a book that is kept for this purpose.  The amendment being proposed in section 2 will give the Director of Corporate Enforcement a specific right of access to this book.  It will also provide a sanction in any case where a company fails to allow the Director of Corporate Enforcement to access this information.  This will assist in enforcing compliance with the Companies Act provisions.</P>
        <P>Sections 3 and 4 are linked and deal with the powers of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to require the production of records from a third party where these records relate to a company under investigation.  This power is vital to the Director of Corporate Enforcement when he is investigating companies whose books are incomplete for whatever reason.  The third party might typically be a director, auditor or employee of the company being investigated.  However, it may be the case that other individuals possess the relevant documentation and, if so, this provision could be relevant to them.  The right of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to access third party records has already been provided through section 19(3) of the Companies Act 1990 and the director has informed me he has already used it successfully in a number of cases.  However, he has requested that the provision be reworded to provide greater clarity and to avoid doubt in the future about what records can be sought from third parties.</P>
        <P>With regard to the avoidance of doubt, the Bill stipulates that the clarification being introduced here will not invalidate any previous requests for access to third party records.  This would be important for the continuity of any ongoing investigations that relied on material discovered through the use of the existing powers.</P>
        <P>Section 5  is another provision with general application.  It deals with the entry and search of premises by the director or authorised officers of the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement on foot of a search warrant issued by a judge of the District Court.  At present, the Companies Act 1990 provides a limit of one month on the lifetime of such warrants.  Although this can be sufficient in some investigations, it may not allow sufficient time to conduct large and complex searches, or where substantial amounts of information are contained in electronic format.  The amendments in the Bill provide for situations where an extension of the period of a search warrant can be sought from and granted by the court.  This will allow the court to take account of the grounds given for seeking an extension and to use its discretion in deciding whether to allow the extension.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for the removal of paper and electronic information from premises being searched, for subsequent examination elsewhere, to determine their relevance to the matters under investigation.  This is referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;extended power of seizure&rdquo;.  Appropriate detailed safeguards are also provided in the Bill to ensure that this extended power is used only when appropriate.  For example, the Bill stipulates the issues that should be taken into account by the director in deciding whether it is reasonably practicable to determine the relevance of something on the company&rsquo;s premises.  It also provides for the arrangements he must put in place before the extended powers of seizure can be used.  These include the maintenance of confidentiality of seized information and granting the owner reasonable access to it.  The Bill also provides for arrangements to be adopted in cases where the director believes it necessary to avoid possible concealment, falsification, destruction or disposal of relevant material.  It requires the director to deal as expeditiously as possible with the material seized and to return any material that proves not to be relevant to the owner as soon as possible.  In drafting the Bill, every effort was made to provide for all situations that might arise during the course of an extended search.  However, should any new or unforeseen issue arise, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is being empowered to make appropriate regulations.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>Section 6<i> </i>makes a number of amendments to section 23 of the Companies Act 1990 which protects a person from having to disclose certain information under Part II of the Companies Act 1990.  The explanatory memorandum inadvertently referred to this as Part III.  The protected information in question in Part II is that which, in the opinion of the court, the person would be entitled to refuse to disclose on grounds of legal professional privilege.</P>
        <P>Although the 1990 Act allowed for a blanket prohibition on the seizure of such material, the Director of Corporate Enforcement reports that there are sometimes difficulties in deciding during a search whether privilege pertains to specific documents.  The situation becomes even more problematic given the prevalence of electronic data storage.  A legal solution is necessary which recognises the inevitability of legal privileged data being mixed up with information not enjoying that privilege.  The arrangement provided for in this Bill will permit the seizure of information, whether privileged, on a sealed basis.  It will then be a matter for the court to decide on matters relating to privilege.  Application to the court for such a ruling must be made by an officer of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or a court-appointed inspector.  It may also be made by any person from whom disclosure is compelled or material taken.</P>
        <P>The amendments also provide for the introduction of a mechanism whereby the court can be assisted by the appointment of an independent person with suitable legal qualification to examine the information and prepare a report with a view to assisting or facilitating the court in making its determination.  This amendment addresses the concerns that were expressed by the High Court during the hearing on 13 March 2009, to which I referred.</P>
        <P>To preserve confidentiality of sensitive information, the Bill provides that the court hearing can be held otherwise than in public.  Section 7<i> </i>relates to the very important provisions contained in section 31 of the Companies Act 1990.  This prohibits companies from making loans to their directors, except in certain defined circumstances.  This limitation on the personal use of a company&rsquo;s assets by directors and persons connected with those directors is to ensure that the company has the available resources to pay its creditors as their debts fall due.  This prohibition is a very important safeguard in company law and it is applicable to all 180,000 companies incorporated in Ireland.  For this reason, breaches of the provisions have been a particular focus of the work of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, since it was established in late 2001.  Concerns were expressed that the success in prosecuting offending directors or companies might be affected by the current wording of section 40 of the Companies Act 1990 which puts an onus on the Director of Corporate Enforcement to prove that a company director was aware he was in default of the company law prohibition on loans to directors.</P>
        <P>Section 7 of this Bill therefore substitutes section 40 of the Companies Act 1990, which sets out the penalty for breaches of section 31 of 1990 Act.  The substituted provision will provide, in future, that if a company enters into a transaction or arrangement that contravenes section 31, every officer of the company who is in default will be guilty of an offence.  This aligns the offence with numerous similar offences under the Companies Act and replaces the existing requirement for a successful prosecution to effectively prove wilful default.</P>
        <P>Section 8 amends sections 41 and 43 of the Companies Act 1990 and deals with the disclosure in the annual accounts of loans, namely, transactions, arrangements or agreements, made by a company to its directors and to persons connected with them.  To remove any doubt, the amendments include appropriate penalties for failure to disclose such loans and defences that can be made.  Section 8 also makes some amendments that relate solely to companies that are licensed banks.  As section 9 also deals with this subject I intend to address both sections together.</P>
        <P>In providing for a disclosure regime for company loans to their directors and to those connected with them, the Companies Act 1990 treated companies that are licensed banks differently <Col N="252"/>from the generality of companies.  Most companies must disclose such data on an individual named basis in their annual accounts but the accounts of companies licensed as banks require a lesser degree of disclosure.  This was supplemented by a requirement to keep a register of relevant loans, details of which had to be disclosed to shareholders in advance of the banks annual general meeting.  This different disclosure regime took account of the fact that lending is part of the day-to-day operations of a banking company and, unlike most other companies, the business of the banking sector was regulated and supervised.</P>
        <P>The generality of companies must disclose in their annual accounts prescribed details, as set out in section 42 of the Companies Act 1990, of all such loans to named individuals.  To date, the annual accounts of companies that are licensed banks were obliged to disclose aggregated data on such loans, where amounts were still outstanding at the end of the financial year.  Given this different disclosure regime, companies which are licensed banks are also currently obliged to keep a statutory register of loans to named directors and connected persons.  Particulars from the register are also included in a pre-AGM statement.</P>
        <P>The Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 changes the disclosure requirements for the banks in the following ways.  The Bill provides that in future loans to directors of companies that are licensed banks will be treated in the same way as non-banking companies.  Specifically, all loans above a <i>de minimis</i> threshold to each individual named director will have to be disclosed separately in the annual accounts, as opposed to in aggregate format.  The maximum amount outstanding during the year will also be disclosed and not simply the amount outstanding at the end of the financial year.</P>
        <P>In so far as connected persons are concerned, the Bill provides for additional disclosure but this is not as detailed as is required for directors.  It retains the existing aggregate disclosure of favourable loans in the case of connected persons, but provides that the maximum amount outstanding during the year will also have to be disclosed.</P>
        <P>The Bill recognises that licensed banks may be required to make more detailed disclosures in their accounts under rules, directions or requirements imposed by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>The Bill retains the requirement for the statutory register because of its value as a source of up-to-date data on current loans.  However, it provides that information which will, as a result of the Bill or other requirement such as the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s rules, be required to be published in the accounts, need not also appear on the pre-AGM statement.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides a specific right to access for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to the statutory register of loans to directors and connected persons, so that he can take enforcement action if necessary.</P>
        <P>Section 10 amends sections 43 and 44 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 to meet the concerns of the European Commission that certain elements of the current provisions are not compatible with the EC treaty.  A company law amendment introduced in 1999 sought to deal with Irish registered companies that were controlled and managed from abroad and were treated as non-resident for tax purposes.  The 1999 Act required a company wishing to register in Ireland to have a director resident in the State, or alternatively through a process involving the Revenue Commissioners and the Companies Registration Office, to show it has a real and continuous link with economic activity that is being carried on in the State.  The amendment proposed in the Bill replaces the necessity to have at least one Irish resident director with a requirement that one director must be resident in the European Economic Area.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to supporting the work of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in every possible way, including through the provision of appropriate statutory powers and resources to that office.  My objective in proposing these legislative changes to the Govern<Col N="253"/>ment and the Oireachtas is twofold.  As I observed recent events unfold in the banking sector, I was anxious to ensure that the Director of Corporate Enforcement had available to him or her an up-to-date suite of enforcement powers that were fit for purpose.   I wanted to ensure that from a business perspective our body of company law was relevant, transparent and proportionate as regards the facilitation of the conduct of business in Ireland and for reasons of good governance and penalties.  Having a strong, transparent and proportionate legal framework is critical to our competitiveness and to our international reputation as a place in which to invest and conduct business.  On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  It is the role of Opposition to forensically analyse the actions of Government and point out shortcomings in its performance.  Our people place great faith in the Opposition&rsquo;s ability to carry out this role on their behalf.  To retain real credibility in carrying out this duty it is important that those in opposition acknowledge and support a positive step in the right direction by any Government.  This Bill is one such positive step.  It is a legislative response to the recent events in our banking system that have shattered confidence in our financial institutions, not alone nationally but internationally. </P>
        <P Just="Left">In April 2005 <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> described Dublin as the &ldquo;Wild West of European Finance&rdquo;.  Perhaps that description was a little on the sensational side for a normally sober publication, but it gave a number of warning signals to the effect that something was not quite right in our financial services sector.  Four years later our faith in the financial institutions and in those who manage and regulate them has suffered massive damage.  I sincerely hope that this legislation will go some way towards restoring that faith.  We must acknowledge, however, that if the provisions contained in the Bill had been in place some years ago, Ireland might have been a very different place financially.  Unfortunately, this Bill cannot make up for the past few years of questionable regulation of the financial sector.  Serious questions still remain for the former Financial Regulator and his staff to answer as regards how they allowed dubious actions in the banks to proceed without raising objections or taking strong action.  Not alone did the regulator not raise any objections, he seemed at times to be party to some of these actions.  The furtive exchange of funds between Irish Life &amp; Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank, euphemistically described as balance sheet management, and allegedly done with the blessing of the regulator, must have been the low point in deceiving not only the shareholders of both institutions but also the Irish<b> </b>people.  The only regulatory response to such balance sheet management seems to have been the by now infamous phrase, &ldquo;Fair play to you, Willie&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Running alongside these dubious activities was another altogether more disturbing exchange of funds where directors of certain banks took out massive personal loans.  In Anglo Irish Bank alone, the figure for loans to directors ran to &euro;179 million.  This activity was ongoing while the bank&rsquo;s annual report painted a completely different picture.  The following words contained in the 2007 annual report of Anglo Irish Bank now have a very sickening hollow ring to them:</P>
        <P LI="1">We operate to the highest ethical and governance standards as we aspire to be a model corporate citizen.  For this reason we invest heavily in the development and training of our staff, as well as maintaining the highest levels of integrity in our relationships with our stakeholders.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Unfortunately for those stakeholders and for our taxpayers, integrity was not a priority for those at the helm of this bank and indeed many others.  The Bill seeks to give extra powers to the Director of Corporate Enforcement so that such an abuse of power and downright greed will not be allowed to happen again.  It will in particular place a duty on a director of a company to declare any interests he or she may have in contracts or proposed contracts.  It also requires <Col N="254"/>the full disclosure in the annual accounts of loans, described as transactions, arrangements or agreements, made by a company to its directors and to persons connected with them.</P>
        <P>The considerable extra powers bestowed on the Director of Corporate Enforcement in this legislation, while late, are very welcome, indeed.  The Bill will clarify and enhance the power of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to require the production of records from third parties where these relate to the business of a company under investigation.  It will give an extension of the period of a search warrant which can be sought from and granted by the District Court to the Director of Corporate Enforcement to enter and search of premises.  The value of giving the director unfettered access to company records is also acknowledged as the Bill allows for the removal of paper and electronic information from premises being searched for subsequent examination elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes major disincentives for those company directors who might be planning to engage in creative loan arrangements in the future.  It proposes that if a company enters into a transaction or arrangement that contravenes the Companies Act 1990, every officer of that company who is in default will be guilty of an offence.  This aligns the offence with numerous similar offences under the Companies Acts and places a serious onus of responsibility on all officers of a company to ensure that all its activities are legal and fair.  Simply turning a blind eye to dubious practices will not be a sufficient defence in the future.  For the taxpayer, probably the most galling aspect of the recent financial debacle was the way in which some directors were able to award themselves substantial loans at very attractive rates.  They also managed to deceive their shareholders, customers and the public by not disclosing details of these loans.  This Bill hopefully will address that problem in that it requires all banks to disclose in their annual accounts details of loans to directors above a minimum threshold.  This disclosure will include the maximum amount outstanding on these loans during the period covered by the accounts.  It also requires the disclosure in the annual accounts of loans made to persons connected with directors.  Banks will be required to have a register of loans to directors and the preparation of a statement, based on information in the register, is to be made available prior to a company&rsquo;s annual general meeting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I mentioned at the outset, the Bill goes a long way towards protecting the shareholders and taxpayers of this country from being subjected to dishonest and sharp practices.  However, there is one omission and that is a provision that might seek to address the anomaly of the building societies and perhaps credit unions, which are not covered under the Companies Acts, for the purposes of investigations by the Office of the Director<i> </i>of Corporate Enforcement.  My colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, recently published a Private Members' Bill, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) (Amendment) Bill 2009, that aims to resolve this anomaly and Fine Gael will be seeking to amend this legislation to reflect our Bill.  I sincerely hope that the support we are giving the Government in bringing forward this new Bill will be reciprocated by an acknowledgement on its part that the Fine  Gael proposal to include all financial institutions in the legislation is a wise one.  The last thing we need is another flawed item of legislation that continues to leave our people open to the type of greed-fuelled abuse they have suffered in recent times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend a warm welcome to the T&aacute;naiste, particularly in so far as she is here in connection with this legislation.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that this Bill is robust in its accommodation and has certainly been activated by the proactiveness of the T&aacute;naiste in recognising the need to have thorough and tough legislation in this area.  I congratulate her on her approach to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in seeking what legislative improvements are required in the com<Col N="255"/>pany law area, her sphere of responsibility.  I am delighted to note the Bill deals with three such aspects, one of which is the transparency of loans by a company that is a licensed bank to its directors and those connected with them.  It recognises that in this regard the current situation differs, regardless of whether it is a licensed bank.  The Bill provides for disclosure requirements, as the T&aacute;naiste outlined, concerning directors, connected persons and other disclosures in the accounts and in the pre-annual general meeting statement.  The legislation also provides a specific right of access by the Director of Corporate Enforcement to the statutory register of loans to directors and connected persons so that he can take enforcement action if necessary.  All in all, that principle, which is contained in detail in the Bill, is merited and welcome.</P>
        <P>The second principle contained in the Bill is strengthening the enforcement of company law.  The T&aacute;naiste has gone into great detail in outlining the relevant sections of the Bill that will assist in that regard.  They make it an offence for directors not to comply with the Bill&rsquo;s disclosure provisions regarding loans to directors and connected persons, and regarding material interests of directors in company contracts.  The Bill modifies a number of the existing provisions of the Companies Act 1990.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech specified the reasons for the various measures.  I welcome the robust nature of the legislation, but one must express a certain amount of caution that we are not going too heavily or too far.</P>

	<P>Come on, go easy now.  I do not think the Senator&rsquo;s party wants to hear that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>A lot of good, law-abiding citizens are involved in companies who take risks.  On occasion, however, because of one or two bad eggs, we use a sledgehammer instead of a simple hammer.  This matter should be left to the T&aacute;naiste together with the various professionals, researchers and other authorities that are available to her, including people such as the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I would like to think that they are taking a balanced approach to this legislation.  Sometimes, however, we go a little bit too far in introducing legislation and giving powers to an individual, particularly with regard to search warrants and other such powers.  I certainly concur with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s view on the basis that this is being done in conjunction with other authorities, agencies and all the other supports available to her Department through this appropriate and balanced legislation. </P>
        <P>The third main part of the legislation seeks to make non-resident companies here compatible with the EU&rsquo;s companies code.  This was the last point referred to by the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>The Bill responds to the lack of disclosures by directors of financial institutions in the past, which has come to light much to the public&rsquo;s dismay, disquiet and frustration.  The former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, in particular, seems to be public target number one as the person allegedly responsible for all the ills of the Irish banking sector and the current recession.  To be fair, however, the former chairman is not responsible for all the ills of the Irish financial institutions or, indeed, for the global recession.  I do not want to do anything that would pre-empt some of the current investigations and likely follow through arising from those investigations, other than to say that there is a public view &mdash; I think the T&aacute;naiste is aware of it &mdash; of the activities of some of these individuals who have rocked the foundations of Irish financial institutions.  They have caused considerable losses to the institutions and their shareholders, as well as affecting international confidence.  It is necessary, therefore, for the Government to put in place the appropriate legislative measures to prevent a recurrence.  Equally, the public wants to see those who have breached and abused their positions in financial institutions being held accountable.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>Everybody is being bombarded by what is happening in the Irish financial sector and the economy generally, which is compounded by the world recession.  We are getting lost in all the figures.  At the end of the day, however, the public will welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s proactive stance in dealing with the Director of Corporate Enforcement and putting this legislation before the House.  They may ask those of us who will be knocking on doors in the coming weeks why this was not done before now.  I listened to the previous speaker, Senator Cannon, who was the leader of a political party in government for the past couple of years, and he posed a similar question.  Equally, the public will ask him why he did not deliver and do something when he was in that position.  They will be asking me the same question because people are frustrated and annoyed.  The public wants to see the people concerned being brought through due and fair process.  There is a view that there have been abuses, but we must await the outcome of that due and fair process.  At that stage, appropriate action can be taken which is similar to and as robust as this legislation.</P>
        <P>While one may have concerns about certain aspects of the Bill, the public would like to see the same type of appropriate legislative response concerning the penalisation of those held accountable for creating the need to bring such legislation before the House.</P>
        <P>There is one other area with which we are all concerned and that is disclosure about connected persons.  It is a very sensitive area and one of which me must be conscious.  We must ensure that we have the appropriate consensus as we approach this issue.   While I appreciate the proactive approach the T&aacute;naiste adopted with regard to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, will she indicate what other representative groups she consulted on the legislation?  Is she open to proposals or recommendations being made before Committee Stage by representative bodies or organisations which have an interest in the Bill?</P>
        <P>In referring to connected persons I had intended to raise an issue connected to directors&rsquo; loans as well as the matter of the so-called &ldquo;golden ten&rdquo;.  While I accept company law is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s area of responsibility, will she clarify issues relating to financial services?  If one was to ask what prompted the introduction of this legislation, the words &ldquo;Anglo Irish Bank&rdquo; would immediately spring to mind.  Issues connected to that bank are a cause of concern.  For the purpose of the debate and to assist those who may be following it, will the T&aacute;naiste indicate the reason for the Bill&rsquo;s current focus?</P>
        <P>I have great admiration for the work being done by the T&aacute;naiste and her team of officials in what must be the most turbulent period in the history of the Department.  I congratulate the Department on taking a proactive approach to addressing the issues with which it must contend daily, while at the same time proactively seeking to secure foreign direct investment.  I understand the Minister was engaged in such work last week.</P>
        <P>The Director of Corporate Enforcement and acting Financial Regulator are also in turbulent, choppy and uncharted waters.  I have great admiration for the acting Financial Regulator, Ms Mary O&rsquo;Dea.  Having been thrown in at the deep end, she has shown she has a firm grasp of the issues.  I wonder why she was not appointed Financial Regulator much earlier.</P>
        <P>In February this year, the Financial Regulator decided to require all banks to report directors&rsquo; loans, including connected lending, in their annual accounts and establish a register of such loans which would be made available for view to the shareholders of the institutions in question.  In accordance with the law, the banks had 21 days to make representations to the regulator on the proposals.  These representations are being considered by the Financial Regulator and it is expected the new requirements will become effective by the end of May 2009.</P>
        <P>While the Bill and the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s requirements will require the same disclosures regarding loans to directors, the latter&rsquo;s proposal differs slightly from that of the former regard<Col N="257"/>ing lendings to entities and persons connected to directors.  Whereas the legislation only requires the disclosure of loans to connected persons granted on favourable terms, the regulator&rsquo;s proposals require disclosure of all loans.  Its requirement that companies maintain a register is over and above company law requirements.</P>
        <P>A great deal of good work is being done by the T&aacute;naiste in the area of company law and by other authorities and bodies in related areas.  I congratulate the acting Financial Regulator and everyone in her office as well as the T&aacute;naiste and her officials on the work they are doing.  I hope appropriate and strong legislative measures will be implemented to address the ills of which we have recently been aware.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House.  She is responsible for a difficult and complex Department.  From years of experience in this area, I am aware she has excellent advisers at her disposal.  The important legislation before us enjoys my full support, although I propose to refer to a number of issues the Bill omits to address.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, I declare an interest in this debate.  I am also in a position to answer some of the questions Senator Callely raised and outline the reason the proposals before us were not implemented in previous legislation.  When the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, introduced the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill in 2003 directors&rsquo; compliance statements were addressed in a clear and direct fashion.  It was subsequently decided, however, to avoid excessively burdening the captains of industry who were ripping us off left, right and centre by ensuring the legislation became what is known as &ldquo;light touch&rdquo;.  Senator Callely&rsquo;s remarks on this matter were made with the best intentions but they angered me because the light touch regulation he calls for is precisely what caused the current trouble.  The Senator is nevertheless correct that no one wants to put pressure on honest people.</P>
        <P>The Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill introduced in 2003 by the then Minister and her advisers, some of whom are in the Chamber, included a provision requiring a clear and unambiguous director&rsquo;s compliance statement which had to be signed off by the company&rsquo;s auditors.  Members on the Government side of both Houses as well as a number of Opposition Senators did not like this provision and considerable pressure was brought to bear on the then Minister.  Against her own best judgment, the Minister softened the original requirement.  In recent months, she has not been given credit for her initial position on the issue.</P>
        <P>What difference did the change make?  Although I do not propose to dwell in detail on developments in the bank to which Deputy Callely referred, when this stuff hit the fan a couple of months ago many people asked the reason senior banking officials were not before the courts.  It is my view, and only time will tell whether it is correct, that the reason they are not before the courts is that the companies legislation does not clearly state where the law was broken.  If the original provision in the 2003 Bill &mdash; I believe it was section 45 &mdash; had been passed, it would have required all company directors to disclose any matters material to the annual report.  As such, the individuals involved in recent cases would have been in breach of the legislation if the relevant section had been passed.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will indicate whether the section has been commenced because the last time I checked it had still not been commenced.  The reason for the change in the Bill was the pressure brought to bear on the Minister.  It is not easy to introduce strict requirements in this area because powerful vested interests prevent the Government from taking the action required.</P>
        <P>I served on a board with the acting Financial Regulator, Ms Mary O&rsquo;Dea.  Having known her for many years, I hold her in the highest regard.  The legislation establishing the Financial Regulator was also softened following its introduction.  In recent times, I have listened to cynical <Col N="258"/>and dishonest statements by Members of both Houses as they berated the Financial Regulator for failing to prevent 110% loans being given to borrowers.  This practice was not stopped because the Legislature did not provide the Financial Regulator with the necessary powers to intervene.  That is the simple, black and white reason.  Notwithstanding that, I accept the Financial Regulator failed to intervene in areas in which he should have acted.  I can cite examples of areas in which inaction on the regulator&rsquo;s part was due to the decisions of legislators.  It is something we need to look at.</P>
        <P>Where does all this come from?  I will give a brief history lesson.  At the time the offshore accounts and the mess involved with them came to light in the late 1990s, which was our last banking crisis, and which also involved an issue about taxation, the Committee of Public Accounts, rather than a tribunal, conducted the investigation into these matters and did so extraordinarily effectively under the chairmanship of the late former Deputy Jim Mitchell.  The committee comprised a number of people from both sides of the House, including Deputies Pat Rabbitte and Bernard Durkan and a number of other people.  The committee asked at the time for a review of the whole auditing system.  In 2002 the then T&aacute;naiste asked me to chair the audit review group.  She wanted to get somebody who was seen to have no connection to her areas.  We produced a report which was presented by myself and the then T&aacute;naiste to the Committee of Public Accounts in 2002, two weeks after the deadline it had given to us.  The report was accepted by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s adviser may have been there on the day.</P>
        <P>We went through the report on the day and an important aspect was we managed to change the viewpoint of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will tell the T&aacute;naiste how.  Its view at the time was there should be no self-regulation among the accountancy profession and auditors and they should be regulated by the State centrally in some way.  We changed that by making a proposal, having a long argument and the committee accepting it on the basis of what the then T&aacute;naiste and I argued, namely, that this was something we should try.  It is now what is in place and one of the groups that is investigating.  Another major aspect was the director&rsquo;s compliance statement.  It was also accepted by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The two central issues of the report were accepted by the committee and on that basis, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment produced the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  When it was brought in it was softened and diluted.</P>
        <P>I want to take the connections further.  In one of the coincidences which life throws up, the secretary of my secretariat when I chaired the group is now the Director of Corporate Enforcement and knows very clearly what is involved.  Some time after that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am not sure which, set up the company law review group which recently produced a report.  Within the group were all the people Senator Callely was hinting at when he asked who was spoken to.  I have listened to the T&aacute;naiste discuss the Bill and I support it.  I listened to her argumentation, I support it and I support very much the point she made about the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>Appendix B to the recent report of the company law review group deals with section 45 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which we all support, produced a minority report and did not agree with what was proposed in the review.  Three groups opposed it and I want to put two on the record formally.  One is the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the other is the Revenue Commissioners.  I want the House to know this because I will table an amendment to this Bill, which will be an addendum as opposed to a change.  I am taking the proposal of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which is appendix B and which goes through <Col N="259"/>section 45 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 with an entire section of changes.</P>
        <P>In the appendix, the director records his reservations and states that as the body responsible for encouraging compliance with company law &mdash;  it is important to listen to these facts and to move away from a light touch &mdash; including the preparation of books of accounts which give a true and fair view of a company&rsquo;s state of affairs, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement finds unacceptable a proposal which omits reporting on obligations which may materially affect the company&rsquo;s financial statements.  That is what I want to put into this Bill so Senator Callely does not ask in a year&rsquo;s time why we waited until now.</P>
        <P>I do not want the T&aacute;naiste to come back and say she is adding another section to the 1,230 sections in the Bill proposed for next year to deal with this issue.  I want her to accept I am putting this forward in good faith.  It is not my proposal but is one which has been well tested over the ground.  In his reservation, the Director of Corporate Enforcement states the provision for auditor review of the director&rsquo;s compliance state has been entirely deleted.  I want this on the record because people in this House stand up and ask what the auditors were doing.  They were doing what we asked them to do and if we ask them to do less, they do less so let us get it right.</P>
        <P>This was a key recommendation of the auditing review group, of which I was chairperson some ten years ago, in enhancing the public interests of auditors.  I will table an amendment to this Bill and I am outlining it so the T&aacute;naiste will know what it is before she sees it.  It is a proposal to amend section 45 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 in line with what was proposed by the auditing review group of which I was chair and which was recently proposed by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to ensure matters which are material to the report are required to be reported by the directors and also that the auditor is required to sign off on that.  It is entirely reasonable.  I will come back with that amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the T&aacute;naiste to take an issue on board.  When she deals with this matter in the future I ask her to remember company law is based on common law and civilisation.  When people started to trade in financial institutions in places such as Genoa and Barcelona, if one did not meet one&rsquo;s liabilities, one was hanged outside one&rsquo;s shop door, which was the case until the Middle Ages.  I make the point because, as a civilised people, we thought that was the wrong way to do it.  We create a privilege and a gift to people in business and financial institutions which is called limited liability.</P>
        <P>I say this because the next time the T&aacute;naiste speaks to a group of business people I would like her to say we have given them this, which is a gift &mdash; a treasure &mdash; of significant importance so businesses can take the kind of risks Senator Callely referred to without people losing their houses and homes.  It is a gift which is not to be abused and which can be taken back at any time by a democracy.  It is a fairly basic tenet.  The T&aacute;naiste could throw away the script, stand up and ask ordinary people how they are honouring it or whether they are aware of it, because generations have grown up feeling this is a right.  It is not.  It is a privilege awarded by the State under the strictest of rules and regulations requiring us to ensure ordinary citizens are treated properly, fairly and equitably.  That is why the problem exists today.</P>
        <P>In the first version of the audit review group, when I asked we propose the directors of a company sign off on a statement which more or less said they were in compliance with the law of the land, I thought, in my innocence, that was not raising the bar one inch.  I thought any director of any public or private company had at least such a level of responsibility and duty to the shareholders, traders, people with whom they dealt and the State.  It did not appear to <Col N="260"/>be the case.  The accounting bodies lined up to say how this could not be done and such a burden could not be placed on people.</P>
        <P>When I hear the word &ldquo;burden&rdquo; in business, I think of the last person who challenged me publicly on this issue when addressing a conference, namely, the man referred to earlier by Senator Callely and the then chairperson of Anglo Irish Bank, who talked about the burden and difficulties of regulation.  We know all about that now.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste receives significant criticism.  It is a most complex and difficult Department to deal with.  I have been of the view for many years that it should be restructured.  Its remit is too broad.  One need only consider the number of external bodies that report to it to see the degree of complexity.</P>
        <P>We must introduce the necessary legislative provisions to ensure those who do not act honourably are in breach of the law.  I propose to support the legislation, with the minor caveat that it is almost too rules-based.  I come from County Kerry, as did Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, and when I see a particular descriptive word in a Bill, I know I can find another word to serve precisely the same purpose.  There are well paid accountants and others who will manage to do exactly the same in regard to the definition of a loan and who will be able to allow their clients to squeeze out from under this legislation.  That is inevitable.  I seek a principles-based approach, whereby people are required to act honourably, comply with the law and do what is expected by us as legislators, by customers and by shareholders and stakeholders.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to support my proposals in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This welcome legislation is a reaction to the sad events that have occurred in Irish business, banking and commercial life in the last year.  As a direct response to the types of abuses we have seen it is, by definition, narrow in focus.  I accept Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s argument that there are broader areas to examine.  There will be an opportunity to examine some of them in the course of the further consideration of the Bill in this and the other House.  There is also the opportunity of the wider review of company law legislation that the Government proposes to undertake in the coming years.  In the current climate, we must take every opportunity to ensure the standards that have applied in the past can no longer apply.  In this regard, I agree that other actions are required to be taken.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, much of what is proposed in this legislation is eminently acceptable.  The increase in powers for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is particularly welcome.  The ability of that office to take a more proactive approach will help to pre-empt the types of scandals we have had to endure in the last 18 months.  Its enhanced function in regard to disclosure and public information will help to avoid such activity as the moving around of company and banking assets to the betterment of individuals that has been far too long hidden from public view.  The threat of disclosure must be greater so we can avoid these practices of the past.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the provisions in regard to the disclosure of director loans within companies and financial institutions.  I would go further, either in this Bill or in future legislation, by allowing questions to be asked about the nature of director loans themselves.  We must be far more prescriptive about the fact that they exist in the first place and we must list the circumstances in which they can be used.  The most obviously scandalous use we have witnessed was for the bolstering of the share prices of the companies and institutions concerned.  I suspect that, far too often, the practice of director loans has been for the self-enrichment of the individuals concerned rather than for reasons of business advancement and the good of the company.</P>
        <P>When loans are available and availed of to such an extent, there is an issue of morality that must be addressed.  There is an attempt to do so in this Bill.  I hope it will be successful but I <Col N="261"/>expect we will have to go further in the future.  For instance, in regard to the access to and involvement of others in the business of the taking of and granting of director loans, there is reference to the spouses of the company directors involved but no mention of siblings, children or other relatives.  In the close society in which we live &mdash; I refrain from using the word &ldquo;incestuous&rdquo; because it has been mentioned so often in reference to the political and business scandals we have witnessed in recent years &mdash; we must tighten every possible legislative loophole.  This Bill is a response to the abuses of which we are aware.  The role of any legislation, and our role as legislators in this House, is to pre-empt any difficulties that may occur in the future.  Unfortunately, our attitude to some in business, commercial and financial life is that if an abuse can be taken, it will be taken.  Future legislation in this area should be used to ensure we tighten every possible loophole.</P>
        <P>The other provisions in this Bill are technical in nature, including some changes to how the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement can do its job.  Our objective in introducing legislation of this nature is to make tangible changes in the culture of corporate life in this State.  We must be as open and honest as possible in these debates so we can put as much distance as possible between the political system and those practices in corporate life which, if they ever were acceptable, can never again be so deemed.  On those grounds, I welcome the legislation and look forward to the debate that will take place on amendments and so on.  I am confident the thrust of this Bill and of future initiatives in regard to companies legislation sets us in the right direction in terms of making the necessary changes.  I look forward to closing as many as possible of the existing loopholes via the proposed consolidated companies Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  As she said, this Bill is introduced just a short time after it was suggested in the High Court that the investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement into the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank was being frustrated by outdated company law.  The Labour Party welcomes the broad thrust of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Whatever powers are required by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to do its job must be provided.  I welcome the provisions to enhance further the powers of that office and to improve the transparency of loans made by banks to their directors.  The Bill also improves the transparency of transactions between companies and their directors and amends the requirement for companies incorporating the State to have Irish-resident directors.  In addition, the Bill changes the scope and effect of legal professional privilege in certain circumstances.  All these changes are to be welcomed.  I hope they are comprehensive enough to provide solutions to the problems encountered by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Bill addresses a deficiency in the Companies Act 1963 by affording the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement the right to inspect and take copies of the required register of all declarations of interest by directors in contracts or proposed contracts.  There is no legislative point in requiring such a register to be maintained if it is not open to inspection.  In addition, powers to seize information found on a premises entered into on foot of a search warrant have been extended.  The Bill will allow an officer of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to remove information and other materials from the site of an investigation pending a determination of the appropriateness of such action.  The duration of search warrants issued to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which are currently valid for no more than one month, may now be extended on application to a District Court judge.</P>
        <P>Section 23 of the Companies Act 1990 allows a person to refuse to disclose what he or she considers to be privileged information to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. <Col N="262"/> The Bill will change that and enable the director to seize privileged information, provided it maintains the confidentiality of the information until such time as a court determines if the information is, in fact, protected by legal privilege, and allow for the appointment of a suitably qualified independent person to prepare a report on the disputed information if it is so disputed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Seanad on the ongoing situation in relation to the current outbreak of influenza and the measures being taken in response to the outbreak</P>
        <P>On Friday, 24 April 2009, a public health alert was received from the World Health Organisation indicating that human cases of influenza type A(H1 N1) virus infection had been identified in the US and Mexico.  On 26 April, the WHO upgraded the pandemic alert level from phase 3 to phase 4 and on 28 April to phase 5.  Phase 5 is defined by the WHO as clusters of the virus with human to human spread.  These upgrades were anticipated in the context of our national influenza preparedness.</P>
        <P>There is one confirmed case of A(H1 N1) influenza in Ireland.  It was confirmed on 2 May 2009.  The case involves a young male in the east who recently returned from travel to Mexico.  The man, who is relatively well, is currently receiving antiviral medication in his home.  Close contacts have been contacted and are also receiving appropriate treatment.  There are no further probable or confirmed cases in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure people who may have influenza will come forward for investigation and, if necessary, treatment, it is proposed to maintain absolute confidentiality in relation to the identity and precise location of probable and confirmed cases. It is not proposed to report on numbers of people under investigation but rather to limit reporting to probable or confirmed cases, which provides important information for planning purposes and is similar to how this information is reported in other countries.</P>
        <P>As of 8 a.m., there were 125 confirmed cases of the influenza in Europe, including the wider European Economic Area and European Free Trade Association countries, with 15 probable cases and evidence of community transmission in three countries.  Outside Europe, there are 1,527 confirmed cases and 22 probable cases.  The bulk of the confirmed cases relate to three countries.  Mexico has 942 cases, the USA has 403 and Canada has 165.  While there is no change to the current level of influenza pandemic alert, it is likely that the numbers of cases worldwide will continue to increase.</P>
        <P>In the event that the WHO changes its pandemic alert level to phase 6, our national preparedness will allow Ireland to respond appropriately to this.  Phase 6 would indicate sustained community spread in a second WHO region other than the Americas.  It should be noted that some community transmission has been seen in the UK, Spain and Germany but it is not yet the sustained high level of transmission seen in Mexico and the USA.</P>
        <P>It is too early to draw definite conclusions on the severity of illness caused by influenza A(H1 N1).  However, cases that have occurred outside Mexico appear to be of mild illness.  This is a cause for hope but not for complacency.  We hope for the best but we need to plan for the worst.  Influenza A(H1 N1) is a new virus against which there is no pre-existing immunity in the population and for which there is no vaccine.  This means that, even if illness caused by <Col N="263"/>influenza A(H1 N1) proves to be milder than initially suspected, levels of infection in the population might still be high.</P>
        <P>On receipt of the alert, my Department activated our national plan for the health service response to pandemic influenza which was finalised in January 2007.  The plan is accompanied by detailed expert guidance developed by the pandemic expert guidance group.  In line with the plan, we have put appropriate governance structures in place to deal with the outbreak.  This involves the HSE&rsquo;s crisis management team, the pandemic expert guidance group, chaired by Professor Bill Hall, and the EU co-ordination group, feeding into a national public health emergency team, NPHET, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  This national group manages the interface between my Department and the HSE and is the main decision making forum for the health system response.  We have also maintained close contact with the World Health Organisation on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To date the following measures have been put in place.  Enhanced surveillance in the community and hospitals across the country to enable the detection and reporting of cases has been instituted.  Improved viral diagnostic services and enhanced laboratory capacity, including out-of-hours arrangements, are currently in place, which strengthens our ability for early detection.  Provision has been made for antiviral stockpiles to cover 47% of the population, which is among the highest levels worldwide.  Some of these supplies have been distributed through public health departments to facilitate the treatment of initial cases.  An advance purchase agreement with the vaccine companies is being put in place to secure the necessary supplies of a pandemic vaccine when these become available.  Communication to professionals outlining their role in managing cases of influenza is updated on a frequent basis.  Contact tracing arrangements have been established.  Posters and leaflets have been placed in air and sea ports.  The HSE has established a flu information helpline, freefone 1800 94 11 00, for the public which is available 24 hours a day.  Up to yesterday it had received over 1,000 calls.  A public information leaflet containing practical information for the public on what to do in the event of a pandemic has been printed and is currently being distributed to every household in the country.  The leaflet is currently available on the HSE website.  Supplies of personal protective equipment and other medications that are required for management of influenza have been issued.  Frequently asked questions have been compiled and are updated daily on my Department&rsquo;s website and a travel advisory has been prepared and is updated daily on my Department&rsquo;s website and that of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied fully with our levels of preparedness and our capacity to deal with a possible flu pandemic.  I compliment all those involved in developing our plans for a pandemic and pay special tribute to those throughout the health services who, since the current outbreak, have worked tirelessly to ensure our health system is geared up and ready to meet the challenge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Senator Liam Twomey.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to brief Senators on the situation regarding influenza A(H1 N1).  I pay tribute to the medical experts in the Department of Health and Children, particularly the chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and his team, for their excellent leadership on this issue, the crisis management provisions which are in place and the briefing of the Opposition, which has been extremely helpful.  I would like to see that continuing if and when the situation changes.</P>
        <P>It appears that all those who should be involved are involved.  It is not yet clear what the outcome will be internationally but we appear to be well prepared at this point.  There is no doubt that new demands will be placed on the health services and that vigilance is absolutely essential.  The key is information, education and forward planning.  It would appear that much <Col N="264"/>planning has been done.  It remains to be seen how well the services will respond if the situation develops and, as the Minister said, that is likely.  However, the indications are extremely good.</P>
        <P>It is important that people are not panicked.  Even if there are more cases of the influenza we do not want to see panic.  People need to be well-informed and know what to do if they have symptoms of the disease.  The general practitioners know what they must do, as do the public health experts.  The readiness we have seen and the preparation thus far are very reassuring for people.  However, I wish to put some questions to the Minister.  We have seen a number of schools in the UK close to where a cluster of cases has been reported.  What contact has the Minister&rsquo;s Department had with the Department of Education and Science?  What plans are in place should such a situation arise here?  That is not in any way to suggest that it will.  What is our level of preparedness to deal with such a situation?  Have school authorities been briefed on crisis management plans?  Does the Minister intend to brief schools?  How will these matters be handled and how have they been handled to date?</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the work to develop a new vaccine for the flu.  It would be helpful to keep the public as informed as possible in this regard.  I understand the timescale for a new vaccine is between four and six months.  It will take time to develop but in the meantime we must have an adequate supply of Tamiflu in Ireland which can prove effective against the disease.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister is updating the travel advice on a daily basis which is very important.  In the beginning different advice was given at EU level and national level, which was unhelpful.  Perhaps the Minister will brief us on the EU response and the decisions taken at the recent Ministers&rsquo; meeting also.</P>
        <P>Is there any specific advice that the Minister or experts could give to people recently returned from Mexico?  I commend the medical experts on their control of the issue to date and I wish them well in future.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister on some of the details I have sought.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the officials in the Department of Health and Children on their handling of the potential crisis to date.  The lessons learnt by the Department in how to deal with a pandemic were greatly enhanced following the outbreak of SARS in 2003.  It is clear from the response of the Department that it has learnt a good deal from that potential SARS outbreak five years ago.  All measures established, including public announcements, and the way with which the matter was dealt, that is, by neither over-playing nor underplaying the nature of the crisis, indicate a positive response from officials in the Department.  Although the structures are in place in the event of a pandemic, it is lucky for us that this virus seems to be no more virulent than any other influenza virus present in any country at any time.  We have been lucky in the sense that it has not been a full-blown crisis.  It has been only a potential crisis and, therefore, we have not been fully tested in respect of the potential outcomes.  I am sure the Department in its wisdom will stress test its systems to establish how it would respond.</P>
        <P>In the past when discussing SARS the issue arose of how best to use hospital beds.  Does the Department believe this is still an issue?  If this were a full blown pandemic of a highly virulent strain of influenza we would have to keep certain people at home as much as possible to isolate them from the general population.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note there has been a great reduction in the HSE in the level of home help services and public health nurses provided.  The recruitment embargo is impacting on primary care services.  The slow roll-out of primary care, which has been a part of Government policy since 2001, would be severely tested if a highly virulent influenza virus struck the country.  From that point <Col N="265"/>of view not enough has been done to build up the level of primary care which has been promised for several years.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated it has funding to build primary care centres, but not to take on staff for primary care centres, which has the potential to weaken primary care.  There is also a manpower crisis in public health nursing and with general practitioners working in primary care services.  The Government does not seem to be responding to these needs seriously.  These matters do not reach the headlines unless something serious takes place.  If the virus were to change and become a highly virulent pandemic we would be severely tested.  There are still weaknesses in place.  What does the Minister intend to do in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and I thank her for taking time to come to the House this evening.  We all woke up on 24 April last and heard the alert that Mexican or H1 N1 flu was here and had been detected in Mexico.  It is an indication of the successful job the Minister is doing when one hears the two main Opposition speakers congratulating her Department and the HSE for the great work they have done in the past three weeks.  I have watched the television news bulletins on the matter and I take my hat off to Dr. Tony Holohan.  He gets better as time goes on.  He has a very calm and experienced mind and is a very intelligent man.  He allays the many fears the public may have with the calm way he assures people.  I was taken by some of his recent comments.  He stated that it was too early to reach a conclusion on the severity of the illness in cases reported outside Mexico.  He further stated that any cases reported outside Mexico were milder than those detected in that country.  He went on to state that this was a cause for hope but not for complacency.  This sums him up because he has not been complacent by any measure or means and has been very much on the ball.</P>
        <P>The Minister has referred to the daily meetings in her Department involving the Secretary General, Mr. Scanlan, and Professor Bill Hall.  They have advised the public and kept it abreast of what is taking place.  I check the website every day and it is updated almost minute by minute.  I checked it on Monday and there were 985 confirmed cases outside Europe.  This morning that number had reached 1,516 cases.  That figure is even higher in the Minister&rsquo;s report, which is obviously several cases ahead of the report I examined.  There has been no other flu, whether SARS or bird flu, on which we have had such a good handle and on which the public has felt so reassured by the response.  I congratulate the Minister and her staff in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we remain calm but vigilant as Dr. Holohan suggested.  On my way to the Chamber I stopped briefly to talk with Deputy Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon.  He asked me to where I was rushing and I said I was going to speak on swine flu.  I asked him what he would call it and he suggested it should be called Mexican flu.  He stated how important it is to be calm and not to get too carried away.  He further stated that every ten years a very strong variant of flu emerges and, unfortunately, takes lives.  However, the difference in this case is that older people have built up a resistance.  It is attacking younger people, especially children.  I am glad that we have been very vigilant in our response to the single case in this country.  The Minister outlined details of that case involving a male, living on the east coast who has been treated and is being monitored.  Even his wider circle of friends are being monitored and probably treated too.  It was interesting to listen to the World Health Organisation spokesperson, Dr. Kelly, a native of Curry, County Sligo.  I am sure Sligonians are very proud of him.  He is a young man but he certainly has a great handle on what is going on.  I was interested the other morning to hear, I think on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s radio programme, a professor from UCD talk about the need for calmness.  He said we should not get too carried away although he stressed that people should be vigilant.  He pointed out that, each year, more than 25,000 people throughout the United States <Col N="266"/>of America die from common colds.  He put what has happened with swine flu and what has been said about it in context.  It is interesting to note the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s website has had 75,000 hits from the public.  People are aware but they are not panicking or running around afraid.</P>
        <P>On world travel, I note we are not telling people not to travel.  We are saying that they should not go into Mexico.  That is wise.</P>
        <P>The Minister has done all she can through her Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I was delighted to hear her say that Ireland has one of the biggest stockpiles of any country of the drugs that would be used to treat swine flu.  I think she said we have 47% coverage for our population.  The information that is being given out on-line is excellent and people are reassured by it.  I printed out a copy of the information that will go out from the HSE and the Department to people&rsquo;s homes in the next seven days.  It is an interesting and easy read.  Again, I thank the Minister, the staff in her Department and the HSE for the fine job they have made of allaying the population&rsquo;s fears.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We are quick to criticise the Department of Health and Children time and again when things go wrong.  The morning after swine flu hit the headlines, one of the British-Irish tabloids carried a front-page story that Ireland was unready, unable and without plans to respond.  The Minister and her staff at the Department have handled the matter with the expertise that I look for in Government.  The calm and assured way in which this was presented to the public has been a model of its type.  Dr. Holohan managed to convey in simple language the medical information about what is, no doubt, a complex issue.  The message he conveyed reassured people.  The information about the various back-ups within the Department and the level of readiness was also reassuring.</P>
        <P>As I said, in bad times there is constant criticism so it is useful to recognise that swine flu has been handled, and continues to be handled, well.  No doubt we are only halfway through it, a quarter of the way or whatever, but as an ordinary citizen I feel we are being well protected and well led on the issue.  The Department reacted and responded as I would want it to have done.  I would like the Minister to convey to her officials my subjective view that the matter has been handled with extraordinary expertise.</P>

	<P>I extend a warm welcome to the Minister for Health and Children and thank her for coming this afternoon.  She will begin to wonder what is wrong with us as we have nothing but praise for her today.  I wish the gentleman who contracted the virus well and hope he continues to enjoy good health.  I will wait to hear the Minister&rsquo;s answers to some of the questions that were put, but I join the other speakers in congratulating her on the way in which she and her officials have handled this epidemic.  The information and the ways in which it has been provided have been effective and efficient, and the media reporting has also been good.  I was especially grateful for the briefing Dr. Tony Holohan gave us in the Oireachtas last week and the fact that he took time out to explain to us what was happening.  It is always better to give people the information before they read about it as that gives us a chance to have a prepared response.  I hope swine flu will be contained and we do not get any more cases in Ireland.  If we do, I hope we will handle them correctly.  I thank the Minister again for the way in which the issue has been handled.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all members of the Seanad who have spoken for their kind comments, particularly about the chief medical officer.  I will certainly ensure their comments are relayed to him.  He is a dynamic, visionary chief medical officer.  He is new to his post.  In fact, he took over the day before the pork had to be withdrawn, <Col N="267"/>so he has had something of a baptism of fire.  In thanking him, I also acknowledge Professor Hall from St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and UCD, who is chairman of the expert group, and Dr. Darina Flanagan and Dr. Kelleher from the Health Service Executive, HSE.  They have been meeting each day, including over the weekend, to ensure they are on top of what is required.  They have been connected to the WHO and at European Union level.</P>
        <P>I was asked a number of questions.  I share Senator Feeney&rsquo;s view that we must be vigilant and not complacent.  When I attended the meeting last Thursday, I was reassured to know we are as prepared as anybody else, but it is clear that in the event of a pandemic, all health systems would be challenged.</P>
        <P>On schools, swine flu was to be considered today by the Department of Education and Science at its management meeting, but the guidelines suggest that, in the event of an outbreak in a cr&egrave;che, the cr&egrave;che would be closed, and if there was an outbreak in a primary school, the class would be kept at home.  In the event of an outbreak in a secondary school, the advice of the public health authorities would be sought.  On the one hand, we have to be precautionary in the manner in which we deal with schools, but on the other hand, if we sent every child home from school, many of our health care workers would face a challenge in finding someone to look after their children, so we have to take expert advice on the issues.  We must do the right thing, of course, but we must do it in proportion.  The Department of Education and Science is on the interdepartmental group which met twice in the past week.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the number of people who die from influenza.  At the EU meeting last week, the WHO made the point that across the European Union, including the European Economic Area and the EFTA countries, between 40,000 and 220,000 people a year die either from flu as a sole cause or from influenza and other conditions.  It is important to put the matter in context.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court recently adjudicated on out-of-hours cover for public health doctors.  I understand it made a recommendation yesterday that will go to ballot with a positive recommendation from the IMO.  That issue was raised last week.  I very much welcome that and hope the recommendation will be supported.</P>
        <P>The chief medical officer will be happy to ensure we continue to have appropriate briefings, where necessary, of key spokespeople from the political parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On hospitals, as Senator Twomey said, we want to treat people at home.  For many reasons, we want to minimise the number of people who require hospital admissions, but in the event of a pandemic the protocols suggest that all non-urgent, non-emergency hospital procedures would be cancelled, not just so that we had the appropriate beds for patients who needed treatment but to minimise the chance of hospitals being the source of cross-infection and the flu being passed from person to person.  I will ensure my Department circulates a copy of the plan published in 2007.  It is easy to read and understand and it contains useful information for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I remember two years ago when the issue arose of whether we needed to purchase anti-virals at a cost of &euro;30 million, which would be stored until the event of their use being necessary, I commented to my officials that I was in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment when we were coming towards Y2K.  Much money was spent to ensure computers did not all break down and aeroplanes did not fall out of the sky.  Afterwards we reflected on what it had cost.  The same issues crossed my mind but the overriding concern must be that one must be prepared even in the event of it not being necessary.  The same applies now to the vaccine.</P>
        <P>To be in the queue to get the vaccine four to six months after the pandemic occurs &mdash; most people have said it would take at least six months to get the vaccine &mdash; we must pay money upfront, which will have to happen shortly.  In the current environment where every &euro;1 million <Col N="268"/>is important, one might ask whether we have to do this now.  The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because in the event of it being necessary, it will be too late to join the queue.  We have made a decision to procure the vaccine and pay a sum of money in advance to its producers in order to be in that queue.  We will be with 15 to 17 other EU countries in that regard.</P>
        <P>The issue of travel was discussed at the Ministers&rsquo; meeting last week.  The French Minister took the view that all direct flights between Mexico and Europe should be cancelled.  That view was not widely shared because one can come from Mexico through other countries, including the United States of America and Venezuela.  Ireland does not have direct flights with Mexico and yet we have had a case here of someone who had holidayed in Mexico.  However, we took the view we should advise people not to travel to Mexico unless absolutely necessary.  That remains the advice.  I know of two people who have taken that advice and changed their holiday plans.  Many people will take that advice but others may not.</P>
        <P>I will be happy to come to the House at any stage to speak about the influenza if it becomes a pandemic or if the situation changes.</P>

        <P>We have had very close co-operation with Minister McGimpsey in Northern Ireland and I have had many conversations with him.  We have linked closely with the UK because we share this island with the Northern Ireland authorities, so it is important we work together.  We are at one in regard to many of these issues.  Northern Ireland has joined the queue as have many other European countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, recognising the need for Ireland to be energy independent, supports the various efforts to ensure that Ireland is protected against a shortage of energy in the years ahead.  These efforts should include wind, wave, solar, tidal, off-shore gas, nuclear fusion and nuclear fission.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am not sure if this is his first time to come to the House in his ministerial capacity.  We welcome the opportunity to have him here at this early stage.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Government decided to table an amendment to the motion.  I purposely worded it in a way that the Government would not have to table an amendment to it. <Col N="269"/> I thought it was neutrally worded and would present the opportunity to debate a topic that I consider important.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I will lead in introducing this motion.  As the 12 minutes speaking time I have been allocated is short, I will limit my contribution to one aspect of this debate and Senator O&rsquo;Toole will speak about another aspect of it.  The fact that I will limit my contribution, to a large extent, to one topic does not mean that I do not have a great deal of time for the other topics in this debate.</P>
        <P>There is an urgent need for Ireland to be protected against a shortage of energy supply in the years ahead.  We should be examining all the energy options.  This debate should include wind, wave, solar, tidal, off-shore gas and nuclear energy.  My aim is to bring together the debates on security of supply and climate change and to find the best way to address these crucial issues.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed there has not been a proper debate on the energy issue to date, one that properly analyses the best ways to make Ireland energy independent.  That is the wording I used in this motion.  We must carefully explore the potential energies and go beyond merely promoting certain energies because they have what I would call a feel good factor.  This debate must also not succumb to scaremongering or to lobbying.  We must come together and examine what is best for Ireland, not only for those who are my age but for the next generation and future generations.</P>
        <P>Ireland has one of the highest energy dependency rates of any country in Europe with approximately 90% of all the country&rsquo;s energies having to be imported, according to EU figures.  The question will be asked as to whether so-called renewable energies alone will help to address such dependency and make us energy independent in the future.</P>
        <P>I was asked on radio and television programmes a few years ago what business I would enter if I was to go into business now.  In that respect, I would say that I would be enthusiastic about the opportunities in the energy sector, particularly in sustainable energy.  There are opportunities in that sector but we must develop them because it is necessary to do so to meet the needs of the next generation.</P>
        <P>This issue is linked to whether renewable energies will significantly contribute to reducing our level of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Renewable energy sources in this country account for just 2.6% of all our energy needs.  This is far short of the Government&rsquo;s target of 20% by 2020.  In 1997, the industrial nations of the world agreed at Kyoto to reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions but we have a long way to go before we get anywhere near what we have to achieve.  We must examine the options to make this country less dependent on outside sources of energy so we cease being one of the most energy-dependent countries of the 27 member states &mdash; we could be one of the worst in this regard &mdash; while at the same time reducing our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
        <P>We need to have a more open debate on the various sources of energy and I include nuclear energy upon which I will speak for the next few minutes of my contribution.  There has been a significant shift in the thinking on nuclear power over the past number of years, particularly in recent months.  Many opponents of nuclear power have changed their minds over atomic energy because of the urgent need to look at energy independence and to cut carbon dioxide emissions.  Environmentalists such as Stephen Tindale, former director of Greenpeace,<i> </i>UK Green Party candidate, Chris Goodall, and the chairman of the UK Environment Agency, Chris Smith Finsbury, are now lobbying for the use of nuclear power.  They announced their support about six weeks ago.  None of these people was in favour of nuclear power a decade ago, but recent scientific evidence of just how severe climate change may become as a result of the burning of oil, gas and coal in conventional power stations, has transformed their views.  It is a measure of how urgent the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?><b> </b>problem has become that some anti-nuclear environmentalists have <Col N="270"/>lately been willing to reconsider their long-standing opposition to nuclear power.  James Lovelock, who is a former chief scientist for NASA and was the first person to discover the hole in the ozone layer, believes that in the short term, &ldquo;Only nuclear power can now halt global warming&rdquo;.  He argues that we &ldquo;should regard nuclear energy as something that could be available from new power stations in five years and could see us through the troubled times ahead when the climate changes and there are shortages of food and fuel and major demographic changes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is more than just a shift in thinking; changes are taking place and all over Europe governments are realising that in order to secure their energy supplies in the face of threatening behaviour from oil-supplying countries such as Russia, nuclear power is probably the only way forward.  Poland wants its first nuclear plant by 2020 and Britain decided last year to replace its ageing nuclear reactors and create new sites.  France has ordered its 61st nuclear generator and Finland is building the largest reactor in the world, which is expected to open in 2011.  Nuclear reactors are to be built in Sweden for the first time in nearly 30 years.  I was in Sweden two weeks ago and this is a talking point.  People remember how opposed they were to nuclear power in the past but they have decided to abandon the commitment made in 1980 to phase out nuclear power.  Sweden is just one of a number of EU countries that have chosen nuclear energy to diversify from fossil fuels and meet tough climate-change targets for cutting CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?><b> </b>emissions.  It will replace the country&rsquo;s existing ten reactors, which supply roughly half of its electricity.  It is interesting to note that no public money will be invested in the nuclear industry and all funding will come from the private sector.  The example of Sweden demonstrates that a country renowned for its progressive ideas when it comes to the environment, that has extensive hydroelectric energy resources and where popular opinion has been against nuclear power previously, can have a radical change in both popular and government opinion.  In this country we still cling to the outdated condemnation of nuclear power through our Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  I remember when that Act went through this House we all nodded our heads in agreement with it.  Austria, too, fell victim to intense lobbying and environmentalists stopped a nuclear plant in Austria from being switched on and instead Austria built two coal fired power plants with long-term effects on the environment.</P>
        <P>With the exception of Chernobyl, there have not been any deaths as a result of nuclear power but this must be compared to the number of people who died in coal mines.  I do not agree completely with the sentiment expressed by Mr. James Lovelock because while I agree that nuclear power is important, we should also give renewable sources of energy a chance.  It is correct to incentivise the use of renewable energy and the question has to be asked whether it is possible to go beyond 20% of energy being renewable energy, given the limitations of supply and the unreliability of wind etc.</P>
        <P>The reason for my argument in favour of nuclear power is because we have been afraid in the past to talk about nuclear power.  Now we have discovered that we must look elsewhere because of the challenges facing us and facing the next generation in particular.  The interesting fact about nuclear power is that it is, in so far as we know, much safer than other sources of energy.  I know everyone thinks of what happened at Chernobyl and also what happened in America at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator.  Nobody died there and they were able to close down the reactor.  However, the accident at Chernobyl rightly scared everybody.  The challenges <?oasys _dc18- ?>facing us with regard to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and the Kyoto Protocol are such that as a cost factor we<?oasys _dc0- ?> must consider some alternative.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole will speak about some of the other areas of energy such as tidal, wave, wind and solar energy.  I agree we must concentrate on those energy sources and I look forward to hearing other views on this issue.  However, we must include all of those options without excluding the nuclear option as it has the capacity to solve the problems in the years ahead.  It will not happen overnight and if we are to invest such a large sum of money into creating nuclear energy in Ireland we need to do something about it now.</P>
        <P>I note that interconnectors will provide energy from other places, in particular from Britain and we will be able to avail of nuclear power coming from somewhere else but that is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  It is a case of not having it ourselves but using somebody else&rsquo;s nuclear power.</P>
        <P>In France nuclear energy is solving financial problems and also an energy problem which France faced up to a long time ago.  I am impressed that in France, one&rsquo;s energy bill shows the source of the energy.  I would like to see if this could be done in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My reason for tabling this motion is because both Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I believe there is a challenge facing the country and we must face up to that challenge.  I have concentrated in my contribution on one particular aspect and I look forward to hearing other contributions to the debate which I hope will provide solutions for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.</P>
        <P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Quinn, on tabling this motion as it is a very important subject.  I also congratulate and welcome to the House, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary.  He and I soldiered together on the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security before his elevation.  Much of what we are discussing was discussed by us both formally and informally within and without the House.  I wish him well in his Ministry.</P>
        <P>In honour of his presence in the House I will talk substantially about his county of Mayo.  First, I will conclude the debate on nuclear energy.  I do not support nuclear energy but the I support the points made by Senator Quinn.  The issue has to be discussed and examined.  One of the issues on which I have strong views is that nuclear is considered as one big issue.  I would like to hear a clear distinction between nuclear fusion and nuclear fission.  Nuclear fission is where the isotopes drive madly into each other and create energy.  However, the problem is that it cannot be stopped and this is still happening in Chernobyl, 25 years later and we have no control over it.  On the other hand, nuclear fusion is where the isotopes are merged together.  It is in a much more controlled environment, although it needs much more heat to do it.  The long-term waste is less and the half-life where it is dangerous is much shorter, one tenth that of fission, so it is far less dangerous to future generations.  The current nuclear fission leaves waste that will be there for hundreds of years and we have not worked out how we will sort that out yet.  I will return to that.</P>
        <P>When Senator Quinn and I discussed this I said I would like to make this as practical and as down to earth as possible.  Looking at what we have in various parts of Ireland, we are as rich in energy as almost any place in Europe.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will know this because he and I have examined it very closely.</P>
        <P>I want to mention the extraordinary, progressive, creative and advanced work being done by Mayo County Council.  It was mind-boggling to meet Mr. Des Mahon, the Mayo county manager, ably assisted by people such as Mr. Peter Hynes and others, who have led the way.  For people who talk about what county councils do and do not do, and the importance of local <Col N="272"/>authorities, here are rural models for other counties to look at.  I will give an example and tell Members the things we could do.  I ask people to keep in mind one figure.  The amount of energy that comes through the grid to our houses at peak every day, around 6 p.m. is approximately 5,000 MW in the middle of winter and approximately 3,500 MW in the summer.  That can be seen on the EirGrid website which shows what we are using on any day of the week at any time.</P>
        <P>Mayo County Council has a proposal to build a wind farm in Bellacorrick in Mayo.  There used to be a turf burning power station there and the Cathaoirleach would be well aware of the importance of turf burning in his constituency.  The last turf burning station in Bellacorrick was demolished approximately two years ago.  There is an existing wind farm and there is a proposal for a larger wind farm.  The county council has all the bits put together and can deal with it at its end but there are national problems.  The problem of getting onto the grid has been solved but it must deal with planning and other issues and we must return to that.  When in full flow that wind farm will produce 500 MW.  That is between one seventh and one tenth of Ireland&rsquo;s daily requirements produced in one area in County Mayo.  That is what can be done and it is completely renewable.  I will come back to the storage issue and the non-reliance on wind as a total solution.</P>
        <P>On the climate change committee we see many maps, for example geological maps showing oil rich areas.  Off the north-west coast of Ireland where Shell is working, there is great potential for oil but I will leave that aside.  On the map of the world which shows the most energy laden waves, the north Mayo coast is the richest in Europe.  The average wave height off Belmullet is approximately 2.5 m to 3 m, about the height of the door jambs in this chamber.  That is the average for the year.  A metre of that can produce approximately 450 MW per hour, so at least another tenth of our energy and probably more can be produced from Mayo.  We are talking about between one quarter and one fifth of our requirement coming from those two sources alone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A building on Fitzwilliam Square houses a company called OpenHydro.  It is the most advanced tidal energy company in the world.  Wave energy is from waves going up and down.  Tidal energy is from the tide going in and out.  They are different.  The only example of tidal energy in Ireland is in Strangford Lough, outside this jurisdiction.  Strangford Lough has a current of approximately four or five knots, approximately 2.5 m per second, and one needs something like that.  One can get that in Bulls Mouth in Achill, along by Kilcredaun Point lighthouse in the Shannon Estuary and up closer to Limerick, the Blasket Sound, places on the east coast where the tide runs down the Irish Sea near Arklow Bank and such places, off Galway and other places.  It is not huge but it exists.</P>
        <P>The company doing that is already connecting to the French grid.  It has the contract to do the same in Washington State and Canada and is the only company that has connected a tidal electricity generator to the grid in the Orkneys, which is the most advanced place for tidal wave energy in Great Britain.  An Irish company is doing this.  Wave energy is like a long crocodile.  Tidal energy is called open energy.  It is silent and invisible.  Not even the most difficult An Taisce member can object to this.  It is far underwater, unseen, invisible and poses no danger to navigation.  The reason it is called open is that it is open in the middle so seals, dolphins and fish can go through without being damaged.  All these possibilities for production exist for us and we are not availing of them.  I know the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this and he knows mine.  We have discussed them before.  He should make this the priority.  Let us take Senator Quinn&rsquo;s points and move it on.</P>
        <P>I will not have time to discuss storage, but the electric car is an extraordinary advance for us because electric cars are recharged at night while the windmills at Bellacorrick will be flying <Col N="273"/>and we will be producing energy that no one will want to buy.  In Ireland we have no way to store energy.  We will have interconnectors to Europe but one still cannot sell it during off-peak times.  The only storage we have in Ireland is Turlough Hill where we pump water up during the off-peak hours and drop it down during the peak hours.  We get only 80% efficiency from that and there are many more efficient ways of doing it.</P>
        <P>I have probably only reached my first paragraph but I can see the Cathaoirleach indicating I must conclude.  Senator Quinn raised the importance of this to the climate and the fact there is a green county.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s county can lead the world on aspects of wave energy, Ireland can lead the world on aspects of tidal energy and we can sell wind power into Europe.  I am not making this up.  The Minister of State and I know this.  We have examined the figures and put our fingers in the wound, as it were.  It can be done.  The renewable power stations are not completely efficient yet but they are all generating.  We have examined the various ways it can be done and I ask that the Government prioritise this to create jobs.  What the ESB announced recently with the extra thousands of jobs is an example of what can be done in this area.  I apologise for going over time.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I commend the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion and I welcome the motion.  Senators Quinn and O&rsquo;Toole have done an excellent job by introducing this motion to the House.  I welcome the Minister of State  to the House.  I am very enthused about the possibilities for new energy sources in this country.  There is a company called Natural Energy Ireland which has substantial money behind it.  It has a plan and a design to provide natural energy in this country that we could export.  It is very important for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to know about this company.  I intend to have an all-party meeting with the company in the audio-visual room in the near future because it is a most interesting company.  It seeks to build three major centres along the west coast.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, that is where the big energy supply is.  The company has estimated that our wealth in energy is equivalent to Saudi Arabia.  We could be exporters of energy to the tune of &euro;68 billion.  These people have done the figures.  Obviously, they would like to become involved in supplying energy to this country and this can be done in different ways.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>As Senators will know, our big problem will be planning and there are all sorts of objections in planning issues.  We need to devise a planning system for our energy needs.  Somebody, somewhere, will object, whether in counties Kerry, Cork, Limerick or in the west.  It happened in Dublin when people from County Kerry objected to the M50.  How stupid is that?  We must amend the planning situation.  Local authorities should be able to provide a permit system whereby planning could be granted for energy projects.  This is in the interests of the nation.  It is as simple as that.  We do not want our energy projects held up for five or ten years.  We see what is going on at present in the west.  We cannot tolerate this.  It is no longer acceptable because the situation is too serious.  We are 98% dependent on outside energy and we cannot continue like that.</P>
        <P>We all know wind energy is in very good supply along the west coast but the wind does not blow all the time.  This company has devised a seaside development system of storing that energy in which an area would be flooded by canals.  When the wind blows this would work according to the Turlough Hill project design in which the wind pushes the water up to a higher table, thereby storing the energy.  When the time is right the energy can be released back into the grid.</P>
        <P>The people involved believe three major projects would supply the entire country with energy.  This figure refers to gigawatts, not megawatts.  It is a gigantic development.  I shall invite the persons concerned to the House to talk to all parties because we should all put our heads together on this.  It is a very important project and if we do not take it on board we will not get out of our current situation.  We are the dearest country in Europe for energy.  That makes us the dearest country for the setting up of industry because we must charge too much for the present supply.</P>
        <P>It is important to provide some figures concerning this project.  Our present system costs us &euro;30 billion to bring a ten-year supply into this country.  We could build three projects of this kind, paying &euro;2.5 billion for the water development and &euro;1.1 million for each generator.  That will give some idea of the cost.  One such development could supply 7,000 MW which shows what a project of this nature could do for the country in terms of selling back into the grid.  We must design our system now.  There is discussion of the new grid being built in Tarbert which is very welcome but it must be designed to fit into a system such as this.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Quinn for tabling this motion.  However, with power of this kind we do not need nuclear power.  We could provide supply with the natural energy we have.  We must consider that this country is known all over the world as the green country, and that is how our agricultural exports are known.  It would be a shame not to keep using as much natural energy as we have in this country.  Solar energy is another technology.  It is in its infancy now but will be a considerable power in the next two to three years.  There are advances already whereby one can run central heating from solar energy.</P>
        <P>I am excited by the new approach in this country towards energy and I welcome the fact that Senator Quinn mentioned nuclear power.  If we did not have a better system we would have to consider that option.  However, we have a system in place and people are working on developing others.  I intend to invite such people to the House to talk to Senators about their work.  It would be very interesting and I hope this will happen in the coming weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, to the House and also the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, who has left.  Deputy Calleary sat with me on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and I wish him well in his Ministry.  New Ministers might bring new ideas to Government and ideas and new vision are needed now.</P><Col N="275"/>
        <P>I compliment Senator Feargal Quinn and the Independent Senators on bringing this motion before the House.  This issue should be high on our agenda because of its significance for our country&rsquo;s future and the development of our economy in terms of energy security.  Ireland is essentially a very small island that is overly dependent on fossil fuels across many sectors of the economy.  I am disappointed by the Government amendment to the motion because it merely restates and reaffirms our dependence on fossil fuels.  There is nothing new in the amendment except that the Government acknowledges it will support a range of renewable energy technologies.  It does not offer any specifics or ideas concerning how it will do this nor did I hear any such discussed in the debate since it commenced.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports the general thrust of this motion.  The party recently published a policy document, Rebuilding Ireland, which gives specific focus to building renewable energy infrastructure that would secure the future of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements and at the same time stimulate our economy and create thousands of jobs.  In times of crisis, when financial markets fail and private investors become risk-averse, the State must lead the way, confident in the long-term direction for the country in a changing world.  The State cannot abdicate its responsibility to its citizens in the hope that the global financial community will rescue us.  That seems to be the message we are getting from the Government but we need more action.</P>
        <P>In the past we have seen how Scandinavian countries exploited the potential they had.  They were the first to take wind technology on board and produced an entire industry around it.  In Ireland we should be taking similar action.  We are surrounded by renewable resources, whether wind or water.  As an island, we have these resources available and they should be exploited to their full potential.</P>
        <P>The previous waves of Irish industrial innovation and expansion were often stimulated by economic crises and involved a visionary response from the State and the public, for example, the establishment of the ESB in 1927 and the Shannon scheme at Ardnacrusha in 1929.  Anyone who reads history books will know there was resistance to that scheme at the time and we all know from whence that resistance came.  However, it proved to be a very successful scheme.  The State became involved with the German firm, Siemens, and produced one of the biggest infrastructure projects of its kind at the time.  It still stands the test of time and has generated thousands of megawatts over the years, providing considerable infrastructure to the country.</P>
        <P>That is why Fine Gael now proposes &euro;11 billion in new investments in key technologies and network infrastructure for the period 2010 to 2013.  This is needed to reposition Ireland as the most competitive and sustainable economy in Europe within the coming decade.  Examples of the types of investments that can be delivered include next-generation broadband  &mdash; often discussed in this House &mdash; and more electricity storage infrastructure, including pump storage stations similar to those at Turlough Hill.  That again was an ESB innovation and has contributed significantly to our economy.  The new charging and electricity grid infrastructure needed to introduce electric cars provided by domestic renewable energy is another area for development as well as more research of the commercialisation of clean bio and ocean hydro related energy to make Ireland a leading player in these emerging sectors.</P>
        <P>I have an open mind on nuclear power.  It needs to be investigated further and more widely debated.  Many have called for a serious examination of the pros and cons of developing nuclear energy in Ireland.  This is an area at which perhaps the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security should look because there could be cross-party engagement on this issue.  All of the issues could be put on the table, experts asked to come to the committee to discuss all sides of the question and eventually a report compiled.  I believe the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, alluded to that on the public record and <Col N="276"/>had no problem with the whole area of nuclear energy being debated.  This possibly could be a good thing.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a very small country and we have enormous natural resources, as Senator Butler indicated.  I wonder whether we need nuclear power stations as a small country with considerable natural resources available.  Interconnectors are being developed such as the UK-Ireland one that is in the pipeline at the moment.  There should be further interconnectors, perhaps to mainland Europe, because that would give us much more security, ensure our energy reserves for the future and mean we were no longer isolated as we are at present.  When those areas are properly thought through and developed, I believe there may not be a need for nuclear power stations in this country.  However, that needs to be worked through and it is something the Government should be working on at the moment.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler referred to areas in planning that could help renewables.  I must give credit to Waterford County Council which has developed under its county development plan a programme for renewables and wind power.  It has identified areas in the county in which it believes it is acceptable to develop such wind plans.  That is a welcome development that possibly might be replicated in all local authorities.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, under the chairmanship of Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, has already drafted legislation called the offshore renewable energy development Bill 2009.  Experts from the industry have contributed to the committee and this is why it has, on a cross-party basis, produced this Bill, the purpose of which is to provide a simplified transparent and fast-track planning and development framework for offshore renewable technologies in an environmentally sustainable manner while respecting the acquired rights of current lessees and all that.  Some &euro;16 billion is available in potential investment in renewables and other energy generating projects awaiting approval from the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>
        <P>Many of those who want to invest in this area and who contributed to the joint committee&rsquo;s proceedings highlighted the barriers that exist within our present planning structures and the bureaucracy of Departments.  For example, to achieve an offshore licence can take years.  The application will be passed from Billy to Jack, from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and on to the Department with responsibility for the marine.  No one really knows who is responsible for issuing these licences and this process is holding up major infrastructural developments.</P>
        <P>The joint committee has proposed this Bill in the hope that the Government will debate and enact it, even with amendments, to which I am sure its members are quite open.  That is one area which should be looked at and streamlined to make it easier.  That would attract investment in its own right.</P>
        <P>There are interesting areas, too, such as micro-systems.  I want to acknowledge what I believe to be a Green Party initiative, whereby domestic wind power micro-generators can now be installed without prior planning permission.  That is a positive move because it makes it easier for people to put in micro-systems and not have to be caught up in bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>I believe the use of renewables should be the norm rather than the exception.  Unfortunately, for the moment it is really just for the pioneers and those privileged enough to afford them.  Renewable energy needs to be more accessible to the wider public, whether in business or domestic situations.  More people will buy into that and in its own right it will attract more investment.</P>
        <P>We can all pay lip service to renewable energy.  The Government now needs to be seen to act on what it has been saying.  It needs to help change the mindset in this country, make the <Col N="277"/>infrastructure more easily available and make the systems more flexible to allow that.  We need to respond to allow that potential to be fully exploited.  Again, I welcome the discussion as an important start to a rolling debate on energy security.  Ireland is a small country but if we have the vision and put the right mechanisms in place, we can provide our own energy for the future with the assistance, obviously, of interconnectors to mainland Europe and the UK.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion tabled by the Independent Members of the House is very valuable.  It gives an opportunity for a very broad-ranging debate.  Much of its content is supportive of work that is already being done.  It is necessary to appreciate the work that needs to be done from this point onwards to realise the potential which I believe everyone in this House recognises exists.  I note that from Senator Coffey&rsquo;s contribution.  There are aspects to the motion I could quibble over, but that said I will not deny the need for an ongoing debate, especially regarding the last clause of the motion.  I cannot see myself ever being in a position to agree with what is being proposed in that element, but the Minister has gone on record in stating that there is a need for such a debate.  He would welcome such a discussion and energetically engage in it.</P>
        <P>Ireland is in a very unusual situation as we deal with difficult economic times.  However, given the state of technology and the very real needs we have in terms of energy and our commitments towards the planet in terms of being environmentally responsible citizens, we also have enormous opportunities.  This is something I believe many Members of the House already recognise.  I recall one of our first lessons in t&iacute;reola&iacute;ocht in secondary school, in the standard textbook of the time, that the first paragraph said Ireland was a country without natural resources.  Natural resources were always taken to be oil, gas or coal.  It is particularly ironic that at this stage of our economic history in particular, we are seen to be a country awash with natural resources which we have chosen for a number of policy reasons not to exploit fully.</P>
        <P>Now, however, we must give active consideration to putting the means and the infrastructure in place towards utilising these natural resources.  Ireland is one of the most energy-dependent countries in the world in terms of fossil fuels.  Because we lack what was referred to in the past as natural resources, we import much of the energy we need.  We have the capacity through wind alone to produce enough energy to meet our current and even our future needs 30 times over.  This could be an energy exporting country.  The moves that have been made in terms of connecting Ireland into the development of a nascent European super-grid, with the current interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland and the approval of the interconnector between the east coast of Ireland and Wales, and even the possible development in the near future of an interconnector between the south of Ireland and France, give us the means to secure our energy needs into the future and to develop our capacity to become an exporter of energy.</P>
        <P>I am confident we can do this.  Already there is enthusiasm among many industry practitioners about what is possible and what needs to be done to make real that possibility.  I have cited the example of a number of companies operating in this area and it is fair that the House, through its record, should record what is being done in that regard.  Take, for example, the work being done by Ocean Energy, a Cork-based company which is doing research into wave energy in Galway involving the development of large metal turbines which would bob up and down in the sea.  It has a three quarter-size model already and the idea is to develop a nest of perhaps up to 70 full-sized models producing the requirement in one such wave farm alone equivalent to what we have as the current target for wave energy.</P>
        <P>Then there is the work of OpenHydro, a company based in County Louth, which is now a world leader in the development of wave energy in terms of attaching turbines on the seabed with reversing rotating blades changing every six hours and a potential source of 24 hours of <Col N="278"/>energy.  The prototype for its research is being done off the coast of Scotland, yet it is employing 30 people here, engaging in engineering work and providing a potential that could realise a great deal of economic hope and opportunity for Ireland in the future.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak briefly on the final part of the motion because I believe it is the intent of the Independent Senators to have a more open and honest debate on such an issue.  On the one hand, we have the question of cold fusion.  I am glad to state that I am not a nuclear physicist but I am led to believe that, according to the scientific debate, this is a distant and perhaps unattainable dream.  However, it if proves to be possible, we can examine how it would provide an alternative to current nuclear energy technology.</P>
        <P>We had a farce some years ago when two scientists claimed to have come up with an answer, but it was shown to be one of the biggest shams in scientific history.  Since some people are seeking such an alternative, others are open to seeing that happen.  However, the difficulty with current nuclear technology is that it is very expensive.  The lead-in time for any nuclear installation can take up to 20 years and the economic cost of that is phenomenal.  It would be far better to invest that capital in renewable energy which gives a better return for one&rsquo;s buck.</P>
        <P>The other aspect is that, even 50 or 60 years after its initial development as an energy source, nuclear technology is still very dangerous.  We recently celebrated &mdash; if that is the right word &mdash; the 23rd anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.  The world is fortunate not to have had a full-blown nuclear accident at many of the plants around the place.  For instance, nuclear installations in eastern Europe, including those in Bulgaria and Romania &mdash; the old Magnox installations &mdash; are accidents waiting to happen.  Many of them are still in use.  Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in EURATOM, which I am not happy about at the best of times, should be working towards decommissioning many of these plants rather than developing nuclear technology.</P>
        <P>The ultimate problem of nuclear power is that the waste that comes about as a result of the process remains radioactive for thousands of years.  Therefore, in terms of meeting our immediate energy needs, we are asking future generations to live with an unacceptable and hazardous risk that will outlive us and them as well as putting the planet at risk.  If it is possible to overcome these problems and if nuclear energy can be developed through technological advances and other means, then it should be kept on the table and there should be an open and honest debate about it.  However, I do not feel now is the time or that it is likely in the near future.</P>

Mar sin, tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis an Seanad&oacute;ir.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn must be commended for raising this highly relevant issue.  It is vital we continue to work towards having a safe and sustainable low-carbon economy.  To put this matter in context, we have an obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 through a combined approach of using 20% renewable energies by 2020 and increasing energy efficiency by 20% in time for 2020.  This is the so-called 20-20-20 package.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed to achieving by 2020 a 20% reduction in energy demand across the whole of the economy through energy efficiency measures.  Recognising that the Government must lead by example, it is right that we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P>The 2007 White Paper on energy set a target of 33% for electricity consumption from renewable resources by 2020, but the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has revised Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy target upwards in this year&rsquo;s carbon budget.  The new target is 40% of electricity consumption from renewable generation by 2020.</P>
        <P>By way of the Irish energy research programmes, &euro;12.675 million will be established for energy research, which includes a &euro;7 million allocation for ocean energy research programmes.  Hopefully this will see progress on the establishment of a grid-connected test facility off the coast of Mayo.  It will also fund grant assistance under the ocean energy prototype fund, among other measures.</P>
        <P>In the long-term, we have reason to be even more optimistic.  We should aim for Ireland to become a technology leader in wave-tide energy.  Why not?  Just as Denmark led the way in wind power, Ireland could become a leader in this new technology, thus creating an industry in supplying the rest of the world.</P>
        <P>The achievement of our renewable energy targets will require an investment in infrastructure.  EirGrid calculates that a &euro;4 billion investment is needed in the period up to 2025.  We must not underestimate the planning difficulties in terms of construction of wind farms and the transport of energy from west to east.  Sites designated under the habitats and birds directives are subject to fairly strict protection under EU law.  If these realities are not taken into account early in policy and project development, then problems can and will emerge.</P>
        <P>We need better regulation to enable new renewable electricity producers to gain access to the grid.  We also need a change in attitude on the part of all of us to accept that wind turbines and wave energy solutions will have a visual impact on our landscape and coasts.  However, provided this is managed properly, it is preferable to the legacy of increased climate damage and the exhaustion of all fossil fuel resources, which we will otherwise pass on to our grandchildren.</P>
        <P>Wind energy is crucial both as a short and medium-term priority.  Studies have indicated that onshore and offshore wind turbines can deliver at least 40% of our energy requirements, which currently stand at roughly 5,000 MW of electricity.</P>
        <P>The State already has about 800 MW of power from wind turbines, which will substantially increase if applications by wind-park developers are successful.  The Government will likely surpass its goal of having 1,200 MW of wind power by 2010.  The goal is to get 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity from renewable sources by 2020.</P>
        <P>We are in a unique position when it comes to wind energy potential.  The average capacity factory for onshore wind turbines &mdash; the measure of how much time the turbine is cranking out power &mdash; is 25% in Europe.  In Ireland it is 35%.  It is important to remember also that it costs less to generate power from wind than from gas.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Dublin has joined the Covenant of Mayors, an initiative in EU cities to go beyond the EU targets of 20-20-20 by 2020.  Local authorities have a key role in mitigating climate change.  More than half of greenhouse gas emissions are created in and by cities.  Some 80% of the population lives and works in cities where up to 80% of energy is consumed.  Local authorities, being the closest administrations to citizens, are ideally positioned to understand these concerns.  Moreover, they can address challenges in a comprehensive way, thus facilitating the conciliation between public and private interests.  They can also facilitate the integration of sustainable energy into overall local development goals, be it through the development of alternative energy, more efficient energy use, or changes in behaviour.</P><Col N="280"/>
        <P>Local governments must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies and must be recognised and supported in their efforts.  The Covenant of Mayors is an ambitious initiative of the European Commission that gives the lead to Europe&rsquo;s pioneering cities to mitigate climate change through the implementation of intelligent, local and sustainable energy policies.  These policies create stable local jobs and increase citizens&rsquo; quality of life as well as addressing crucial social issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to conclude with a word on nuclear fission energy.  I realise this is the hot-button topic in any debate of this kind and I have noted the amendment proposed by my Fine Gael colleagues.  It has been a success in France, where about 80% of energy is nuclear sourced.  We must acknowledge that nuclear energy is capable of stimulating job growth in local communities.  Nuclear energy is also a baseload energy, that is, a source of constantly generated energy, which is an important supplement to other forms of renewable energy that tend to fluctuate more in output.</P>
        <P>Even though it has a good safety track record in developed countries, we must be very careful in our deliberations on this particular energy source as the potential for catastrophic harm is so great.  Safety is not the only issue regarding nuclear energy.  Approved nuclear units produce 1.2 gigawatts of energy, far in advance of what Ireland needs.  Perhaps we could develop greater energy interconnection with the UK.  We could develop a trade in wind and nuclear energy which would be to the mutual benefit to both parties.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Quinn again for highlighting this vital issue of energy independence and the related issue renewable energy.  If we manage renewable energy effectively now, we will greatly enhance the prospects of Ireland becoming a cleaner and more economically stable environment in which our children and grandchildren may flourish.  If, however, we fail to manage renewable energy effectively or waste time before giving it the requisite attention, the environmental and economic consequences will be dire.

In &eacute;ineacht le Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; eile, ba mhaith liom an Seanad&oacute;ir Quinn a mholadh as ucht an r&uacute;n seo a chur ar an gcl&aacute;r.

T&aacute; dualgas orainn an &aacute;bhar f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute; go minic.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution in proposing the motion but remain more sympathetic to the Government and Fine Gael Party amendments for reasons I will explain.  The Senator made an interesting point about Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported energy, noting that renewable energy accounts for only 2% of energy consumption, whereas the target is<?oasys _jy ?>20%.  Unfortunately, there is no alternative to the use of fossil fuels in transport.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn and I hold diverging views on the issue of nuclear power.  I was interested to note his reference to a shift taking place among certain scientists who previously opposed nuclear power but are coming to regard the need to move towards nuclear power as the lesser of two evils.  Their changing position owes much to the challenges to the environment arising from climate change since the middle of the previous century.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I was first elected a county councillor in Wexford in 1979 Government policy on energy was led by Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s father, Mr. Des O&rsquo;Malley, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At that time, county councillors were placed under considerable pressure to support the Minister&rsquo;s policy of introducing nuclear power.  I and another Wexford county councillor were very reluctant to do so given the highly controversial proposal to build a nuclear power plant at Carnsore.</P><Col N="281"/>
        <P>Having examined the issue I could clearly see the economic justification for nuclear power being made at the time.  However, the subsequent downturn resulted in a change in Government priorities and it was no longer necessary to accelerate expansion of our energy generation capacity.  My opposition to nuclear power was based on the belief that there was insufficient justification for the generation of nuclear waste, which has a lifespan of thousands of years, to address a short-term economic need.  My view that this waste would have adverse environmental effects on future generations has been borne out by subsequent developments in the nuclear industry.  We have all heard and read about some of the horrific stories connected with the Sellafield nuclear plant, particularly the lack of transparency and secrecy surrounding some of the major accidents at that location, and other nuclear facilities elsewhere, including Chernobyl.</P>
        <P>It is generally recognised that substantial amounts of nuclear waste are buried in locations at the bottom of the sea which have probably not even be marked and will continue to pose a major threat to the environment for thousands of years.  While I do not have scientific evidence to support this view, I have no doubt that at the root of many cancers lies the irresponsible manner in which nuclear waste has been disposed of.  For these reasons, I remain a strong opponent of the nuclear industry.</P>
        <P>I fully support efforts to move towards a green agenda or, as Senator Butler described it, the generation of natural energy.  A number of Irish energy companies are leading the field in this area having established operations in wind where we have been most successful.</P>
        <P>Irish energy policy has three main goals, namely, to maintain secure energy supplies, support economic growth and competitiveness &mdash; a highly appropriate objective in current circumstances &mdash; and ensure energy supply and use is environmentally sustainable.  We have made significant progress on some of these goals.  In 2006-07, for example, gas accounted for 25% of our primary energy demand.  Currently, 96% of gas used in Ireland is imported from Britain via interconnectors.</P>
        <P>It is important to note, when considering the controversy surrounding the Corrib gas field, that the field will meet 60% of our annual gas demand for around five years from when it enters production until it starts to decline.  It is essential, therefore, to bring this gas ashore as soon as possible and support the exploration industry in trying to find other gas and oil fields which will help secure energy independence and provide the sustainability we require.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also invested heavily in gas storage on an all-island basis.  Investment in the high pressure transmission network by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is substantial.  In addition to the Mayo gas pipeline, a North-South pipeline is under development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people in County Wexford were apprehensive when the ESB decided to dispose of its two generating stations at Tarbert and Great Island, which is close to where I live.  Both facilities have been acquired by Endesa, a Spanish company, which will operate them as gas fired plants.  This is a positive development which will result in much-needed competition.  Regulation should be reviewed to ensure its primary objective is to give consumers a better deal.  I am far from convinced that the Commissioner for Energy Regulation considers competition an overriding priority.</P>
        <P>In the area of electricity, substantial investment is being made in the North-South and east-west interconnectors, both of which should be operating by 2012.  We have also decided to introduce a smart metering programme.  I understand 21,000 ESB customers will have a smart meter installed in the coming months to enable them to control and reduce their electricity bills.</P>
        <P>Ireland is moving in the right direction.  Electricity generated by wind has increased from 5.2% of overall electricity production in 2004 to 12% currently.  While I support the use of electric cars, unfortunately there does not appear to by any corresponding innovation in the heavy goods vehicle area, to facilitate a move away from oil, the fuel of the transport industry.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>We are moving in the right direction regarding electricity and renewable energy is the way to go.  Wind, solar and tidal wave power were mentioned.  Other than wind, the other technologies still require significant development before they will be efficiently operated.  We are moving in the right direction.  It is important we remain focused on it because not only is oil contributing to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> and climate change and having an adverse impact, it is also a finite resource.  Depending on who one believes there is a quite a possibility we will not have oil past the second half of this century.  Economists are predicting when the current downturn starts to go on the incline, the price of oil will go in the very same direction and will become very expensive.  There is much motivation for us to move in the direction of renewable energy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt we have a very unusual future ahead of us.  It is difficult to say what direction it is taking.  We are looking at wind and wave power as alternatives to using gas and oil.  They involve their own inherent costs which are quite significant, no matter how much we may say they are sustainable or easier on the environment than other forms of energy supply such as gas and oil.  One must ask if perhaps we should try to change our approach a little more than just looking at alternatives to gas and oil and look at fuel efficiency, not just the conservation issues the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is well-known for regarding housing stock, but across the board.</P>
        <P>For instance, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean there are the United States of America and Europe.  What makes European cars so much more fuel efficient than American cars?  If one is in America one hardly ever sees a family car powered by diesel and the efficiency of its cars overall is abysmal, whereas in Europe we have been pushing for years to make our cars more fuel efficient and get the maximum amount of milage out of them.  This is because we use taxes to keep the cost of fuel up, as opposed to America where petrol is extremely cheap.  It is only in the last number of years the United States is changing its approach and trying to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles on its highways.</P>
        <P>We should perhaps look at focusing on and putting all our efforts into efficiency.  For instance, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in terms of making savings, what happens the hundreds of reports Members receive from the Department of Transport, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  I presume they go for recycling or go in the bin.  The majority of Members, unless they concern an area one has a particular interest in, do not even read them.</P>
        <P>The same goes for all the information one gets in this House.  Far too much of it is printed and delivered into our letter boxes and is not relevant.  If we were to talk about efficiencies we should start with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  An bord snip is looking at us, but its idea of efficiency is to get rid of us completely, which may not be necessary.  There are ways of improving efficiency across the public service and Civil Service.  Some private companies are better at this.  There is no way a private organisation would turn out the amount of reports and paper trails on different issues which crop up on a daily basis at the same level as the public service and Civil Service.</P>
        <P>The HSE threw out a significant amount of its headed paper simply because it changed its title.  We see a waste of resources across the public service and Civil Service, such as inefficient buildings we constructed in the last number of years which should not have been allowed to happen.  We need to look at how we are using energy across the public service and Civil Service.  I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is interested in this and is looking at conserving energy in the housing stock of the ordinary man and woman, but we could be a little more pushy regard<Col N="283"/>ing making savings in what we spend in the private and public sector and we should have an emphasis on that.</P>
        <P>Energy, such as that which comes from gas and oil, is a finite resource and will eventually run out, but there is not much point in expending millions of euro in looking for alternatives and we will not get the same efficiency out of energy produced from wind and wave power.  Each kilowatt hour produced by wind and wave is expensive and will always remain so.  It will be difficult to drive the technology to the point where we can push the price per kilowatt hour down simply because the wear and tear, especially of wave power, is quite extreme.  Wind power has a certain amount of input costs we should keep in mind.</P>
        <P>It is nice to have the luxury of saying we are against nuclear power because as long as we have the east-west and North-South connectors we can use all the nuclear power we want from the UK so we do not have to worry about having to build nuclear power plants on our own little island.  However, we will be using nuclear power from the British mainland once those connectors are up and running and when we need to get energy from the UK.  It is nice to have that luxury.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking at future energy needs, we should focus on conservation because it is the most significant issue.  We are paying for energy costs all the time.  If one looks across the economy, costs for many things are going down, but one area in which we do not see costs reducing is in services provided by Government.  Anybody who receives a water charges or rates bill from the local authorities or applies for a driving licence or any service from local and public authorities and Government services is seeing costs going up.  If one is looking at a new era of austerity, we should focus more on costs and I would like to hear the response of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on what are crucial issues for our country, namely, where we get our energy supplies from, how we can maintain security of supply, be competitive and meet our climate change targets.  Although it may have moved down the agenda in some peoples&rsquo; minds in the last six months or so, given the economic crisis which has developed and oil prices having come down from $150 to some $50 per barrel, the reality is the energy issue remains the greatest challenge we face and is also an opportunity we can rise to.</P>
        <P>The challenge in meeting our climate change targets, which we have agreed as mandatory targets in the European Union, should not be underestimated, particularly if one considers we will have to go beyond the European Union targets of a 20% to 30% reduction.  In my lifetime, I see us making a reduction in our emissions in the order of 80% or more.  That is the scale of the challenge.  In an area where 60% of climate change emissions come from the energy area we must provide the solution in energy more than anywhere else.</P>
        <P>The imperative to do that is added to by the fact we are clearly facing a peak in global oil production.  The figure today is that roughly 80 million barrels of oil are being produced.  The analysis being done by the International Energy Agency, which was previously very cautious on the issue of a peak in global oil production, could not be more alarming.  There is no clear path to where the world could continue to see a growth in production in oil beyond whatever the final peak figure is, but we clearly have to start preparing now for not just an expansion but a contraction in the availability of the light sweet crudes which have powered the earth and the growing economy for the last 100 years.</P>
        <P>When one looks at the use of oil in our food production, transport system and in everyday materials made from oil-based plastics, it is an immense challenge unlike any other we have faced in terms of the scale of change which will occur.  That is why I am pleased to come to <Col N="284"/>this Chamber to discuss what can be done to manage this contraction.  I am confident we can do so successfully and, moreover, that it can offer us an opportunity.  I see a path through this change which can deliver for our country not only a secure supply and our contribution to the reduction of climate change emissions but also a competitive economy.  There will be a twin-track advancement of our energy policy in the development of our own renewable energy resources and in the promotion of energy efficiency as the only long-term secure hedge from rising international fossil fuel prices.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator Twomey that the development of ocean energy will be uneconomic.  From our current vantage point, it is a frontier technology.  However, as it develops and becomes commercialised, I am confident it will become economic.  The British Government is developing some 33 gigawatts of ocean energy in the next ten years, which is a short timeframe in energy terms.  We have a far greater resource, with much stronger winds and much more powerful waves.  When that technology is developed &mdash; and we should engage in that development so that the jobs it creates are here &mdash; we will have an economic resource that will power our country and also earn us revenue through its exportation to the rest of Europe.</P>
        <P>One can look at energy in different ways.  I will restrict my comments to the three main usage areas, namely, for electricity production, heat production and transport, and will outline some of the initiatives we are taking and the opportunities that present.  In regard to electricity production, the path on which we are set is one that is properly planned.  We have undertaken a detailed all-island grid study to determine how our grid can be developed to tap into renewable resources such as wind power.  Detailed analysis has been done by leading international experts who agree that even in the next ten years, it will be possible to obtain up to 40% of our electricity supply from wind.</P>
        <P>Most of that will come from onshore wind.  We have already built 1,000 MW of wind power and I expect to quadruple that in the next ten years to 4,000 MW.  This is already subsidising our electricity system and bringing down electricity prices.  Why would we not continue that process?  After that, we must look to develop offshore wind power.  In the interim, we might get something like 2,000 MW of offshore wind or offshore wave and tidal power.  After that, when the technology is no longer frontier but mainstream, we will have the opportunity to expand on a greater scale by tapping into our massive ocean resources.  The future will involve powering this country by clean electricity which can be used in a range of other areas.  The ocean energy unit in Sustainable Energy Ireland, in conjunction with my Department, is tasked with planning for the delivery of that future today.</P>
        <P>These developments are essential because the reality is that we are excessively dependent on gas for our electricity production.  Currently, some 80% of that gas is coming from the North Sea.  However, the latter has already gone through its own peak, as recently as seven or eight years ago, in oil and gas production.  In the aftermath of that peak, supply is declining by 7% to 8% per annum, yet we are obtaining 80% of our gas from that source.  Like the United Kingdom, we face a dramatic change in our energy future in terms of our reliance on gas.  We will increasingly rely on Norwegian gas, after which we will have to go further and further afield, to Algeria, Russia and so on.  These sources of supply are not secure and cannot be depended upon.  The cause of our increased electricity prices is this dependence on gas.  We must move away from that dependence.</P>
        <P>To achieve the objective of cheaper and cleaner local energy from wind and ocean, we must build our grid out to the west, north west and south west of this country.  That is not very popular and not particularly easy to do, but it must be done.  Otherwise, we will not be in a position to tap into that alternative supply and will miss out on the greatest natural resource <Col N="285"/>opportunity this country has.  I ask Senators to take that into account when the issue of grid development arises.</P>
        <P>I have never shied away from a debate on the development of nuclear energy.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley will know that from our days together on the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I have consistently said there should be a debate without preconditions and preconceptions.  It is through such a debate that the reality of our situation will become clear, namely, that it is in wind and other renewable power supplies that we have the greatest economic advantage.  We are beginning to develop expertise in these areas, but we have no expertise in nuclear power generation.  Our grid is not well suited to nuclear energy.  The latter requires massive plants which would be heavily subsidised by the State.  It would require a much larger grid with a very large back-up facility, which would be uneconomic.</P>
        <P>Such realities will become apparent in any comprehensive debate on these issues, and the political imperative behind the development of renewables will become clear.  This is the case not only in this State but elsewhere.  While only one nuclear plant is currently being built in Europe, the equivalent of ten nuclear power plants is being built in wind power generation every year.  Everybody must wake up and see what is happening, where the money is going, what is being built and what is effective in energy terms.  The future is not nuclear but renewable and we have the best resources in the world.  Why in God&rsquo;s name are we constantly returning to scratch this itch?  Is it because it is a controversial issue and there is a perception that only political correctness is preventing us from addressing the nuclear energy issue?  That is not the case.  The reality is that it is sensible and sane energy policy to switch to renewables.  In addition, the introduction of smart meters will ensure a network that provides better and more efficient use of the electricity we generate.</P>
        <P>We have more difficulty in switching away from the use of fossils in the production of heat.  This challenge is often underestimated because it is not as sexy.  People will talk all night about nuclear power plants but not about the combined heat and power boilers that may be used to heat buildings.  It is quite warm in the Chamber today.  Far more energy is being used to heat it than is required for lighting or for the sound system.  We are often blind to the cause of greatest energy usage because we do not see it.  However, it counts for a large part of our emissions.</P>
        <P>Adding to the difficulties of effecting change in this area is the infrastructure that has been built up over 100 years.  To switch from gas and oil boilers to geothermal, heat pump, wood-fired, solar-fired and other alternative heating systems is a disruptive technological initiative that requires Government leadership.  That is what we are trying to do in terms of the insulation and the greener home schemes we are supporting.  These initiatives are not intended to be there forever but rather to kick-start an alternative supply system that does not rely on imported fossil fuels.  We will extend that further with the launch in the coming days of the national energy efficiency action plan.  This looks to the State to take a lead by going beyond the European Union target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency to seek an improvement of 33% in the next ten years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To achieve this objective will require the retrofitting of public buildings.  There are 3,000 buildings in public use which are larger than 1,000 sq. m.  These are the buildings we should target by looking at innovative ways of heating them such as using energy service companies to deliver the reductions in heat usage via new technologies.  The capital for that can be repaid from the savings that will be garnered in the next five to ten years.  Under this model, capital can be raised without an adverse effect on the Exchequer&rsquo;s balance sheet.  We can simultaneously make savings for the State and deliver a new economic stimulus.  The installation <Col N="286"/>schemes we have already introduced will provide some 4,000 additional jobs.  However, that is only the beginning.  The ESB has gone further by predicting the creation of 6,000 jobs under various schemes on which it is working, such as smart metering, electric vehicles and so on.  Why stop there?  I want to go further in our use of energy in public buildings so that we can create a new economy through energy efficiency.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that this must be a limited discussion.  I will be pleased to return to discuss any one issue at a later date.  In regard to transport, the greatest risk in terms of a peak in global oil production relates to the transport sector because it is the most difficult area in which to seek alternative power solutions.  The combustion engine has been honed to perfection in the past 100 years in terms of energy efficiency and placement within a vehicle body.  However, we must now look for something different because that light, sweet crude oil which has powered those cars and trucks for the past 100 years will not be as readily available in the coming decades.</P>
        <P>One of the main alternatives is in the development of electric vehicles and we are well placed as a country to start switching to that technology.  It suits us.  Our island is not that large.  We do not have our own oil resources.  We have huge variable renewable power supplies that can be stored in many ways in a battery system in a car fleet.  In the middle of the night, when there is no use for wind power, we can power up our cars much more cheaply than at the local petrol station.   That is why we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Renault-Nissan and the ESB to deliver those technologies here.  We are not stopping with those companies.  We are open to business with any company which has intent in this area.  We want to be one of the leading countries in developing these possibilities and by dint of those agreements we have signalled internationally that we are.</P>
        <P>People see this as futuristic, slightly marginal or not the main deal.  It is.  The technology is developing and massive resources are being invested in it by motor companies across the world.  For us, it presents a huge potential to protect ourselves from the future peak in oil production.</P>
        <P>That is only the start.  We need to do a myriad of other things.  More than anything else, we need to change our mindset.  We need a collective agreement that this is our mission and a task that we can achieve.  We need to wake up to the fact that others are doing it.  The American Administration is determinedly going in this direction.  We should both lead and follow.  From this area there will be jobs.  It will not be easy, it will take time but it is achievable.  The only thing stopping us is lack of imagination and political will.  An alternative, 100% renewable, zero emissions future in energy is perfectly attainable for this country.  It is the best economic course and one we can achieve on the back of our own natural resources.  We should put all our efforts towards that task.  It gives us a real future which we can aim for and hand on to our children with pride.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have been called to speak immediately on coming into the House.  I am especially glad the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is here because I have some suggestions, questions and prods to deliver directly to him.  First, I welcome him to the House and say I am extremely glad a person of his capacity, commitment and political and ideological background is in his position.  It is fortunate the Green Party has this significant role at this juncture.</P>
        <P>I commend my good friend and colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, on tabling this very important motion, which is seconded by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I lent my name to it because I believe in most of it.  However, I have some reservations about the nuclear element although fission and fusion are relatively safe and are well down the list of recommendations.  Senator Quinn has been very courageous in this area.  He has, as I have, taken an interest in the area <Col N="287"/>of nuclear energy.  I cannot speak for Senator Quinn, but I had a long period of resistance to this idea.  I believe the Green Party in Ireland perhaps still has, although the Green Party in England appears to have changed its mind.</P>
        <P>I have not actually changed my mind.  I have simply prised it a little further open.  It is for that reason that Senator Quinn and I have a motion on this matter on the Order Paper.  It proposes: &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann requests the Government to establish as a matter of urgency an expert committee to examine in an impartial fashion the feasibility, benefits and potential hazards of nuclear energy generation.&rdquo;  That is the first step.  We must face this issue because of the pollutant nature of fossil fuel-based generating systems.  We must establish the facts.  It was following a meeting with two friends of mine who are involved in the nuclear area that I agreed to table that motion.  I am not quite as supportive as Senator Quinn.  I would not be gung ho for nuclear energy but to behave responsibly, we must establish the facts.</P>
        <P>A number of people, especially on the Opposition benches and in the Green component of the Government but most particularly my colleagues, Senators Bacik, O&rsquo;Toole and Quinn, have been pushing for the use of natural energy sources for a number of years.  There are, of course, problems.  The Minister will have seen a newspaper report in recent days of a very exciting development, launched in the presence of Ms Angela Merkel, where the difficulties of wind generation and the fluctuation of supply appear to have been solved by a capacity to store energy and bring it on stream when the wind drops, avoiding the sporadic pattern which is a major problem of wind generation and guaranteeing continuity of supply.  We can learn from this.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the virtues of the electric car.  I drove one outside this House about two weeks ago.  It was a Mitsubishi produced by Mr. Joe Clarke of Westbrook Motors in Parnell Street, Dublin 1 in the north inner city.  It was one of 11 cars which have been made, is valued at &euro;1 million and I was allowed to drive it.  It was a wonderful experience.  One simply turned the key, there was no noise, no exhaust, the drive was very smooth and there was good acceleration.  The technology probably needs to be tweaked because of the limited mileage the car can achieve but it is well on the way.  Today, I received a report by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security entitled Drive for Zero: Electric Vehicles are a Winning Proposition.</P>
        <P>I principally wish to direct my pleas to the Minister about wave energy.  We have a substantial natural resource, particularly on the Atlantic coast.  It is estimated we could eventually supply all the energy needs of the island of Ireland from that one source and perhaps export energy.  We have the natural ingredients.  We have the resource, the research community, the appropriate policy, the incentives &mdash; with a feed-in-tariff for wave energy of 22 cent per kilowatt hour &mdash; and the technology developers.  However, since the announcement of this Government strategy only &euro;500,000 has been invested by the Government.  That is not enough and it must be increased.  That amount was made available to UCC.  None of the developers themselves, who are the most exposed to financial uncertainty, received a single cent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has said he sees the emergence of a local wave energy industry as being akin to the establishment of the first portakabin by Intel in Leixlip.  If that is the case and there is job potential, should he not be supplying similar levels of support?  This is not happening.  It is all the more important because of the retention of intellectual property, profits and expertise in Ireland.  The European Commission quotes ten to 20 jobs per megawatt installed ocean energy capacity.  A national target of 500 MW should produce 10,000 jobs.  Wave energy is a very worthwhile investment.  I believe the Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place.  I hope he can use this debate and an independent contribution like mine to strengthen his hand at Cabinet and to ensure the Government makes this investment.</P><Col N="288"/>
        <P>Wavebob, the company in which I am interested, has a joint venture with Vattenfall, a Swedish company, to develop wave farms off the west coast of Ireland.  This is a clear vote of confidence by the international community, but they need further support.  In the United States under President Obama&rsquo;s stimulus package, $250 million will be made available to support ocean energy development.  What are we doing?  We are in danger of being caught if the Scottish authorities facilitate planning permissions and the US supplies the money.  We do not want to be outmanoeuvred by the Scottish, as we were in the whiskey trade.</P>
        <P>Matthew Simmons wrote <i>Twilight in the Desert</i>, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.  He was one of the first proponents of peak oil theory and called such energy sources the Holy Grail for the future of energy.  We are trying to grow a business.  At the moment the wave company to which I refer gets most of its support and finance from Sweden.  That must stop.  One of the directors of the company is a personal friend of mine and I put that on the table.  I have no personal investment in any of this.  I refer to someone I have known for many years and whom I respect, namely, Mr. William Dick.  Even with personal guarantees, these people cannot squeeze money out of the banks.</P>
        <P>Science Foundation Ireland awards hundreds of millions of euro for research and design but these people cannot get any of it because they work as a small, private industry.  Tax relief on research and design is meaningless in the case of this company.  SFI funds flow to third level institutions, but little goes to research.  The company to which I refer has a bunch of very bright people doing seriously advanced work.  All those involved are graduates, post-doctorate researchers and so on.  It has talent from throughout the world; some seven nationalities are represented.  It is relatively easy to get funding from Enterprise Ireland for collaborative research with a university.  The company has two leading scientists in training with funding totalling approximately &euro;700,000, but the universities have a different approach.  They take time and tend to publish commercially sensitive material.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister examine this?  The Minister should invest in wave energy, about which he spoke so prophetically.  When I use the term &ldquo;invest&rdquo;, I do not mean &euro;500 million, but substantially more than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  It is always reassuring and inspiring to hear him speak on this subject, which is the basis and stimulation of his political life.  No doubt he has a long-term interest in the area, a message which we receive very strongly when listening to him speak on the topic.  I refer to comments made by the Minister, especially the remarks on political will.  Anything can occur when political will is in place.  This is the reason we are especially fortunate to have Deputy Ryan in the Ministry.  He is certainly not wanting in political will.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  Senator Norris made reference to the development of ocean energy, an area in which we could improve.  It is fair enough for Senator Norris to urge for more money to be invested in it, but times are difficult.  In an ideal world more money would be made available.  However, we can try to ensure the legislative framework is such that legislation is not a barrier to progress and I refer in particular to the Foreshore Act in this regard.  This area should be addressed.  The last thing we need is barriers to access to investment in the private sector.  As the Minister correctly stated, we have the best resources to develop wind and ocean energy.  We must be enthusiastic and welcome people into the area by getting rid of barriers which exist.  I impress upon the Minister the need to do work in this area.  I realise there is toing and froing between the committee and the Department related to the legislation we have drafted.  However, we all seek the same result and I call on the Minister to act in this area.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>Earlier, I listened to Senator Quinn.  I agreed with his point, that is, there is no reason for a Government amendment to the motion.  It is clear how carefully he has crafted the motion, which is wide open, could not cause offence and is seeking an open debate on the matter.  Of course, when I examined the supplementary Order Paper I saw the Government amendment.  It is clear the Government is proud of its work in this area, which is fair enough.  It is unfortunate the Senator&rsquo;s motion was not accepted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Equally, I was very disappointed with the Fine Gael amendment.  At the root of our problem is a fear about discussing the matter.  The Minister spoke very eloquently about why we must open the debate.  I concur with his comments to the effect that we were the two parties on the previous Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security who consistently called for a debate on the nuclear energy issue, and with very good reason.  The Minister is convinced of the argument that it is a matter of safety and economics.  However, what we heard from the Minister this evening must receive a wider audience.  At least he is courageous enough to examine the matter and to call on others to discuss it.  The cowardice of other political parties and people on this matter is terrible.  They run from the issue of nuclear power, but we must face up to it.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey referred to interconnectivity.  He is fooling himself if he believes we will be able to take nuclear generated electricity from the United Kingdom and mainland Europe in future.  We are already doing so.  He stated it is nice that we can have that luxury, which is a typical Irish response.  That point of view accepts that other countries will take risks but that we receive the benefit of those risks without debating the matter ourselves.  That is why I am especially disappointed with the Fine Gael motion.  They simply wish to shut down debate on the issue.  They do not wish to be associated with any debate concerning nuclear power, which is not to the credit of the party because the people are ready for a proper debate.</P>
        <P>The basis of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s motion concerns security of supply and climate change and we are all agreed on these matters.  The Minister spoke very eloquently about the issue of climate change and also stated that our competitiveness is vitally important.  I have been interested in and have worked in this area for the past seven or eight years.  There is sometimes a knee-jerk reaction to nuclear power and an instinct to close down any negotiation on the matter.  One really must inform oneself rather than close one&rsquo;s mind.</P>
        <P>It has been interesting to see the issues of climate change and renewable energy move from the political sidelines to centre stage.  Senator Quinn made reference to the issue of environmental safety.  I encountered a quote when doing research for this area which gave me pause for thought.  One cause of climate change trouble is high carbon emissions from coal and gas burning.  That is a reality.  The high emissions of greenhouse gases in these areas will destroy the planet.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of the destructive qualities of nuclear power.  Senator Quinn mentioned statistics which indicate nuclear power has not caused more damage than other sources of power.  There is a quote, upon which we should all reflect, to the effect that a low carbon future is simply impossible without nuclear power.  If we were honest with ourselves we would realise that is true.  We must acknowledge the damage that burning coal and gas has done in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  We must also recognise the role that nuclear power must play internationally.  I agree with one point made by the Minister concerning the national grid and whether it has the capacity to deal with nuclear power.  There is also the matter of whether there should be such a station in Ireland.  The Minister will be well aware of the views and we have discussed the matter previously.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s heavy dependency on imported fuels would be even worse if such countries as France and the United Kingdom did not have nuclear power.  I would welcome an honest and <Col N="290"/>open debate which is why I commend Senator Quinn for raising the subject.  Last year, there was an interruption in gas supply because of a dispute between the Ukraine and Russia.  In such circumstances France would look after itself in the first instance, as would the United Kingdom.  Luckily, France is heavily dependent on nuclear power such that it does not mind exporting and has plenty of energy to sell.  I welcome the debate and I hope we attain what the committee seeks, that is, an open debate on the matter.  More people should hear the contributions made this evening, especially that of the Minister.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Mary White.  I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, back to the House.  It is great to listen to him as he has a great knowledge and is very much on top of his brief.  This is not the first time the Seanad has heard him speak about different types of energy.  He said at the beginning of his speech that energy is one of the greatest challenges the country faces but that there are also huge opportunities.  That is true.  The Government should take on board Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy document on creating 100,000 jobs.  I am disappointed the Government has not taken it on board.  It should look closely at the document.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Quinn on lodging the motion and giving Members an opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I am rather disappointed with Senator O&rsquo;Malley because Senator Coffey did qualify Fine Gael&rsquo;s position.  He said the issue of nuclear power should be debated openly but separately.</P>

	<P>My local authority in County Mayo has amended its county development plan to include various types of energy such as solar, wave and wind power.  Many local authorities have not done so and they should.  That would help with the planning process for wind and wave power projects.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley said there could be problems down the road for offshore licences and so forth.  The issue should be considered by every local authority, especially those in coastal areas which have potential for wind and wave power.  As an island country, we have golden opportunities to export energy.  We should be in the export business.  We have more wind and waves than the majority of European countries but there are obstacles.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report that was commissioned by the Oireachtas committee, which contains some criticism, perhaps in small print, of the Minister&rsquo;s Department and suggests it is not moving quickly enough.  It is a good report and I commend the committee on what it says, particularly about electric vehicles.</P><Col N="291"/>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland is like a secret service in some respects.  Getting a smart meter is not the easiest task in the world.  We need to have the infrastructure in place.  That leads me to the interconnector and the separation of the national grid.  The Minister is moving in the right direction, but the report suggests he is moving slowly in some areas.</P>
        <P>The Acting Chairman is looking at Senator White, so I will conclude now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley.  I compliment the Minister on his contribution over the years to alternative energy and congratulate him on putting the issue of nuclear energy on the radar.  I will make a few points on the problems with wind energy projects and I hope the Minister will take on the issues.</P>
        <P>At present 1,014 MW is pumped out by wind energy and 1,500 MW is ready to go between 2009 and 2014.  I will talk about the problems facing the projects that are contracted and ready to go.  A substantial number of wind farm projects are ready to begin construction but a number of factors are delaying progress, including delays in getting a grid connection.  The majority of the projects that have a contract to connect are likely to be connected in 2009 or 2010, but a number will not get a connection until 2014.  There is considerable concern in the wind energy industry that the grid will not be delivered in time to allow all the projects to be built.  There is even more concern about grid connections for projects under Gate 3.  Most projects in development are finding it increasingly difficult to secure finance.  A number of banks are not lending and the level of equity required by the banks has risen significantly.  The delay in getting grid connections is causing problems for a number of developers whose planning permissions for projects are running out.</P>
        <P>The benefits of wind energy include the creation of jobs in development, construction, maintenance, operations, management, law, finance and insurance; the provision of security against oil price volatility; an increase in our energy independence; and assistance with our environmental commitments on climate change.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a serious lack of joined-up thinking between the various bodies that deal with the wind energy industry, including the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, EirGrid, ESB Networks and Sustainable Energy Ireland.  The renewable energy development programme was set up a number of years ago to consider energy policy, support structures and so on, but in recent times it has not been an active entity.  This body consists of members from all areas of the renewables industry, decision makers such as CER and EirGrid and academics.  It should be reactivated quickly and given adequate resources to allow it to achieve its full potential.</P>
        <P>Small-scale projects should also be supported.  We must make development easier and reduce red tape.  One advantage of small-scale projects is that they can be developed by local communities or local companies, thus increasing the local benefits. The programme that SEI is running to encourage micro-generation is welcome, but it must be managed properly and the correct control measures and training must be put in place.  On behalf of people who are involved in wind energy, I say to the Minister that it is critical we resolve these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everyone who spoke in the debate.  In particular, I appreciate the interest the Minister has shown and the words he used.  He said the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> targets are challenging, and they certainly are, but he spoke with enthusiasm, confidence and, I think, a knowledge of the technology.  On that basis, energy security is in good hands.  I was also delighted to hear that the Minister is willing to talk about nuclear power despite the views he has expressed in the past.</P><Col N="292"/>
        <P>Senators Coffey and Burke both confirmed they are willing to talk about nuclear power.  If they are willing to debate it, I am not sure why the amendment was lodged, but the fact they are willing to debate it is interesting.  I especially thank Senator O&rsquo;Malley for her criticism of those who have a closed mind and are unwilling to debate the topic.  The reason for lodging the motion was to have the debate, to open it up and ensure we talk about the various energy sources.  It was particularly interesting to hear Senator Mary White talk about the frustrations and delays that are happening, particularly with wind energy projects.</P>
        <P>There is a lot of evidence that wind farms are not an answer to global warming in countries such as Ireland and northern Europe in general.</P>
        <P>I was in Austria recently and could not believe the number of wind turbines between Vienna and Bratislava.  The Germans, who have invested more than anybody in wind farms, are finding that, despite having more than 17,000 wind turbines, the nation is emitting more carbon than before it built them.  According to estimates, this is due to the fact the turbines are only about 17% efficient because the wind does not blow at the right speed often enough to do any better.  As a result, 83% of the electricity which should come from wind must come from coal burning power stations which can never work at optimum efficiency because they must forever adjust to the fluctuating flow from wind generation.  We must solve that if we are to get on top of wind energy.</P>
        <P>In short, being intermittent, wind power must always be backed up by more reliable fossil fuel or nuclear plants.  At present, wind energy is incapable of satisfying the growing demands for energy but I hope we overcome that.  Even with the huge attraction of subsidies, energy companies are increasingly abandoning wind as an effective and green source of energy, and I am sure the Minister knows that.  For example, one of the oldest and most efficient wind farms in Britain is to be dismantled and replaced by a nuclear power station under plans drawn up by a German-owned power group.  That concerns me.</P>
        <P>I refer to tidal energy, an area we must exploit.  It was interesting to hear Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s views.  Tidal waves and currents possess huge potential for low carbon energy generation.  However, efforts to harness them have been hampered by the difficulty of designing devices which can tolerate harsh oceanic conditions.  This year, however, power generating buoys which harness wave energy 50 m under water were put to the test in the UK and the world&rsquo;s first commercial scale tide turbine delivered electricity to the UK national grid.  I mention that because much work is going on to achieve that.</P>
        <P>Danish support for wind power helped that country to establish worldwide leadership in the building of turbines.  Ireland must do the same with wave and tidal power.  We have the opportunity and the ability, as Senator Mary White mentioned, and we know we can do something about it.  However, this will not solve our current problems.  We need to look at all other resources as well.</P>
        <P>Ireland has spent approximately &euro;920 million in four years buying credits under the Kyoto scheme to pay for our carbon emissions.  The money we spend on four years&rsquo; worth of carbon emissions credits is just shy of the &euro;1 billion it would take for Ireland to build a medium-sized nuclear power station.  The cost of decommissioning a nuclear plant might add another &euro;250 million or so to this figure.  However, this looks like a calculation worth examining.  Nuclear is nearly a carbon-free energy.  It is not entirely carbon free as there is some carbon use in its construction but, overall, nuclear is a very low carbon emitter so let us not close our minds to it.</P>
        <P>We must ask why there has been a massive shift towards nuclear power over other forms of renewable energy across Europe.  Can we be truly energy independent by just relying on energies such as wind and wave power?  Why are we ignoring the fact that nuclear energy is the <Col N="293"/>most green type of energy because it does not have any of these emissions?  Would we save more in the long term by reducing our carbon emissions by going down the nuclear road?  Are certain forms of renewable energy profiting from subsidies and favouritism even if they are not the best long-term solution for this country?  In effect, are we kidding ourselves that we will ever get close to, let alone go beyond, 20% of our energy being produced by renewable energies?</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>In a time when energy supply is more volatile than ever, when countries are committed to reducing emissions and when we need to plan for the future, Ireland needs to be energy independent.  We must not rule out any one form of energy due to past prejudices, misinformation or lobbying.</P>
        <P>This motion has given us a chance to debate this issue.  It has been a very useful debate and I thank everybody who spoke.  I thank the Minister, in particular, for his open mind.  However, I urge him not to allow us to close our minds to the threat not only to us, but to future generations.  We must solve this problem so let us not close our minds to every form of energy available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to the House.  I raise the issue of the befriending service in south Tipperary.  It is a community-based service of south Tipperary Mental Health and Voluntary Housing Association.  The mission statement of this befriending project indicates it supports and empowers the people using its services to identify and achieve their goals and it offers companionship and support on the journey towards recovery.  It is a volunteer befriending service for people over 18 years of age living in the community who are experiencing mental health problems.  The ethos of the project is to foster independence, promote self-empowerment, build self-confidence and self-esteem and reduce social isolation.  Research has shown that one in four people will experience mental health problems at some time in their lives.  Many people, following discharge from inpatient services, feel isolated within communities, lack confidence and find it difficult to access social, educational and cultural amenities.</P>
        <P>The mental health service in south Tipperary set up this project in 2006 and it was launched with a &euro;25,000 grant from HSE south east at the time.  Further funding of &euro;10,000 was given through the Clonmel RAPID programme to augment the service and the proceeds of fundraising made up the balance of funding required.  This service is heavily reliant on volunteers who do not receive payment for their time as they are volunteers.  They have comprehensive training in confidentiality, listening skills, positive mental health, suicide awareness and stress management.  Ongoing training, support and supervision is provided.  It is an essential part of the project and is provided by the co-ordinator and steering committee with the added support of south Tipperary Mental Health and Voluntary Housing Association.</P>
        <P>The project works because there is one to one befriending, which is the core activity of the project.  One to one befriending endeavours to encourage independence, self-empowerment <Col N="294"/>and identification of goals.  The befriendee and volunteer are carefully matched by the co-ordinator who is also supported by a referral committee.  The befriendee will define his or her personal goal and a contract is signed.  The co-ordinator monitors progress and is available to assess it and as a means of support and advice.   Generally there is a limited relationship which will enable the befriendee to widen his or her social network and increase his or her awareness.  Overall, the project has been found to have a positive impact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A user satisfaction questionnaire was sent to a random group of people who are users of the south Tipperary Befriending Service.  All respondents stated they were very satisfied with the service provided and that they would recommend it to other people.</P>
        <P>I raise this matter because this service is being discontinued and the co-ordinator will receive her P45 this week.  It is being discontinued because funding of &euro;20,000, which is needed to run the service for a year, has not been given by the HSE.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure this service is continued because of the strong and positive issues it raises.  I ask him to ensure this service is funded to the tune of &euro;20,000 per annum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to Senator Prendergast and the House for arriving a little late.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to acknowledge at first hand the tremendous work being carried out by the many groups and volunteers throughout the country.  I met Martin Rogan concerning a similar project in Dublin some months ago.  These groups work to empower people with mental health problems.   Within this Department, the key issue is the area of recovery and the first step to achieving that is a supported befriending service.  In my capacity as Minister of State, I am fortunate to have met representatives of many community and voluntary groups.  I am acutely aware, therefore, of the role of such groups in helping vulnerable persons and the positive impact their work can have on individuals and communities.</P>
        <P>I want to address the specific issue raised by the Senator, which is the provision of funding for the befriending service in south Tipperary.  I understand a funding application for &euro;20,000 was received in the HSE&rsquo;s local health office in Tipperary.  I acknowledge the contribution and support of Senator Prendergast on this specific issue on the ground in Tipperary.   I also fully recognise her professional involvement.  As Senators will no doubt be aware, the allocation of core funding to voluntary groups will be a matter for the HSE.  In these circumstances the application will be considered by the HSE and it  will have my support &mdash; the Senator asked me that direct question.  I spoke to a befriending group in Dublin.  There is little point in publicly supporting an issue if privately one will not put one&rsquo;s shoulder to the wheel and seek financial support for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have discussed the report, A Vision for Change, on many occasions.  The key issue in that report is to try to involve the services within the community.  I want to come before the House as soon as I can to explain the Government&rsquo;s position on the report, A Vision for Change, and how we intend to fund the new models proposed and supported within the community.  I assure the Senator I will return to the specific issue of how services such as the befriending service are to be funded.  I will inform the House before the summer recess about the capital programme and give the House a clear timeframe as to the sale of assets one to 12.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast has raised this issue with me on other occasions.  I have always recognised the importance of having a director for mental health and I hope to clarify this point to the House soon.  I reaffirm the commitment to A Vision for Change.  I fully acknowledge that this programme is now entering its fourth year of a ten-year programme and it is important to deliver the recommendations contained therein within the remaining six years.  It is timely to review the programme and I propose to hold such a review some time in July and consider how many of the recommendations have been delivered, how the community support services <Col N="295"/>which the Senator quite properly demands are to be funded, and to set down clear timeframes with price tags attached.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The befriending service is an example of a very worthwhile and valuable community initiative and such initiatives are the cornerstone of A Vision for Change.  A mental health reform programme should be based on strong, community mental health programmes.  I am aware that some Senators may not be familiar with the work of the befriending associations so I will outline the work they undertake.  The befriending service assists people with mental health difficulties to re-establish personal interests and social contacts within the community and by motivating and supporting vulnerable persons, the service develops an individual&rsquo;s independence and encourages him or her to reintegrate into the local community.  Befriending is essentially about building a relationship between a volunteer and a person to be befriended.  Volunteers undergo preparatory training which includes mental health awareness, confidentiality and listening skills.  The service then works to match clients and volunteers based largely on their shared interests and hobbies.  This enables a person to widen his or her social network, increase his or her independence and help individuals make informed choices, thus supporting them to live their life to the full.  The ethos of the befriending service is very much in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change, the Government&rsquo;s policy for the development of our mental health services.</P>
        <P>Mental health is a resource that needs to be promoted and protected.  One of the fundamental principles of A Vision for Change is recovery.  People with mental illness must be facilitated in reclaiming their lives and becoming involved in society.  To achieve this, people need supportive mental health services, but they also need supportive communities.  As the stigma attached to mental illness is one of the biggest challenges we face, putting the message about in the community that it is all right to admit to being depressed or lonely is key.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Vision for Change refers to a model for recovery.  It is important we work towards a policy aimed at eliminating the stigma attached to mental illness.  I have brought together a group of 12 to 15 people.  These are not experts but rather people who are internationally recognised in the areas of the arts, sport and politics.  This group meets every month to work on the elimination of the stigma attached to those with mental illness.  I hope to invite the editors of local radio and print media to become part of an ongoing process whereby they might play a role in providing supports to those recovering from mental illness either in their print or broadcast media.  This is in line with the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion by way of the befriending service.  I assure her that I will give it my support and I will be saying so to the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Senator Keaveney proposed that the Joint Committee on Health and Children discuss the involvement of the creative arts as a support.</P>
        <P>I intend to come back to the House to explain the reform package and my target date is July.  There is no point in coming back with piecemeal information.  I am planning a campaign to remove the stigma and to create the notion of mental well-being.  I will give the House the timescale for the establishment of the community mental health teams.  The HSE is often criticised for a lack of initiative in some areas but I welcome the initiative to co-locate community mental health teams within primary care centres.  Of the 200 proposed, a total of 100 will cater for mental health.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The work carried out at local community level by the befriending service is helping to change the way we view the recovery process and I commend the organisation on its commitment and vision in delivering this valuable service.  I also pay tribute to the individual volunteers who give up their time and energy to befriend those who are anxious, depressed or suicidal.  They are making a real difference in people&rsquo;s lives.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I will correspond directly with her about my support for this application.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise this matter, the need for a campaign to address the issue of the dangers of sunburn and the use of sunbeds.  As we come towards the time most associated with travelling to sunny tourist destinations, we also have a responsibility to understand the risks associated with getting that tan, whether by natural means or by using a sunbed.   We have access to sun holidays and sunbeds all year round now but in moving towards the height of the season we have to be proactive in highlighting the other side of sunburn and the tanning process.  We have a responsibility to inform people of the risks but also to show how dangerous it can be to ignore what can appear to be insignificant lumps or bumps.</P>
        <P>It is when young people die as a result of what seemed an innocuous lump that relatives have begged me and other politicians to promote understanding of this very serious and fatal issue.  This is the reason I wish to know the current status of health awareness campaigns which publicise the risks and inform about the best forms of protection and what signs to look for.  I note that in a debate in the House on bowel cancer we conducted an entire debate without outlining the signs of the cancer and what were the best preventative measures.</P>
        <P>The fact that sunscreens do not fully prevent the possibility of skin cancer or melanoma is not fully understood.  There are differing strengths of sunscreen but they must be applied regularly and not just once daily.  This may seem obvious to some but not to everyone.  I have been reading up on the issue and I note the list of important signs to be aware of.  It is known as the ABCD approach which is: asymmetry, lesions typically irregular in shape; border, melanoma lesions with uneven or irregular borders; colour, melanoma lesions often contain many shades of brown or black whereas benign moles are usually a single shade of brown; and diameter, melanoma lesions are often more than 6 mm in diameter whereas benign moles are less than 6 mm.  It is advised that any lesion greater than 6 mm to 10 mm, a lump, bump or otherwise, should be checked by a doctor during a physical examination.  Those at risk include people with fair skin that burns or freckles easily, those with relatives who have had skin cancer, those with a history of one or more bad, blistering sunburns as a child or teenager or those who have a history of the disease.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society has informed me that the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children does not fund any sun awareness or skin cancer awareness campaigns.  While the Marie Keating Foundation does a certain amount of work, the Irish Cancer Society is the primary charity in this area.  The society funds a sun smart campaign every year and will launch the campaign next week with a national advertising campaign which will focus on educating people about the risks of skin cancer.  This will target students and people in work places and will advertise a helpline.  The society is asking that sunbed legislation be brought forward as soon as possible to regulate the industry and to protect minors from exposure to the harmful effects of sunbeds.  This legislation was first promised in 2006.  The Irish Cancer Society participated in consultations in 2008 and its priority is to have this legislation brought forward as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>The Department has stated that this is unlikely to happen before the autumn but given that it seems to be straightforward legislation, it seems that if it is given priority by the Minister, it could be fast-tracked through the legislative process.  I understand there can sometimes be valid reasons for not giving priority to certain issues.  However, I know people who died very young from something we should be better informed about.  We all love to see the sun and to benefit as much as we can from it and get as red as we can.  It is very important that the Department rows in with the work this charity is doing through legislation and supporting the awareness campaigns.  In working together we can achieve the maximum results.  I do not know off-hand the statistics on the number of people dying each year from melanoma but every life lost is a life too many.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter on the adjournment of the Seanad, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who could not be here.  Skin cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in Ireland.  In 2005 there were 26,776 new cancers registered with the National Cancer Registry, of which 6,196, 23.1%, were non-melanoma skin cancers and 598, 2.2%, were melanoma skin cancers.  Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer.  I again thank the Senator for raising the matter as it helps us to focus on what this issue is about.</P>
        <P>The national cancer control programme, NCCP, which was set up in 2007 to provide a comprehensive programme of cancer control in Ireland, has established a cancer prevention working group in collaboration with the health promotion services of the Health Service Executive.  The key areas for attention are smoking cessation, obesity and physical activity, alcohol and exposure to ultraviolet radiation.</P>
        <P>The NCCP is in the process of establishing a multidisciplinary skin cancer expert working group, chaired by a consultant dermatologist, to address the prevention and management of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.  The focus of the work will be on prevention and awareness, early detection and management in the primary care setting, GP referral guidelines and integration of general practice with acute services and specialist management of skin cancers.  The first meeting of the group has been set for May 2009.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for running health promotion and social marketing campaigns, including public awareness campaigns, falls within the remit of the Health Service Executive.  The Health Service Executive does not plan to run specific campaigns on the dangers of sun exposure for this summer 2009 as the new skin cancer expert working group is beginning its work this month.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society is a leading provider of information on skin cancer and the importance of prevention in Ireland.  Through a variety of campaigns and services, the society endeavours to reach all people and educate them on skin cancer prevention and the importance of the early detection of skin cancer.  This year the Irish Cancer Society will again run a national SunSmart campaign to promote skin cancer prevention behaviours and to encourage people to follow the SunSmart code.  The campaign is scheduled to commence on 11 May with national radio and magazine advertising.  This year&rsquo;s campaign will be primarily aimed at children and those caring for children to encourage everyone to be SunSmart.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In June 2006, the National Cancer Forum prepared A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland.  In that report, it was recommended that &ldquo;in conjunction with campaigns to promote safe sun practices and to reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation, regulation of sunbed use, including restriction of their use to adults only should be put in place.&rdquo;  The Department of Health and Children initiated a public consultation on the proposed legislation to regulate sunbeds and has analysed the submissions received.  Meetings have taken place with interested parties and a regulatory impact analysis, RIA, has been drafted.</P>
        <P>The enforcement measures to apply to the proposed sunbed legislation are being considered.  This is an ongoing process and the Department is researching the legal issues, examining the position both in Ireland and in other countries and arranging meetings with a number of interested parties.  In parallel with this, work is under way to finalise the RIA and the heads of a Bill for consideration by Government.  These processes are inter-linked and outcomes in these areas of work will shape the final versions of the RIA and the heads of a Bill.  Following consideration of the enforcement issue, the completion of the RIA and the drafting of the heads of the Bill, it is intended to submit proposals on the regulation of sunbeds for consideration by Government before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Despite the enormous benefits of preventing diseases and illnesses, the primary focus of health care systems is on treatment rather than prevention.  I firmly believe that promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours across the population is worthwhile.  The Government will continue to support efforts to create greater awareness around the preventative measures and positive <Col N="298"/>lifestyle behaviours needed to allow people to live healthier lives.  Again, I thank Senator Keaveney for bringing the issue before the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter.  I welcome the Minister to the House, particularly since he seems to be in such a benevolent mood.  I hope I will get an equally positive and satisfactory answer from him.  Once again I am raising the matter of final year pharmacy students.  I had to do this previously with a number of matters, including the enormous increase in the registration fee.</P>
        <P>Now I am looking at the question of the pre-registration requirement on final-year pharmacy students that they take an additional year, of which six months must be undertaken in a hospital or community pharmacy.  This is to provide practical, on-the-ground training and it is very necessary.  However, since the passage in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the past couple of months of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, there has been an unintended consequence and this vulnerable group of students has been caught in a snare.  Although they are required to become apprentices in a hospital or community pharmacy, the embargo on recruitment in the public service contained in that Bill means this has, apparently, ceased.  That is plainly a nonsense and an unintended consequence.</P>
        <P>The hospitals rely on these people.  They are the foot soldiers.  How are the hospital pharmacies to continue if this system is to be axed arbitrarily in a manner I do not believe had been foreseen?  The moratorium was not intended to affect front-line positions such as those in hospitals but it has been left like that.  I assume this insanity will be rectified but at the moment the students are, once again, left in total uncertainty.  They are coming up to exam time and this is grossly unfair on people who are already in a situation of some anxiety.</P>
        <P>For quite a long time all the major hospitals have been taking at least one pre-registration student for a year&rsquo;s training.  New students were offered an opportunity for training when the old students leave after completing their training.  There was a turnover system so it does not mean additional posts or expense.  It is the continuation at no additional expense of the existing system, but this is being axed.  The system ensured properly qualified, suitable Irish pharmacists were available for work in hospitals and pharmacies throughout the country.  The one-year training is part of the course and it is mandatory to qualify as a pharmacist.  It is, therefore, very important that we examine the impact of this moratorium.</P>
        <P>Many students have been called for interviews and have even been told they were successful, but this is dependent on the Department and the HSE agreeing on this.  Hospitals such as the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, Incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Tallaght, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Sligo General Hospital and Galway University Hospital have had or arranged interviews and selected people only to be told the position is pending the agreement of the continuation of funding.  This is unacceptable.  These hospitals have pre-registration positions, but after November they will not have them.  The hospitals will also suffer.  As I have said, these pre-registration students make up the junior grades of the hospital pharmacy staff.  How will the hospitals run without them?  They are already under pressure.</P>
        <P>It is not an additional expense.  This November, the current crop will come to an end and the salary normally transfers to the new student.  In many cases, the salaries were already taken <Col N="299"/>into account in the budgeting forecasts so there is no real reason for this cut.  However, the moratorium means that no hiring can be undertaken, not even of replacement staff.  I believe, and I hope the Minister of State will agree, that these positions are required of students in order that they may become qualified as pharmacists.  It is a mandatory situation upon which the hospitals depend for a certain level of staff.  These positions should be designated as training places and safeguarded, year after year.  They should be ring-fenced, as happens in the case of doctors and nurses.</P>
        <P>If major teaching hospitals are not to take on these students the situation will be unthinkable.  What would happen, for example, in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital or the Mater Hospital, just around the corner from me?  Ultimately, the situation effectively punishes students who got good leaving certificate or A level results and remained in Ireland to study pharmacy.  If they had gone to the United Kingdom like many other students they would not have this problem because it does not exist there.  The Irish pharmacy student is in danger of losing out not because he or she is lazy or not up to scratch but simply because there has not been forward planning.</P>
        <P>The meeting between the Pharmaceutical Society, the Department of Health and Children and the Hospital Pharmacists Association was supposed to take place tomorrow but it has been postponed.  This means that many students who are now approaching their exams may have to spend the entire summer not knowing whether they will get a job or should look for accommodation in Dublin, whether they can return home or must work all summer to support themselves.  The reason is that the pre-registration training is a five-day week position.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister of State that these are the people who have already paid an enormously increased &euro;1,500 registration fee.  Do they not deserve to be treated as they have been in the past instead of being left in this catch-22 situation?</P>
        <P>I happen to know the Minister of State, who is a decent midlands man, and I ask him to use that valiant old Fianna F&aacute;il phrase I have heard so many times and have sometimes mocked, namely, &ldquo;in fairness&rdquo;.  In fairness, can the Minister of State not do something for these decent students?  I await his reply with great interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;In fairness&rdquo; has also been shelved as the new way forward.  The Senator might notice that those words are no longer used.</P>
        <P>I apologise that the Minister, Deputy Harney, cannot be present.  I am taking the Adjournment matter in her name. Pharmacy graduates are obliged to complete one year of post-qualification training before they are eligible to become registered pharmacists.  This is to fulfil the EU obligation that pharmacy education last a minimum of five years. In addition, at least six months of the pre-registration training must be in a clinical sitting, either in a community or hospital pharmacy.  This course of study, supervised work experience and examination is organised by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  To date, the majority of pre-registration pharmacy students have tended to undertake 12 months of pre-registration training in one establishment, for example, a community or hospital pharmacy.  However, it is possible for students to undertake two six-month placements, one of which must be in a community or hospital pharmacy and the second in another establishment relevant to the practice of pharmacy, for example, the pharmaceutical industry, academia etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The PSI has informed the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, that it is preparing a contingency plan in case of a shortfall in the number of placements available this year.  Notwithstanding the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce a moratorium across the public service, certain posts in the health sector may be filled through exemptions in the employment control framework for front-line posts.  The framework allows for a growth in the number of front-line posts within the overall approved employment ceiling of 111,800 work-time equivalents for the health sector.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>Provision has been made within the employment control framework for the continuation of the normal arrangements in respect of the filling of clinical placements, rotations and training positions for health care professionals, including trainee pharmacists.  The PSI has been in discussions with the HSE concerning the number of placements available in the hospital sector and to ascertain whether there is an opportunity to increase the throughput of students in this area.</P>
        <P>The Minister welcomes the initiative of the PSI in developing a contingency plan that will endeavour to ensure all students are enabled to acquire a &ldquo;qualification appropriate for practice&rdquo; and thereby to obtain registration as pharmacists and practise their profession.</P>
        <P>The PSI&rsquo;s plan will require the full support of the HSE, community pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as tutor pharmacists across all sectors of practice, in the community, hospital, industry, academic and regulatory sectors, if it is to succeed.  The Minister urges all concerned to support the PSI in this initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally thank the Minister of State for his reply but, as he will no doubt understand, it is completely unsatisfactory even from an intellectual and logical point of view.  I understand the Minister of State was merely reading it but his script acknowledged a particular situation with particular consequences and then offered a garbled generalised response which is not a solution.  It depends on the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to do this, that or the other.  That society has received &euro;1,500 from students, an enormously inflated fee, but what is it doing?</P>
        <P>These students are already qualified or fairly well so.  They are senior sophomores in their final year who have slaved and done the work that is a required part of their course.  Is the Minister of State seriously suggesting that it is the responsibility of the PSI rather than that of the Government and the HSE to ensure that these students are permitted to complete the course to which they are entitled?  It beggars belief.</P>
        <P>I made my point and, judging by his facial expression and occasional nods, the Minister of State appears to understand it.  I know he is not the Minister principally involved, who is the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, a woman for whom I have considerable regard.  I ask the Minister of State to transmit to her the necessity to be prepared to meet representatives of these students and to iron out this matter for once and for all.  They cannot be left in limbo over the summer.  It is just not human.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand Senator Norris&rsquo;s frustration at a response that appears to defer the responsibility of Government to initiate and support the proposal.  I reiterate this suggests the PSI plan will require the full support of the HSE and community pharmacies.  It is not a matter of leaving the issue out and depending on the process to happen.</P>
        <P>From the briefings I have had with the senior Minister, I can say it is her intention to meet those involved and be proactive in this area.  I hope that will happen within a matter of days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  People who have completed all the requirements should be entitled not to be frustrated in this bizarre way.  I know that neither the Minister of State nor the Minister, Deputy Harney, would wish that.</P>
