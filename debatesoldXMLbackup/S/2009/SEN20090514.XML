	<P>I have notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the details of the operation of the new scheme to provide a child care place for three year old children, the payment methods, number of available places and the level of uptake in the scheme which she expects from child care providers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Geraldine Feeney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the reason an expectant mother with private health insurance can only access a private room in a private hospital and not a private room in a public hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the European Asylum Support Office, back from committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Adoption Bill 2009 &mdash; Report Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and to adjourn at 3.30 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 2<i>a</i> the Industrial Development Bill 2008 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] which is expected from the D&aacute;il later today and will be circulated by way of supplementary Order Paper.  It is proposed that this Bill will be taken not earlier than 3.30 p.m.  The business of the House will be interrupted between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have discussed a number of times in this House services for children.  Yesterday we had the publication of the Monageer report, which was only published in part.  Will the Leader take a message back from this House to Government that we want to see this report published in full?  We had a similar situation previously when the Kelly Fitzgerald report was published.  Initially, it was not published in full but then it was published through the mechanism of being sent to a committee of the Houses and it was then placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The same should happen in this case.  If we are to learn anything from <Col N="404"/>the lessons of the past about protecting children in this country it is that co-ordinated action is required between agencies.  It is clear this family was known to the authorities over a long period.</P>
        <P>A range of organisations, agencies and individuals were involved with the family from a very early stage.  It is extraordinary that after ten years of the Celtic tiger, we do not have the basic child care services in place with the co-ordination that is necessary to give families such as this the supports they need to prevent the terrible tragedy that we have seen.  We certainly need to debate that in this House and I ask for an early debate on child protection services.</P>
        <P>There is a front page story in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which states that cases involving severe abuse are not being allocated because there is a shortage of social workers and that the files are remaining on the shelves of offices throughout the country.  That is extraordinary.  Where has the priority been for the past ten years of the Celtic tiger if we cannot provide basic child care services for vulnerable families?  We have yet another report outlining deficiencies.  Heads have rolled in England when this has happened.  There is no accountability in this country for the lack of services to these families over the past ten years.  The Government puts its money where its mouth is, and if it is not put into child care, that is an absolute dereliction of duty.  I want this issue debated in this House as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>We have a report this morning from exporters.  I spoke yesterday about the report from small businesses.  The key point is the lack of competitiveness in this economy.  Senators from all sides of the House have called for a debate on competitiveness.  There is an absolute necessity to become more competitive if we are to retain jobs.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the disquiet of this House about what has happened to Aung San Suu Kyi, with the continuation of her 19 year confinement in Burma and the trial she is undergoing once again.  What is happening to that woman and the length of time she is being kept in isolation is an outrageous abuse of human rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald on what I understand to be a call for a debate on the rights of children and the services to support them.  While there may have been some arguments for redacting some elements of the Monageer report, I find no justification whatever for editing out the seven recommendations.  How on earth is this Parliament to exercise its role of supervision in assessing whether these recommendations have been fulfilled if we are not allowed to know what they are?  That must be made known.</P>
        <P>In a debate on children, I would like to include the situation in the children&rsquo;s hospital in Crumlin, where wards are being closed and children with serious cardiac problems are placed on intolerable waiting lists.  I have received representations on a number of cases, including that of a young boy, the optimum age for whom to undergo the second part of a serious operation &mdash; the first part took place when he was a small infant &mdash; is three to three and a half years, which means that it should take place between June 2009 and January 2010, but he may well not get a bed.  This is intolerable, given that the Government claimed it would protect the vulnerable.  There are other heart-rending cases, including one involving a special needs child.</P>
        <P>I support the repeated calls that have been made for a specific date for a human rights debate.  We could take in the trumped up charge against Aung San Suu Kyi.  We could compliment the US Government on having taken its position on the human rights council of the United Nations, which is very important.  We could raise cases such as that of Ezra Nawi, someone who is personally known to me, a human rights activist in Israel who has intervened in a non-violent way to try to prevent the destruction of Palestinian houses, who was arrested and is being sentenced in a case over which there is precisely the same doubt as there was regarding the Denning judgment.  This is an appalling case about which I will circulate details and against <Col N="405"/>which I will ask members to join the international outcry.  The Minister should be involved in this case.</P>
        <P>In the general context of the two previous items, I raise the extraordinary situation concerning the cut in overseas aid.  On RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Primetime&rdquo; on 5 May, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, a very decent man, stated that &ldquo;we are protecting short-term emergency and humanitarian aid because that is where our focus is.  We want to save lives.&rdquo;  This was in answer to a question from Justin Kilcullen of Tr&oacute;caire.  When Irish Aid&rsquo;s emergency recovery unit was contacted to confirm this, however, it stated that, despite what the Minister of State said, given the current economic circumstances, the earmarked funding for rapid onset humanitarian emergencies was cut from &euro;20 million to &euro;6 million.  That is a 70% cut, which is a direct contradiction of what the Minister of State said.  When it got back to the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department, it was told that he meant to say that the reduced amount of humanitarian aid would be delivered.  This is a nonsense.  We need a debate on this and to get clarification from the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I give a guarded welcome to the publication this morning of the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, which will come to this House, I believe, next week.  It is the most important Bill regarding estate agents and particularly management companies for many a year and it is not before time.  There are many families in Dublin and across the commuter belt, in places such as Dunboyne and Ashbourne, who are paying more than &euro;1,000 per year to get their grass cut, if they are lucky to get it cut.  I am glad this Bill will come before the House, but it is only a first step on the journey.  I impress upon the Leader the need not just to bring this Bill forward, but to also bring forward other Bills relating to this matter.</P>
        <P>The announcement last night that the Swiss owners of SR Technics are about to conclude a deal to sell equipment and relocate it from Dublin Airport is worrying news.  It could lead to a loss of further jobs at the airport.  We all heard the announcement earlier this week that the DAA is looking at reducing staff.  This is very bad news for workers at the airport.  We all know that it is a result of a downturn in the overall market.  I ask the Leader to look again at the issue of the airport travel tax?  Aer Lingus describes it as anti-consumer and claims that it will reduce passenger numbers.  Ryanair has also asked for it to be examined again.  Other governments have looked at this.  The Dutch Government, for instance, did a study and noticed that although it raised over &euro;3 million in airport taxes, it cost over &euro;1 billion in lost revenues so it was scrapped.  The Belgians have also looked at scrapping it.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke about competitiveness, and it is important that our tourism industry is also competitive.  I ask for a debate on airline policy, particularly the travel tax.</P>
        <P>This week&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Lancet </i> published an article on climate change.  It was done in collaboration with University College London and it claims that climate change is the biggest threat to our health.  It predicts more heat waves like the one in France a few years ago, where thousands of people died in the middle of the summer, more malnutrition and higher levels of migration unless governments do something about it.  In 2007, Senator Ivana Bacik brought the Climate Protection Bill before this House, yet the Government has done nothing about it since.  I ask the Leader for a clear commitment to introduce, as soon as possible, a Bill into this House to address the issue of climate change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on crime.  I welcome the proposal to have legislation to deal with serious criminals.  I recognise that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, are in Templemore to inspect 100 Garda reserves who are graduating today.  The fact that there are only 300 such reserves in active service and 200 in training, or coming out of training, is something that we need to explore with a view to making greater progress, given that we were <Col N="406"/>looking towards a figure of approximately 4,000.  Although there is a problem with serious crime, other types of community policing need a boost and I would like the issue to be addressed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I call for a discussion on the implementation of the Children Act.  That Act is there not only to protect the child, but also to encourage parents to be responsible for the role of their children.  In some respects, this tallies with the discussion about social work.  It is not just about being able to intervene to protect the child but, where parents cannot cope with a child, to be able to intervene in that situation.  A broad debate needs to take place about this and about the implementation of the Children Act and its strengths and weaknesses.  That will lead to a debate I called for previously in regard to sentencing and the role of the Judiciary in ensuring people receive adequate and appropriate sentences.</P>
        <P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to a matter I have raised in this House on a number of occasions, namely, the change in status of Magilligan Port from international to domestic to facilitate the continued operation of the Foyle ferry which carried more than two million passengers in the past two years.  This move has been very much welcomed in the north-west region and is another sign of hands across the Border co-operation working at its best.  It is a new dispensation for us in the north west under the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment RTE on its effort to bring balance to the debate on the economy.  For a long time there has been a view abroad that we have been having a one-sided debate.  This is demoralising people at a time when we need to uplift and assist them in getting through the current recession.  This morning, RTE interviewed a leading economist with a totally different story than we have been hearing.  He was interviewed by RTE &mdash; I will not mention his name &mdash; on the basis that the media has in the past been accused of being somewhat less than straightforward in terms of providing a balanced report on the economy.</P>
        <P>This economist, who is a leading economist in this country, predicted good news on the horizon for Ireland.  He said that in the near future the recession will bottom out and that early next year there will be a return to growth in the economy.  On exports, an issue on which a report has been issued today, he made the point that we are doing much better in the export area than most other countries.</P>
        <P>I mention this because I believe there is a new realisation entering the debate.  RTE is providing leadership, which is significant at this particular time.  What I heard this morning should be put in print because it must be important reading for all people wishing to make a positive contribution to lifting us from where we are.  At the end of the day, what is important is people, jobs and, above all else, ensuring we assist Ireland internationally by putting out a balanced picture to prospective investors and media gurus.  I compliment RTE on that interview.  It is an important start on the road back.</P>

	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments in regard to the interview, which I, too, heard this morning.  There is a need to recognise that we can talk ourselves into a deeper recession.  Let us not do that.  We must recognise we are facing a challenge that we can handle.  I am not sure that has been recognised.</P>
        <P>I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that when in Dundalk I spoke to some people who had just lost their jobs.  When I suggested they go to Newry, which is only a 15 minute drive away, to get a job they responded by saying employees in Newry are paid only one third of what they are paid in Dundalk.  This brings to mind Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on competitiveness.  The Leader has promised regularly to provide time for a debate on the economy which, I believe, should be directly focused on competitiveness.  We have a huge job to do in this regard.</P>
        <P>I was surprised when I read of a &euro;250 million pay increase by way of increments to civil servants and State agency employees.  This is the type of issue we must be willing to grasp in terms of affordability.  An article published this week by Lansdowne Market Research states that three quarters of private sector employees have agreed to take pay cuts this year.  This is happening at a time when we are paying increments to civil servants and State agency employees whose jobs are secure.  We must accept the need to address this issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is an interesting town in France called Beauvais wherein is located a 14th century Gothic cathedral which is being cleaned up by approximately 100 people, many of whom are not being paid for their work.  They are job seekers who are willing to work to improve the area in which they live.  They are being paid unemployment benefit or perhaps a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  I believe there exists an opportunity for us to do similar work.  A letter in a newspaper the other day referred to the untidiness in gardens and common areas.  The article referred in particular to dandelions, of which I have seen a great deal lately.  Job seekers who enjoy gardening would be happy to work for their job seeker remuneration if doing work they accepted needs to be done.  A campaign similar to the once in France should be conducted here.  The work being carried out in Beauvais is one of a thousand different projects being undertaken in France.  Let us learn from what is happening elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I, too, came across the article on climate change in the <i>Lancet</i>, as referred to by Senator Hannigan.  The figures published this week are amazing.  It is stated in that article that our health will suffer if we fail to enact climate protection legislation.  I urge the Leader to ensure the Bill tabled by Senator Bacik, or a similar Bill, is introduced shortly.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call that we should not overstate our difficulties or underestimate our challenge and that we remain positive.  Our &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude is vital at this time.  We must work together to ensure we overcome our difficulties.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s remarks on competitiveness are linked to Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call yesterday for a debate on the economy, an issue I too raised on the Order of Business yesterday.  This is an issue that we need to address.  I wholeheartedly support the call for a debate on competitiveness.</P>
      
        <P>On the announcement in respect of SR Technics in north Dublin, which is in my constituency, I believe the T&aacute;naiste is endeavouring to achieve the best result.  I have had the opportunity of speaking with her.  It is important for us to put on record, as Senator Hannigan has done, the importance of retaining an aircraft maintenance facility in Ireland.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter through the avenues open to him.</P><Col N="410"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on procedures and processes on the operation of psychiatric services in the public and private sectors.  Psychiatric patients are usually very vulnerable people and are known to the services.  I was surprised at the Dunne case that was mentioned yesterday.  In my constituency last night a man, not for the first time, started to do damage to the structure of his family house and possibly damage to his own person.  On the one hand the services may wish to attempt to lock people up and on the other hand others claim there are civil liberties issues.  At the end of the day a balance needs to be struck.</P>

	<P>Now that the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks is in place in addition to that of Bank of Ireland, we understand this is meant to improve the vital credit line to small and medium-sized businesses.  What is the Government&rsquo;s response in this regard?  As we know up to now approximately 60% of all such loan applications to banks are being refused.  In line with what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others have said, although all the land speculation got us into the problem, if we are to have any hope of trading out of this recession it is of paramount importance to build at the ground level with the small businesses, including hoteliers and other good operators who have been the backbone of the economy and are trying to protect jobs never mind getting into job creation which I would also like.  I want to protect what we have.  Businesses cannot be suffocated and must be allowed to trade.  I would like to hear the Leader&rsquo;s comments on that matter.</P>
        <P>When is the NAMA legislation expected to be taken?  I agree with what Senator Hannigan said on the Property Services (Regulation) Bill, about which I asked recently.

I have spoken to the Minister of State and I know he is anxious to conclude bilateral arrangements with Russia and Vietnam quickly.  However, the e-mails are misrepresenting the facts regarding this House.  The fact is the Minister of State was not available to come in on the day the vote was taken.

        <P Just="Left">I refer to the positive news that is still available to us.  I wish to ask the Leader for a debate on transport with particular emphasis on the Dublin Airport Authority.  We will shortly have the second terminal at Dublin Airport which will add at least &euro;30 million in running costs alone, not to mention the retail aspect and the other positive aspects of being able to handle more traffic &mdash; up to 30 million passengers a year.  There could also be the added value of metro north, which would become very viable with those sorts of numbers and more importantly a new development, Dublin Airport City, which is the new direction of airports to attract foreign direct investment and mobile finance, that is people who wish to have immediate access to do business with all the other areas with which they do business.  Many thousands of jobs could be created and it would be well worth debating the positive developments in Dublin Airport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister to make a statement on those children who will be affected by the proposed closure of ward beds in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  While in some cases elective surgery might mean a planned cosmetic procedure, in this case it means life-saving surgery.  It takes place in two stages because a little baby can only have so much done at one time and needs maturity of organs in order to proceed.  Having worked down the country, I am aware of cases where a baby was delivered with severe problems that had not been diagnosed ante-natally.  That baby would need to come as an emergency or hot admission to the hospital and would then take precedence over planned or elective surgery.  One can understand the dilemma presented to people awaiting child-saving surgery.</P>
        <P>No facilities are provided for the parents of such children.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin is the biggest referral centre for children from throughout the country.  Its staff provide an excellent service.  The relaying to parents of news that may not be so good &mdash; it can also be good &mdash; takes place in a corridor.  This is an appalling indictment of the service being given to people at a time that might be very upsetting.  The Minister should make a statement or at least agree to debate how best to prioritise without closing these wards as a money-saving venture.  Although we are supposed to cherish all our children equally, this does not suggest we are.</P>

	<P>A study has just been published on the quality of life of older people in residential care.  Choice, privacy and a sense if identity are some of the requirements of older people living in residential care in order to maintain a good quality of life according to research published in the May issue of the <i>Journal of Advanced Nursing</i>.  Researchers from the National University of Ireland Galway spoke to 101 older people in long-stay care in private public nursing homes.  The key findings include the following.  Residents who took part in the research said that choice is important in their daily routine.  For example, one resident was permitted to go to bed at any time and another person was woken up at 6 a.m. but did not get breakfast until 8.10 a.m.  Residents would like to have choice in when they go to bed and get up.  Privacy is also an important issue.  Even people with their own rooms found that nursing staff walked into their rooms without knocking on the door.  Others felt even more acutely that when they had to share a room they had absolutely no place to which to escape in order to have a little time on their own.</P>

	<P>I would like the new Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, to come to the House to update us on the strategic plan for older people.  It is not just about the efficiency and running of nursing homes.  It is about equality of <Col N="412"/>life for older people.  They should have a say in what happens to them.  Their skills should be utilised by the owners of the nursing home.  They should have a feeling of self-worth.  We need to get away from the technicality of running them to making a good quality of life for older people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Leader rightly raised the issue of the punitive fixed interest rates that still are being applied to thousands of families nationwide.  Last week, his colleague, Senator Wilson, highlighted the issue of the treatment of one such family by a lending agency, which bordered on terrorism.  I asked the question last week, and will continue to do so until Members get a debate on this issue, as to the level of influence the taxpayers&rsquo; investment in the banking system has bought.  I argue it has bought absolutely none.  As for the &euro;7 billion that has just been invested in the two main banks, not a single cent of it is trickling through to areas in which it is needed.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is not trickling through to families who are suffering such levels of indebtedness.  We learned from the Monageer report yesterday that one such family&rsquo;s level of indebtedness was a major factor in driving them to taking the sort of tragic action they did.  Second, it most certainly is not trickling down to the businesses that need it.  I argue that every cent that has been invested thus far is being used simply to shore up the balance accounts of these institutions and nothing else.</P>
        <P>The issue raised by Senator Quinn whereby civic-minded jobseekers might volunteer their time, energy and efforts towards working to improve their local communities and facilities therein is a very laudable aspiration that I wish to see come to fruition.  However, a number of weeks ago some such civic-minded people in my community offered their services to the local county council.  They wished to enter an area that is used by our children, cut the grass, tidy it up and prepare it for what hopefully will be a good summer season.  However, they were told that such activity simply could not be allowed by the local authority because they would not be covered by insurance.  Were one of them to so much as cut a finger, major issues would arise.  I ask whatever Minister is responsible, which may be the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to consider the possibility of establishing a form of global national insurance policy, which has been done in other countries and which would allow people who, quite correctly, wish to spend some of their time in helping their local communities to be covered by such a policy.  This would not cost a lot of money in the greater scheme of things and it is a measure that certainly should be explored to ascertain what avenues are open in respect of getting such work done.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the company in County Galway that this morning announced an innovation in wind energy, whereby it has manufactured a component to deal with low wind speeds, which will run for 300 days of the year.  That is a magnificent breakthrough in respect of wind energy production.  Yesterday morning, Senator Mullen mentioned another organisation, Spirit of Ireland, which came together for the benefit of the country.  It is wonderful to see such participation to ensure we become energy independent.  This could take place over the next five years and it will mean that Members of the Oireachtas will be obliged to consider the legislation that obtains at present and which must be changed.  I have invited representatives from Spirit of Ireland to Leinster House for an all-party meeting in two weeks&rsquo; time and Members of both Houses will be notified of that in due course.  Members will <Col N="413"/>be surprised by the innovative ideas Spirit of Ireland has come up with on how to proceed over the next five years to ensure that, as Senator Callely noted, the economy becomes competitive again and that Ireland is able to provide clean, new energy at a cheaper price than anywhere else in Europe.  It is most important that this is done.  While necessity is the mother of invention, this is what is happening at present.  It is important that people are thinking outside the box and Ireland has the people and the skills to do this.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader in his response to intimate when it is proposed the House will sit next week and for the rest of May.  I also ask the Leader to facilitate as a matter of extreme urgency a debate on social partnership.  As we are in the middle of a recession, social partnership is needed more than ever and I appeal to unions and employers not to be entrenched.  Social partnership is needed now more than ever to discuss our competitiveness, how to protect and create jobs and, in particular, how to communicate with the people, which is a matter to which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred.  I wonder what planet the Senator is on.  Is he again blaming George Lee for reporting on what is happening?  Unemployment has risen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have asked the questions.  Our banks are in crisis, retail is in trouble, construction is dying a death, car sales have plummeted and, as can be seen if one walks around this city or Cork, shops are in trouble.  RTE should not be blamed for the recession.  Let us have a debate on RTE&rsquo;s role, but it should not be blamed for reporting on the recession because it did not cause it.  George Lee merely reported on it.  There should be realism in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Why have seven recommendations been blacked out from the Monageer report?  What does that state about Members&rsquo; role in society regarding the protection of young children?  Does the blacking out of 37 pages mean that next December, the Government will black out the pages of the budget that it does not wish Members to read?  Is that what will happen next?  I hope not because this issue pertains to children and, collectively, Members have a moral obligation to be responsible in this regard.  The blacking out of recommendations is not the way forward.  Why will the Minister of State with responsibility for children not allow the provision of an out-of-hours service for social workers?  Surely emergency services, not cutbacks, should be put in place in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was an example and an exhibition of gutter politics in the House last week when Senator Leyden attacked George Lee and RTE&rsquo;s objectivity in respect of its economic reporting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>While Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is more polite, nevertheless it still is the same attack on RTE&rsquo;s reporting and its objectivity in recent months.  It also constitutes gutter politics even though it is more polite.  When there is positive news on the economy, it is correct <Col N="414"/>to report it, but the reporting by one economist on RTE of some positive news, to which I referred in the House last week, namely, the issue of competitiveness and that our exports are holding up quite well compared to other industrialised economies, which is news the Government may welcome, is not the same as balanced reporting.  There has been balanced reporting on the economy by RTE, which has not talked the economy into recession.  The premise of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s entire attack and suggestion, namely, that there has been a lack of objectivity, is that we talk ourselves into recession.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the headlines of this morning&rsquo;s newspapers.  According to Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, the world economy may face near-stagnation for ten years, similar to Japan&rsquo;s lost decade.  Under the headline, European Clouds Refuse to Part, the <i>Financial Times</i> reported on decline in industrial production across Europe.  The only countries to exceed the decline in Ireland are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine.  Moreover, the Governor of the Bank of England has warned that the economy&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I asked for a debate on overseas aid and proposed cuts yesterday.  I was not present for the Leader&rsquo;s reply but I gather there will be a debate.  I draw the attention of the House to a report that Ireland will almost certainly miss its commitment to spend 0.6% of national income on overseas aid by 2010.  Our target was to contribute 0.7% of gross national product to overseas aid by 2012 and because of swingeing cuts in the overseas aid budget, we have gone from 0.58% to 0.48%.  We are going in the wrong direction.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable we are joining the laggers when the Netherlands will meet its 2010 target of 0.56% and the UK, Spain and Luxembourg are likely to do so.  Mr. Gordon Brown gave a commitment that Britain would reach 0.7% by 2013.  Having commended ourselves and taken the international stage to extol our virtue by setting this commitment of 0.7% by 2012, we have lost the initiative and are moving in the wrong direction while other countries remain idealistic and make commitments.  I hope this is a matter we can flesh out in the debate on overseas aid and take a new direction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Norris, Hannigan, Keaveney and Buttimer expressed concerns about the Monageer report.  As the Taoiseach has said, the Government was constrained by the advice of the Attorney General.  The advice of the Attorney General must be taken and this is the reason a considerable part of the report has been blotted out.  Next week I will discuss with the Leaders of the groups how we can facilitate a debate on the published part of the report at the earliest time.  Also, Senator Fitzgerald referred to child protection and funding for vulnerable families.  I agree with her sentiments and we will do all we can to support vulnerable people, no matter how bad the economy.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Quinn, Callely and Cannon called for a debate on competitiveness.  Senator Coghlan asked when the Finance Bill will be debated.  Second Stage will take place on the last Thursday of this month, 28 May.  The competitiveness debate will be timely.  We must come to terms with competitiveness in the public and private sectors.  The private sector has shown the way, as stated by Senator Quinn, because it is compulsory in most cases.  If people do not lower income by 10% and 20% companies will not survive.</P>
        <P>I refer to the expertise available at SR Technics to Europe and the airline business.  If this expertise leaves our shores we will never see it again.  It has taken 30 or 40 years for us to be recognised as a leader in this field.  Workers in the private sector may have to take a reduced income to keep expertise and jobs here.  Many of those men and women have been employed in the area for a considerable period and will find it extremely difficult to be retrained.  Competitiveness is the single greatest challenge.  I am prepared to offer an entire day&rsquo;s debate, before the Finance Bill, if possible, where Members can make a 15 minute contribution with the Minister present.  I will discuss this with the leaders of the groups at next week&rsquo;s meeting.</P>
        <P>I refer to the experience outlined to the House on the job seeker&rsquo;s programme in France.  We can examine this and see how we can encourage it.  Some 1,000 projects have been given out in France and Ireland has been known for its voluntary work.  The greatest thing a young person or an unemployed person can have in the morning is something to do that day.  It is a contradiction to have nothing to do in the day after being educated in one of the best systems we have seen in the history of the country.  We owe it to these unemployed men, women, boys and girls to have something in place.  Senator Cannon referred to insurance.  Surely this should not be a barrier placed by a local authority, when such a body can show the lead as it did during the 1980s with F&Aacute;S schemes.  This was another time when we experienced a massive downturn.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Prendergast expressed serious concern about funding for Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital.  We all supported and subscribed to fund-raising for Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital over the past 20 years.  If a child&rsquo;s life is in danger and funding is the problem, the <Col N="416"/>people are never found wanting.  I will take this issue up with the Minister, who is very supportive of Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital.  It is very close to where she was reared.</P>
        <P>Regarding human rights and other issues brought to my attention by Senators Norris and Fitzgerald concerning the unfortunate lady held in captivity for 19 years in Burma, I have no difficulty in having time left aside for this to be debated in the House.  Regarding Senators Norris and Mullen on overseas aid, we have heard various percentages over the years.  I saw the new Minister of State, Deputy Power, interviewed on television in recent weeks.  He said that from 1997 to 2007, our allocation increased twentyfold, a statistic of which we can be proud.</P>

        <P>Senators Hannigan and Callely asked when the Property Services (Regulation) Bill will be debated in the House.  Senator Coghlan has been inquiring about this for some considerable time.  The Bill will be initiated in the Seanad and will be before Members for their consideration on Thursday, 21 May.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin, Hannigan and Callely referred to job losses and the potential and opportunities for airport activities, as outlined by Senator Hanafin.  I wish everyone well with the new terminal currently being constructed.  This shows a new vision as a gateway to Ireland.  Senator Hanafin referred to the airport city, a new phenomenon coming to most countries in the world.  With the metro being built in years to come, it could become a realistic opportunity to showcase our country, what we have achieved and where we are going.  The first place everybody coming here arrives at is the airport and we were always told the first impression lasts.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan spoke about climate change, an area where legislation is needed.  I will check to see where the issue is on the Minister&rsquo;s list of priorities.  Senator Keaveney called for a debate on crime, which would be very timely, and I have no difficulty in allocating further time for the Minister to come to the House to update us in this area.  The Senator also spoke on the port at Magilligan and we join with her comments on the success and status of that port.</P>
        <P>I know the Senator works very hard for the port at Magilligan and on each side of the Border.  I wondered at various times whether the Senator may be contemplating a political career on the other side of the Border as well.  It is great to see her strong representation for that area in this House and bringing such matters to our attention on a weekly basis.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames commented on the Order of Business.  I can understand the Senator&rsquo;s frustration if she wants something discussed on the Order of Business.  On most occasions, the Order of Business is agreed by the leaders of the groups and myself and we have it outlined for the week.  If there is something which the Senator, or any Senator, wants debated on that particular day but it is not, this does not mean the Government side is opposed to it.  It means that on that day the business has been outlined and the Ministers&rsquo; diaries have been arranged so they will be here.</P>
        <P>As long-established Senators in particular in the House will know, there is a long-established format where everything possible is done in communicating, consultation and negotiation.  I hope this will continue and I do not want to depart from it.  With regard to the Senators who <Col N="417"/>may have found themselves in a position to back me on the proposed Order of Business for that day, it does not necessarily mean they were opposed in any shape or form to Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s point on the Order of Business, which she is entitled to raise.</P>

	<P>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Quinn offered their congratulations on the view of the economist this morning on radio.  We have many experts in the world on the economy and very few can pinpoint how the economies of the world will recover.  As we are such a small open economy, we will be one of the first and fastest countries to pick up economically compared to any other country.  The light is starting to appear at the end of the tunnel in the United States of America.  Until that country&rsquo;s economy lifts, we will not improve either.</P>

Senator Coghlan again pointed out his serious concerns regarding banking and related issues.  I will come back to the House next week to update it on the proposals relating to NAMA.  As I have already said, the Finance Bill will be taken on the last Thursday in May.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White brought to the attention of the House something which everybody here, regardless of political shades, would have to agree upon.  That is the quality of care for older people in the autumn of their lives, particularly quality of life, choice of long-stay options and privacy in rooms.  All of these matters give quality to our senior citizens in their retirement years.  I congratulate the Senator for all she is doing in this area in helping and assisting people.  Whenever time is requested, we will be able to have the new Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, come to the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon expressed strong views, as I did yesterday, on the 20% of mortgage holders who are caught in fixed interest rates, which are currently penal.  This is particularly so where <Col N="418"/>one of the income earners in the house, or perhaps the only income earner, is unemployed.  There should be some strategy for this, such as a 12-month or even a two-year moratorium.  If people have a loan over five or ten years and have made the constant repayments every month on the button, those who have worked hard to gain this reputation should certainly be considered again.</P>
        <P>We are playing our part to keep banking alive in the country, as has been pointed out by the Senator, and there has been significant investment by the taxpayer.  In their hour of need, surely we must have an influence if we have 25% of the shares of the two major banks on the island.  I will inquire further on this and perhaps we can discuss it with the Minister for Finance when the Finance Bill comes before the House in two weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Larry Butler outlined to the House the good news on wind energy innovations which are taking place through two or three consortia.  I know Senator Butler has taken the spirit of Irish innovators through the House for all Members to hear and to witness their inventions in the near future.  We have an opportunity in Ireland and in a short time &mdash; perhaps ten years &mdash; we could become a user of clean new energy and perhaps even export it in coming years.  It could be a significant asset, as the raw material costs nothing.  From that perspective, I welcome the Senator&rsquo;s announcement and we can have a debate on that when necessary.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for a debate on social partnership and I have no difficulty in having time left aside for this also.  The matter of sitting days next week will be decided by how business progresses today.  We will come back to the House this evening on that matter.</P>

	<P>I was making the point that services relating to the provision of information, advice and counselling to a birth parent wishing to consider placing a child for adoption already exist in many instances.  The principal intention behind the amendment is not to institute these services but rather to obtain recognition in respect of them in legislation.  In view of the fact that the services to which I refer already exist, it is somewhat odd that reference is not made to them in the legislation.  The Bill would be strengthened if it referred to them.  Some later sections contain completely extraneous material, particularly that which refers to the Hague Convention.  The legislation, therefore, refers to a number of matters that are irrelevant.  However, the matter to which I refer, which is germane, is not mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 14 provides for the mother or guardian placing a child for adoption to be supplied with a written statement explaining that the placement is the beginning of the adoption process, the effect of an adoption order and the consents necessary, and requires that the mother or guardian sign a document stating that he or she understands the import of the written statement.  Mothers are always treated sensitively in respect of these issues, particularly with regard to their individual circumstances, and this will continue to be the case.  There are many agencies involved in the support of mothers who are in crisis and who may be considering adoption.  I accept that in this Bill we are not specifically providing for such counselling.  However, it is my intention to consider this amendment for inclusion on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and I welcome his indication that the amendment will be considered for inclusion on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  However, I regret that he did not introduce an alternative amendment in this House.  Some 84 amendments to this Bill have been tabled by Senators from different parties and the Minister of State has not indicated a willingness to accept any of them.  He has not tabled any alternatives but has merely brought forward two minor technical amendments.  When points are made in good faith and when people carry out research and work with agencies that are interested in matters such <Col N="420"/>as those to which the legislation refers, it would be in the interests of democracy and the reputation of the Seanad if the Government considered accepting Opposition amendments on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>We want to improve the legislation and highlight the concerns of those who are experts in this area and who have stated that the Bill could be strengthened by the inclusion of amendments such as that under discussion.  The Government has been in power for 12 years and during that period there has been a diminution in its willingness to accept amendments tabled by Opposition Members.  I was a Member of the Houses when such amendments were accepted in good faith.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is considering the amendment for inclusion on Committee Stage in the Lower House, but I regret that an alternative was not introduced in this House.</P>

We are all on the same page in respect of the issue under discussion and I have accepted the principle behind the amendment.  We will find a way to ensure that provision is made in respect of this matter in the legislation.  The two Houses will act in unison in respect of this matter and I do not believe there is any division in terms of our motivation with regard to it.  No discourtesy is intended by my stating that the amendment is accepted, in principle, and that it will be transposed into the legislation in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>j</i>) providing post placement support, advice and counselling to birth and adoptive parents;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is similar to amendment No. 6.  However, it deals with the issues that arise post-placement.  It suggests that the Bill should also contain, at its core, the concept of providing post-placement support, advice and counselling to birth and adoptive parents.  This is a recognition that certain issues can arise following placement.  In the context of the Russian bilateral agreement, for example, concerns have been raised with regard to post-placement reports not being sent.  Perhaps the Minister of State will state whether reports in respect of this matter are accurate.  If they are accurate, will he indicate why that was the case and how such a development has inhibited our relationship with the Russian authorities.  Perhaps he will also indicate why the required post-placement reports &mdash; I presume these were to be supplied by the HSE &mdash; were not provided.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 is designed to strengthen the concept of the State having a responsibility to provide post-placement support, advice and counselling to birth and adoptive parents.  As stated, it also recognises that post-placement issues can arise.  Like amendment No. 6, it highlights a matter that is not dealt with in the Bill.  The position would be strengthened if provision was made in respect of the matter to which I refer.  Such provision would also ensure that support, advice, counselling or whatever is required to ensure that a placement is successful is provided following such a placement.</P>
        <P>I take on board what the Minister of State said with regard to his discussions with the Vietnamese authorities in respect of the interests of the child being at the core.  Such interests <Col N="421"/>and those of parents would be placed at the core if the type of provision contained in the amendment were built into the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment, which represents a further stage of development on the position we considered in the context of the previous amendment.  I am of the view that amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are closely related because we are moving on to deal not just with the birth parents but also with the adoptive parents, namely, those who are assuming responsibility for the child.</P>
        <P>This is an extremely important matter.  The point I made in respect of amendment No. 6 stands and is even more relevant.  At present, adoption agencies of various kinds provide intermediary information and tracing services to birth parents, adopted adults who may wish to discover the nature of their origins and adoptive families.  However, the legislation leaves a gap and does not provide any legislative basis for this work.  There is no support from the Legislature for the work being done in this area by support bodies, which is of considerable concern to those involved professionally.  They would like to have proper recognition and a legislative basis to support them in their provision of services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of post-placement support, advice and counselling to birth and adoptive parents would be a worthwhile and important addition to the Bill.  It should be a matter of normal and regular practice in this area.  If it were in place, we would not likely have had the recent hiccup with the Russian adoption process.</P>
        <P>There are two sides to the story of adoption.  A birth parent gives up much when handing over their child for adoption.  The least they deserve, and to reinforce that the decision they made was a good one, is to know how their child is progressing in the form of a note or a photograph.  It would also be useful if the Health Service Executive or the assessment agency involved gave its professional view on how the adopted child was doing.</P>
        <P>Post-placement support is also important for the adoptive parent because they will have moved to a new stage in rearing the child.  This would provide a useful link between the birth parents and the adoptive parents.  Post-placement support closes off the circle.  If we were bound by law to provide that support, we would not find ourselves in the crisis we have with Russia.  I support the measure and look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s support for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>We have done extensive work in finding out what the issue is with post-placement reports and the Russian authorities.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question on the matter, I stated there are 34 missing post-placement reports out of a total of 450 from last year.  The majority of the outstanding reports have been completed and are with adoptive parents for translation and notarisation.  In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to have a home visit with their social worker.</P>
        <P>Russia has blacklisted another 19 countries in the inter-country adoption process.  We have liaised with the Russian embassy to find out how many reports it considers are missing.  The Adoption Authority and the Health Service Executive have written to the parents in question, reminding them of their obligations which arise out of an affidavit they swore at the time of the adoption to provide post-placement reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State clarify whether the figure 450 refers to the total number of adoptions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive completed over 450 reports last year in respect of children adopted from the Russian Federation.  Pact, An Adoption Alliance, has not been blacklisted by the Russian authorities but it only completed seven last year.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="422"/>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure refers to 450 reports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Healy Eames, the only Member who has the right to come back in is the proposer of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure refers to reports for over one year.  In any case, much progress has been made on this issue.  It is an issue that we have in common with other countries, unfortunately.  The Russian authorities, I believe, simply decided to put the foot down to ensure they had all materials contemporaneously and there would be no delays in the furnishing of these post-placement reports.  It is a legitimate policy decision on their part.  We are trying to comply with this as quickly as possible and to allay fears on it.</P>
        <P>Regarding the amendment, a difference has to be clarified between post-placement and post-adoption.  In a domestic situation, placement is one matter and the adoption order follows that.  We must be clear about the two different interpretations of this.  On Committee Stage I pointed out that in Ireland an adoption is a termination of the relationship between the natural parent and the child.  As such, the child is treated in law the same as any other child.  Once the obligation to notify the Adoption Authority of bringing the child into the State or the placement of the child kicks in, there is also an obligation to notify the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The protections afforded to all children in the State are afforded to an adopted child under the Child Care Act 1991.  People always want to ensure adopted children are treated the same as other children.  Obviously the Health Service Executive has expertise in knowing what issues arise in adoption.  These issues are dealt with under the Child Care Act.  I, therefore, resist this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure why the Minister of State is resisting it.  If one takes the Russian situation, there are 34 missing post-placement reports.  The Russian authorities have decided to put their foot down and, probably rightly so, request the reports.  This links with a later amendment as to whether the Health Service Executive has the resources to do the necessary work in this area.  Given that this is an ongoing issue and that post-placement reports are required and are good practice, I am still not clear as to why the Minister of State is not accepting this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The protections afforded to non-adopted children are also afforded to adopted children under the Child Care Act.  If the concern is related to post-placement reports, that is a separate issue.  It is not an obligation of the Adoption Authority.</P>
        <P>There is also the constitutional issue of the right of any family to exclude a person from insisting on a post-placement report.  Under the Constitution, a family does not have an obligation to furnish information about its children to any statutory authority for the benefit of a third country.  That is why there is no statutory obligation in this regard.  The Health Service Executive and the Adoption Authority have facilitated adoptive parents in attempting to comply with requirements from countries such as Russia that wish to obtain post-placement information.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 19, line 33, after &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or of an accredited body&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is obvious from the debates on the earlier amendments that the Health Service Executive is in no position to provide all the supports necessary in this area.  This amendment allows such supports to be provided by other accredited bodies, a perfectly proper and appropriate proposal.  I hope on this occasion the Minister of State will address the amendment and not allow himself to be seduced into the byways as he was with the previous amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not want to venture into the byways.  The Minister of State could easily have accepted it because it was directly analogous to the preceding amendment.  If he accepts one, it is daft that he does not accept the other.  They are bound by the idea that in this human situation both adoptive and adoptee families should be given as much support as possible.  We are suggesting the addition of the phrase &ldquo;an accredited body&rdquo;, in other words, the organisations which have done sterling work in supporting families.  I grudgingly admit they have also done sterling work in lobbying us on these issues.</P>
        <P>This appears to me a reasonable amendment and I will not throw a tantrum if the Minister of State is prepared to accept the principle of it and consider its reintroduction in the other House.  I realise he will not do so in this House.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  This is the first time in our debate on the Bill that we have raised the issue of accredited agencies.  I have tabled a number of amendments which allow accredited agencies as well as the HSE to take action under the Bill.  When I raised this issue during our last debate on the Bill, I understood from the Minister of State&rsquo;s response that he was against the idea of an accredited agency and was satisfied the HSE was competent to do the necessary work.  However, I since read in an interview in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> that he now agrees that the concept of an accredited agency would be useful in dealing with the well-documented problems this country faces in terms of waiting lists for adoption assessments.</P>
        <P>It is completely unacceptable that people have to wait years for assessments which are relatively straightforward.  Certain established procedures must be followed, various people are interviewed and references are checked.  The waiting lists exist because there is a shortage of the personnel required to do this work in a timely and efficient manner.  These delays are particularly distressing for couples who become ineligible because of age limits and who in many cases have already undergone fertility treatments.  I am sure the Minister of State read the two letters on this subject in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  For quite some time we have had a failed system of assessment with the result that children and parents have been left in limbo. <Col N="424"/> The two letters in <i>The Irish Times</i> say it all.  It is clearly beyond the HSE&rsquo;s capabilities at present to conduct adoption assessments in an efficient and speedy manner.  It is not that organisation&rsquo;s fault because it has not been adequately resourced to do the job requested of it.  It is in an impossible situation.</P>
        <P>A leading article by Carl O&rsquo;Brien in <i>The Irish Times</i> today reports that social workers in Wexford simply cannot deal with their caseloads.  These social workers, who are part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s area of responsibility, lack sufficient resources to meet all the demands made of them.  That article also reveals that hundreds of children who are at risk have not been allocated social workers and their cases are on the shelves of offices around the country.  We are debating this Bill in the context of the Monageer report, which clearly reveals that two children and two adults were failed despite the fact they were contacted at a very early stage when the parents were recognised as having disabilities.  Even though they were in contact with a range of organisations and were assessed by numerous experts, the system failed.  The capacity of the HSE to assess couples on waiting lists is a serious matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris has moved an amendment that develops for the first time in the context of this Bill the concept of an accredited body.  This would involve a body other than the HSE which would operate to the standards set out in the Bill.  It is critical that the highest standards apply to any agency working in this area.  The Minister of State has stated he believes in the concept of an accredited body, perhaps after reflecting on the discussions in this House.  However, he has not brought an amendment to provide for such an agency.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about legislation and if words are to mean anything, now is the time to make such an amendment.  This is our first opportunity to discuss an accredited body which would have delegated powers and responsibility for adoption assessment.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard because for too long we have been approached by families who were distressed by the length of time assessments take.  I do not for a moment claim this is a simple process and I recognise the issues involved are highly complex.  Clearly, however, the State has failed to provide a workable and reasonable system.  The endless delays only add to the distress of those who seek to adopt.  Those who have shared their concerns with us about Vietnam and Russia have already experienced incredible delays in the adoption process.  They have encountered social workers who were not replaced while on maternity leave and assessments which were promised but never happened or were postponed for two or three years.  This is the context for our proposal on accredited bodies.  If I thought the system was working, I would not call for the establishment of such bodies.  It is clear, however, that the system is broken in terms of adoption assessments and we need to consider alternatives.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  He is probably the first Government Member to admit the system is broken.  It is about time somebody did something about it in order to make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  Ireland&rsquo;s adoption societies and agencies have built up significant expertise and can provide suitable staff for an accreditation organisation.  The system could work if it were streamlined in this way.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s change of heart, if the newspaper reports are correct, and I hope he will clarify whether he intends to proceed with the concept of an accredited body.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald.  It is great that the Minister of State acknowledged the executive could also be interchanged with an accredited body for the reasons Senator Fitzgerald outlined.  The waiting time for assessment is unacceptable because by the time many couples find out they have a difficulty conceiving a child and have pursued fertility treatment and other investigations and can afford to buy their own home, they are in their late 30s.  They join assessment waiting lists and by the time they are approved for adoption <Col N="425"/>of a child, they could be in their mid-40s.  It is unacceptable as couples lose many good child rearing years, which can have an impact on the quality of parenting and so on.</P>
        <P>It introduces a great deal of sadness into a couple&rsquo;s lives that an agency is holding up their lives.  Many couples have described the HSE as acting like God.  There is no question that the assessment needs to be rigorous because the process is ultimately about the child and not the couple.  We have a good record in this jurisdiction in parenting and providing good adoptive parents but it is not acceptable that the HSE can hold up people&rsquo;s lives to this extent.  I welcome the establishment of an accredited body which has clear terms of reference and which uses strict criteria and high standards.  The Minister of State should examine how it is funded and perhaps a significant amount of work could be taken from the HSE because it is clear on many fronts that the executive is not coping with children&rsquo;s issues.</P>
        <P>Child protection is in crisis.  There have been many child abuse cases.  We have had the Monageer and Cloyne reports and the Ombudsman for Children recently suspended an investigation because the HSE would not co-operate.  How can the executive respond to all these investigations?  It is not managing, yet prospective adoptive couples face waits of between three and five years for assessment.  There is great merit in putting an accredited body in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Our vision through this legislation should be to deliver a compassionate revision of the existing circumstances in which people who want to adopt children find themselves.  It is cruel to prospective adoptive parents that they must hang on for between six and ten years for approval.  This is totally unnecessary.  I agree families must be scrutinised rigorously but if we can speed up the process through the enactment of this legislation, we will make a dramatic change in the lives of people who want to adopt children.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald and Healy Eames mentioned the Monageer report.  I have some sympathy with the argument about the lack of resources in the HSE but why were 27 pages of the report blacked out and seven recommendations left out?  This is not only about lack of resources and one must read between the blacked out lines.  The HSE has buckets of money with an annual budget of &euro;14.5 billion and 111,000 staff.  We are making great progress in improvements in the HSE but it needs to prioritise radically where it is spending its money and what are the areas of greatest need.</P>
        <P>As I said to the Minister of State in another arena yesterday, the primary recommendation in the Monageer report is the provision of a 24 hours a day, seven days a week social work service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not debating the Monageer report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>My two colleagues were freely allowed to discuss it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>They mentioned it in passing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>They went on about it and I am entitled to do the same.  We are debating the HSE&rsquo;s resources.  The executive needs to become much more efficient and reallocate its human resources.  It does not seem to have the ability of the private sector to manage.</P>
        <P>The next four recommendations in the Monageer report relate to garda&iacute; reporting to their immediate managers, garda&iacute; reporting to the HSE and so on.  These are common-sense recommendations and they refer to the normal way of doing business.  Serious warnings were issued about the family involved in this case and nobody, other than the undertaker, used his or her common sense.  Officials should have reported concerns to their managers in the HSE or elsewhere.  The issue is people doing their jobs, not financial resources.  People will become complacent because many pages in the report have been blacked out and this could lead them to <Col N="426"/>believe that if they do not do their job properly, they will not be exposed.  The report demonstrates clearly that local HSE problems were dumped on the Garda, which was not fair.</P>
        <P>There is no difference of opinion among political parties about the Bill.   We all support it and people who are calling on us and asking for help all concur that Deputy Barry Andrews is an outstanding Minister of State and they are lucky to have him in this Ministry as this time.  We must energise the system and speed up the process and time involved in parents adopting their child following approval.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the Dowse case yesterday and a colleague and I had an exchange over it.  If my comments on it were hurtful to anybody, I sincerely apologise because it was the last thing I intended.  This is a serious human issue.  People&rsquo;s emotions have been seriously disturbed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to declarations of eligibility and suitability, about which I commented in the media.  Section 37(3) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) As soon as practicable after the Health Service Executive receives an application under <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Health Service Executive shall take the following steps concerning the adoption proposed under the separate application referred to in <i>subsection (2)(b)</i> or arrange for the steps to be taken by an accredited body ... (<i>b</i>) carrying out an assessment of eligibility and suitability in relation to the applicants[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is permitted in the Bill.  Nevertheless, that does not address the problem that we must set up an appropriate body and give it the appropriate powers to do the declaration of assessment.  This is concerned with the assessment of eligibility and suitability, and that remains to be done.  I have undertaken to speak with the associations, with the advice of the Attorney General, to determine what we can do within that section.  It is to do with the eligibility and the assessment.  As I said, it is not fair to have a prolonged system of assessment that creates stresses in families.  Equally, even if it was foreshortened, it does not mean that stresses will not be caused by this process, because it is stressful.  I have met couples who have been through assessments other than by the Health Service Executive who find it stressful.  It can create stresses in marriages and relationships.  We have to remove that part that is unnecessarily prolonged because of bureaucracy.  That is my determination.</P>
        <P>On the issues raised about child protection, when I was appointed Minister of State I said child protection would be my priority, and it has been my priority.  In the past year we have made significant progress in developing structures, changes and reforms in the area, including announcements I made in recent weeks.  In the first instance the HSE has agreed to appoint an individual who will be solely responsible for children and families.  That is the first time that has happened nationally in our health services structure.  For the first time we will have somebody who will parallel, on an implementation level, the policy responsibility that I and the Office of the Minister for Children has had since it was set up to underline our commitment to this area as a Government.</P>
        <P>We have also set up a task force to address the legacy of the former health boards whereby referrals are done in a different way in different health board areas.  They have passed down through the local health offices and we have now almost completed a process of standardisation which will ensure we will have a single national way of referring, assessing risk and determining waiting lists.  In that way we will know where the problems are &mdash; I recognise problems exist and I would not have set it as a priority if they did not &mdash; and allocate resources accordingly.  We will be able to understand where the gaps are.  We also need to bring this into the information technology era to ensure we have a data bank of resources.</P><Col N="427"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White hit the nail on the head.  There has been much mention of out -of-hours resources in regard to Monageer.  That was the key finding.  It has been acknowledged, however, that an out-of-hours service probably would not have saved the lives of that tragic family but what is also recommended in the report is better co-ordination among agencies.  That is why I believe that if we standardise the way the different health offices work in terms of child protection and give them the facility to share the information using technology, there is a possibility that at any one time we can X-ray the system to see where children are at risk, where the numbers are greatest and where the resource allocations need to be reconsidered.</P>
        <P>I was also pleased to announce that social workers are exempt from the recruitment embargo in the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That again underlines the fact that we recognise this is an area of major priority.</P>
        <P>Having made the point about section 37 it might clarify the reason this part of the Bill, page 19, Part 3, concerns the placement for adoption.  The section the Senator is attempting to amend, section 12, concerns the statutory authorities rather than any accredited body and allowing them permission to enter the home in circumstances where they wish to make or recognise an adoption.  It has nothing to do with the assessment process.  I hope the point I made on section 37 explains the reason I will not support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is because we are on Report Stage that there are so many references to reports of various kinds.  There was a reference to the absence of proper reports in the Russian situation and now we have mention of the Monageer report, which is not directly relevant but since it has been opened up by Senators and by the Minister of State, I will mention it. What concerns me principally about the Monageer report &mdash; I said this on the Order of Business &mdash; is not the blacking out of sections on legal advice but the fact that seven of the recommendations were deleted.  How in the name of God can we function effectively as a Parliament if in monitoring the implementation of these recommendations nobody is allowed to know what they are except two citizens of this State?  That is absurd.  There are ways around that.  The way around it &mdash; the Minister of State probably knows this because it has been done previously &mdash; is to read them into the record of either House of the Oireachtas or of a privileged committee of the House.  It then becomes part of the record and we are protected against any legal recourse in so doing.  I recommend the Minister to consider this option, not perhaps with regard to all of it.  I am not one of those who goes around looking for heads on a plate.  That is largely a waste of time, but we ought to know what are the recommendations.  The Minister of State might consider reading those into the record of the House and giving us his answer.</P>
        <P>I unreservedly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that there is no embargo on the recruitment of social workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely hope he is right.  Will he comment, as Minister with responsibility for children, on the article on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>  about a report which states that thousands of children at risk of abuse have no social worker?  How can that be explained if there is no embargo on the recruitment of social workers?  Why is it not being done?  One third of the 21,000 children who were reported as being at risk have no social worker.  If there is no embargo we are entitled to ask why that is the case.  The report states <Col N="428"/>that the cases where there is information to suggest the child is at immediate risk of harm should receive the highest priority.  I will leave that matter because I want to deal with the amendment.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, the Minister has helpfully drawn our attention to the existence of the phrase I wish to insert, namely, &ldquo;or of an accredited body&rdquo;.  I welcome the fact that this phrase exists so that there is an acknowledgement at a later point in the Bill.  It does not appear that there is any insuperable difficulty in accepting the addition of &ldquo;or of an accredited body&rdquo; at this point.</P>
        <P>I had difficulty in hearing it but the Minister made some reference to legal advice he has received.  Will he disclose that to the House if he is saying that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of what?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not mention anything about legal advice, to the best of my<?oasys _jy ?>recollection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legal advice in existence independent of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say there was no legal objection, I am just saying I did not say anything about legal advice.</P>

	<P>The Minister can contribute again.  Senator Norris, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it was something different.  The Minister will no doubt let us know if there is legal advice to the effect that there is a difficulty.  I do not imagine that could possibly be the case but the Minister might be frank with us and acknowledge if it is the case and, if so, he might indicate what it is.  It cannot be a financial difficulty because if it was a financial difficulty this amendment would have been ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach on the basis that it would create a charge on the Exchequer.  The fact that the amendment has survived is clear and cogent proof that there is no financial implication.  Otherwise, to quote the late and not so great Lord Denning, it would be an appalling vista that the Cathaoirleach had misadvised himself and the House on this matter and permitted an illegal amendment to be discussed.</P>

	<P>A sullied man now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, exactly.  For those reasons I would like the Minister to tease out the matter first and address those questions.  Admittedly, one of them deals with the Monageer report and the problem with the recommendations.  They are the crucial issues.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the appointment of social workers is not embargoed but, if not, why are thousands of children at risk?  With regard to the amendment, this phrase already exists in the legislation at the Minister&rsquo;s behest.  In the absence of either a legal or financial impediment and taking account of the fact, for which I am very grateful, that there has been very supportive debate by all Senators from all shades of opinion and all parties and none, the Minister might find it in his heart to go a little further in accepting this idea.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="429"/>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, I said that Part 3 of the Bill concerns placement for adoption.  The statutory authorities, the Adoption Authority and the HSE have the right, under section 12, to visit the home of the child or the guardian for the purpose of placement.  It is solely that issue.  It would not be appropriate for any other body to have a right to enter or visit the home created on a statutory basis.  That is my opinion and it is why I am resisting this amendment.  The concerns the Senator raised about the assessment process are dealt with later in the Bill.  If I did so, I did not mean to say that legal advice was specifically sought on this issue.  It was not.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 15, 16, 26, 30 and 31 are related to amendment No. 9.  Amendment No. 16 is a technical alternative to amendment No. 15 and amendment No. 31 is a technical alternative to amendment No. 30.  Is it agreed that amendments Nos. 9, 15, 16, 26, 30 and 31 be discussed together?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the birth of the child has been registered, and either the particulars of the father have been registered or the mother has sworn and furnished to the accredited body a statutory declaration that the father is unknown or missing, and cannot be traced using reasonable inquiries, unless the court permits placement notwithstanding a failure or refusal to swear such a statutory declaration,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill does not specifically require a child&rsquo;s birth to be registered before placement for adoption.  This is an omission.  More fundamentally, the father&rsquo;s details should be registered where adoption is contemplated unless the mother completes a statutory declaration to the effect that the father is unknown or missing and cannot be traced using reasonable inquiries.  We believe the father&rsquo;s rights should be enhanced in this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  Are the amendments being taken separately in terms of proposing and seconding them?</P>

	<P>They are being discussed together but each one will be individually proposed and seconded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with all the amendments in the group.  Amendment No. 9 relates to the conditions for adoption, many of which are included in the Bill at a later stage.  We support the suggestion but the right of the father to be consulted is dealt with later in the Bill.  Perhaps Senator Prendergast or Senator Norris will clarify amendment No. 15 as it appears to limit the rights of fathers to be consulted.  Why would consulting the father be detrimental to the interests of the child?  I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response to that amendment.  We support amendment No. 16.  Amendment No. 26 relates to the father&rsquo;s rights if his name is on the birth certificate.  It is a reasonable proposal.  Amendment No. 31, proposed by Fine Gael, deals with the situation where the father is unavailable because of a criminal offence.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="430"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Labour Party amendment.  Amendments Nos. 15 and 30 are in my name.  They are similarly worded.  I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response to them.  It is a function of this House to tease out the implications of legislation not just in areas where we have direct concern ourselves but also on behalf of people who request that these matters be examined.  I understand Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s diffidence in addressing my amendments because they appear to curtail the rights of the biological father.  This is an important issue and one on which the public commentator, Mr. John Waters, has been extremely vocal in defending the rights of natural fathers.  He and a substantial lobby group of fathers have been vociferous in expressing their views.</P>
        <P>I had some reservations about putting down the amendment because I believe there is a natural interest on the part of the biological father in the fate, welfare and destiny of any offspring.  However, for these amendments to come into operation the responsible authority &mdash; one assumes such an authority would be responsible &mdash; would have the right to decide to place the child for adoption without extensive consultation with the natural father in a situation where it had been clearly demonstrated that this would be detrimental to the best interests of the child.  Curiously, on one occasion in the past I was involved in a situation where the guardians and mother of a child, in particular circumstances which it would not be appropriate to outline in the House, clearly believed that the best interests of the child would most emphatically not be served by any awakening of interest in the father, whose connection with the mother was casual in the extreme.  He was a person of quite suspect character whose interest in the child might be awakened and might turn out to be malign.  These are very unusual circumstances.  It is because of my knowledge of this situation that I put forward the amendment.  I respect the rights of biological fathers.</P>
        <P>The second clause in the amendment deals with the issue of delay.  Again, I am anxious to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.  It is perhaps not wholly appropriate to say so but my support for this part of the amendment is a little lukewarm.  Although I acknowledge the passionate feelings of prospective parents in wishing to accelerate the proceedings, one must be very careful to ensure that whatever delay is involved is indeed undue.  Taking the language at face value, the amendment provides that it must be demonstrated that the situation would be detrimental to the child, as provided in (<i>a</i>), or that the delay would be undue, as provided in (<i>b</i>).  With those two provisos I am prepared to put the amendment before the House.  I await with interest the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their comments.  There is a range of amendments to consider.  The amendments are related to each other in that they deal with consents to the making of an adoption order and the placing of a child for adoption.  When considering whether to accept the amendments we must have cognisance of sections 16 to 18 because they go into much greater detail on the rights of the father and enhance the rights of the father while balancing them against the paramount interest, namely, that of the child, and also of the mother.</P>
        <P>Section 16 refers to the right of the father to be consulted on the placement of a child for adoption.  Section 17 requires the accredited body to take reasonable steps to ensure the father has been consulted.  Section 18 deals with circumstances where the father&rsquo;s consent can be dispensed with on the authority of the High Court.  In that three-stage strategy we try to introduce a balance in favour of a father&rsquo;s rights against the mother&rsquo;s rights and the child&rsquo;s paramount rights to be considered in any issue relating to the placement of a child for adoption.  The later amendments in the group consider the father&rsquo;s rights on consent.  We are dealing with the same principle in two different parts of the adoption process.</P><Col N="431"/>
        <P>I accept that the amendment is well motivated but the concerns are addressed in the provisions of sections 16 to 18 and in the consents section later in the Bill.  The concerns that have been raised have been adequately dealt with and reflect properly the balance that is required.  One should bear in mind that, overall, this is a child-centred approach and the interests of the child are paramount.  We have tried also to introduce such safeguards to ensure fathers are properly given an opportunity to object to consent in an informed way and that they are given all the support necessary to make those decisions.  The decision in question is a life-long one and every step must be taken to ensure the decision made by the adoption authority is made in full knowledge of everybody who has a right prior to the adoption being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 16 merely gives a right to the father to apply to be consulted on adoption.  It is extraordinarily insulting and offensive to put in legislation that a father has only a right to be consulted about his own child being permanently removed from him.  It is almost unbelievable that this minimal level of protection is proposed in law in 2009.  I would like to see fathers protected in this situation by providing that fathers who are named on a birth certificate can veto adoption unless the court gives the go-ahead.</P>
        <P>The power to dispense with any attempt even to notify the father is much too wide.  The High Court can dispense with any notice to the father if that is deemed inappropriate.  We suggest that this measure needs to be tightened up considerably.  If the conception of the child was the result of an offence such as rape or incest there should be no need to notify the father but otherwise notification should be given.  That was the reason for the amendment.</P>
        <P>It is presumed that unless the contrary is shown that the welfare of the child is best promoted in the society of both the child&rsquo;s natural parents.  In effect, that test arises from the Supreme Court decision N <i>v.</i> HSE.  The welfare of the child is not a free-standing concept and there must be a presumption that welfare is best promoted in the natural family unless the contrary is shown.  Welfare is not to be reduced to a financial-type contest between natural parents and perhaps more well-heeled adoptive parents.  That was the reason that amendment was proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is child centred.  The Child Care Act understands the concept of children&rsquo;s rights in the context of the rights of parents which, as we are aware, are established in the Constitution.  However, the adoption process is a final break between a natural parent and a child and, as such, that process must be concluded with all due consideration.  Reference was made to section 17, which includes the provision that if a father objects to a placement, the process will be suspended for a period of not less than 21 days to allow the father to apply for guardianship under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  That is another safeguard and if that is unsuccessful one still has the right to apply to the High Court to determine the matter.  A sufficient number of checks and balances are included in the Bill.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I wish to ask the Minister of State about the reference to the Hague Convention in Part 2.  The placing of the explanatory report in the Oireachtas Library is completely superfluous.  It does <Col N="432"/>not mean anything.  Perhaps I will speak to the Minister of State about that in private.  I presume I could have had an opportunity to talk about it on the section.</P>
        <P>The amendment seeks to impose a limitation.  The idea of undue delay and accelerating the process arises again.  Amendment No. 14 specifies &ldquo;not more than 35 days&rdquo;.  Again, as I understand it, that is to try to limit the delay.  Section 17(3)(<i>b</i>)(<i>i</i>) states: &ldquo;[N]otify the father and the mother in writing in the prescribed manner that the accredited body is deferring the placement for a period specified in the notice, not being less than 21 days&rdquo;.  My intention is to remove the phrase &ldquo;not being less than&rdquo; and to make the period specific at 21 days.  The aim is to ensure that rather than being a minimum period, it is the exact period.  Again, I do this on the advice of one of the lobbying groups.</P>

	<P>We suggest in this amendment that the timeframe of 35 days would be more realistic.  A period of 21 days is too short.  For example, a person might change address or a letter could be lost owing to postal difficulties.  A change to 35 days would give the father sufficient time for reflection.  That is a slightly different point from that made by Senator Norris whose amendment refers to three weeks in this context.  I appreciate that we want to be child centred on this and that the Minister of State is balancing various rights.  The amendment suggests that 35 days would give a little bit more time to the father to reflect and for people to contact him to be sure of his views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Just before the phrase &ldquo;not less than 21 days&rdquo; on the top of page 22, the Bill refers to &ldquo;the placement specified in the notice&rdquo;.  Therefore, there is a specification of a period, and this should be not less than 21 days.  We are dealing with a situation where a father is objecting to his child being placed with an adopted parent.  It is quite a significant thing, so some flexibility is required.  We are saying that not less than 21 days should be specified in the notice period.  In any case, the likely scenarios cover a much broader spectrum.  Experience tells us that this discretionary approach is warranted.  It upholds the balances in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  We believe that a minimum period of not less than 21 days is the correct period because it is an issue of such obvious importance.  Once the father applies for guardianship, the child cannot be placed until those proceedings are determined, so there is a further period.  I would not be inclined to accept these amendments.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment arose at an earlier stage.  We had some discussion about it when Senator Bacik tabled it.  I certainly felt that it was worth discussing with the Minister of State on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 17 is a technical amendment about the mother co-operating with the father&rsquo;s identity in the consent procedure, as are amendments Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive and amendments Nos. 32 and 34.  Senator Bacik addressed this issue in quite a lot of detail on Committee Stage, and I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful to Senator Fitzgerald for outlining the background to these amendments.  I tabled them on Committee Stage and I was supported by Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Norris and others.  The sense of them is not about changing the meaning of any of the relevant provisions but rather to change the language.  The language used is based on the previous version of these provisions is judgmental and reflects a view of the mother as being in some way unco-operative.  The word used is that the mother &ldquo;refuses&rdquo; to reveal the father&rsquo;s identity.  The reality is that when mothers are putting their babies up for adoption, it is a deeply traumatic personal circumstance that means that they cannot keep the baby.  There may be all sorts of reasons for which they cannot reveal the father&rsquo;s identity.  To suggest that it is a wilful refusal implies a judgment or a condemnation of the mother in some way.  That is the wrong sort of language to be placing in a Bill about adoption which is about putting the rights of the child uppermost but also about recognising the human tragedy of the mother&rsquo;s situation, who is making the dreadfully difficult decision of putting her child up for adoption.</P>
        <P>I would like to see us change the language.  I do not want to change the meaning because it is important that mothers are encouraged to reveal the father&rsquo;s identity for the sake of their children.  This amendment would not change the meaning of the Bill but it would change the message we are sending to mothers in this situation if we said that instead of the mother refusing to reveal, we spoke about the mother who does not reveal the father&rsquo;s identity.  There is no judgment in that case.  It might be because she is unable to do so as she does not know him.  There would be many reasons she would not know the father&rsquo;s name and it may not be anything like a wilful refusal.</P>
        <P>The further amendments are in the same vein.  There is a sense in which the implication behind the language currently used is that the mother&rsquo;s co-operation is not forthcoming with the adoption authorities.  That is not helpful and it would be better to describe the mother as assisting rather than co-operating.  It is really a change in language to change the message we are sending to mothers in this very difficult personal decision.  The Minister of State accepted that I had a point on the message underlying the language and I would be grateful to hear if he has considered changing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I largely support the arguments made by Senator Bacik and Senator Fitzgerald.  They have done us a service by tabling these amendments.  One would want to avoid any element of coercion of the mother, and that is the one thing that concerns me.  By using words like &ldquo;persuading&rdquo; and so on, it feels as if moral pressure is being put on mothers.</P>
        <P>It is sometimes possible that there could be a wilful refusal.  There can also be other kinds of refusals that concern issues beyond not providing the identity of the father.  An act can be deliberate without being wilful and an act in these circumstances could be deliberate without being malicious and could also be in the interests of the child.  I can envisage circumstances in support of the use of the term &ldquo;does not&rdquo; or the inclusion of some additional phrase.  The mother may not be in a position to reveal the identity of the father for a variety of reasons.  For example, she could be unconscious or in a vegetative state.  If I applied my mind to it, I could think of a number of circumstances in which it would be impossible or ill advised for the mother to reveal the identity of the father.</P><Col N="434"/>
        <P>I am happy to support these amendments but the matter needs to be examined in greater depth.  Perhaps the Minister of State can give a commitment to do that before the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment. We discussed this issue at length on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State indicated he would look at the language.  As Senator Bacik says, it is not about the meaning but about using kinder language.  Instead of using the word &ldquo;refuses&rdquo;, we can use &ldquo;does not&rdquo; instead.  Words such as the former could cast the mother in a very poor light and we do not know the circumstances, which may be harrowing for a mother, that would make it difficult for her to co-operate.  I ask the Minister of State to look again at the language in this part of the Bill while retaining the thrust of the meaning.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion is made in amendment No. 17 that we replace the term &ldquo;refuses to&rdquo; with &ldquo;does not&rdquo;.  There are further consequent and related amendments.  In my view, it is almost impossible to change the language of a Bill without, as Senator Bacik suggested, changing its meaning.  If we use the term &ldquo;refuses to&rdquo; in one section and &ldquo;does not&rdquo; in another, inevitably that contrast will be pointed out by lawyers and it will be assumed the Oireachtas meant one thing in one section and something else in another section.</P>
        <P>While I am sympathetic to the concept, I believe there is an absolute obligation on us to underline the seriousness of the refusal or failure &mdash; whatever the phrase one chooses to use &mdash; of a mother to provide the name of the father, if at all possible.  We must remember this is a child centred policy from which so much flows.  A child has a right to know his or her father.  We must underline that seriousness by the inclusion of these words.  They are not meant as an admonition but are used to underline the seriousness of this issue.  As Senator Bacik stated, there may be many reasons this has come to pass.  While some people may be offended by these words others might be encouraged by them to reveal the father&rsquo;s name or identity, which is in the child&rsquo;s interest.</P>
        <P>While I accept the motivation of the amendment, to safeguard children&rsquo;s human rights the wording used must remain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a good discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and in this House.  I agree with the Minister of State on the right of the child to know and have access to his or her father.  That is absolutely critical.  Some countries have mandatory obligations in this regard.  It is an issue which should be examined in context.</P>
        <P>The reason behind these technical amendments is the punitive language used in respect of a mother.  Perhaps the Minister of State will consider the addition of the term &ldquo;does not&rdquo; when this matter comes before the D&aacute;il.  That might be a way of dealing with this which covers both eventualities.  There may well be circumstances where the mother would not be able to state the identity of the father, including that she does not know it.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 28, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">31.&mdash;(1) In this section, &ldquo;a contact order&rdquo; means an order requiring the person with whom a child lives, or is to live, to allow the child to visit or stay with the person named in the order, or for that person and the child otherwise to have contact with each other.</P><Col N="437"/>
        <P LI="2">(2) Where the father is consulted under <i>section 30(3)</i> of this Act, the Court may make a contact order in favour of the father, on such terms as the Court may see fit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment makes provision for a contact order, which is permitted in British legislation, where the natural father would have the right to apply for a contact order with the child after adoption.  Obviously we are in a different legal scenario from that which exists in the UK.  I reference that to make the point that the concept of open adoption and ongoing contact is becoming more prevalent.  It is very often seen to be in the child&rsquo;s best interest.  Very often adoptive parents themselves are very keen on this concept because they understand that some contact with the biological parent can be beneficial for the child at an appropriate stage.</P>
        <P>It is a very different concept of adoption from the traditional one we had which was a closed system.  However, we have got to understand more about children&rsquo;s needs.  The idea of adoption has developed and grown from countrywide adoption to international adoption.  Open adoption may and will become more prevalent in the future.  It does not mean endless and ongoing contact.  It means that very often by agreement there is contact between the adoptive parents and the biological parent.  This can take a very different format.  It can be an exchange of photographs or birthday cards.  It can be exchanging information about key milestones.  Sometimes it can mean physical contact, with the biological parent coming into contact with the child, usually with the agreement, obviously, of the adoptive parents.</P>
        <P>This section of the Bill, section 31, attempts to reflect the reality that there is more open adoption.  I would be interested in the views of the Minister of State on the matter.  Clearly the Constitution, which he has mentioned a number of times, circumscribes how we deal with adoption law here.  If we had decided to introduce a constitutional amendment on children and inserted the rights of children into the Constitution, we might have addressed certain sections of the Bill differently.  The Minister of State has commented about that matter on a number of occasions when discussing various sections.  Given that the Government is considering a constitutional amendment on the rights of children, I would be interested to hear the comments of the Minister of State in that regard.  It may be that given our current situation, he cannot accept or even consider this amendment.  However, I would like him to outline his understanding of the constitutional issues that arise regarding children given that we do not have a constitutional provision at the moment covering the best interests of the child in his or her own right.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The area being discussed is quite interesting.  As Senator Fitzgerald has said, there is a body of opinion that open adoption will become more common in the future.</P>
        <P>However as the Senator is aware, the current position is that an adoption order effects the termination of the relationship between the natural parent and the child.  Therefore, the child is treated in law in the same way as any other child and this is protected under the Constitution.  Nevertheless, the Oireachtas joint committee to which the Senator referred is examining the constitutional rights of the child.  It has done a great deal of work on this issue already and has until the end of the summer to work on it as a report is due at the end of September.</P>
        <P>There are various ways in which one might like to call adoption a form of alternative care.  There is a long tradition of fostering in Ireland, which can be a short-term measure for a period of months if a child is in a difficult position in its own family home.  In addition, much more long-term fostering exists and many rights to which I referred yesterday have been given in respect of long-term fostering situations, including the right to consent to medical treatment and to apply for passports.  Relative adoption also exists, whereby relatives of a child adopt and in such circumstances, although a full adoption has taken place, there often is contact with the natural parents.</P><Col N="438"/>
        <P>However, the Government is constrained by the current position.  Even were I so inclined, I do not believe I could accept this amendment.  The Irish model of adoption is accepted under the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children  and Co-operation in respect of Inter-Country Adoption.  It would be necessary to carry out a great deal of work to put in place a statutory framework as envisaged by this amendment before one could even consider it.  The first step to take will be to go through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and to scope out such issues there before making any other statements on this issue.</P>

	<P>For the purpose of providing clarification for Members, this section refers to adoption orders made by the authority and includes domestic adoption and the adoption of children from abroad in circumstances in which the adoption order is made in Ireland.  Section 32 does not relate to the recognition of inter-country adoptions.  As for the proposed deletion of this section of the Bill, there is no reason that all involved in the adoption process should not be aware of the religion, if any, of the applicants.  The absence of such knowledge could leave the required consent open to being challenged in the courts.  The section simply provides that the mother and those whose consent is required, or both, are aware of the religion, if any, of the prospective adopters.  The proposed amendment No. 37 further clarifies that point.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The substance of this amendment was discussed in the debate on Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment that I seconded.  All the arguments were made and as there is so much work to be done in the House today, I will listen to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to ascertain whether he has developed any further ideas in this regard and perhaps I will come back thereafter.  While my colleague, Senator Bacik, may wish to say one or two words, the best interests of neither the House nor the legislation are served by simply reiterating all the same material.</P>

	<P>I second Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment No. 38, which would have the same effect as my amendment No. 4, which Members debated earlier.  The amendment is to insert into the Bill recognition of the position of same-sex couples who are parenting children and who may wish to adopt.  I reiterate the point that many children already are living in Ireland with parents who are same-sex partners and who, therefore, must have their legal position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the non-birth parent recognised in law.  This issue is being approached from the perspective of the rights and best interests of the child and the amendment simply seeks to give legal recognition to already existing situations, particularly because, as the Minister of State has noted, same-sex couples already are fostering children.  Simply put, there is one more piece in the jigsaw, namely, that same-sex couples also should be entitled to adopt in the same way as are married heterosexual couples.</P>
        <P>I record my disappointment on how few amendments have been accepted by the Minister of State from Members, given the goodwill he has shown.  Moreover, there was a good debate on this Bill on Committee Stage and the Minister of State certainly indicated a willingness to consider some of the principles raised by Members, including the principle of recognition of same-sex parents.  I am sorry this has not been reflected in his acceptance of more amendments tabled by Members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>To flesh out matters slightly, I referred to this kind of amendment when I discussed the amendment tabled by my colleague, Senator Bacik.  It is carefully drafted and I assume that at some stage this is the kind of measure that will be introduced.  In the first instance, the amendment ensures the involvement of a stable couple, whose members have been involved in a long-term relationship.  In addition, it safeguards the rights of the child by requiring the applicants to have demonstrated to the appropriate authorities under this legislation that they are fit persons to adopt.</P>
        <P>While there may not be an opportunity under this Bill, I ask the Minister of State to indicate privately to me and to Senator Bacik, who has been instrumental, together with other Members of the House, in teasing out the arguments for this issue, whether he can find out from the Government precisely what are its intentions regarding the civil partnership Bill.  The Leader of the House has stated a number of times on the Order of Business that the Bill will be introduced within a certain timeframe.  The autumn now is being mentioned but when a Green Party Member is asked, it is due before the summer recess.  Will the Minister of State communicate a timeframe to Senator Bacik and me under which at least this part of the puzzle will be resolved?</P>
        <P>For example, a situation has arisen in respect of a grandmother who is an average person, who certainly is not a strident or revolutionary person, namely, Mrs. Gill of County Offaly.  She passionately makes a plea on behalf of the baby who she considers morally to be her granddaughter but who, because of the non-recognition issue, has no legal connection with her whatsoever.  I also refer to the remarkable and dignified pleas that were made by existing and now virtually adult children of gay relationships, both on the airwaves and in the pages of <i>The <Col N="440"/>Irish Times</i>.  I record my gratitude to <i>The Irish Times</i>, in respect of both articles and editorials, in seeking to rectify this remaining injustice and violation of people&rsquo;s civil rights.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 31, line 4, after &ldquo;them&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(or either of them, if a failure by one only of the married couple to comply with this section would not seriously threaten the welfare of the child)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As for amendment No. 39, the qualification on who is suitable to adopt places an unreasonable requirement on the applicants, stressing &ldquo;each&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;either&rdquo; in terms of their ability to parent.  As for amendment No. 40, the tests set out in section 34 are in many respects inappropriate for an application by a parent or relative.  For example, section 34(<i>c</i>) refers to means.  Are we saying the unmarried father or mother of a child could not become an adopter because he or she had no money?  Can we take the reference to age in section 34(<i>b</i>) to mean grandparents could not adopt a grandchild because of age?  Clearly we have more sensitive tests that are required by parents or relatives as opposed to unconnected third parties.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure of the motivation behind this.  It is a dilution of the principle that the same standards of eligibility and suitability should apply to all applicants in adoptions in order to protect the interests of the children proposed to be adopted.  I cannot see how a married couple can be separated as envisaged by the first amendment so that one could be assessed positively while setting aside concerns that would arise after assessing the other parent separately or if one parent would have failed if he or she applied as a single adopter.  Regarding the suggestion that a lack of money is a bar to adoption, section 34(<i>c</i>) states that a person has adequate financial means to support the child.  This does not mean one must be rolling in money, simply that one must be able to provide for the child&rsquo;s needs.  That is not unreasonable where we are creating a permanent link between a child and a prospective adoptive parent.  The criteria set out are reasonable and motivated by the interests of ensuring the welfare of the child is paramount.  I do not accept these amendments because of the dilution of the standards contemplated.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 31, line 28, after &ldquo;<i>section 37(1)</i>,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;or to an accredited committee or body on behalf of the Executive&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We had a comprehensive discussion on this.  The Bill appears to state that all applications for assessment must be made to the HSE, which currently manages over 90% of assessments and has presided over the growth of waiting times to start an assessment to over three years in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  The waiting times are awful.  People must wait up to five years to be processed through a system that ultimately involves 30 hours of contact with the social <Col N="441"/>worker.  Assessments should be robust and should allow for preparation and reflection by the applicants.  Anyone who thinks of adopting three times could have to wait 15 years.  Provision should be made for accredited agencies, which could conduct such assessments.  However, all applications must be made to the HSE and all assessments must be passed back to the HSE placement committee.  Effectively, this discourages the establishment of any assessment agency because its sustainability and efficiency would be dictated by the HSE.  While regulation is not as pristine a term as it was a few months ago, the Adoption Board would regulate assessments and is the final authority in granting declarations.  Assessments by accredited organisations should be directly routed to independent placement committees and applicants should have the opportunity to apply directly to any accredited agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I would like the Minister of State to comment on this issue.  What are his plans for accredited agencies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I addressed this earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>But the Minister of State did not say what he would do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 40 suggests waiving provisions that are unnecessary for the protection of the child&rsquo;s welfare.  It is important to recognise that adoption is a service for children.  Where the State presumes to provide the place of parents or endorse the role of parents, it must be satisfied about the best interests of any child being placed in the care of persons not the child&rsquo;s parents.  Section 37 gives us the opportunity for an accredited body to carry out these assessments.  I have had discussions with the representative associations and my staff about what we can do.  We have other priorities at the moment, such as bilateral agreements and post placement reports, but I have undertaken to meet with the associations over the summer to find a solution to this.  It is too early to say where we will go and how we will provide for such a service but we do not want to create a fast-track assessment where those with lots of money can afford to pay for an assessment.  This must be not for profit and the service must be provided equally to all applicants.  How that is funded will be discussed with stakeholders.  I am ambitious to shorten the time, which is onerous, as pointed out by Senator Prendergast.  It is properly onerous in most of the requirements in the criteria.  The length of time is unfortunate.  We are dealing with a limited number of social workers, as has been identified earlier.  These are the same social workers who deal with child protection and post placement reports, which are increasing at a fast rate.  While we have no embargo on the recruitment of social workers, we have a finite budget in the normal way.  While other categories of employment are embargoed, social workers are not.  With a combination of these measures we should be able to tackle the issue.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 31, to delete lines 30 and 31 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;The Health Service Executive, and an accredited body which places a child for adoption, shall establish one or more adoption committees.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="442"/>
        <P FLI="0">This involves the deletion of the opening sentence of section 36, &ldquo;The Health Service Executive shall establish one or more adoption committees.&rdquo; and its replacement by the amended text.  This concerns the involvement of accredited bodies.  I await the response of the Minister of State, which was positive in principle although not to the point of effecting an amendment to the notion of accredited bodies at an earlier stage.  Accredited bodies exist and are named in the body of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I have listened carefully to what the Minister of State said about accepting an accredited body.  It seems he is in favour of it in general but not specifically and that he is having discussions in late summer but is not in a position to make it a priority at the moment.  If he does establish it, he believes it should not be for profit.  I agree because that would be dangerous.   The accredited body should have an ethos of equality of access.  I would like to see progress on this idea in the body of the Bill.  I do not know when this Bill will be debated in the D&aacute;il.  There should be some statutory form, as suggested in these amendments.  That would strengthen the Government&rsquo;s hand because the intention would be a statutory provision rather than being reliant on meetings with the interested parties.  They are not a substitute for making absolutely sure this happens.</P>
        <P>I have already spoken at length about the problems we have at present and I will not revisit them but it seems the Minister of State is addressing an issue as well.  There is a lack of clarity because the Minister of State has indicated there is no embargo on the recruitment of social workers but there are limited funds available, which we all recognise.  I take up the point made by Senator Mary White earlier with regard to the Monageer report.  Of course, it is not just about resources as it is about ensuring that existing resources are managed in the best possible way.  There should be a kind of case conferencing, communication and management from the top that ensures families get the sort of services they need.</P>
        <P>That was the point I made on that particular case.  There was much contact, according to the report, but the problem was the contact was not effective.  Resources make up one aspect but there must also be effective work when the resources and people are in place, as well as proper management.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that since entering office, he has tried to ensure he has the facts from each area and that he would get access to the information as quickly as possible.  He has tried to see what is happening in different community care areas in order to compare responses etc., which is absolutely critical.  However, we are doing this very late in the day.  I cannot believe this information is still not at the fingertips of the Department, given that we have had community care and social workers in place for so long trying to work effectively with families and children who are abused.  This has been a significant issue in this country and the effectiveness of the response still seems to be open to question despite more money going in.  It is not just about resources; it is about their management.</P>
        <P>With regard to setting up this agency, the Minister of State appears to be suggesting there may not be finance for the personnel to run it, which may be the reason we are not able to pursue it.  That goes against the Minister&rsquo;s earlier statement that there is no embargo on the appointment of social workers.  I know many community care teams are short at the moment and have not had personnel replaced.  Senator Norris has raised this point.</P>
        <P>Although he might not do it today, will the Minister of State tell us what precisely is the recruitment position?  Is there an effective embargo in some areas because of the financial limitations and is that the reason there are cases waiting?</P>
        <P>To return to the specifics, it seems the Minister of State is supporting the idea in principle and he would like to see a cut in assessment times.  The setting up of an accredited body would <Col N="443"/>probably achieve that but the Minister of State does not appear to be giving any commitment in the short or medium term to establish such a body.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to these amendments, the HSE has the primary and statutory role in child protection in this country.  What is envisaged is that the HSE would be the first point of contact.  If an accredited agency would be able to carry out some of the procedures relating to assessment, they would do it through the HSE.  The statutory procedure is there to allow this to happen but the HSE has the sole responsibility for child protection so the process must go through the executive initially.</P>
        <P>If the language expresses &ldquo;the Health Service Executive or an accredited agency&rdquo;, such an agency without any statutory authority should not be able to make decisions that are fundamentally about child protection, when the statutory authority in this regard is the HSE.  That is one of the issues that will come up and we have discussed already how this would happen.  Ultimately, the HSE must have a supervisory role and be able to stand over assessments made because of its obligation under the Child Care Act.  It is one issue that must be considered.</P>
        <P>The Senator asked whether money is an issue.  Unfortunately, with issues relating to health, children and every other aspect of Government there are finite resources, particularly at the moment.  The toughest part of politics is telling people we have put a certain amount of money in one area rather than another.  Making such decisions and establishing these priorities is difficult but we stand over such decisions.</P>
        <P>That we do not have an embargo with regard to social worker appointments is a very significant step forward and I was very pleased to receive that information from the HSE.  Nevertheless, finite resources remain and there is no way we will be able to appoint thousands of social workers.  We will be able to improve the position but it is not just about resources, it is about working in a different way, as the Senator mentioned.  I did not need the Monageer report to underline this to me and that is why the task force on child protection services in the State, which is due to report at the end of this month, is ambitious in ensuring there is a standardised approach across the country with regard to child protection.</P>
        <P>The HSE must be the statutory authority with regard to child protection.  Ultimately, some of the functions relating to assessment can be given to another accredited body but there must be a supervisory role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There seems to be some degree of movement on the part of the Minister of State because he accepts there can be a role for an accredited body in support of the HSE.  I accept the Minister of State is correct in stating there is a statutory supervisory role for the HSE but he also indicated we could not have a position where the language would state &ldquo;the Health Service Executive or an accredited body&rdquo;.  That is not what is contained in the amendment, which states &ldquo;the Health Service Executive and an accredited body&rdquo;.  There appears to be a little disjuncture there.</P>
        <P>I do not see the point raised by the Minister of State regarding a conflict.  As I envisage it, the amendment supplements and assists the work of the HSE while accepting its supervisory role under statute.  I welcome what the Minister of State has indicated regarding his interest in expanding the work that is done and so on.  He has tailored his remark a little because in an earlier contribution he seemed to suggest there was no embargo on the recruitment of support staff such as social workers and so on but then he said there were still budgetary considerations.  Although this may not be a strict embargo, it is certainly a limiting factor in achieving the best results.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s amendment uses &ldquo;and&rdquo;, which implies that one must apply to both the HSE and the accredited body.  If we are speaking about bureaucracy, that would add unnecessary layers.  I presume that what was envisaged was that one or the other would be done and one could be left with an alternative.  As I stated in a previous reply, I do not believe that possible with regard to the Child Care Act and the obligations of the HSE.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the budgetary considerations not to limit what I stated earlier.  I thought it went without saying that any decision of Government has budgetary considerations and this is sad when one considers health and children.  It is not something one would like but the HSE is obliged under the Health Act 2004 to remain within its allocation of funding.  That is a statutory obligation as passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The budgetary considerations are laid out in statute and go without saying in my view.  Such considerations were not mentioned to couch what I said earlier, as they are fairly obvious.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment involves a slight difference in language from the form proposed in the Bill as it seeks to open the position somewhat more.  The reasoning behind it is similar to the previous amendment relating to the question of open adoption.  The amendment changes the form of words used in the Bill to the following: &ldquo;The Authority may attach, to the interim order, conditions in regard to the maintenance, education and welfare of the child and in regard to access arrangements in respect of maintaining meaningful contacts for the child.&rdquo;  It, therefore, substitutes the term &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; for that of &ldquo;supervision&rdquo;.  In my opinion, that is a reasonable and humane course to follow.  In addition, the amendment suggests the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;in regard to access arrangements in respect of maintaining meaningful contacts for the child&rdquo;.  This is important because children should have access to proper and meaningful contacts.  The amendment also asserts the primacy of the child and his or her interest in this relationship.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On amendment No. 58, the relevant subsection in the Bill is ambiguous.  If a question of custody falls to be decided, it must be decided under the general law of custody set out in the Guardianship Act.  While section 3 of that Act sets out the principle that the welfare of a child is a first and paramount consideration, it is apparent that this is not the only consideration.  In particular, custody cannot be awarded to someone who is not entitled to it.  This is a confusing ambiguity to introduce into the Bill because it disingenuously suggests that even if an adoption order were declared invalid, custody could remain with the adopting parents rather than the natural parents by virtue of the welfare principle.  The latter is inappropriate and misleading.</P>

	<P>The phrasing is what is at issue.  Section 48 states the authority may take evidence orally or on affidavit.  Naturally, if both formats were possible then it is understood by the way described.  It is not necessary to insert the two words &ldquo;or both&rdquo; because it is already understood and they are not mutually exclusive.  I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s concerns would be well-founded if it were drafted &ldquo;either orally or on affidavit&rdquo;.  However, it is expressed that they are not mutually exclusive and evidence can be given both on affidavit or orally.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, which shall give consent to that information being given where the adopted person and the person placing the child for adoption have agreed through a tracing mechanism to be established by the Authority that the information can be given&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 66 arises from submissions we have received on the need for a formal tracing mechanism.  Clearly, it needs to be specified that information can be released where both sides have indicated a willingness to find each other.  Amendment No. 72 is similar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  This series of amendments puts tracing on a statutory basis.  They are recommended by and have the support of people who are very experienced in this area.  We want to promote the development of services that will assist <Col N="451"/>people who were adopted and those who placed children for adoption to trace each other.  A number of agencies have developed professional expertise in this area and a huge number of adopted young people have benefitted from the support these agencies can offer.  Like other aspects of the Bill before us, this is a delicate issue and the proper professional standards must be in place to ensure people receive the best service possible.</P>
        <P>This area has become even more complex due to international adoptions.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this.  He stated earlier that issues had arisen in Romania, where tracing was introduced several years ago, in respect of families attempting to retrieve information.  Making legislative provision for tracing is a useful means of promoting high standards.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 73 proposes the development of intermediary information and tracing services for birth families and adopted persons.  It is similar in this regard to the amendment moved by Senator Prendergast.  Does the Minister believe this should be part of the legislation?  It is a core part of many people&rsquo;s experience and we want to ensure the system works effectively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consider including a provision on tracing and I have consulted the Office of the Attorney General on whether the existing administrative system needs to be put on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Board contains an information tracing unit and the recently established preference register has received 6,270 applications and made 500 matches.  Last year the board launched a standardised framework which provides guidelines and standards for this process.</P>
        <P>The amendments refer to the promotion and development of tracing.  If the board is to have a statutory role in this regard, it would have to be neutral on the issue of tracing because not everybody wishes to be contacted.  Nevertheless, a strong argument can be made for the exchange of medical information.  If one considers the child&rsquo;s interest as paramount, it is difficult to justify statutory blocks to providing that information even where a natural parent prefers not to be contacted in the normal way.  We are discussing these issues with the Attorney General and I thank Senators for tabling these amendments.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(12) (<i>a</i>) An tArd-Chlaraitheoir shall keep an index to make traceable the connection between each entry in the Register of Foreign Adoptions and identifying information regarding the child&rsquo;s original identity, including country of birth.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I referred earlier to the international character of adoption, which makes the issue of tracing even more complex.

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it correct to say, therefore, that 5,770 people were unable to make contact?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures refer to the register&rsquo;s first two years of operation.  I imagine the figure of 500 will increase.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is astounding that out of more than 6,000 people who wanted further details on their adoptions, 5,770 were unable to get this information.  The information may be less accurate in respect of the cohort of older people but most of these cases would have involved Irish adoptions.  These figures underscore the importance of a tracing mechanism.</P>
        <P>My amendment proposes the creation of an index that would make traceable the connection between each entry in the register of foreign adoptions and a child&rsquo;s original identity, including country of birth.  This information would not be open to public inspection and information would only be provided by order of a court or the authority.  It would have to be a highly confidential system.  The figures outlined by the Minister of State pertain to an Irish context and a time when adoption was a more closed concept but they underscore the importance of my amendment in regard to international adoptions and the huge importance of having as much identifying information as possible in the register of foreign adoptions.  It is absolutely critical for the child&rsquo;s psychological, physical and mental health that as much data as possible are kept on the register.  The amendment has been tabled because it is important that this is put on a statutory footing.  If people are not obliged to do this, the information may be lost or it may not be furnished, although standards have improved hugely and that is probably basic information now which is available somewhere.  The amendment proposes to formalise the process.  The statistics outlined by the Minister of State show why this is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I agree completely with the argument made by Senator Fitzgerald.  It is human to want to trace relatives as some stage in one&rsquo;s life, no matter how successful and happy is the adoption.  In addition, increasingly adoptees are seeking information about their parental background in terms of illness profile and genetic predisposition to certain illnesses and so on.  The sentimental and the practical are grounds for keeping the register.  In other words, the information should be retained in a secure form.</P>
        <P>The second part of the amendment deals with security in a slightly different manner in that it refers to security from prying eyes and the gaze of persons who have no right to the information because it is personal and private.  I am astonished to have received information that the register is wide open.  Such records are open to anyone and the people who have briefed me feel strongly that this material should be held in private, as is the case with domestic adoptions.  Will the Minister of State comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the assertion that information held is openly or widely available, which is a cause of distress to those involved in these cases?  I am not aware whether that is the case but the issue has been brought to my attention.  My brief states, &ldquo;Currently these records are open to anyone and should be held in private, as in domestic adoption.&rdquo;  I am taking what I have been told in good faith but I am curious because if this is the situation, it is not positive or good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The section does not seem to indicate that the register excludes parties from observing it.  I will have to check this and come back to the Senator at another time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that is worrying?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  It is a fair point, which I will have to examine.  The Adoption Board is anxious to continue carrying out publicity campaigns to notify people of the availability of the register and the traceability options that are available but, as Senator Fitzgerald said, many of the 6,270 who have contacted the board are Irish people and domestic adoptions were involved.  Very often adoption societies had kept records in the basements of <Col N="453"/>buildings, which were gathering dust.  I met representatives of the natural parents organisation who are anxious that something be done to preserve and collate the data, as people are anxious to obtain this information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the amendment, an tArd Chl&aacute;iritheoir is not responsible for the register of foreign adoptions.  The Adoption Board relies on the information and documentation made available to it by the foreign jurisdiction.  All information provided is held on file.  The register of birth of the child is in the other jurisdiction and access or otherwise depends on the law in the other jurisdiction.  The Adoption Board, in light of the work on the existing contact register, has indicated its intention to undertake further work anticipating the likely desire of inter-country adoptees to trace their origins in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State seems to suggest it is correct that the register is open to public inspection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand to be corrected on that and I will have to clarify it for the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be disturbing and we would not want that situation.  The Minister of State also said the board is considering a similar register for inter-country adoptions because their numbers are on the increase and that will be necessary.  It is important that the amendment is considered and accepted by him because the section is vague and we do not want to repeat the same mistakes with inter-country adoptions.  As he pointed out, adoptees have been unable to access information and files are lying all over the place.  Even if the child&rsquo;s birth certificate or other information relating to him or her is kept in another country, greater effort should be made to gather the information, preserve it for the child and make sure it is available so that the child or the family can check the physical or medical histories.  It is important that information is kept and is traceable.</P>
        <P>Traceability is the key issue.  If the information is left on file, it could be extremely difficult to track it down later.  Of a total of 6,270 people who have approached the Adoption Board, only 500 made matches.  We must look forward as traceability and availability of information relating to family histories and so on will be issues in inter-country adoptions.  The provisions in my amendments should be made statutory.  Will the Minister of State consult further with the board and ensure these provisions are inserted in this legislation?  The research results furnished by the board to the Minister of State, which are helpful, highlight that we need a strong element of support for tracing.</P>
        <P>With regard to &ldquo;promotion&rdquo;, it is important that adoptees are made aware.  People can feel very isolated when they try to trace their family and they need to know there is a place where they can go to obtain the supports and information they need and that they will be dealt with in confidence.  Both issues need to be considered further by the Minister of State before the Bill is debated in the D&aacute;il.  It is important to have an entry in the register of foreign adoptions with all identifying information but, as the Minister of State indicated, the register may be open to the public for international adoptions.  That needs to be examined but he has agreed to report back to the House in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure how I will approach this but I undertake to examine the section.  The issues raised by the Senator are legitimate but I must give them more consideration before I make commitments on what I will do in this regard.  I thank her for bringing these issues to my attention.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping in the House.  Senators may speak once on each grouping.  I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>A total of 20 amendments were proposed and approved on Committee Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  The Labour Party jointly proposed one of those amendments.  The amendments do not make any substantive changes to the Bill as originally introduced in this House.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, and Nos. 8 to 20, inclusive, in sections 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the Bill were introduced to provide for the commencement of all sections of the Bill on the passing of the Bill.  The previous draft of the Bill provided for ministerial orders to commence the various sections of the Act but it was then concluded that the ministerial order mechanism is not necessary and it is now proposed that all sections will come into effect on the passing of <Col N="455"/>the Bill.  It is merely a technical issue.  We are moving from ministerial commencement orders to commencement on the passing of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 in section 3 is a drafting amendment to delete &ldquo;the substitution of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;substituting&rdquo; and does not constitute a substantive or material change.  That amendment was originally submitted in this House by the Labour Party Members who had tabled a number of drafting amendments on Committee Stage.  However, on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel it was not accepted at that stage.  The amendment was resubmitted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The Parliamentary Counsel had reconsidered the matter and recommended that the amendment should be made.  That is in accordance with the conciliatory approach on this side of the House to try to accommodate all views and include as many of them as possible in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline to the House the details of the way the Government scheme to provide a child care place for three year old children will function, the payment methods, the number of available places and the level of uptake in the scheme he expects from child care providers.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has been here all day but this is an important issue and many questions arise from it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the introduction of a preschool year while recognising the negative impact the loss of the early child supplement income will have on all families, particularly the most vulnerable.  I am concerned about some of the practical implementations of this preschool year considering that in the weeks following the announcement of the scheme, many preschool providers raised questions and expressed genuine concerns about the scheme.  Such concerns <Col N="456"/>included the lack of information on the implementation of the new scheme, the duration of the capitation grant and the payment of top-ups.  In particular, service providers questioned the adequacy of the capitation grant in meeting the cost of providing the service and the difficulties some providers will experience in that regard.  I am aware there is concern about that in many of the preschools and child care services in Lucan and Clondalkin.</P>
        <P>I want to read into the record an e-mail I got from somebody who is involved in child care.  She states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am the owner and manager of a pre-school for the past 7 years.  I operate 2 sessions per day, Monday to Thursday, for 10 months of the year (43 weeks).  While I welcome the new venture by the government to provide free pre-school education, I am appalled by the manner in which the scheme is being railroaded in without prior consultation with pre-school providers and without due consideration to the quality services we have spent years building only to be undermined and dictated to in this manner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is an indication of the concern of people already providing the service.  The e-mail further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The capitation grant, as suggested, will be provided based on a 38 week service.  The majority of pre-school services operate from September to the end of June (43 weeks) and incorporate 4 weeks holidays into their fee in order to pay staff wages.  The grant is set at &euro;2,450 and pre-school providers are not permitted to redress the shortfall from [people who attend their services].</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Obviously that does not allow for any holiday periods.  This woman states she estimates her income will be down &euro;11,000 per annum due to providing a five-day service as opposed to a four-day one and due to the scheme not allowing for a 43-week provision of service.</P>
        <P>These are the two specific issues which my constituent has raised.  Will the Minister outline what consultation he intends to undertake with the sector?  What will he do about the issue of staff holidays and the longer period of service?  The scheme also demands that the provider must have eight children to avail of the scheme.  What happens if the provider thought she could fill the places but cannot do so and is down one or two places?  How many providers will avail of the scheme?  How many places are available now and how many does the Minister envisage will be available as the scheme is implemented?  Is the Minister willing to review the details of the scheme to address some of the concerns of child care service providers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Fitzgerald for raising this important issue.  As the Senator is aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free preschool year of early childhood care and education, ECCE, which will be introduced from January next.  The introduction of the scheme is, I believe, one of the most significant developments in early childhood care and education that has taken place in Ireland to date.  Building on the progress made over the past decade, in terms of investing in child care and in developing educational frameworks for young children, we are now taking the first major step in providing universal pre-school education for all children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Children will be eligible for the free preschool year where they are aged between three years and three months and four years and six months on 1 September of each year.  Exceptions will be made where a child has special needs or to accommodate children due to the enrolment policy of a local primary school.  These decisions follow consultations we have held with the NCNA, the IPPA and other stakeholders.  Research underpins the importance of delivering preschool provision in a consistent format based within an appropriate educational framework. <Col N="457"/>For this reason, the preschool year scheme has been designed to provide 570 hours for each participating child, which will be delivered on a weekly basis over the course of each year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where children attend a sessional play-school, they will receive three hours per day each week over 38 weeks.  To take account of the fact that young children are cared for in a variety of settings, a child attending a full-time or part-time service will receive two hours and 15 minutes per day each week for 50 weeks.  An annual capitation fee of over &euro;2,400 will be paid to participating services.  This is equivalent to &euro;64.50 per week where a service is participating for 38 weeks and &euro;48.50 per week where it participates for 50 weeks.  Services will be paid in advance at the start of each term.  As a free preschool year, participating services must agree to provide the service in return for the capitation grant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Services may charge parents for additional services provided these are clearly optional.  These would include additional hours over and above the free preschool year requirement and additional services in the form of various one-off or ongoing activities or services such as outings, birthday parties, specific teaching resources, such as dance or music, or food.  However, all additional services offered must be clearly optional and subject to parents&rsquo; agreement.  It is also essential that appropriate programme based activities are provided to children not participating in an optional activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is hoped that at least 70,000 children will participate in the scheme from the early stages of its introduction, which would represent 90% of all children eligible within the 15 month age range allowed for, and almost all children when the pattern of enrolments in the year prior to starting primary school settles into place.  A sufficient number of preschool places is expected to be available based on the existing capacity in the sector and it will be open to all preschool services, of which there are almost 5,000, to participate.  The fact that payments will be made to services at the start of each term, rather than on a weekly or monthly basis during the year, will be a very significant benefit to services, particularly in the current economic context which has resulted in high vacancy rates in many services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While some high cost services have argued that the rate of capitation should be higher, the large majority of services have expressed their support for the scheme in strong terms.  The level of capitation allowed for is significantly higher than that proposed under the NESF&rsquo;s proposed free preschool year scheme and is far higher than that allowed for under the equivalent scheme operating in Northern Ireland, which amounts to &pound;30 per week, despite having similar conditions.  For most services, the scheme will see an increase in their income and this will allow them to meet the higher standards required for participation relative to the existing requirements under the child care regulations.  The higher standards concerning qualification of staff and the educational programme guided by S&iacute;olta will ensure that a quality service is provided to all children in their preschool year and not just those whose parents can afford to pay higher fees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am aware that a member of Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s party has called for the scheme not to be free, but to allow commercially based preschools and Montessori schools to continue to charge fees from qualified parents, in addition to collecting the capitation fee, in the form of a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo;.  This would greatly reduce the benefit of the scheme for those families and would also make the scheme inaccessible for families who are under financial pressure, inevitably leading to disadvantaged children being left out.  As research demonstrates that the greatest benefit from preschool education is found among children who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, this would be doubly unfair and is an outcome I could not stand over.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted the Government has made the far-sighted decision to introduce this new scheme.  It will give equal opportunities to all children, particularly the most marginalised who would not otherwise be able to attend preschool, and help parents who, up to now, had to meet the cost of preschool provision.  It will also benefit services which will gain certainty and sustainability in what are, for most, very trying times.  I believe the long-term benefits will be <Col N="458"/>enormously significant to all of our children and to society as a whole.  It will involve time and effort to ensure the greatest possible levels of participation in the scheme and to reach the highest standards of early years care and education provision.  However, I am confident that the scheme provides the framework to achieve this ambition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to the e-mail from a woman who runs a child care service.  She says:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have worked really hard over the last nine years to build a successful service where parents can be proud to send their children.  It is not just a three hour childminding service and it does not end when the children leave.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She goes on to outline the types of services she provides.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to somebody such as her?  The scheme is almost usurping the quality and range of service she has built up and provided over many years.  It will probably undermine the quality of the service and will not allow it to develop to provide what parents want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a national, universal, free preschool year.  It is designed to benefit all children.  While there are examples where difficulties can be found, we will try to accommodate all the providers in the scheme when it is finalised.  We are in consultation with the representative associations of child care facilities.  They have underlined some of the issues the Senator raised, including that providers such as the one mentioned by the Senator who operate on a four-day week.  We are examining whether we can accommodate providing the 15 hours over a four-day period so services such as the one mentioned can survive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to this announcement there was widespread acknowledgement that the early child care supplement was under pressure and could be withdrawn.  Service providers told me they were struggling with capacity because people were migrating from private providers to community providers.  They were seeking some lifeline and this is the lifeline we have provided.  Clearly, we have work to do to bring on board as many providers as possible.  However, according to my figures, over 80% of providers are delighted with this scheme as it gives them the opportunity to survive these difficult times.  It also marks the beginning of a historic development whereby children will present themselves in primary schools as motivated and well socialised, particularly children who are marginalised.  Well-off parents send their children to preschool anyway.  It is the great cohort of children from disadvantaged communities who will be able to access preschool services for the first time.</P>
