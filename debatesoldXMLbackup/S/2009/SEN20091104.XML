      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday morning another family, the Ronan family in Kilkenny, experienced the terror and trauma of a so-called tiger kidnapping.  Last week it was a family in Lucan.  Now young children are being used as pawns in this horrific crime, which must be unbelievably disturbing and upsetting for the families involved.  Why have the Government, the Garda and the banks not put in place the sort of security measures that would protect families and workers in the banks?  Clearly, the incidence of such crimes is escalating, but this cannot be allowed to continue.  It is a cause of serious concern and must be creating dreadful anxiety for bank officials who are afraid of being subjected to terror by these gangs.  Are resources being given to the Garda to deal with the problem?  Are subversive organisations involved?  Do we have the resources in place to track down the perpetrators and deal with them effectively?  This cannot be allowed to continue in the way we saw yesterday.  Thank goodness nobody was hurt, but the psychological trauma experienced by the family and others within the last few weeks must be prevented.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to address the issue.  We are putting so much money into the banks and have considerable control over them.  Surely this security issue can be dealt with in a more effective way.  We must ensure no more families are subjected to this experience.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children has outlined the Government&rsquo;s recommendations which he said would address the issues raised in the Ryan report.  One of the key issues was the availability of front-line staff to work with children at risk and in need of protection.  It is, therefore, disturbing to read about the report from the HSE in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that the number of children in care who have a social worker has fallen by 7% this year.  It <Col N="636"/>makes a mockery of the recommendations made in the Ryan report if we do not have these services in place to deal with children in need of protection and care.  I would like the Minister of State to come to the House for a realistic and honest discussion on how we can ensure the appalling abuses in this country over decades do not happen again and that the report is actually implemented, rather than simply left sitting there, as is the case.  The report in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning gives hard facts about the non-allocation of social workers and the reduction in services to children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The question asked by a number of people recently is how we square the circle between the social partners and the Government.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton made some interesting comments over the past 24 hours in terms of showing that solutions can always be found if people are committed.  The Taoiseach has obviously convinced the people with whom he is negotiating that &euro;4 billion has to be collected one way or another.  It is also clear that introducing certain reforms will not allow us to collect the money required on time and that the social partners are demanding fairness.  How does one square that circle?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has come up with the idea of bridging finance.  I have no inside knowledge of the negotiations but I interpret his proposal to mean that certain changes, such as pay cuts, can be introduced until such time as broader arrangements can be made on producing savings.  Similarly, Deputy Bruton pointed out that pay restraints and other impositions could be implemented until certain benchmarks are achieved.  I make these points to demonstrate that when people sit around a table, they can always find solutions.  I do not say that the options presented by the Taoiseach or Deputy Bruton will work in the long term or receive the support of all parties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume there are four sides to the table because the unemployed and the community and voluntary pillar should also be represented.  Ordinary workers and trade unionists want certainty and honesty.  Once they can see an end to the crisis, it will be easier to get their support.  However, the leadership of the trade union movement needs to be able to explain how we can end the pain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on social workers, particularly those dealing with children.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, should address the issue in this House.  Like Senator Fitzgerald, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  We hope to issue our final report shortly but we are at present struggling with the question of a constitutional referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  While I believe this would represent an important step forward, an even bigger step would be to allocate sufficient social workers to deal with the daily demands of the system.  That should not have to await the report of any committee before being made a Government priority.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the specific and urgent issue of youth unemployment.  The F&Aacute;S report which was published today confirms what many of us already suspected, namely, that men under the age of 24 are the worst affected by unemployment.  We are facing the risk that the legacy of this recession will be a lost generation.  Tens of thousands of young people will have little prospect of working in their own country.  Emigration has already resumed and we are threatened with a recurrence of the events of the 1980s.  I ask that the <Col N="637"/>debate on youth unemployment be facilitated by proposals from the Government on how we will confront this scourge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express my disappointment at the ruling by the Supreme Court on Portmarnock Golf Club&rsquo;s prohibition on women becoming full members.  While I respect the right of that court to decide the law as it sees fit, it is disappointing in the 21st century that a golf club should be designated gentlemen only.  The Supreme Court ruled that the club is entitled to an exemption under section 9 of the Equal Status Act 2000, which provides that a club established to meet the particular needs of one sex can discriminate on the grounds of gender.  However, the need to play golf is not unique to males.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some women are very good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all aware of the important networking opportunities presented by golf courses and it is disappointing to see the continuation of this prohibition against women.  More than 400 clubs have already opened their doors to women as full members and none has ground to a halt.</P>
        <P>I support the call made by a previous speaker for the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appear before the House.  I ask that he address the concerns that the equality agenda is being undermined by budgetary cutbacks.  Tomorrow morning, the Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, will be addressed by a group which is lodging a complaint to the European Commission in this regard.  Perhaps the Minister will outline for us the strategies he can implement to protect this country&rsquo;s equality and human rights so we do not emerge from the recession with a weakened infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Fitzgerald and concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in regard to the ongoing discussions between the social partners.  A perception is being created in some quarters that failure is a creeping inevitability in these discussions.  This House should send a clear message that failure is not an option.  Our country stands on the brink and if agreement cannot be reached, decisions must be made that ensure a return to prosperity.</P>
        <P>I note that voluntary or involuntary unemployment is being considered as an option for the public service, as opposed to measures that would reduce or freeze wages.  This would be an appalling route, however.  This House has on many occasions pointed to the importance of social solidarity and the need to pull together.  How will we do that by keeping a reduced number in work on current or higher wages instead of a larger number on lower wages?  That is the challenge we face.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on yesterday&rsquo;s Exchequer returns.  The Taoiseach stated that one in ten people are now on the higher rate of income tax, as opposed to one in five previously, and that half of all earners do not pay income tax.  How can that be the case given that the income levies apply to earnings below the average industrial wage?  These points need to be clarified if we are to hold a debate based on facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>On a day when the Sub-Committee on Women&rsquo;s Participation in Politics is meeting to consider ways to increase female involvement in parliamentary activities, I share Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s concerns about the areas from which women continue to be excluded.  While I cannot beat the judges&rsquo; knowledge of the law, at a time when we are trying to drive equality, I fail to understand how a golf club has been able to argue successfully that women are not equal to men in accessing membership.  This issue which dates back to when I <Col N="638"/>chaired the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is an ongoing battle. </P>
        <P>Yesterday another family suffered violence at the hands of people with guns.  It is irrelevant whether a weapon is brandished or discharged over someone&rsquo;s head.  In a couple of weeks we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Children should have the right to grow up without having their home invaded by people carrying guns.  The House should discuss human rights, including the rights of children.  I note from my work on the Council of Europe that young people are seeking a convention on the rights of youth.  We must ask why human rights conventions, including on the rights of the child, have failed and various sections of the population consider it necessary to have a separate convention to affirm their rights.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I also request a debate on my report on history teaching in areas of recent conflict.  It is a basic right to know each other and have a full picture of activities taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I return to a matter I raised yesterday, namely, the Corrib gas field.  After I spoke yesterday, my colleague, Senator Hanafin, indicated he supported my call for a debate on the issue but argued that Shell to Sea was not correct and so forth.  We also heard from another Senator on the Government benches that dangerous dissident elements were involved.  The report of the planning board is very clear.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has found that up to half of Shell&rsquo;s proposed route for a gas pipeline in County Mayo is unacceptable, the houses affected are in the hazard range of the pipeline should a failure occur and Ireland has not adopted proper health and safety risk thresholds.  I ask for a full debate on this issue.  While I fully accept that this enormous resource is extremely valuable to the people, particularly at this time, it is they, rather than a discredited multinational corporation, who should have it. </P>
        <P>With regard to the ruling in the Supreme Court, it is important to note there were two fine dissenting judgments.  This happened to me also and I was ultimately vindicated in the European Court of Justice.  It is absurd that a purpose of a club is defined in the majority verdict as the wishes of the people.  The purpose of the club is to play golf, as the two dissenting judges made perfectly clear.  I expect this matter to be examined again.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Defence to come before the House to explain the reason the Irish Army has been ordering defence equipment from a company which manufactured equipment used in the Gaza war which has been the subject of a war crimes complaint?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on his remarks today and yesterday on the current pay negotiations.  If we have learned anything in the past ten years, it is that partnership works and no one has all the wisdom or answers.  It is ridiculous for the Government and congress to demonise each other.  I am confident that if they work together and reach an agreement in the coming days, it will help us along the road to the recovery, to which we all aspire.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to the House for a debate on the future of local government.  The Minister clearly has views on the issue, given that the revised programme for Government envisages the establishment of a new tier of local government.  While this is all well and good and I commend the Minister on being creative and progressive, as always, the downside is that an air of uncertainty is creeping into councils, particularly town councils, the future of which is very much in doubt.  My colleague, Senator Glynn, raised this matter recently.  This air of uncertainty has spread to other councils and bodies associated with councils such as vocational education committees.  Uncertainty does not make for best practice.  I am relaying to the Leader concerns expressed to me not only by elected members from around the country but also management and senior staff in councils.  We must tease out this issue and let the man see the monkey.  There is no better place than the Seanad to have a debate before certain drastic decisions are taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We hear much about the relevance of the Seanad.  Despite the fact that thousands of children and adults have contracted swine flu and tens of thousands of those deemed to be at risk are being vaccinated against the condition, a debate on the issue has been pulled because three Ministers, none of whom is responsible for the Health Service Executive, are unable to make themselves available to the House.  This pandemic is of a scale not experienced since the foundation of the State.  The House makes itself irrelevant when it refuses to discuss major issues of public health. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows that is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 12 years since a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government initiated its policy of zero tolerance on crime.  Subversive activity and home-grown organised crime are increasing and foreign criminal gangs are establishing themselves.  I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House to discuss rampant crime in certain parts of the country.  The Government is abandoning many communities to crime and its effects. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive is playing a blinder on the public airwaves, whether on radio or television, with regard to swine flu.  We have heard Dr. Tony Holohan discussing the issue on numerous occasions.  Rather than having a debate in the Seanad which, as we have noted time and again, does not receive much media coverage, the debate is taking place in the media.  The issue is in our faces &mdash; where it should be &mdash; because the HSE is doing a good job.</P>
        <P>I concur with previous speakers&rsquo; comments on the terrible crime committed yesterday against the Ronan family, one of whom works in the Bank of Ireland in Kilkenny.  Tiger robberies are <Col N="640"/>a new type of crime which appear to take place once or twice a week.  They are among the most appalling crimes because they involve young children.  While I support the call by the leader of the Opposition for the Minister to come before the House, I note from listening to the radio on my way here this morning that he is meeting representatives of the Irish Bank Officials Association and the Garda Commissioner today.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come before the House as soon as possible.  Senators referred to the psychological impact on the poor Ronan family of opening one&rsquo;s door at 6.15 a.m. and finding oneself pushed into one&rsquo;s house by men with guns.  This must be a terrible experience and I do not know how anyone would survive it.  These crimes have a dreadful effect on bank officials going about their daily business.  When they come home from work to enjoy their recreational time, they do not know what will happen to them in the safety of their own homes.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">On an indirectly related IBOA issue, a large non-Irish bank operating in Ireland is now changing the contracts of workers who have been there ten, 20 or 30 years.  In these economic times, when everybody is trying to do what is right, this bank is asking workers to take a cut in salary which is having an impact on pensions.  I will give the information to the Leader and ask him to write to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to find out if anything can possibly be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Fitzgerald and ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, come to the House as a matter of extreme urgency.  We have seen an increase in what are called tiger kidnappings but the reality is that families are being traumatised.  I compliment Larry Broderick of the IBOA who spoke on the radio this morning and was clear, cogent and made a very good case on behalf of the IBOA.  What land is the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, living in when he refers to adhering to protocols?  I want to put a straight question to the Leader, man to man.  What would the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, or any of us do if our wife and three children had a gun put to our heads and shots fired over our heads at 6.15 in the morning?  We certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>He is looking for protocols now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;would not follow protocols and think about the money in the bank.  We would do as we were asked to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I received phone calls this morning from friends of mine who work in banks and who are genuinely concerned about their safety and that of their families.  They are ordinary people who are going from A to B every day and now suddenly have to think about their safety.  The trauma of the three children and the Ronan family cannot be glossed over.  When the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, goes on national radio and talks about following protocols, he is living in a fantasy world.  We are discussing the lives of people, not money.  It is wrong that any individual such as a bank manager or whoever can walk into a bank, have access to hundreds of thousands of euro and walk out the door with it.  The place for debate is here and this Chamber is where the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is accountable to the Members elected on behalf of the people.  I, like Senator Fitzgerald, would like that debate today as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of social partnership, I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  A solution can always be found and at this moment in time our determination and confidence in a solution will be our ability to find one.  We must focus on that and be confident that there is a solution.  In recent weeks I and other Members of the House &mdash; Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Bradford mentioned it &mdash; have inquired as to the possibility of bringing some of the social partners into this House to address us so we could play our part in seeking a solution.  It would <Col N="641"/>involve issues with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Perhaps the matter could be raised and discussed because it is important that we play an active role in helping to find a solution.</P>
        <P>What does not help to seek a solution is how aspects of the media are pitching the public and private sectors against one another.  I mention in particular the programme &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; which is despicable in its approach to how it debates with people.  It is pure political points scoring and is very dangerous.  People throughout this country are extremely angry and fearful about the future.  The focus of all of us, especially the media and the political institutions, should be on giving, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, some certainty, confidence and absolute determination that we will get a solution to these problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I spoke of our need to deplore collectively the effects a strike or protest action would have, particularly if such action was in favour of sectoral interests, and the effects that would have on the most vulnerable members of our society.  There will be a motion on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order Paper on which I will ask for a debate and which request I will push to a vote if necessary.  Perhaps when the Leader and others have had a chance to see the motion we might be able to take a more collective approach to the issue.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with what Senator de B&uacute;rca and others said on the decision regarding the golf club.  It is worth reflecting on the fact that the equality agenda can sometimes be perverted to the point of intolerance.  In that regard, I was especially heartened to see that politicians on the left and the right wings of Italian public life were united in deploring the rather strange decision of the European Court of Human Rights to ban the display of crucifixes in school classrooms on the basis they contravene something called educational pluralism.   This is an example of equality, which is a perfectly good concept and one which should inform our public culture, being used and manipulated in way which is oppressive of a much-cherished tradition across a society.</P>
        <P>Italy was once rather cynically described as a place where communists prayed and cardinals did not.  I do not know if that was true.  The European Court of Human Rights may have picked the wrong target in Italy.  This highlights the importance of the Irish Constitution because the European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated at sub-constitutional level.  We have the protections of our guarantees of religious freedom and genuine educational pluralism where different groups of all faiths and none are funded by the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also worth noting that people, of whom I was one, were correct to seek guarantees in the Lisbon treaty on social and ethical issues because in the context of the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the coming together of the European Union and the European Court of Human Right&rsquo;s jurisprudence, it was very important that the European treaties be informed by a clarification which would respect what the Irish Constitution has to say about education and other matters.  In that regard, the politicians who negotiated those clarifications on behalf of Ireland are to be very much commended.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  He has a very wise head.  He has personal experience of national partnerships and played a very crucial role in this area in the 1980s.  RTE and TV3 would be well served if they allocated some time in their schedules in the next few weeks to bringing forward experts and economists.  Last night we were briefed by the economists Alan Ahearne and Jim O&rsquo;Leary who were excellent, and Colm McCarthy, who explained the situation.  It was a worthwhile exercise.  RTE and others could bring David McWilliams on board and try to give an idea of who else he was speaking to.  He disclosed certain confidentialities&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

        <P Just="Left">Like other Senators, I am heartened by the voice of experience, namely, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  He is talking with great experience.  There is nothing which cannot be achieved through dialogue.  If one gets people into one room, around one table and, if necessary, keep them there for a long time, a solution can be found.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, there are routes to a solution.  I like the bridging and equally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We will come to that anon.  This morning two good voices were on the radio, namely, Deputies Richard Bruton and Billy Kelleher.  There was a large measure of agreement.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct.  Everybody now knows we have to save &euro;4 billion.  Senator MacSharry mentioned it.  I thought we already agreed that this House would play a useful part, even if it was a small part, and make a good contribution by having an interplay here with the social partners.  That is the issue I raise with the Leader.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>The media should step back and let the social partners and politicians work this out in some way.  The media are creating so much doom and gloom that it is depressing those in the world outside.  The media have a responsibility to step back for a while until we see if we can get back some order to the finances.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Supreme Court ruling on the discrimination case involving Portmarnock golf club, the phrase that got to me was that this was a gentleman&rsquo;s club.  That would beg the question of what we mean by a gentleman in today&rsquo;s thinking.  It was a distasteful conclusion and I would like the Leader to perhaps bring the relevant Minister to the House to see if we can update that legislation.</P>

	<P>Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, used this House to make a very important statement on Northern Ireland.  He said it was worth noting that most of the challenges facing North and South do not divide along Nationalist and Unionist lines.  It was good to know that RTE at least recognised the Minister&rsquo;s use of this House this morning on the radio, as we do not always get the credit for some of the work that goes on here.</P>
        <P>In regard to the challenges facing the economy, Senator O&rsquo;Toole has received many comments about his contribution today.  He spoke about the need for certainty, and although nobody could disagree with him on that, it is not always easy to achieve it.  There are two other pertinent words.  The need for honesty is very important, as is patriotism.  For too long and too often we have said that somebody else should suffer pain and take the challenge.  We want somebody else to do something, and not just with the economy.  We have got into the habit of expecting somebody else to do things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was disappointed by the letter from congress because it called for five actions but only from the Government.  Perhaps the congress will also call for other action as well.  I am concerned that we may fudge the issue if we delay the required action so we must call for honesty.  We achieved success in the few years after 1987 because we took the required steps and solved the problem quickly at that stage.  We should not delay or fudge the matter.  We should by all means look for certainty but we must also look for honesty and patriotism.  That is what we must achieve ourselves rather than expect somebody else to achieve it for us.</P>

        <P>We are in a very difficult position and we need responsibility from our media.  INN, an independent news provider, used to give news to local radio stations but there are now two radio stations providing the news.  The realistic term for them is &ldquo;Newstalk Fine Gael&rdquo; and &ldquo;What the Opposition is saying Today FM&rdquo;.

        <P>With regard to swine flu, I heard Senator Feeney&rsquo;s comments but cannot agree with them.  The HSE created much spin on the national airwaves but in the midlands, doctors in the Athlone area still have not received the vaccine.  People are going to general practitioners&rsquo; surgeries but they are unable to get the vaccine.  The HSE is speaking the speak but not walking the walk.</P>
        <P>I visited a school on Monday and the youngsters asked me to raise the issue of the change in the junior certificate Irish paper.  The teachers were notified last week of the change in the type and form of the paper.  The junior certificate children whom I spoke to asked if it was fair that they had been studying the curriculum up to then but were landed with a bombshell that the paper would be changed for their exam.  The school in question was in the Leader&rsquo;s constituency so perhaps he will help us reply to those youngsters.</P>

        <P>Will the Leader obtain from the Minister&rsquo;s office the position and difficulties she is experiencing in meeting certain claims by claimants throughout the country?

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Leader&rsquo;s absence last Thursday, I raised a matter that has been raised again by Senator Marc MacSharry today and Senator Jerry Buttimer yesterday.  It runs along the lines suggested by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole that we would use in the immediate future this House as a forum for a genuine economic debate and presentation, where social partners and people concerned with the economic development of this country could make a presentation and engage in dialogue with us.  They would bring forward their ideas, listen to our concerns and engage in meaningful discussion.</P>
        <P>If we want this very important House of the Oireachtas to be relevant, we must deal with subjects of concern to the people.  No subject is more important or urgent than the immediate economic crisis facing the country.  We have discussions almost daily on the subject, especially <Col N="645"/>on the Order of Business, but we must move beyond talking to ourselves.  We must engage with and listen to the people concerned who may have different analyses but each in their own way has a worthy contribution.</P>
        <P>We must bring these people together and the Chamber of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in whatever form can be determined, is an ideal vehicle for economic debate.  It is an urgent matter and I asked for the debate to be put in place last Thursday.  There is little point in having such a discussion next January.  It is a bit of a challenge for the Leader but I know he respects the House and recognises the role that can be played by the House in turning this country around.  Within the next fortnight we must use this House to engage in immediate, urgent and expansive dialogue on the economic choices facing the country.  I look forward to the Leader taking the initiative and making this House relevant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that the Lisbon treaty has been dealt with once and for all and that all future legislation is to be referred to the national parliaments, this House could, as a starting point, create a major role for itself by having all proposed EU legislation debated in this Chamber.  For too long we have heard that no meaningful work is done in the House.  This is the sort of work that might well answer the public in this regard as well as provide proper scrutiny of all EU legislation other than in sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence and for understanding the rare occasion when strong views need to be expressed in the House.</P>
        <P>We have an economic crisis in the country and every speaker today has touched on it.  It is important union heads do not make it worse by promoting strikes and that they show real leadership at this time.  I offer one fact to bear this out.  The Union of Students of Ireland, USI, contacted me to say that 50 students per week are dropping out of college at present because of the delay in grants payments.  Members know, as do I, that local authorities have no money.  In UCD a dozen students per day visit the welfare office and at this time of year there are more than 200 new applications for student assistance.  Parents can no longer afford to bail out  students and students are choosing to live at home and drop out of college.  This is an educational crisis in the making.  The Government has not helped because the Student Support Bill was stalled in the other House on Second Stage 18 months ago.  It is incumbent upon us to put education on a sound financial footing.  I ask the Leader to give a timeframe for this Bill in the House.  Otherwise we will all suffer the folly of letting education suffer in our country.</P>
        <P>We can say many things, good and bad, about the HSE.  Within the past week, I was in the accident and emergency department with my family and spent &euro;559 between doctors, pharmacies, diagnostics and two accident and emergency department charges, the latter at the exorbitant cost of &euro;100 each.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Donohoe, Keaveney, Twomey, Feeney and Buttimer all expressed the shock and horror of Members at what happened to Adrian Ronan, his wife and family and the horrific ordeal they experienced over the past 36 hours.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, or a Minister of State will be in the House this afternoon on Committee Stage of the Criminal Procedure Bill and I am sure colleagues can find ways to highlight their serious concern with him.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing everything it can.  This is an entirely new dimension in these activities taking place in this country and we wish the Garda, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and everybody connected well in their endeavour.  There are special units within the Garda to deal with this and they are having success.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign  Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was in the House yesterday for a very enlightening debate.  I am sorry there was not enough time for the very many Members who wished to speak.  We will have another debate in the near future on Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement and all issues relating to North-South relations.  The Minister is totally committed to coming to the House on an ongoing basis for such debates and said so yesterday in the Chamber.  The challenges now being faced by the Garda and the banking fraternity possibly result from organisation splinter groups getting involved in these activities.  When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present on Committee Stage today, that would be an opportune time for Senators to offer an angle or make points.</P>
        <P>I wish to be associated with Senator Leyden&rsquo;s good wishes to Senator Shane Ross in his endeavour.  I congratulate Senator Ross on bringing so many and various matters to our attention last night in his publication.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White and Keaveney called on the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to come to the House for a debate on the abuse of children, funding for children&rsquo;s issues and the challenges facing the Minister of State in his departmental portfolio.  The Minister of State has agreed to come to the House for this debate but as Members will know, the NAMA legislation is being debated over three days next week so the earliest possible time will be during the following week.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Donohoe, O&rsquo;Sullivan, MacSharry, Leyden, Coghlan, Ormonde, Quinn and Healy Eames expressed views on the challenges of the forthcoming budget and the successful role social partnership has played in our country since 1987.  As Senator Feargal Quinn noted, honesty, integrity and patriotism are needed.  I agree with those sentiments and see some light in that all parties agree that raising &euro;4 billion in the budget is necessary.  It is just a matter of how that will be done.  The leadership of the trade unions have a responsibility, as do the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and everyone concerned, to ensure this takes place.  We have achieved a very great deal in recent years and we are known as a generation that meets challenges head on.   This is probably the most serious challenge we have faced in recent times.  We have seen it all before in the 1970s and 1980s and we are a resilient people.  I know we will come through this and can see light at the end of the tunnel. This budget must start the fight back and the way forward for our economy for the future.</P><Col N="647"/>
        <P>I welcome the statements made in the Chamber, led by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I look forward to our having not only one but at least two pre-budget debates.  This day five weeks is the day of the Budget Statement and I shall discuss with the leaders of the various parties and groups how we can have the debates take place in the House when the NAMA legislation is out of the way.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White spoke about young men and youth unemployment.  This is very timely, especially with regard to statistics on the challenges facing young men under 24 years of age.  I agree to a debate on this matter and will endeavour to have it take place as a matter of urgency within the next three weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators de B&uacute;rca and McFadden and very many other Senators expressed their views regarding the decision of the courts on golf clubs and courses.   Senators will not want to confuse golf courses with golf clubs.  They are two different things and those of us who know a lot about this know this to be true.</P>

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan outlined an important issue and called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to debate in the House the future of local government and the challenges it faces, especially in terms of town and county councils and their hard-working and dedicated members.  Most of us who have been local authority members know that hard work and dedication are required.  We will make the fullest amount of time available at the earliest opportunity to discuss the future of local authorities with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, Feeney, Callely and Healy Eames expressed their serious concerns regarding swine flu.  As I informed the House yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children is not available this week.  I want her to attend the House to update it on this matter.  I spoke to her private secretary just before this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business and I am endeavouring to arrange the earliest possible date for that discussion.  I share the Senators&rsquo; concerns.  When Senator Twomey speaks about health, I take his comments as sacrosanct and act upon them.</P>

As he correctly pointed out, the protocols inserted in the Lisbon treaty by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their officials and the Constitution protect us.  Concerning Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point, I have already mentioned the visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, to the House yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin and others referred to balance in the media and a need to be responsible, especially at this difficult time.  People are losing their jobs and financial pressure is the order of the day morning, noon and night for many families.  The media has a serious responsibility not to increase the difficulties of the 500,000 unemployed people by running programmes that will annoy them and only worsen their situation.  The media only want to know about bad news.  On the Order of Business, I have often asked which radio or television station would give us 30 minutes of good news every day.  We could enjoy life for those 30 minutes and then switch off.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When the debate adjourned last week I was making a point about planning enforcement.  I stated that when a planning application is granted with a number of conditions, condition No. 1 is always as follows from Fingal County Council:</P>
        <P LI="1">The development to be carried out in its entirety in accordance with the plans, particulars, specifications, and information lodged with the application, save as by the other conditions attached hereto.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If only that were true because in many cases it is not.  What if, as in many cases, the developer takes a chance and does something that he has not proposed in the hope of getting away with it?  In many cases nobody notices and he gets away with it.  What happens if a near neighbour notices?  The process is that the matter should be reported to the planning enforcement section of the local authority.  When a report and complaint are made, an inspector is sent out to investigate and write up a report.  On foot of this report the enforcement officer makes a decision either to pursue the developer or issue warnings etc., which may result in the developer applying for retention.  From the complainant&rsquo;s point of view this is positive as he or she can then lodge an objection to the retention application and may appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la if retention is granted by the local authority.</P>
        <P>However, the enforcement officer may decide it is only a minor infringement requiring no action.  This is a regular occurrence.  There is no appeals mechanism available to a complainant in such circumstances and in those cases the developer gets away with it.  I have observed the enforcement officer&rsquo;s decision may be influenced by a lack of staff.  From his or her desk in the county hall it may appear to be a minor matter but it may be a very serious matter for the neighbours concerned.  If the affected neighbours have not objected to the planning application in the first place, because in the absence of the infringement they had no difficulty with the <Col N="652"/>application, they cannot appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Enforcement officers have too much power in this specific regard leaving the process open to abuse.</P>
        <P>This matter must be addressed in the interest of democracy in the planning process.  I have not yet decided how to address the issue but I may table an amendment on Committee Stage.  Perhaps it should be open to anyone complaining about non-compliance with a planning condition and where an enforcement officer has rejected the complaint, to make an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An amendment to the Bill might suffice.</P>
        <P>I refer to a typical case with which I am familiar.  The developer includes a specific proposal in a planning application.  At additional information stage he is asked to remove it as it is not in keeping with the houses on either side. He does as he is requested by the planner and is subsequently given permission.  He then goes ahead and does it anyway.  The neighbours on either side complain but to no avail because the enforcement officer decides it is of no major significance.  The complainants then have nowhere else to go.  The planning law must be changed to allow some kind of an appeal in cases like this.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State and his officials to give serious consideration to this point.  The Minister of State may not regard this as a significant issue but from my first-hand experience I know it is.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  Planning applications and approvals have been on an upward and downward spiral in recent years, as a recent survey in <i>The Irish Times</i> confirms.  The newspaper carried out a survey of ten county councils and found a sizable fall in the number of applications made in the past three years.  The figures supplied to <i>The Irish Times</i> by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government showed that in 2008 there were 62,906 planning applications lodged, compared to 91,654 in 2007 and 97,226 in 2006.  The number of applications varied in county councils in different parts of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although it is a rural county in the north west, my county, Donegal, had one of the largest number of planning applications lodged in any county or city council in the country.  There has been much development and many sites would have been approved from 2005 or 2006 onwards.  Many of these developments did not go ahead and as a result, the people involved now have the option of proceeding with the development or seeking an extension of planning approval.  I will refer to this matter later.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased the Bill is before the Oireachtas and progressing through the Seanad.  It is an important Bill.  Its objectives include the support of economic renewal and the promotion of sustainable development.  One of its aims is to bring into closer alignment the national spatial strategy, the regional planning guidelines of the regional authorities, county development plans and local area plans.  This should facilitate closer working between the Minister, his Department and all the respective agencies involved.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to several sections of the Bill, including the one dealing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  One aim of the Bill is to improve the throughput and performance of the board.  The provision to give effect to this aim is intended to secure a higher compliance rate with the statutory period of 18 weeks.  In other words, a decision should be taken by the board within 18 weeks, or approximately four and a half months.  There is no question but that the board is taking significantly in excess of six months to make a decision on a sizable volume of applications.  This is unacceptable from the point of view of objectors and, more importantly, that of developers, especially in cases involving large-scale developments that may create employment in an area, whether hotel developments &mdash; although there are not too many such developments at present &mdash; or other job creating developments.</P><Col N="653"/>
        <P>I note section 28 proposes to reduce the quorum at meetings of An Bord Plean&aacute;la from three to two.  While I welcome the objective of trying to increase the throughput, I hold some reservations about reducing the quorum from three to two.  The board is made up of ten members.  If it cannot have at least three members present at all meetings, we should review the membership, not necessarily the membership of the organisation, but perhaps the individuals on the board from certain organisations.  If they cannot attend board meetings, the matter should be reviewed, rather than reducing the quorum to two.  I appreciate the reduction from three to two only relates to decisions of a minor nature such as those on smaller applications.  Nevertheless, I hold some reservations and concerns about the matter.  Some of my colleagues in county councils, for example, some councillors in County Donegal, have raised this matter cautiously also and they hold concerns about the matter.  I seek more information on it but I welcome the objective of the legislation and the recognition that reducing the timeframe of the board to administer applications needs to be dealt with.</P>
        <P>I refer to other issues related to the Bill, including the recognition of the refusal of planning permission in cases in which there has been previous unauthorised development.  Currently, the planning authority or the council can refuse permission on the basis of past failures to comply, having regard to certain information, and if it is satisfied the applicant is not in compliance with the terms of previous permissions.  It may form the opinion that there is a real and substantial risk a development may not be duly completed in accordance with the terms of planning permission and that permission should, therefore, be denied.  This is contained in section 35 of the principal Act of 2000.  The non-compliance referred to in section 35 of the 2000 Act must be substantial in nature.  Under the Bill, the planning authority will have new grounds on which to rely in forming the opinion that planning permission should not be granted.  These include where the applicant has carried out a substantial unauthorised development or has been convicted of an offence under the Act.  I welcome this measure because there are rogue developers who have, heretofore, gone from development to development without completing a previous one.  I am aware of several such developments in my constituency in which developers have finished up, sold on the houses but have not completed the estates or complied with the planning conditions in terms of finishing green areas or providing facilities for kids.  Such developers move on to the next development and the local council cannot do much about it.  I welcome this section of the Bill but trust the word &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; refers to the individual, not the company, because an applicant could go and form a new company and apply for planning permission under that company&rsquo;s name.  It is important permission is related to the individual rather than the company.  I trust the Minister of State will note this point.</P>
        <P>Another measure I welcome relates to a matter I raised on the Adjournment with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that is, the extension of planning permission.  I welcome the proposed amendment to section 42 of the 2000 Act by its replacement with section 23 of this Bill.  Until now, to have planning permission extended substantial works had to be carried out on developments.  In the recent climate this has placed a significant burden on individuals, whether young couples with planning permission for one house or small developers with planning permission for several houses.  I know of one such case in which the applicant is negotiating with Donegal County Council to purchase the houses for letting to local authority tenants.  However, there is an insecurity in the sense that the time allocated for permission is running out and no substantial works have taken place on the site.</P>
        <P>Section 23 states &ldquo;the authority is satisfied that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially mitigated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission&rdquo;.  It is important that very clear guidelines are issued to local authorities in respect of this section and I am confident this will be the case.  I welcome <Col N="654"/>the measure, as it is a major step forward that an individual, for example, a developer of a shopping centre or hotel, can seek a five year extension.  We all know of many young couples who cannot proceed because they cannot obtain finance for their development.  Such persons cannot go on site and section 23 would allow them to obtain a five-year extension.</P>
        <P>The Bill may not be enacted until the new year.  It is going through the Seanad and from here will go to the D&aacute;il but it may be January or February before it is enacted.  I recommend that consideration be given to respection for a period of six months in respect of this section.  If that were applied, the measure could date back to six months prior to the enactment of the Bill.  The Minister of State should consider this proposal.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to two other issues in respect of planning and development plans.  The new Bill does not take any consideration of objectors to planning applications.  I refer to counties such as County Donegal in which there are large volumes of holiday homes.  I have spent hours dealing with individual applications for local people and while the planning authority might be satisfied to grant permission, owners of holiday homes object and often such objectors forward the application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  People should be obliged to pay a high fee if they wish to object to a development that does not interfere directly with their permanent or principal place of residence.  If possible, this suggestion should be considered in the context of this Bill.  While it may need to be considered as part of future legislation, it is a matter of grave concern to many local people who live in areas in which there are large volumes of holiday homes.</P>
        <P>While the other issue to which I wish to refer also relates to planning, I understand it may be coming down the tracks through other legislation.  I refer to the issue of access to national roads and, in particular, the difficulty being experienced by individuals living in close proximity to national secondary roads.  The legislation does not distinguish between national secondary and national primary routes and the National Roads Authority is objecting to all applications for access to a national secondary route.  A clear distinction must be made between national primary and national secondary routes.  While my understanding is that this issue is being dealt with by the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I would appreciate an update on the issue from the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>This is great legislation, which I welcome.  I have raised a number of issues for consideration and it would be excellent if this were possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State and acknowledge the work he personally is undertaking on the rental sector.  New regulations are being introduced and far greater interest is being shown in that area, which is to be welcomed.  However, the purpose of this debate is to focus on the Bill.  I wish to raise a number of points, to which I would appreciate a response from the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>The first point pertains to the change to the definition of what constitutes a majority in a council chamber for the passing of development plans and council legislation that will influence how planning decisions are made.  The Bill proposes that the majority in this regard should be increased from a straight majority to one of two thirds.  The Minister should reconsider this proposal because it opens up the possibility of a group of councillors who object strongly to the development plan or planning legislation having the ability to stop the enactment of such a plan or legislation.  Such a group could be drawn from across all parties or from within a particular party and their opposition could be based on the principles upon which the entire plan is conducted or a limited part of the development plan.</P>
        <P>Obviously, we live under and operate in a democratic system.  If a simple majority of the electorate is good enough for the election of people to council chambers or most other chambers in Ireland, why is such a simple majority not good enough for the passing of a development <Col N="655"/>plan for a local authority area?  I raise my concerns in this regard specifically to emphasise that it opens up the opportunity for a development plan to be blocked or stalemate if a small number of council members are opposed to it.  Consequently, the possibility might arise that development plans might not be passed by local authorities because they are unable to find the significant majorities the legislation will require.  I fail to discern how this could be in the best interests of the operation or implementation of development plans or in the best interests of effective local government.</P>
        <P>My second point relates to a point on which Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill touched, the proposal in thie Bill to authorise the broadening of grounds upon which planning permission might be refused to an applicant.  The helpful briefing on the Bill indicated that under section 35 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, local authorities already had the power to refuse planning permission to applicants if their previous planning history made it likely that a new planning permission received by them might not be enacted in the manner in which the local authority would wish.  The Law Reform Commission report of 2008 which commented on this area indicated that up to that point, this legislative provision had never been used by any local authority.  This appears to be a highly sensible provision to have in our laws.  If a person has a serial history of breaching the planning permission he or she has received, this history should be considered in any future planning application for permission he or she seeks.  However, before Members engage in strengthening or changing the criteria upon which planning permission may be refused, surely they should consider the law that has been in place for the past nine years to ascertain how it can be made to work more effectively.  I refer, in particular, to the fact that it never appears to have been implemented.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government publishes many statistics in respect of implementation of the planning laws by local authorities.  I am particularly familiar with its work on the quality of rental accommodation and the manner in which it is provided every year by local authorities.  Perhaps this could be considered for this aspect of the planning laws.  Before strengthening or changing what is in place &mdash; I do not necessarily oppose such changes &mdash; Members should ask a more fundamental question regarding the reason the existing law is not being implemented as it appears to be a useful legal provision that would do much to drive compliance with the terms of planning permissions already granted.</P>
        <P>The third point which has been touched on by other Members pertains to the change this legislation makes in reducing the statutory quorum for An Bord Plean&aacute;la board decisions from three to two.  I question the reason for this change, given that many decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la are extremely important and have a significant effect on the communities upon which the decisions are made.  Reducing the number of involved in such decisions from three to two appears to be more likely to lead to compromise decisions being reached as opposed to decisions that are in the best interests of planning law and the community who depend on such decisions being made.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill noted, if three people are not capable of coming together and making the correct decision, surely the composition of the board should be revised and its operation examined rather than reducing the number involved in such decisions.</P>
        <P>A fourth point to make in respect of this legislation is that it broadens the definition of the number of areas in which a local authority can take an area in charge.  It appears to do this in two ways.  First, it moves away from defining the area of land as multi-unit dwellings.  Second, it appears to change the definition of those involved in this decision from people who are voters to those who are home owners.  Both changes appear to be worthwhile but before Members engage in making such a decision, a more important question to be asked is whether the local authority will have the money to run and regulate properly the new areas they might be asked to take in charge.  In all cases, I would be supportive of a decision by a community to move away from being regulated and run by a private body to an environment in which it was <Col N="656"/>regulated and looked after by the local authority.  That seems to be a good thing to do but we already know that local authorities are severely strapped for cash.  Asking them to care for more land and dwellings, without having the money to do so, is a bad idea.  In addition to the decision that land be taken in charge, we should put in place the funding mechanism required to ensure a city or county council will have the money to do the job well.  The Bill does not appear to answer the question.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to broadening the use of development levies in order that local authorities can spend the money on school provision.  This is a great idea.  The Bill also refers to broadband provision but these are areas in which the local authorities have no competence.  Responsibility for the planning and provision of schools lies with the Department of Education and Science.  The Bill will broaden the definition of the use to which development levies can be put to give local authorities the ability to spend money in these areas.  We should examine transferring responsibility for where and how schools are built from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities.  The latter will have the best idea of future population trends and what is happening with development.  If they have the option of spending more money on this, they should have responsibility to make the bigger decisions.</P>
        <P>There is a gap in the legislation.  A number of agencies have been set up and they operate at times outside the planning environment in which most people must deal.  The prime example is the Dublin Docklands Development Authority which has the ability to initiate planning decisions and planning permissions in a way that is very different from how the vast majority of decisions are made.  That seems to be the wrong thing to do and we are now paying the price.  I want to see agencies being roped into planning law with which the vast majority must comply.  Even if it takes longer for planning decisions to be made and more people must become involved, it seems the additional time spent on these decisions is a small price to pay to ensure they are properly made and cannot be challenged in the future.  This is a matter the legislation should examine.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the principle of the Bill.  When the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, spoke on the Bill, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am pleased to bring the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 before the Seanad.  If there is one clear point to be made about planning, it is that planning is about people, not buildings.  Good planning can bring enormous benefits to individuals and communities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I concur with what he said and it is an important point.  As someone involved in public life, planning in rural areas has been close to my heart for 25 years.  At some stage we must grasp the nettle.  Planning in rural areas is a quagmire, loaded with flawed policy and inconsistencies.  As a public representative and a former member of a council for almost 19 years, some 80% of my time was taken up making representations on such matters.  There has been, unfairly and unjustly, prejudice against people living in rural areas and participating in the parishes and communities in which they grew up, which they cherish and love.  In this case I refer to genuine local needs, not someone from Dublin who is moving to the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Peninsula or Connemara.  I am talking about local people who want to acquire a site from their uncle, aunt, father or brother.  Unfortunately, when I spoke to colleagues as a Deputy and as a Senator, I noticed that the position varied from county to county.  In some counties the system is much easier.  Isolation will be further compounded by the impossible position of young couples seeking to <Col N="657"/>obtain planning permission and live in rural Ireland.  The position varies from area to area, which is most unfortunate.</P>
        <P>I am not much of a racegoer and was never at the Galway races or in the tent.  I might have been at the races in Killarney or Listowel once or twice.  At the Aintree Grand National meeting great race horses and jockeys negotiate a very difficult course which includes Beecher&rsquo;s Brook, the Elbow and the other fences and jumps about which we hear so much.  From my experience, I would have as much chance of obtaining planning permission in parts of rural Ireland as I would of surviving the Aintree Grand National course riding an ass or a donkey.  It is a terrible system under which one must beg with planners but each planner differs from the next.  One must also speak to the engineers but in the case of some 60% of the planning applications eventually approved, I had to beg the county manager to bend the rules.  I am not talking about big developments but places such as the Mizen, Sheep&rsquo;s Head and Beara Peninsulas.  People should be able to live in their community, if they wish.  That is why I quoted the Minister&rsquo;s comment that planning was about people.</P>
        <P>In Crookhaven, at the end of the Mizen Peninsula, almost 90% of houses are holiday homes.  I recently dealt with a person who could not obtain planning permission, despite the presence of holiday homes.  A few years ago an American who visits every three years objected to a local man and his wife who had one child receiving planning permission on the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Peninsula.  The school in the area, Rushnacahara, had 13 pupils.  I asked the county manager to visit the site, although he should not have had to do so.  I explained that if the population were to drop further, the school would close.  The American was listened to all the way up the line, including by An Taisce, whereas the local couple who had received a site from the man&rsquo;s brother could not receive planning permission.  The county manager was in the area on a Sunday morning and facilitated me by examining the site.  This is typical of the cases I have encountered during the years.  It is absolutely crazy.</P>
        <P>Some regulations come from national Government and others from the European Union but we are hampered by the rules and regulations dealing with special areas of conservation and scenic landscapes.  Parts of Ireland have been spoiled and damaged by bad planning.  I would consistently like to see good planning.  If family members want to live in the community in which they grew up rather than in a city 70 or 80 miles away, whether they play football or hurling, they should receive preferential treatment.  Trying to obtain planning permission is like trying to pull a tooth from a duck.  It is a waste of resources.  I have spoken to people in other political parties who spend 80% of their time in county hall dealing with applications for planning permission instead of important issues of policy for the county.  They must hop from one planner to another to try to resolve rural planning issues.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State comes from a rural constituency and I ask him to address the matter.  I am emotive about it because I have put so much time and energy into it but I do not see the position changing or improving.  Huge, rushed developments have been constructed in towns and villages in my area, some of which will be taken over by NAMA, while others will remain an eyesore.  Very few applications are for rural one-off houses, in respect of which a couple has obtained a site but cannot proceed further.  In this regard, I want to make it quite clear I am 100% supported by groups such as Macra na Feirme, Irish Rural Link, the IFA, the ICMSA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, the ICA and many other country groups that have made this point from time to time.</P>
        <P>It is an absolute wrong and injustice that An Taisce has any involvement with one-off rural planning and I make this point very forcibly.  I have made it previously on national radio and on RTE television.  I do not state that An Taisce should be abolished.  It was established in the early 1980s and I believe the Minister at the time was Dick Spring.  His motives were honour<Col N="658"/>able and it has a role to play.  However, at present An Taisce is obliged to be notified of all planning in rural areas throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have been in politics for 25 years and I could not name two members of An Taisce in west Cork.  However, consistently it shoots down planning applications because once An Taisce puts its name to an objection the county manager shivers and quakes.  There is a serious bias in An Bord Plean&aacute;la &mdash; I state this in public &mdash; in favour of An Taisce and against local people.  I am not discussing the wealthy American, Dubliner or German who comes in with loads of money and wants to build in the Sheep&rsquo;s Head or Mizen Peninsulas.  I have no truck with them and good luck if they get planning permission.  However, there seems to be a huge difficulty with local people.  Legislation should be changed to make the situation such that An Taisce has no role to play in rural planning.  Such a role was never intended when it was first established.</P>
        <P>An Taisce certainly has a role in protecting our heritage and I give it that but there is a lack of transparency, whether it be in west Cork, west Kerry or Donegal.  It is not fair that members of An Taisce in west Cork object to developments in Donegal, Mayo and, on one occasion, a golf course in Clare.  On another occasion, people from Mayo &mdash; I do not know who they were &mdash; objected to a mast in the village of Leap in west Cork.  The people there had no reception for some RTE stations &mdash; I am not discussing Sky or any other such channel &mdash; and building the mast was held up for seven or eight years.  The objectors were listened to.  I am not sure whether the issue of those who object to planning applications for spurious reasons is covered in the Bill but we should examine it.  We must seriously examine whether an American who comes to the Sheep&rsquo;s Head every three years for three weeks or somebody from the Beara Peninsula who is retired and from another jurisdiction can object to a fish factory in Donegal or a golf course in Clare.</P>
        <P>The Bill has some very salient features and in that regard I compliment the Minister of State but it does not address the real issues facing rural Ireland.  Sustainable development is mentioned and I know from coming from a peninsula, having been born on the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Peninsula, that there is a decline in population in the Kilcrohane western end of that area of 30% over three census figures.  That gives an indication of decline.  Almost 90% of Crookhaven is made up of holiday homes.  The locals who want to raise their families there, whether they are involved in fishing, cheese making or are small farmers, have to jump through all types of hula-hoops.</P>
        <P>I can recall only very rare occasions when somebody was awarded planning permission holus-bolus with the conditions within the two month period.  Those occasions are the exception to the rule.  Inevitably permission is either refused or deferred for further information.  All types of road blocks are met and one planner varies from another.  The lack of consistency and guidelines in rural planning is an absolute disgrace.  The Minister of State might well state the issue is at local authority level but I do not agree with that.  I have spoken to Members from other counties who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I wish the Leas-Chathaoirleach would give me another half an hour.</P>
        <P>I spoke to representatives from other counties who stated that the situation varies from county to county.  I will move from the issue of one-off housing but I am sorry to do so because I could write a thesis on it.</P>
        <P>In his speech here on Second Stage the Minister referred to wind farms.  I suggest to him that a big lacuna exists in this area.  I support the concept of wind farms in principle and I have <Col N="659"/>always held that wind energy is necessary.  However, a very difficult situation arose in my area where the local authority granted planning permission to a wind farm but there were protests and shenanigans about the 15 km line to the grid.  Eventually, the developer was forced to put the line underground.  Some people state that is not economically viable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot understand why a local authority does not deal with the granting of planning permission for a wind farm at the same time as dealing with its connection to the national grid.  It is a very obvious point as in places such as west Cork or Kerry the grid lines run one way or another.  When the line from the wind farm in west Cork was being planned objections were made.  When the local community came together and suggested putting the line away from houses and over mountain areas the local authority disagreed and routed it in such a way that in two instances the line came within 50 m of dwelling houses were youngsters lived.  I am not sure how many kilovolts it carried but it was a large amount as there were 18 turbines on the farm.  This type of planning annoys the public as it lacks common sense.</P>
        <P>I am sorry I have been negative but I want to make the point that we have not got to the core of the issue on rural planning.  Perhaps the day should come when rural planning should be vested, as it was at one time, with the executive of local authorities and councillors should be left out of it.  It is a heartache and a headache and it has been a stressful issue for me over the years.  I have not been a member of a local authority since 2003 but councillors tell me they still have the same headaches.  This is not only in west Cork but across the board, including in Kerry, Galway and Clare.</P>
        <P>If I could succeed on something today it would be to ask the Minister of State to address the fact that objections, An Taisce&rsquo;s involvement in rural planning and delays with An Bord Plean&aacute;la are very frustrating for people in rural Ireland and to trickle this down to local authorities.  It is almost a question of turning off the lights in parts of west Cork and forgetting about them because they face Becher&rsquo;s Brook every which way they turn.  It is also frustrating for planners and county managers and they should have something else to do rather than spending hours, days and weeks dealing with planning applications.  It is like Lanigan&rsquo;s ball; I step in, you step out, we step in together and then fall out over it.  It is a pure mess.  I am being more than sincere and emotional about the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran.  He is a distinguished past Member of the Seanad.  We cannot avoid putting this Bill in a proper context and stating what is not that palatable about it.  Effectively, it is a Soviet-style takeover of micro-planning by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Department.  It is a communist operation; it is a centralisation of planning power and micro-planning.  It is wrong and should not happen.  The great challenge for Senator Cassidy and his colleagues in the Seanad is to consider joining us in voting against the Bill on Second Stage.  They know from their involvement at local level and from being rooted with so many councillors throughout the country that it should be voted against.</P>
        <P>I will go through the Bill in more specific terms and substantiate my opening remarks.  An amendment to a draft development plan and variations to a development plan will require the support of at least two thirds of a local authority.  That is undemocratic.  It stops the normal majority system from functioning in a local authority.  While it could be argued that it copperfastens it, it will work as an undemocratic and blunt instrument and I disapprove of it.  A two thirds majority is also required for the local area plan and to grant planning permission for developments that would materially contravene the development plan.  We are getting rid of <Col N="660"/>majority voting and a means of expressing the public will and the wishes of the democratically elected members of councils.  That is a disturbing development.</P>
        <P>The Minister plans to extend his power so that he can issue directions on local area plans.  Traditionally, the departmental guidelines had to be taken into account in planning decisions, which was reasonable and right, but the guidelines have now been put on a much stronger statutory footing, and evidence must be given by the local authority that it took into account and interpreted the guidelines and that its planning is consistent with them.  It is a nice way of saying that the local authority has no discretion.  Effectively, that will be the outcome.  A council must issue a statement, when making a draft development plan, detailing how the policies and objectives of the Minister contained in the guidelines have been followed and, equally, why they have not been followed.  That gives a whole new status to the guidelines, which were instructive and were taken heed of in the past but are now becoming diktats from on high.</P>
        <P>The provision under which the mandatory population threshold for preparing local area plans is raised from 2,000 to 5,000 is disturbing for our rural representatives and for much of the country.  It is stated that the optional threshold for local area plans is between 2,000 and 5,000.  This effectively institutes a bias towards the larger population centres and will stop the development of smaller areas by preventing the development of sewerage systems and other infrastructure so that they can never grow.  I am not being flippant when I say that Senator Cassidy and his group will need to reflect considerably on this before they decide how to vote.  It is a disturbing diminution of democracy and of the wishes of local communities.  The fact that a small area with a population of up to 2,000 could have had a local area plan in the past was important because it gave it the potential to grow and conferred it with its constitutional and natural right to exist as a small community.  This is a disturbing development.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, development contributions can be used to fund new infrastructure such as school sites, broadband provision and flood relief works.  I do not have a difficulty with that on principle, unless it is used as an excuse for central funding in these areas and drains the local authority of resources.  However, it is a case of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  There was an opportunity in Celtic tiger times to accumulate moneys that could have been used to build schools in major population centres where large estates had been built.  The instrument would need to have retrospective effect because the money will be hard to access.  The provision is of little relevance in a modern context.  However, the principle is not wrong as long as the local authority will not be denuded of money.</P>
        <P>A residential estate can be taken in charge by a local council in certain circumstances on foot of a request from the majority of owners or occupants.  That is an acceptable proposition in cases in which estates need to be taken in hand by the local authority.  There is now a difficulty with some estates not being properly finished and builders not being able to access credit or capital to allow them to finish off estates.  There are many unfinished estates throughout the country, so this is a major issue.  Much thought and imagination will need to be used to resolve this.</P>
        <P>The provisions which almost give the Minister&rsquo;s guidelines legal standing, so that local authorities must explain why they are not implementing them, is wrong, as are the requirement for a two-thirds majority is wrong and the failure to allow local area development plans for areas of small population up to 1,700 or 1,800 people.  These all represent a Soviet-style centralisation of power.  It is Stalinism in an Irish context.  It reflects a philosophy among the Government that only the big population centres matter.  It will deliver services to these centres to obtain economies of scale but the wishes of people who live in dispersed communities will be diluted.  That can hardly be right.</P><Col N="661"/>
        <P>I wish to comment on the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  This cannot be echoed often enough in the House.  Nobody should interfere with the right of an individual &mdash; a young person, a farmer&rsquo;s son or a son of any other local person &mdash; to build a house on the family&rsquo;s farm or lands, within normal guidelines and with proper sewerage and so on.  This should not be diminished.</P>
        <P>The fact that the Government was accruing a surplus of income from willy-nilly developments and extra housing during the Celtic tiger years, and that it allowed unwieldy and perhaps improper developments in places, cannot now become a reason for diminishing democracy, removing local area plans, removing the role of the local councillor, imposing guidelines and bringing in an impossible majority voting system.  The Green Party may have two thirds majority voting within its own party but it cannot be transposed to local authorities.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Reilly f&aacute; choinne a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; nach aonta&iacute;m le m&oacute;r-chuid den m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; aige.  D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; mo chuid phoint&iacute; f&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>I could talk at some length about planning as it is an area that has exercised me as a councillor and Senator.  I will not be voting against Second Stage of this Bill because new legislation is required in the area of planning, although I do not believe this is the finished article and I will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.  I would like to have the opportunity to do that, and voting against the legislation would not allow us an opportunity to reshape it.</P>
        <P>I am approaching this from the point of view of someone who lives in a rural area which is designated a town.  I support rural housing.  I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s assertion that we have enough housing land rezoned to last us until 2075.  This is absolute nonsense.  It is technically true, but it does not stack up.  Planners use this time and time again.  In an area such as my own &mdash; the Derrybeg-Bunbeg area in County Donegal, in which the town is designated under the county development plan &mdash; houses can be built at eight to the acre, but in reality, nobody will build at this density.  It can be done but it will not be.  All land zoned within that area &mdash; every hectare of it &mdash; would need to be built upon to provide the figures the Minister continues to put out.</P>
        <P>The other problem with the figures is that the infrastructure is not in place.  The council has just rejected a proposal to build a shop unit and two apartments in the centre of the town.  It cannot be progressed because there is no sewerage scheme in the town.  That is replicated right across the State.  We need to get real.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision allowing the extension of planning permissions.  The amendment proposed is quite cumbersome, specifying that the authority must be satisfied either that there have been substantial works or that works could not be carried out for commercial, economic or technical reasons.  I would like to see definitions in this regard.  If a person has planning permission to build a house but has not built it because he or she cannot get a loan from the bank, what will be required?  Will he or she need to provide all the paperwork, including bank statements and so on, which will tie up the planners as they go through them, simply to prove we are in a recession?  The process could be made simpler.  The idea is right but let us not tie people up with an entirely new application which takes eight weeks to process and requires that an agent be employed to lodge the paperwork.</P>
        <P>The principle of development contribution schemes for schools is worthwhile but I disagree with its application because, as other Senators have noted, the buck is being passed to local authorities.  Contribution schemes are excessive in some areas and they represent a major burden for rural self-build projects.  As the schemes are not covered by mortgages, individuals <Col N="662"/>must bear the costs by themselves.  I am opposed to widening the schemes because the Exchequer should fund site acquisitions for schools.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a very contentious body.  It has recently made interesting decisions on two major infrastructure projects in County Donegal, the Stranorlar-Balleybofey bypass and the 100 kV power line project for the west and south of the county.  The board approved the 100 kV line despite the inspector&rsquo;s recommendation that it be rejected, whereas it rejected the bypass in the face of the inspector&rsquo;s recommendation for approval.  I am concerned that two or three people in the board&rsquo;s offices in Dublin can overturn the plans made by road designers and council planners and thereby throw their projects into chaos.  It took the board two years to make these decisions, which is another problem.</P>
        <P>We can use planning to support Irish language communities.  The Irish language and the Gaeltacht ought to be added to section 4, which requires that local development plans take cognisance of housing.  I understand why the population threshold for local area plans is being increased from 2,000 to 5,000 in light of the pressures involved in delivering such plans, but this is unfortunate because they are the best way to provide planning.  I would like the threshold to remain at 2,000.</P>
        <P>I support the requirement for a quorum of two thirds of local authority members.  I have experience of councillors making terrible rezoning decisions without considering planning needs.  The two thirds requirement will force councillors to be more considerate in their decisions and allow smaller parties and individuals to raise their concerns.</P>
        <P>According to the legal opinion we have received, council takeovers of estate management can only be initiated by owners.  However, some owners may not want local authorities to take over their estates before construction is complete or because they are awaiting planning permission on other projects.  A provision should be included in the Bill whereby the residents of local estates can lobby local authorities to enter discussions with owners on a management takeover.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about the new regulations which prohibit developments adjacent to national primary and secondary roads.  This has landlocked people across a massive area of County Donegal.  This issue has been raised for many years with the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and it needs to be resolved immediately.  I share the Minister&rsquo;s concerns regarding road safety and turning points but we need to be imaginative in finding a solution.</P>
        <P>I will not be voting against the Bill on Second Stage because I believe it can be improved through amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the introduction of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009.  I shall address specific sections of the Bill before making more general observations.</P>
        <P>Section 7 recommends that material amendments to county development plans require the support of two thirds of the total number of councillors as opposed to a simple majority.  As this will involve two thirds of all local authority members rather than of those who are present, I suggest that a simple majority should apply to the making of plans.  However, I agree that a majority of two thirds should be required for variations to or contraventions of a plan.</P>
        <P>Sections 14 to 16 strengthen the status of regional authorities in the preparation of county development plans.  While it is acceptable for regional authorities to make submissions regarding the preparation of development plans, the final decision must rest with local authority members.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to allow a regional authority to insist that local auth<Col N="663"/>orities act in accordance with its recommendations when plans are prepared or amended.  The status of regional authorities must be clarified to ensure the powers of local authority members are not diluted.</P>
        <P>Section 20 provides that a planning authority may refuse planning permission where an applicant is substantially non-compliant with a previous permission.  The intention of the section is well-founded but how will it deal in practice with an applicant who applies for planning permission in somebody else&rsquo;s name or where a new company with the same directors as a non-compliant company is established to make a new application?  It is simple at present to avoid the implications of this section.</P>
        <P>One of the most important provisions in the Bill is the extension of time for existing planning applications, especially given the current credit and financial constraints faced by young couples.  If a young couple&rsquo;s planning permission runs out over the remaining months of this year, will they be covered in terms of extending the five-year period?  I commend the Minister on this extension which allows people time to breathe.  Where somebody has already gone to considerable time and expense in making a planning application, would he or she qualify for an extension from a local authority?</P>
        <P>In the counties surrounding Dublin and other cities, rural villages which originally had populations of only 400 people &mdash; I have in mind a village in my own county &mdash; may have been expanded by several hundred houses.  New schools are required in many instances.  The bishop in my county has very generously provided a site for a new school free of charge but funding is required from the Department of Education and Science.  Developers who in the good times sold properties for high prices should pay a ring-fenced development contribution to the infrastructure needs of the additional population.  Planning fees could include provisions for building extra classrooms in existing or new schools.  They could also address demands for community centres.  In most areas, community centres that have been built with funding and support from the national lottery would be in serious trouble were it not for the Gaelic Athletic Association.  A development charge should be levied to fund community centres.  Without a place to communicate, young boys and girls will not have anything to do.  Community centres are also used for other purposes, including meetings for parents.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Once a sewerage scheme is completed in a village, there is nothing to prevent development and developers will appeal refusals to grant planning permission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that basis.  Everyone is then allowed to build 50 or 100 houses.  While County Westmeath has not experienced the same level of excessive development as County Meath and other counties closer to Dublin, over-development had commenced in towns such as Kinnegad and Killucan.  In Rochefortbridge, hundreds of houses were built despite the fact that the town did not even have an automated teller machine, ATM, to allow people to withdraw cash using their bank cards.  Local people expect the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science to fund the necessary support services.  While we should acknowledge that developers have made a significant contribution to the economy in the past 20 years, they should be required to make a contribution towards funding schools and community centres in areas under development.</P>
        <P>On the proposed area plans, I accept that the national spatial strategy hubs and gateways should take precedent for development and welcome provisions on areas with populations of up to 2,000 and 5,000.  However, I also support the right of sons and daughters of local people to build a one-off house in family plots or gardens, many of which are one acre sites provided with council cottages.  Permitting such development allows people to be close to and look after their parents in the later years of life.  In return, the parents baby-sit and mind their grandchildren during the working day.  This makes for good, wholesome family life in rural areas. <Col N="664"/> We must ensure nothing interferes with the rural quality of life to which we, in rural areas, have become accustomed.  In the main, I welcome the Bill and seek its passage through the House.  I thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  While I am in favour of some aspects of the Bill, I do not support other provisions because they are not logical.  I hope the Minister will introduce amendments on Committee and Report Stages and I have no doubt the legislation will change significantly during its passage through the Houses.</P>
        <P>The Minister has all but blamed councillors for the economic downturn.  While councillors zone land, planning permission is granted by county managers.  Section 140 powers, under which a county manager may be directed to grant planning permission, are seldom used.  For this reason, county managers are to blame for many of the bad developments around the country because they are effectively the chief planning officers of the councils and local authorities.  Councillors draw up a plan on which submissions are made by objectors and supporters, including council officials.  In recent years, the Department has intervened at the final stages of some area plans.  Councillors who draw up area plans are not the cause of our financial problems.</P>
        <P>To take the Minister&rsquo;s logic to its conclusion, the more land that is zoned, the greater the availability of development land and the lower the price for sites.  If the number of acres of zoned land is reduced, as proposed, the price of development land and sites will increase.  The Minister&rsquo;s plan envisages that land will only become available on a phased basis.  Surely this will increase the cost of development and zoned land because the amount of development land available will decline.  If the amount of zoned land is reduced, we will return to the old days when restrictions were imposed on development land in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister has extended the validity of planning permissions for a further five years.  I presume his decision is connected to the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency which will acquire many of the loans for these developments.  Without planning permission, the sites in question would be worthless.  While I do not have a problem with the proposal to extend planning permissions for five years, I expect the Minister to make alterations in certain cases where the proposed developments reflect poor planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want me to remove the provision?  I have been receiving representations from the Opposition on this issue for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Slight changes could be made to some of the proposals.</P>
        <P>A few years ago, the Fine Gael Party tabled a motion on construction standards on the basis that properties were being built without insulation, particularly in Dublin.  As a result of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party&rsquo;s decision to vote against the motion, a large number of houses were built using cavity blocks and do not meet insulation standards.  If planning permissions are to be extended for a further five years, I hope the Minister will table an amendment providing that properties built on the basis of such permissions must be insulated and stipulating what type of block must be used.</P>
        <P>Another problem with the Bill is that it establishes a hierarchy among towns.  The national spatial strategy designated gateways and hubs which will be allowed to grow at the expense of smaller towns.  The Minister indicated that area plans will not be permitted for towns with a population of less than 2,000.  This means they will not be prioritised for sewerage and water treatment facilities and will never be given priority if there is a hub town in the local area because its population is expected to increase to a specified number within a specified timeframe.</P><Col N="665"/>
        <P>Figures from the Central Statistics Office show the population is not increasing.  Population growth in many hubs and gateways has, therefore, ceased.  What provision has been made for transport facilities in towns and villages with a population of fewer than 2,000?  How will access points from these smaller centres to the larger gateways and hubs develop?  If the population of these smaller towns does not increase, transport services will not be viable and eventually shops, pubs and other outlets will close.</P>
        <P>In our county development plan we have area plans for villages, as well as towns with a population of up to 2,000.  A population of 2,000 is quite a sizeable town.  It may not be considered so in Dublin but in a rural areas it is a considerable size for a town which provides a lot of facilities such as schools, gaming facilities, shops and supermarkets.  Some towns of that size are a hive of activity.  Many towns have experienced difficulties in getting extensions to water and sewerage treatment units over the past number of years, but under the plan the Minister has put in place they will have that problem for many years to come until the hub in their area grows to the size of population required by the Minister.</P>
        <P>I note the<i> Irish Independent</i> on 10 October 2002 stated councillors zoned enough land in the country for 3 million extra people.  That is nearly double the size of the population.  The article discusses each county in great detail.  It states my county has done enough planning for more than 7,000 extra houses.  There are plans for 92,000 additional houses in Donegal, 10,500 in Sligo and 20,000 in Waterford.  If that type of zoning exists, surely it is not a great priority unless the Minister makes provision for putting some of the land back into agricultural use.  I do not know if councillors, landowners or the county managers would instigate a situation whereby the land would revert to agricultural use.</P>
        <P>I welcome some aspects of the Bill.  There are some good aspects to it.  The Minister must examine the proposed 80% windfall tax.  An 80% tax would be an absolute disaster.  There would be no commercial activity and nobody would do anything.  If a person has a site or piece of land to zone but 80% of the value will go the taxpayer, he or she will sit on it and will not do anything.  It beats me why the proposed tax is so high.  I advise the Minister if that provision stays in the Bill there will be no activity in terms of rezoning land from agricultural use to commercial or housing use.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to change the adoption of a county development plan from a simple majority to a two thirds majority.  I have heard various Senators speak on the issue and have dealt with a considerable number of county development plans over the past 25 years while I was a member of town and county local authorities.  Councillors put in a significant performance in the adoption of a county development plan.  It takes an awful lot of their time and energy, as well as that of the staff of local authorities.  It is never a simple thing to get a county development plan passed.  In this Bill the Minister says in some cases eight people may well have more power than 16 people.  Why would a smaller number have the right to hold up the adoption of a county development plan?  As we are in a democracy, surely the majority should rule.  It is not always easy to get a majority of a local authority to pass a development plan.  It is an area which the Minister should re-examine and it should go back to a simple majority.  I have a number of other things to say on the Bill but I will hold them until Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I have not had the pleasure of being here for most of the Second Stage debate.  While I am familiar with some of the provisions of the Bill, I want to use this opportunity to make a few general points on planning.</P>
        <P>I am from the north west, namely, the gateway city of Sligo.  I am very focused on the issue of balanced regional development.  The wish for those of us who live on the western seaboard is to be able to live and develop the provision of the services we would like there and not have <Col N="666"/>to have travel an unreasonable distance to secure the kind of administrative and various other services one would have the benefit of in the larger cities.</P>
        <P>In that context, the spatial strategy has been a document we have selectively dipped in and out of.  When we were doing something as a Government over recent years which fitted in with the strategy we would say it was in line with the spatial strategy.  More often than not, when it did not, we did not mention it.</P>
        <P>Sligo has been a major beneficiary in terms of decentralisation programmes from 1989 to more recent years, which has been very successful.  When we last visited the issue of decentralisation we should have focused exclusively on the nine gateway centres.  Like in the United States where, for example, heavy industry is located in Detroit, medical services and devices are in Chicago and so on, we could have a critical mass of activity and develop our nation along these lines in a strategic way.  The hubs would feed off the gateways and the smaller villages and towns, such as my colleague, Senator Burke, mentioned would, in turn, feed off them.  In a more general sense, the national spatial strategy needs to be examined in a more strategic fashion and in a cross-departmental, joined-up way.  All policy and not just planning should feed into that because heretofore we have been far too selective about it.</P>
        <P>One of the main issues I have, to which I briefly alluded, is that we in the west live there and do not wish to preserve it solely as the weekend destination of the urban dweller.  We want to live there, have our services there and have due cognisance taken of that.  I am cognisant of the need to have not a free for all but I am equally cognisant of the fact it is possible to achieve the objectives the people of the north west want, while upholding rules and sustainability.</P>
        <P>The right to object is something which has always bothered me.  If somebody is based in Dublin and wants to take a view on a dwelling home to be built in Enniscrone<b> </b>in County Sligo, I have a problem with such a person having the right to object.  It is problematic.  Such a person is not doing a service <i>per se</i>, particularly if a family wants to build a home within reasonable design guidelines.  I do not feel one should have the right to object in such circumstances.  I would like the Minister to examine the issue.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious of an issue which emerged last week, that is, the EU ruling that we were in breach of certain standards in septic tanks.  It was mentioned that we would have to have a licensing system for them which I am not against in principle.  It is a good idea and we will have to assess septic tanks which are already in place all over the country.  Many will have to be replaced.  Following the ruling last week there is a lot of fear that a significant cost will be involved.  It costs between &euro;4,000 and &euro;8,000 to replace a septic tank.  As we prepare this law for next year, will funds be put in place to help people who cannot afford that but who may be in breach of the ruling because they have an older septic tank?  They want to be compliant with the law but do not have the means to do so.  As with the other very worthwhile grant schemes, which the Minister has presided over in terms of insulation and so on, could funds be set aside to ensure families throughout the country in rural Ireland who are being served by substandard septic tanks or waste water systems are helped?</P>
        <P>I want to mention briefly the role of An Taisce.  While it does some very good work and I support many of its schemes, one of its senior officials said to me it was its intention to close Sligo Airport.  I do not wish to come down on either side of a planning application by the airport to extend its runway.  I take no view on it.  It is a frightening statement from a senior official in An Taisce.  This is a gateway town under the national spatial strategy and I am sure the Minister will reaffirm that issue.  To say there is an intention to close Sligo Airport is extremely shocking.  If that is the perspective of a senior official in what is a good organisation &mdash; An Taisce does good work &mdash; I would have concerns about it being a prescribed organis<Col N="667"/>ation.  A senior official would be in a position to steer that particular organisation down certain routes and with certain agendas.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage there will be various opportunities to get into the meat of the Bill.  I welcome the extension for planning permissions but the idea should not focus on the amount of work done.  What do we define as work?  I am aware of a planning application worth millions of euro, and it will not be subject to NAMA, which Senator Burke has mentioned.  Is five years enough or is there a possibility to introduce common sense to some of these cases?  Some of the applications might need seven or ten years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the many Senators who made contributions on Second Stage of this Bill and Members generally for their attendance over the course of the debate.  I note the matters raised, both today and during previous debates, and I will reflect on the contributions made by Senators in the context of progressing the Bill through Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>It remains my intention to have this Bill enacted at the earliest opportunity and I hope we can work constructively through any issues arising from it.  As I stated when presenting this Bill to the House, the principal driving force behind the legislation will continue to be the need to strengthen the statutory provisions for the planning process.  Planning is about people and a sound development plan is key to ensuring good planning at a local level.</P>
        <P>The more strategic approach to zoning and the accompanying checks and balances set out in the Bill will allow development to take place at the right time and in the correct place.  It will also allow the State to plan for the provision of infrastructure with much greater certainty.  This is key to the economic renewal agenda.  We must learn from and not repeat the mistakes of the past.  All land zonings will now have to be the subject of public consultation at the plan-making stage or in a draft variation of a development plan.  This is crucial from the point of view of ensuring public confidence in the zoning process.</P>
        <P>I will now refer to some of the matters raised by Senators.  The contributions dealt with a wide range of issues and I will endeavour to deal with as many of them as time permits.  I welcome the positive comments on the core strategy and the focusing of land use strategies.  Senator Coffey correctly made the point that the evidence in the core strategy must be based on high-quality up-to-date information from a reliable source.</P>
        <P>Under this Bill, all new city and county development plans must include a core strategy, which is a high-level summary description of the key statistics and priorities underpinning the development plan, with examples being expected population growth, housing and retail needs, the amount of zoned land and priority locations for development investment over the six-year plan period.  It is the touchstone against which future development decisions in the city or county can be tested as being consistent with national and regional policy.  These data are gathered not by my Department but by local authorities from a range of national, regional and local sources, and they provide the most up-to-date context for the plan.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Coffey that these data must be of the highest calibre.</P>
        <P>The core strategy should help councillors and key stakeholders to assess the needs and priorities for their area and will provide the framework for deciding on the scale, phasing and location of new development having regard to existing services and planned investment over the coming years.  By adhering to the core strategy which will derive many of its forecasts and targets from the regional planning guidelines, local councils will be able to assess for themselves whether new proposals are appropriate and consistent with the core strategy and therefore make more informed decisions on zoning, housing development and other investments.</P><Col N="668"/>
        <P>I am endeavouring to ensure the right decisions, for all the right reasons, are taken at the earliest stages of the development planning process, thus empowering local democracy to take full account of local, regional and national policy in the bests interests of the people it serves.  The measures in this Bill will strengthen local democracy and accountability, which is one of my key objectives in accordance with the ongoing process of local government reform and the White Paper on local government, by maintaining this fundamental power at the heart of local government within a clear planning framework.</P>
        <P>Under this Bill, planning authorities will now have to demonstrate intentions by way of statement when preparing and making a draft development plan and when outlining how it is to be implemented.  They will not just have a regard to the policies and objectives of the Minister contained in ministerial guidelines issued under section 28 of the planning Acts.  Equally, planning authorities must detail the reasons such policies and objectives would not be implemented.  That should help ground national policy within the local context and minimise the instances where I am forced, as Minister, to intervene in the development plan process and use my powers of direction under section 31.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of diluting power in county councils and the issue of allowing the centralisation of the planning process in a one size fits all manner.  The opposite is my intention and I wish for ministerial guidance to be implemented to ensure development is sustainable, properly planned and tailored to the needs of the people.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the issue of the inspector&rsquo;s report.  Senators Ormonde, Bradford, Buttimer, Coghlan and Doherty raised the issue of the board overturning its own inspector&rsquo;s recommendations.  Since the establishment of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 1977, planning legislation has clearly assigned final responsibility for decisions on planning appeals to the board and not to inspectors making reports and recommendations to the board.  In considering decisions on planning appeals, the board must consider all submissions on the file together with its own inspector&rsquo;s report and recommendation.  It must reach its own conclusion on the matter in line with proper planning and sustainable development of the area.</P>
        <P>If the board does not follow the recommendations of the inspector, the board must be satisfied that the facts of the case support its decision.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the board must also give the reasons for the decision and specify various reasons for not accepting the inspector&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>Concerns were expressed about reducing the board quorum of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board has a crucial role in providing an independent appeal mechanism for planning cases and in processing strategic infrastructure in other cases.  Delivering on the high number of cases in recent years while incorporating all elements of environmental assessment and public participation has been challenging, and the unprecedented level of case intake in recent years led to a backlog and a deterioration of the board&rsquo;s ability to decide cases within an 18-week statutory objective.</P>
        <P>The backlog was mainly at board level, given that a quorum of three board members was required to decide all cases.  I propose to assist the board in achieving efficiencies of operation by providing for a reduction in the current statutory quorum from three members to two.  This relates to the determination of certain classes of routine cases.  This amendment aims to improve the throughput of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and secure a higher compliance rate within the 18-week statutory objective for appeals at no additional staff cost.</P>
        <P>The chairperson or deputy chairperson of the board will have the power to recommend which cases are suitable for a reduced quorum.  If there is a meeting with a quorum of two that <Col N="669"/>is evenly divided on a vote, the matter will be referred to a meeting where the quorum is three.  I will examine both these issues further on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators expressed concerns about the increased threshold for mandatory preparations of local area plans.  It will go from 2,000 to 5,000 persons.  The clear intention in the Planning and Development Act 2000 was for local area plans to be prepared for the areas requiring regeneration or which were likely to be subject of large-scale development.  Some planning authorities are coming under significant resource pressure to prepare local area plans for relatively small areas which meet neither of these criteria but for which a local area plan is required owing to scale of population.  As local area plans involve considerable technical analysis and public consultation and are thus resource intensive, it is considered more helpful to provide updated and more realistic thresholds for their preparation.  However, the need for close alignment between development objectives and zoning of the local area plan with the development plan core strategy and regional planning guidelines is also addressed in this Bill.</P>
        <P>To ensure local area plans are comprehensively linked to the city or development plan, which is reviewed every six years, the lifespan of local area plans is to be increased to ten years.  Where the local area plan is no longer consistent with the city or county development plan, for example, where the development plan has been reviewed or varied, there is a requirement to vary or review the local area plan within one year to bring it into line with the higher level plan.  Provision is also made for the phasing of development within the local area plan, as provided for within a development plan, particularly given that zoning objectives are provided for in a local area plan on foot of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002.</P>
        <P>I note the concerns of Senators Ormonde and Coffey, especially regarding urbanisation.  I stress that it will continue to be the case that a local area plan may be prepared in respect of any area which a planning authority considers suitable and, in particular, for those areas that require economic, physical and social renewal outside of areas where a local area plan is mandatorily required.  It will continue to be the case that locally elected councillors can decide on the need for a local area plan for particular areas.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised the point that it appeared most planners in towns, counties and in An Bord Plean&aacute;la were urban planners and that there were no rural planners as such.  Students attending planning courses in UCD, DIT and UCC are drawn from all over the country, both urban and rural areas.  In all three courses the curriculum covers both rural and urban planning issues.  Senators may be interested to note that my Department has employed planning students as summer research <i>stagiaires</i> in recent years and that the majority of these students have come from rural backgrounds, from counties Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
        <P>Senators Daly, Leyden and Paddy Burke, among others, raised issues regarding the duration of planning permission.  The Bill provides that planning permission may be extended where substantial works have not been completed but the planning authority must be satisfied that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works.  While I will examine this issue further on Committee Stage, I can tell Senator Burke that this has absolutely nothing to do with the NAMA legislation.  I have been asked about this by Opposition party Members because their constituents obviously have been raising the issue repeatedly with them, given the volume of questions I have had to answer on it.</P>
        <P>The location, phasing and servicing of zoned lands have to be considered carefully in the context of our current economic and environmental circumstances.  Tighter management of land zoning and ensuring the location and quantum of land zoned for development are in line <Col N="670"/>with regional and local targets for growth will help local authorities to prioritise the provision of their own infrastructure and services.</P>
        <P>Material amendments to draft development plans will require the support of two thirds of the total number of members rather than a simple majority as currently provided for.  Decisions on development plans must involve the majority of members.  I welcome the support of a number of Senators for this amendment to the planning Acts.  However, concerns were raised by some Senators that this amendment would allow a small number of councillors to band together to halt a development plan and also that the size of the majority proposed should be right.  Senator Coghlan, in particular, wished to know the reasoning behind this provision.  At present, a 75% majority of the elected members is required to approve a planning application which is deemed to be in material contravention of the development plan.  Even if such a majority is achieved, the underlying zoning is not changed.  Only the specific proposed development is granted permission.  On the other hand, a simple majority, not of the fulll council but only of those attending a particular meeting, is required to change a zoning in a development plan or local area plan which could have significant long-term effects on an area.  This lower threshold is hard to justify.</P>

	<P>What I can do is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to extend the time allowed by ten minutes to allow the Minister to conclude.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Accordingly, the proposal in the Bill is to have a two thirds majority for material changes after the draft plan has been placed on display.  The two thirds requirement does not apply to approving the draft plan before it is placed on public display.  As I stated previously, one of the key objectives of the Bill is to strengthen local democracy and accountability in accordance with the ongoing process of local government reform to be pursued in the forthcoming White Paper on local government.  The increased requirement for two thirds support for material amendments to draft development plans is appropriate, as the development plan forms the blueprint for development within a planning authority area.</P>
        <P>I turn now to the question of community gain.  The Bill amends the principal Act to provide for a wider definition of public infrastructure and facilities to reflect newer infrastructural requirements.  Having regard to the sustainable communities agenda and other policy developments such as the developing areas initiative, the wider definition of public infrastructure and and facilities will, if needed, provide local authorities with greater flexibility to use development levies.  This will allow the levies to be spent on a broader range of items such as flood relief works, broadband provision and school sites, matters raised by many Senators.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred, rightly, to the relationship between planning policy and promoting healthy lifestyles.  Under existing planning legislation, planning authorities&rsquo; development plans must include objectives for the following: integration of planning and sustainable development of an area with social, community and cultural requirements for the area and its population; and the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities.  Statutory planning guidance such as the guidelines I published, namely, &ldquo;Guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable residential development in urban areas &mdash; cities, towns and villages &mdash; 2008&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guidelines for planning authorities on design standards for apartments 2007&rdquo;, has <Col N="671"/>been provided for planning authorities which reinforces the need to provide adequate open space and recreational facilities, particularly for children, and in designing new residential development they should prioritise cycling and walking and minimise the need for private cars.  The residential development guidelines recommend integrated housing and public transport development which minimises the requirement for car use and proper footpath and cycleway access for new developments.  They also recommend direct walking and cycling routes to local facilities such as shops and schools and set quantative open space standards for active or passive use within developments.  The guidelines can be assessed on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Legislation and guidance provide the framework and tools for planning authorities to make provisions in their development plan for policies to positively address obesity and support general healthy lifestyles for people of all ages.  My Department is represented on the task force on obesity within the remit of the Department of Health and Children and will continue to play a full role in cross-departmental initiatives in this area.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators made reference to derelict sites.  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 provides for the acquisition of such sites by local authorities to enable them to require the execution of works on such sites by the owners and, in certain circumstances, to execute works on derelict sites at the expense of the owners and to provide for other matters connected with matters aforesaid.  My Department is in the process of updating the list of prescribed areas under section 21 of the Act which allows local authorities to propose areas for prescription as urban areas for the purposes of the Act.  The areas are prescribed by way of a statutory instrument.  Following its enactment, the local authorities may impose levies on the owner of the site.  The levy is based on the value of the land.  The imposition of levies on the owners or occupiers of the lands in question is to encourage the owners or occupiers to remove the lands from dereliction.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn referred to the issue of legislation on dangerous buildings not being enforced.  Building regulations generally apply to the construction of a new building, the extension and material alteration of an existing building and material change of use of an existing building.  Where a building control authority considers that construction works or a change of use within the scope of the building regulations may give rise to a risk to the health and safety of persons who may be in or about the building or works, it may apply to the High Court or Circuit Court under section 12 of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007 for an order requiring the following: the removal, alteration or making safe of any structure, service, fitting or equipment, or the discontinuance of any works or the restriction or prohibition of the use of the building until any of the above requirements has been effected.  Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 building control authorities.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of flood plains.  In September 2008 my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Martin Mansergh, and I issued for public consultation draft guidelines for planning authorities.  These guidelines, entitled The Planning System and Flood Risk Management, are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to incorporating flood risk identification, assessment and management in the planning system and building upon its long-standing acknowledgement in the legislation as an important planning issue.  Submissions received on foot of the consultation process are being considered by my Department in conjunction with the OPW with a view to finalising and publishing the statutory guidelines by the end of the year at the latest.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also made the point that the development of Spain&rsquo;s metro system was possible because planning laws had been adjusted to secure rights to land underneath houses.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 introduced a streamlined planning consent procedure for strategic infrastructural developments and amended the rules <Col N="672"/>of compulsory acquisition to provide that the value of any land lying ten metres or more below the surface shall be taken to be nil unless it can be shown to be of greater value by a claimant.</P>
        <P>Allied to this, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 will amend the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 to provide An Bord Plean&aacute;la with powers to recover costs in respect of applications for railway orders.  The applicant pays principle is the basis for the payment of costs under the strategic infrastructure Act.  Applicants are currently required to pay costs associated with the development consent process as determined by the board.  The development consent application fee of &euro;100,000 is offset against these costs and the developer pays the balance as applicable.</P>
        <P>The costs to date on some major projects have been significant.  The board does not recover any of the significant costs it incurs in dealing with cases that do not proceed beyond the pre-application stage.  The board must strike a balance between offering continual improvement in pre-application consultations for those cases that are truly strategic infrastructure and funding the costs associated with the pre-application consultation service it provides.  The Bill provides for the recovery by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of its costs associated with the pre-application stage.  Such costs can be offset against the formal application fee for those cases that proceed to be determined by the board.</P>
        <P>Senators also raised a number of issues relating to developers&rsquo; performance, including the matters of unfinished estates, the provision of bonds as security relating to the completion of essential works on estates and measures to refuse permission to a developer with a history of non-compliance with previous permissions.  In early 2008, my Department issued policy guidance on taking residential developments in charge, emphasising the importance of a proactive role for local authorities in ensuring, in so far as they can, that residential developments are completed properly by developers to the standards set out in the planning permission.  Planning authorities were urged to ensure they attached appropriate conditions to planning permissions, including conditions regarding bonds and phasing of developments, inspected the developments during and after construction and took early enforcement action if appropriate.</P>
        <P>Concerning bonds, the guidance stated that the amount of security and the terms under which it is required to be given must enable the planning authority, without cost to itself, to complete the necessary services, including roads, footpaths, water mains, sewers, lighting and open spaces, to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer.  It was also stated that the condition must require that the lodgement of the security be coupled with an agreement that would empower the planning authority to realise the amount of the security and that the bond must be of sufficient duration to allow time to inspect the development after the expiration of permission and still call it a bond if necessary.</P>
        <P>Section 35 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced the concept of the refusal of planning permission because of the applicant&rsquo;s non-compliance with a previous planning permission, but this refusal was subject to the consent of the High Court.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 amended this provision by reversing the burden of proof.  Now, the planning authority can refuse permission in such a case and the planning applicant must apply to the High Court if he or she wants to have that decision reversed.</P>
        <P>I am broadening and strengthening the circumstances under which a planning authority can refuse planning permission to include instances in which an applicant has carried out an unauthorised substantial development or has been convicted of any offence under the planning Acts.  I am confident that this provision will facilitate the greater use of section 35 by the planning authorities which should make for a culture of greater compliance with the planning controls.</P><Col N="673"/>
        <P>Senator Cummins highlighted the issue of vehicles being used to display advertising on roadsides.  If a vehicle is left in one location for long periods and is in use as an unauthorised advertising structure, it is difficult to see why it should be exempt from planning enforcement.  The erection of unauthorised advertising structures other than road traffic signs is regulated, as the Senator should know.  A licence is issued under section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 for a structure on, under, over or along a public road.  Planning permission under section 34 of the 2000 Act is required for signage on private property.  My Department is preparing statutory guidance with the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority, NRA.  It is intended that the issue of road signage and the practice of parking large truck trailers off the road as a means of advertising hauliers will be addressed in these guidelines which I hope to issue in draft form for public consultation early next year.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to the national spatial strategy which is designed as a 20-year strategic document and has been endorsed by the Government.  In the context of the Bill, the ongoing review of the regional planning guidelines, which translate the strategy&rsquo;s principles into concrete objectives and have been adopted by each regional authority, will have a major influence on how future development plans are drafted, thus improving local and regional responsibility and accountability for ensuring all parts of the country develop in a sustainable manner.</P>
        <P>The issue of what constitutes a draft development plan was raised by Senator Walsh, for whose contribution I was in attendance.  The short answer is that the manager is tasked with preparing the draft plan in accordance with any directions given to him or her by the council.  The council is free to make any amendments to the draft which then goes on public display.</P>
        <P>I am greatly encouraged by the generally supportive and constructive contributions by Members on Second Stage and I look forward to dealing with the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p1- ?>&ldquo;Act of 1967&rdquo; means the Criminal Procedure Act 1967;&rdquo;.</P>
     
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 50 contains my substantive proposals for reform while amendment No. 1 is a consequential amendment.  I will therefore focus on the later amendment No. 50.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Amendment No. 50 relates to the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 and consists of two parts.  The first part contains the definition of &ldquo;prosecutor&rdquo; in section 4 of the 1967 Act.  It proposes to amend that section by deleting the words &ldquo;or on behalf or with the consent of,&rdquo; when defining the role of the Attorney General as prosecutor.  Section 4(1)(<i>a</i>) defines prosecutor for the purposes of Part IA, that is, the procedures relating to indictable offences.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is the prosecutor.  Section 4(1)(<i>b</i>) defines prosecutor in relation to Part II of the 1967 Act, that is, where the accused pleads guilty in the District Court to an indictable offence and Part III which deals with remand.  In these instances the prosecutor may be the Director of Public Prosecutions, a person acting at the suit of the DPP or a person authorised by law to prosecute an offence.  However, section 4(2) defines prosecutor in relation to Parts IA, II and III as the Attorney General in cases where the institution or continuation of proceedings requires the Attorney General&rsquo;s consent.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has expressed a concern that section 4(2) may be interpreted to mean that every reference to prosecutor in Parts IA and Parts II and III of the 1967 Act is to be taken as referring to the Attorney General in any case coming under those Parts, including cases where the Attorney General&rsquo;s role is confined to consenting to the institution and continuation of the prosecution rather than to conducting it.  This could mean <Col N="675"/>that if an accused is charged with an offence under legislation that stipulates that the consent of the Attorney General is required before a prosecution is instituted, then it is the Attorney General and not the Director of Public Prosecutions who must serve the book of evidence, consent to a return for trial and carry out all other prosecution functions assigned to the prosecutor under Part IA.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is concerned only to ensure clarity as to its own functions, especially for the purposes of Part IA of the 1967 Act.  The clarification now proposed does not alter the requirement for the Attorney General&rsquo;s consent to the institution or continuation of certain proceedings.  The amendment will put beyond doubt that after the Attorney General has given his consent, in cases where consent is required by statute, it is for the DPP to operate thereafter as the prosecutor of the case.</P>
        <P>The second part of this amendment relates to the time period for service of the book of evidence, more particularly the issue is about when the time period begins.  Currently, section 4B(1) of the 1967 Act stipulates that it must be served within 42 days of the person&rsquo;s first appearance in the District Court.  The amendment changes that period to it being 42 days from the date on which it is determined that the case is to be tried on indictment.  As many Senators will be aware, a book of evidence is required only when a case is tried on indictment.  Experience suggests that in a great many cases, the 42-day period, as it is currently applied, will have expired before the question of whether the case is to be tried on indictment or summarily will have been determined.  This creates a significant burden on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and creates inefficiencies in the system.  For example, in some cases, a book of evidence will not have been prepared as the DPP intends to proceed on a summary basis but the District Court may, as it is entitled, refuse jurisdiction and send the case forward for trial on indictment.</P>
        <P>It would be much more efficient if the timeline for service of the book of evidence ran from the day on which it was determined that a book of evidence was actually required.  While applications for extensions to the time period under section 4B(3) will continue to a factor in particular cases, this amendment should reduce the number of applications for those cases where it was initially unclear whether they would be sent forward for trial on indictment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 is consequential on amendment No. 50.  It adds a definition of the Act of 1967 to section 2 of the Bill.  It defines the reference to the Act of 1967 as referring to the Criminal Procedure Act 1967.  I recommend these amendments to the House as they will significantly promote the more efficient use of resources.</P>
        <P>I wish to take this opportunity to speak on the interpretation section to flag the Government&rsquo;s intention to bring forward amendments on Report Stage to the definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; in sections 2 and 4 to update the Bill to reflect the definition in the Broadcasting Act 2009 which has been enacted since the publication of this Bill.  Section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the following definition of broadcast:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;[B]roadcast&rdquo; means the transmission, relaying or distribution by electronic communications network of communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals, intended for direct reception by the general public whether such communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals are actually received or not[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">The House will note the reference to wireless telegraphy, cable or the Internet, contained in the definition that currently appears in this Bill under consideration has been replaced by a reference to electronic communications network.  I suggest this is a preferable way of proceeding because the Broadcasting Act is now enacted and our proposal for the definition of broadcast reflects what is already in the Broadcasting Act 2009.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="676"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that amendment No. 1 is consequential on amendment No. 50 which is clearly the substantive amendment.  I am concerned about the practical impact of this proposed amendment and I wish to reserve my position on it for Report Stage.  I ask for the opportunity to take soundings on it among other practitioners.  I speak as someone who is a practising barrister and has worked a good deal in the District Court, albeit I do not tend to practise there any more and have not done so for some years.  However, I am conscious that the Minister&rsquo;s stated rationale for introducing this amendment is to reduce the burden on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and to make the running of the system more efficient.  If I am correct, the effect of the amendment would be quite serious on the defence in terms of prolonging quite significantly the period of time before the book of evidence would be served upon them.  Case law from the European Court of Human Rights and our own jurisprudence suggests there should be a presumption in favour of more information and greater disclosure to the defence in advance.  This concentrates the mind of all concerned in any criminal case and it is the way the law has been going.  I do not see it as a positive development that the prosecution would be given longer to prepare the book of evidence.  The Minister stated that often the 42 day period is not observed and I am aware of this.  However, it keeps the pressure on the DPP&rsquo;s office and it gives district judges a modicum of control over the process.  I am concerned this amendment would adversely affect the rights of the accused and give the district judge less control over the time period within which the prosecution must produce the book of evidence.  A better approach would be to keep the current provision and allow the flexibility the district judges use in practice in terms of prolonging the period within which the book of evidence may be served.</P>
        <P>I reserve the right to speak further and to call for a division against this measure on Report Stage.  It is unfortunate such a significant provision was introduced by way of amendment and that we did not have the opportunity to comment on it on Second Stage.  I made a very full speech on this Bill on Second Stage in June, as Members will be aware, and I examined the Bill in great detail at that point.  However, this new amendment to the Act of 1967 makes a significant change to District Court practice and I alert other colleagues to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What Senator Bacik has just said illustrates the value of this House and the value we place upon the kind of professional expertise we have here.  I say as much without prejudice, as they say in legal circles, to the argument.  It is important to recognise that the amendment which occurs first in the order is not the really significant one.  It is amendment No. 50 that comes toward the end of the Bill that matters.  Given the presumption of innocence, there should be at least an equal balance between the rights of the defendant and the rights of the prosecution.  If the delicacy of this balance is altered, as has been suggested, by this amendment in favour of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a State office, and against an individual, it would be regrettable.  Senator Bacik is very wise to stay her hand and seek further consultation on this matter.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s comments in which he flagged the definition of broadcasting.  This attracted my attention because I wondered if it was sufficiently clear in view of the extraordinary pace of advances in broadcasting.  For example, the use of the term &ldquo;wireless telegraphy&rdquo; is nowadays regarded as charmingly antique.  We have been overcome by a whole series of patterns of broadcasting.  It is very appropriate and I welcome the fact the Minister has updated that definition.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to definitions and there is also a definition of a &ldquo;children detention school&rdquo;.  Perhaps there could be some debate on the appropriateness of some of these places in light of what we know now.  I do not believe it should simply appear as a definition.  We <Col N="677"/>should examine whether it is appropriate to send children to these places, but that is just bye the bye.  I welcome what Senator Bacik said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with the amendment and since it will be raised on Report Stage we can revert to it.  In principle, I have no difficulty with it or with the Bill in general.  I hope that in the course of the dialogue we can secure some refinement of the legislation.  The Bill responds to several proposals made in the balancing of the criminal law system in favour of the victims.  It is to be welcomed and I will address the various amendments in that frame of mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators.  Senator Norris will note that I value very much the input into legislation from the Seanad and I welcome the expertise brought to this Bill, not only from the political parties but also from the Independents, and not only in this area but in other areas as well.</P>
        <P>The amendment was prompted largely by the DPP&rsquo;s office on the basis that until 1999 there were no time limits within which it was required to serve a book of evidence.  This changed following the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which included a statutory requirement for a time limit.  District Court rules dating from 1967 had certain requirements but these were only rules and they were replaced in 1997 by an updated District Court rule in this respect.  In 1999 a statutory requirement was introduced.  The DPP&rsquo;s office made a very strong case to the effect that because of the requirement for a book of evidence on indictment it was only logical that only when a decision is made to send forward a defendant on indictment should the time limit kick in, rather than when a defendant first appears in the District Court.  To a certain extent the DPP&rsquo;s office could be up against a time line, especially if adjournments took place at the initial stage before a decision had been made on whether it was a minor offence.</P>
        <P>This matter was examined by a working group on the jurisdiction of the courts, chaired by Mr. Justice Fennelly.  It reported in 2003 and examined this issue.  The working group proposed a 90 day time limit from the first appearance in court.  We believe the proposal of a 42 day limit following the decision to send forward a defendant is neater because the requirement for a book of evidence only kicks in once the court has decided to try the offence on indictment.  We believe it creates a more certain period and lessens the burden on the DPP&rsquo;s office on the preparation of evidence.  Sometimes it might prepare a book of evidence when it is not required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his full response.  I am conscious Mr. Justice Fennelly&rsquo;s report maintained the principle that the time should run from the first appearance, albeit extending the time somewhat to reflect the greater reality.  However, the principle espoused by the working group was important.  My concern is that principle would be eroded by the proposed amendment and it would adversely impact on the accused.  I am conscious that time limits were introduced in 1999 through statute.  However, to give the full picture, the reason they were introduced is that in the same Act powers to detain an accused or to adjourn an accused on remand in custody for longer periods were increased.  When I began practising in the District Court there were more rigid time rules for the period during which an accused could be detained in custody between adjournment dates to the court.  As I recall, the 1999 changes to insert time limits served as a balance to the increased time an accused was likely to spend in custody between court appearances.</P>
        <P>How will the district judge make the determination that the facts do not constitute a minor offence if such a determination is to be made before any book of evidence is served?  I reserve my position on this matter.  Like Senator Regan, I welcomed many aspects of this Bill on Second Stage, especially Part 2 which deals with the impact of crimes on the victim and I wish to put that on the record again.  I support many of the principles in the Bill but I am concerned <Col N="678"/>this late amendment was inserted and that it makes a substantial change to criminal procedure in the District Court.  It is an area of practice often overlooked but it is where the majority of criminal case are dealt with.  We must be very careful about making such sweeping changes without being conscious of their full impact.  While I will not seek a division on this point now, the Minister should ask again, albeit perhaps not just the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  For example, the Criminal Bar Association is made up of people who both defend and prosecute.  I ask that the views of this organisation or those of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties also be sought in this regard.  Although I have not had time to do this, I certainly intend to do so before Report Stage to ascertain what impact they consider this amendment is likely to have in practice on accused persons before the District Court.  I am concerned there may be unforeseen practical consequences to this measure.  Changing the point at which the time runs is quite significant.  As I understand it, Mr. Justice Fennelly&rsquo;s report did not propose that major change; it simply extended the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing further to add, other than to note that in respect of Mr. Justice Fennelly&rsquo;s report, I am starting with the baseline of when the defendant first appeared in the District Court.  My Department believes and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions concurs strongly that the baseline should be when the decision is made to send forward for trial on indictment.  It is only then that the requirement for a book of evidence to be produced kicks in.  As the Senator is aware, a District Court judge decides on whether a case can be dealt with in summary fashion or on indictment based on the facts put before him or her in his or her court.  Obviously, he or she must then make a judgment about sending someone forward.</P>
        <P>To a large extent, the reason the 90-day period was proposed by the working group was based on the assumption that the baseline would be the first appearance.  However, in a highly complex case 90 days may not be sufficient, perhaps because the District Court did not make a determination on the issue until well into the 90-day period.  Consequently, retaining the starting time for the production of the book of evidence as it is at present, that is, 42 days from the date when the decision is made to send forward for trial is best.</P>
        <P>As for representations, the Department obviously will hear representations from Senators, in particular, on the views of outside groups.  Nevertheless, this is the Department&rsquo;s best view on the issue, having discussed it with those at the coalface in this respect, that is, with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, in particular, as well as the Courts Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a further brief comment.  As I noted, I certainly intend to consult those at the coalface in representing people before the District Court and ask that the Minister&rsquo;s office does the same.  While I am conscious that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is at the coalface, it only represents the prosecution and Members must also be conscious of the right of the defence.  Moreover, as a final point, it strikes me that there also is a victims&rsquo; rights aspects to this issue.  Forty-two days is a significant period for victims to wait and if the consequence of this section is to prolong the pre-trial period generally, it will have a highly adverse impact on victims.  Any research I have undertaken on victims&rsquo; rights on any of the literature suggests delays in the process cause concern to victims.  The Minister also is anxious to deal with this issue.  Members must be cautious about proceeding with such a significant change without considering all the consequences and consulting other groups beyond the Director of Public Prosecutions alone.  I certainly intend to do so before Report Stage.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 4, but in Part 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      
        <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART 2</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">TREATMENT OF VICTIMS</P>
        <P LI="1">4.&mdash;(1) Any person who deals with a victim (for example, a member of the judiciary, lawyer, member of court staff, member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other official) shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) treat the victim with courtesy and compassion, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) respect the victim&rsquo;s dignity and privacy, save that nothing contained herein shall in any way infringe the constitutional rights of an alleged offender or of an offender.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) A victim has the right to be informed as fully as possible&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) of his or her rights and of the remedies available to the victim,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) of his or her role in the criminal justice process and with regard to criminal proceedings and of the progress made in investigating his or her complaint and in the processing of any criminal prosecution arising from such complaint,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) of the availability of health services and social services or other appropriate assistance or prevention services through which he or she may obtain such medical, psychological, social care or help as he or she may require.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) A victim has the right, insofar as resources are available&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) to such medical, psychological and social care or help as he or she may require and to such other assistance or services capable of meeting his or her needs for shelter and support or for referral to other services better suited to provide him or her with assistance,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) to protection against intimidation and retaliation.</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) A victim has a duty to cooperate, to such extent as is possible, with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other relevant law enforcement authority.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments relate to how the victims of crime are treated in the context of criminal procedures.  I appreciate that a considerable amount of work has been done by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime and the Department in this area.  However, I wish to read one excerpt from the commission&rsquo;s framework document that refers to the position of the victims of crime.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the case of charges being brought, they have to cope with a complex system where minimum recognition is afforded to the victim . . . Further trauma is suffered where no perpetrator is identified or sufficient evidence does not exist to bring a charge.  The degree <Col N="680"/>of trauma is not measured by the seriousness of the crime e.g. an elderly person who has been burgled often will suffer life-changing effects.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Moreover, in the case of more serious crime, the impact is even more traumatic.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that this legislation is supposed to address these issues and that it relies on the report and recommendations of the balance in the criminal law review group on this subject.  However, as for what informs the amendments I have tabled, I again refer to the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime&rsquo;s annual report of 2008.  It refers to a meeting in September 2008 under the heading, Justice for Victims Initiative.  It states, &ldquo;The meeting also provided an opportunity for the Minister to outline his Justice for Victims Initiative to those who attended and to assure them that a legislative package was being progressed and was on course to be published in the spring of 2009&rdquo;.  I believe this Bill to be the aforementioned package of measures.  The amendments I have tabled complement the package before Members.</P>
        <P>I will revert to the basis of all this, the European Council framework decision of 15 March 2001 on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings.  The European Communities treaties recognise that the position of the victim must be taken into account in order to have mutual recognition of judgments and procedures in the area of criminal law.  The framework decision states, among other things:</P>
        <P LI="1">The conclusions of the European Council meeting in Tampere in ... October 1999 stipulate that minimum standards should be drawn up on the protection of victims of crimes, in particular on crime victims&rsquo; access to justice and on their right to compensation for damages, including legal costs.  In addition, national programmes should be set up to finance measures, public and non-governmental, for assistance to and protection of victims ... Member States should approximate their laws and regulations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I refer to article 2 of the framework decision which is germane to my first amendment which proposes the insertion of a new section 4.  Article 2 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Each Member State shall ensure that victims have a real and appropriate role in its criminal legal system.  It shall continue to make every effort to ensure that victims are treated with due respect for the dignity of the individual during proceedings and shall recognise the rights and legitimate interests of victims with particular reference to criminal proceedings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My proposed section 4 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Any person who deals with a victim (for example, a member of the judiciary, lawyer, member of court staff, member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other official) shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) treat the victim with courtesy and compassion, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) respect the victim&rsquo;s dignity and privacy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It goes on to propose that the victim has a right to be informed as far as possible of his or her rights, his or her role in the criminal justice process and the availability of health and social services, etc.</P>
        <P>This really is a declaratory statement implementing, in effect, the framework decision.  It is important to have a statutory basis to the recognition given to the victims of crime and their role in the criminal process.  With the passing of the Lisbon treaty, such framework decisions invariably will be transposed into directives.  While the framework decision is binding on a member state, as is the directive, there will be an enforcement procedure, whereby the Euro<Col N="681"/>pean Commission will ensure legislation adopted at European level is reflected in national legislation.  There is a direct link and it is important that there be a statutory basis for the principles set out in the framework decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 3 reads: &ldquo;A victim or member of a victim&rsquo;s immediate family who has welfare, counselling, medical or legal needs arising from the commission of an offence or as a result of anti-social behaviour shall have access to services that are responsive to those needs insofar as resources are available&rdquo;.  There is a right to be assisted; therefore, there is a duty and an obligation on us, arising not only from our legal requirements but also now from European Union obligations.  These provisions should be set out in legislation and followed through.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 concerns information for the victim.  I appreciate that the victims of crime office provides valuable information in a generic sense for those who are victims of crime.  They can access the general framework or scheme of how the system works but that is a far cry from providing such information for individual victims of crime.  On a point of information, we must consider data protection, whether people want to be informed and whether the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could inform support services that a person has been the victim of crime without the victim requesting it or sanctioning the use of that information.  This matter must be addressed, as acknowledged by the European framework decision.  The amendment on the right to receive information is based on Article 4 of the framework decision:</P>
        <P LI="1">Each Member State shall ensure that victims in particular have access, as from their first contact with law enforcement agencies, by any means it deems appropriate and as far as possible in languages commonly understood, to information of relevance for the protection of their interests. Such information shall be at least as follows:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the type of services or organisations to which they can turn for support;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the type of support which they can obtain;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) where and how they can report an offence . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">Article 4 also includes the provision that &ldquo;Each Member State shall ensure that victims who have expressed a wish to this effect are kept informed of the outcome of their complaint&rdquo;.  A procedure must be established whereby the information can be provided for the victim of crime and this information can be passed on to support services.  Perhaps a form could be drafted for the victim to sign.  The amendment mirrors the broad principles set out in the European framework decision.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 suggests the victim should be provided with the name and telephone number of the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who has the primary responsibility to investigate the reported offence.  This is basic information that enables the person to feel he or she is not being entirely ignored in the process of prosecution of a criminal offence that has affected the person.  By setting out in statute the type of information that should be provided and the procedures for so doing, we facilitate everyone, even though much good work is being done by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies.</P>
        <P>Keeping the victim informed is referred to in section 7(2) which concerns the preliminary hearing, any defending hearing set down for sentencing, any hearings of appeal and to review the sentence.  Again, there is a requirement under the EU framework decision that the victim be kept informed.  Section 3 of Article 4 states: &ldquo;Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, at least in cases where there might be danger to the victims, when the person prosecuted or sentenced for an offence is released, a decision may be taken to notify the victim if necessary&rdquo;.  Section 2 of Article 4 refers to keeping the victim informed of relevant <Col N="682"/>factors enabling them, in the event of prosecution, to know the conduct of the criminal proceedings regarding the person prosecuted for offences concerning them, except in exceptional cases where the proper handling of the case may be adversely affected, and to be informed of the court sentence.  I do not see these matters addressed in the Bill, yet it was intended that it would address the rights of victims in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 6 deals with limits on duties to give information under sections 6 and 7 where the giving of the information would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of law and order.  This is a reflection of the framework decision.  The amendment provides that the victim may nominate someone to receive the information.  In dealing with these amendments I have a question for the Minister on dealing with the proposal made by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, suggesting that in a case where the injured party had died or had become incapacitated such that he or she was unable to give evidence, where the defence attacked the character of the injured party, that shield could be dropped and the accused would be liable to cross-examination as to his or her character without leave of the court.  Does the Minister intend to address this particular recommendation?  Perhaps we can return to the matter on Report Stage or at a later time.</P></Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the spirit of these amendments because Senator Regan is attempting to secure the rights of victims.  There is a strong public feeling that victims are not treated with the degree of sympathy they could be and that they do not have access to the redress they ought to have.  There is a feeling that the balance may be slightly skewed.  I am not sure whether that is true but certainly one must have compassion towards people who are clearly the victims of crime, and sometimes the victims of very brutal crimes.  This morning, I heard the Minister on the radio discussing the appalling bank robbery where people were held.  The victims included small and vulnerable children who may be traumatised for a very long time.  There is certainly a very considerable public appetite for something to be done in the interests of victims.</P>
        <P>Another point is that, without wishing to undermine the status of citizens in this regard, they are alleged victims until the crime has been adjudicated upon.  In almost all cases they will turn out to be victims and as citizens they should be treated appropriately anyway.  I remember a case from recent years where a man was convicted on the evidence of a young woman.  It turned out that the background was a dispute between two families about land.  She put her oar in to victimise the person accused of rape.  He was convicted and a number of years later she surfaced from abroad and acknowledged that it was a tissue of lies.  She was and should have been seen as an alleged victim up to the point where the man was convicted.  In this case, the man was convicted incorrectly.  I am not impugning the status of all victims.  I am stating that their victimhood is only confirmed by the passing of sentence by the court.  Until that point they are assumed or alleged victims.</P>
        <P>The same is true of defendants.  They are accused until they are convicted.  Because there is a small number of cases in which the accusation will prove to be unfounded or malicious, it seems that the first part of the section proposed in Amendment No. 2 should apply with equal force to the accused.  I mean those paragraphs which state:</P>
        <P LI="1">4.&mdash;(1) Any person who deals with a victim (for example, a member of the judiciary, lawyer, member of court staff, member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other official) shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) treat the victim with courtesy and compassion, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) respect the victim&rsquo;s dignity and privacy, save that nothing contained herein shall in any way infringe the constitutional rights of an alleged offender or of an offender[.]</P><Col N="683"/>
        <P FLI="0">Those essential courtesies and compassion of respect for dignity and privacy should also extend to those accused, especially because they have not been convicted.</P>
        <P>Although I do not have any qualification whatever in law I remember attending the District Court on a number of occasions in the remote past when judges felt free to engage &mdash; and I hope they no longer do &mdash; in mocking and taunting people accused of specific crimes.  I was in court when reference was made to their sexual organs, sexual propensities and sexual practices to howls of amusement from the body of the court.  That is not appropriate and I would like to think that every citizen should be treated with the minimum of courtesy and compassion, particularly until he or she is convicted.  I do not see why courtesy and compassion should cease in an allegedly Christian state even when a person is convicted.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 contains a weakening and classic let-out which is inevitable in the current circumstances in the phrase, &ldquo;insofar as resources are available&rdquo;.  That would be very well used to get out of any obligation to provide assistance to victims through psychological and social care.  They would be told that the resources are not available and they cannot have them.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 is interesting and important because people who are alleged or assumed victims of crime are very anxious to know the process of the investigation and to know that the investigation is continuing.  In the previous session, Senator Hannigan raised on the Adjournment and brought to the attention of the Minister a case in which a victim could get no information and the matter was endlessly delayed to the point where a prosecution became almost unsustainable.  This was brought to the attention of the court.  The name of the investigating garda and a telephone access number are completely reasonable requests to be included in the amendment.</P>
        <P>With regard to the outline of the investigation and prosecution process, Senator Regan has included some learned comments and my concern is that information might be divulged whose divulgence is dangerous to the investigation.  One cannot rely entirely on discretion.  If one gives out sensitive information to victims it may be that their immediate instinct is to run next door and tell a neighbour and disclose it all.  It may also be that an investigation is following certain angles that are not only delicate but also dead ends, and endless gossip and malicious talk might be fostered by this.  Therefore, I am concerned about access to this type of information.</P>
        <P>It is essential to give information on whether an accused is granted bail because experience shows us that many criminals re-offend immediately on release, especially in larceny.  Frequently they re-offend on bail.  I am on the central area joint policing committee and at our most recent session approximately one month ago, the very efficient police officers presented us with statistics on crime which they then took back because they were confidential.  I do not think I am breaking confidentiality when I state that in the central area of Dublin there was a huge spike in certain types of crime, particularly burglaries and robberies of or from cars.  The superintendent or inspector &mdash; I am not sure which &mdash; present at the meeting explained this as being directly related to releases from Mountjoy, that the Garda knew immediately a particular person was back in operation and that they just had to look for him.  This is very practical information.</P>
        <P>After I make my final point I will read the Minister&rsquo;s reply if he deigns to deal with the points I have raised because I must attend another meeting.  If it is not buried somewhere I have not noticed, Senator Regan should include in the list the date of release.  This is very important for victims and relatives who had a close family member murdered.  I know of a number of instances reported in the public media where relatives were not told an offender was released.  I know we are not supposed to put names on the record so I will not do so but I am sure the Minister will know the case to which I refer where a man convicted of man<Col N="684"/>slaughter was released and murdered somebody else.  A shock is given to relatives when they are not told a release is coming up.  They can prepare themselves emotionally if they are made aware of it.  Senator Regan may have included this and I might have missed it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak generally in support of Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendments.  These are very useful and very welcome.  They are in keeping with the needs of victims.  It is clear from any research done that what victims and those who complain that they were victims of crime require is to be kept informed of the progress of an investigation, of any developments in the investigation and pre-trial process and of anything that occurs following the trial.  In the Irish criminal justice system we have been very much wanting compared with the system in continental European countries where victims are entitled to much greater rights within the criminal justice process.  According to research I carried out in 1998 with colleagues at Trinity College into victims of rape, which was published by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, rape complainants&rsquo; experience of the pre-trial and trial process was greatly improved if they had good communications with the garda involved in investigating the case, and they found they could understand the procedure much better, which greatly enhanced their overall satisfaction with the process.</P>
        <P>Tribute must be paid to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which, in recent years, has tried to do much more to keep victims informed where serious crimes have occurred, in particular, the families of victims of homicide.  The office now has a specific liaison person assigned to each family where there is a charge of murder or manslaughter.  I also pay tribute to the work of Advic, the organisation that supports families of victims of homicide, which has done a great deal of work with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It must also be said that in most cases that are not at such a serious level, individual investigating garda&iacute; perform an important function in keeping victims and complainants informed of the progress of an investigation in an informal way.  Much of what Senator Regan has outlined, particularly in his proposed amendment No. 5, is already the case, and many garda&iacute; are already doing a great deal of such work.  It is important, however, as Senator Regan pointed out, to formalise this to support victims&rsquo; rights.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan is dealing with data release in a separate amendment &mdash; No. 18, I believe &mdash; but there is clearly a lack of knowledge currently.  There are a couple of points on which the amendments could be improved.  For example, with regard to informing a victim of his or her right to choose legal aid and assistance where a complaint is made of a serious sexual crime, this is contained in the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  Indeed, victims have a right to separate legal representation under the Sex Offenders Act 2001 where the defence makes an application to produce evidence of prior sexual history.  That amendment was introduced as a direct result of our study into the experience of rape victims.  I have tabled another amendment to this Bill, No. 17, which provides for enhanced potential right of representation for victims of crime.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that there are already many voluntary groups working in this area.  Not only are garda&iacute; doing a great deal of work in informing and communicating with victims of crime, albeit on a relatively informal basis, but there is a large number of voluntary victim support groups around the country which provide court accompaniment services to victims.  Senator Norris has spoken about the proviso &ldquo;insofar as resources are available&rdquo; in Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendments.  In the current climate, that goes without saying.  However, the <Col N="685"/>Minister does have a commitment to continue financial support for those voluntary groups through the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, and the court accompaniment provision is regarded as important.</P>
        <P>I recently conducted research for the commission, with colleagues in Trinity College, which considered the experiences of local victim support groups and one issue raised, which is relevant to Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment No. 4, is that the groups would prefer to make contact themselves with persons who make complaints to the Garda, but that this had given rise to data protection difficulties.  While garda&iacute; are now giving information to victims about locally accessible voluntary agencies, to use Senator Regan&rsquo;s words, it is not currently possible for a voluntary agency to contact a victim because the garda cannot provide the victim&rsquo;s name and address.  It occurs to me &mdash; Senator Regan may have dealt with this &mdash; that it would be possible to provide a form in a Garda station that victims could sign giving permission to the Garda to give their names and addresses to the support groups directly.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions provides a great deal of information through leaflets, which are offered in Garda stations to people who make complaints about crimes &mdash; the first stage of interaction with the criminal justice process.  We must commend that.  However, it is also important that we put all these positive developments for victims in the form of a statutory requirement that victims be informed about the progress of court proceedings and that they be kept informed throughout the pre-trial, trial and post-trial periods.</P>
        <P>There is one thing on which I disagree with Senator Regan.  I note he does not confine the references in his amendments to criminal offences, but extends them to anti-social behaviour.  Given the lack of operative effectiveness of anti-social behaviour orders and the fact that this is an area of law that is not quite criminal &mdash; these are civil orders, the breach of which may give rise to criminal proceedings &mdash; I am not sure it is appropriate to include the references to anti-social behaviour that crop up throughout the Senator&rsquo;s amendments.  Otherwise, these are important amendments, which are in keeping with the spirit of the Bill and of the Minister&rsquo;s stated desire to improve the situation for victims of crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions, and express my thanks to Senator Regan for his remarks on the first amendments that were moved on the basis of the spirit in which we are trying to improve this Bill.  To answer the Senator on the issue of character evidence and what he referred to as dropping the shield, Government amendment No. 47 deals with this by inserting the following into the principal Act: &ldquo;the person has personally or by the person&rsquo;s advocate asked questions of any witness for the purpose of making, or the conduct of the defence is such as to involve, imputations on the character of a person in respect of whom the offence was alleged to have been committed...&rdquo;.  Thus, there are amendments clearing up some of the anomalies in that respect and also following on from the 1924 Act with regard to the evidence that can be adduced in criminal trials.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge Senator Bacik&rsquo;s comments and am of the view that we should improve assistance to victims of crime as much as possible and contribute to raising awareness about their difficulties.  I share that commitment, but the question is how to go about it.  That is where we differ.  The issue is why Government would adopt a certain attitude, as opposed to people in the Opposition, but we have common cause in trying to assist victims as much as possible.</P>
        <P>While this Bill has a role with regard to victims, we already have provisions in our legislation for victim impact statements, intimidation of witnesses, <i>in camera</i> hearings and the non-identification of some victims in the media, and the giving of evidence by television link in the case of young people and other vulnerable victims.  There is a place for legislation, but in certain instances legislating for something can be too prescriptive and could lead to a lawyer&rsquo;s playground.  I suggest that some of the proposed amendments would lead to a considerable onus <Col N="686"/>being put in the prosecution and on the presiding judge to decide whether a victim&rsquo;s statutory right to be treated with courtesy and compassion had been complied with.  I would hazard that such provisions would cause severe difficulty in a well-fought prosecution.  Legislation is not the best tool in all circumstances; it can be overly prescriptive or become outdated or rigid as time passes and circumstances change.  If we put something in legislation, would we get time in the Oireachtas to change it?  Such provisions, for example those which provide that the victim should be treated with courtesy and compassion, could lead to endless legal disputes about interpretation in particular cases.</P>
      
        <P>A charter is more flexible in terms of taking account of individual circumstances while giving strong directions in the majority of cases.  As Senator Bacik has acknowledged, garda&iacute; do excellent work in liaising with victims.  In respect of most major crimes, liaison officers are assigned to work with victims.  The Garda has developed a victims&rsquo; charter and officer training includes a module on how to treat victims.  Garda&iacute; stick rigidly to the guidelines set out in the victims&rsquo; charter and face disciplinary proceedings if they fail to do so.</P>
        <P>My Department has produced a victims&rsquo; charter through the victims of crime office which I established in conjunction with the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.  The charter is written in plain rather than legal language so victims can understand it.  I favour a victims&rsquo; charter as the primary means for ensuring best practice in services to victims.  I asked the commission to review the existing charter with a view to improving its provisions and hope to be in a position to publish the revised charter in the first quarter of 2010.</P>
        <P>The new Part 2 proposed in amendment No. 2 provides for a generic right to courtesy, compassion and respect from any person dealing with a victim.  While this is a commendable aspiration, I question the feasibility of legislating such virtuous behaviours into people.  The amendment is equally ambitious in regard to the right to information, with Part 3 setting out in great detail the information that must be provided.  Compliance with the proposed section 7 of Part 3 would leave garda&iacute; little time to conduct actual criminal investigations.  Furthermore, the section makes no distinction between serious and minor offences nor does it take account of whether a victim wishes an investigation to proceed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Even though the main focus of amendment No. 2 is the provision of information to victims, it does not cover all the information required under the victims&rsquo; charter.  It says nothing about what a victim should do if information is not provided.  Should the victim engage in further legal action or appeal to the criminal justice agencies concerned?  The existing victims&rsquo; charter provides a clear avenue of internal complaint to each of the agencies if a victim&rsquo;s expectations are not met and this clarity will be carried forward into the revised charter.  If such mechanisms were prescribed by law, a considerable amount of time and discussion would be expended in drafting them.  I empathise with the principle behind these amendments but I suggest that prescriptive legislation is not the appropriate vehicle for them.</P>
        <P>The proposed Part 2 is brief and aspirational in providing to victims a generic right to services in so far as resources are available.  Part 3 contains three sparse sections which set out circumstances in which information can be withheld or given to a victim&rsquo;s representative.  Senator Norris sought a definition of &ldquo;support person of a victim&rdquo; in amendment No. 7.  If these amendments ever became the law of the land, they would be a recipe for confusion and legal wrangling.  I do not propose to accept the amendments because they impose a rigid regime where flexibility is preferable, lack clarity and are likely to cause disputes, confusion and further litigation.</P><Col N="687"/>
        <P>Under the heading &ldquo;What you can expect from the Garda&iacute;&rdquo;, Page 7 of the existing victims&rsquo; charter sets out in layman&rsquo;s language what victims can expect, stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Garda&iacute; are committed to addressing your needs and concerns in an empathetic, understanding and problem-solving manner.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">If you are a victim of crime, the Garda&iacute; will respond promptly to your call . . . tell you the name, telephone number and station of the investigating Garda . . . outline the investigation process to you . . . tell you about the services available from Victim Support . . . tell you, where a suspect is charged . . . show special sensitivity in relation to sexual offences . . . tell you about offender releases . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">It provides further details for the following categories of victims:</P>
        <P LI="1">for families of murder victims . . . as a victim of domestic violence . . . if you are a visitor to Ireland . . . an elderly person . . . if you have any form of physical or mental disability<?oasys _jy ?>. . . if you are unable to communicate fluently in Irish or English.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The charter refers victims whose expectations are not met to the Garda victim liaison office on Harcourt Street.  I respectfully suggest this is a better way of meeting the objectives set out by Senator Regan and others, with whom I genuinely share a common cause.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge that the victims&rsquo; charter has been a valuable aid to those who have been affected by crime but the European framework decision puts an obligation on us to put these matters on a statutory footing.  It is legitimate to oblige organisations such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide information where a victim seeks it.  I maintain that it is necessary to set out these procedures in criminal legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister argued that my amendments would unduly complicate the Bill but criminal legislation is complicated and precise by its nature.  I do not see why there should not also be precision in regard to victims of crime.  I urge the Minister to consider, if not the amendments under discussion, some other means to give statutory acknowledgement to the rights of victims of crime in line with the framework decision of 2001, which will undoubtedly become a directive following the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>I do not agree that my proposed amendments would give rise to unnecessary litigation.  The way in which a victim is treated is separate to the prosecution of an alleged offender.  I do not see how treating a victim in a reasonable manner would interfere with the effective prosecution of crime.  The amendments I tabled include saver clauses in respect of resources.  A saver clause also provides that if the provision interferes in any way with the maintenance of law and order, in other words, the prosecution, the giving of the relevant information is not required.  While the Minister listed areas, including victim impact statements, where the law has been changed to facilitate the victim, these are highly limited.</P>
        <P>The basic issue in this respect is one of acknowledging the victim and providing him or her with the information required on the process.  I note the charter is vague as to the process to apply when an offender who has been found guilty is released, freed on bail etc.  The charter does not cover these issues adequately and they are the subject of later amendments.  I urge the Minister to reconsider and have these matters placed on a statutory basis, either by accepting the amendments or providing for them in a form he deems fit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs an important task in informing victims of the progress of investigations and the pre-trial process, this process is dependent on the goodwill of individual garda&iacute;.  I am aware of the charter but the difficulty with it, as Senator Regan noted, is that its terms are rather vague and somewhat aspirational.  It does not impose <Col N="688"/>a requirement that actions be taken to keep victims informed, particularly in cases of more serious crimes such as rape and murder which individual garda&iacute; outside specialist units may not have encountered previously.</P>
        <P>The establishment of specialist units has been highly beneficial in improving practice among garda&iacute; in their dealings with victims of crime.  Despite this, we still hear of problems, particularly in rural Garda stations where a complainant may make a serious complaint which the garda on duty has not dealt with previously.  Statutory requirements in this area would give greater rights to complainants and victims and remove the onus on individual garda&iacute; to provide the type of information victims require.  To that extent, Senator Regan is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Regan acknowledges that the victims charter contains substantial detail.  As I indicated, the charter is being reviewed by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.  It is hoped the revised version which will take into account developments at Oireachtas and European Union level will be published in the first quarter of 2010.</P>
        <P>I do not accept Senator Bacik&rsquo;s view that Garda practice can be haphazard and depends on the individual garda.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a fully dedicated victim liaison office and ongoing training is available on human rights, dealing with victims and addressing their needs.  In a force of almost 14,800 individuals one will always find some officers who are not doing exactly what is required.  By and large, however, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has come a long way and the position has changed significantly since the time when little assistance was given to prosecution witnesses, especially when court cases started.</P>
        <P>The Senators and I differ on whether one should introduce statutory rights in this area.  The strong fear is that to do so would create confusion and that such rights could be used by the defence to get their client off, which would not be in the interests of the victim.  While that scenario may be a long stretch of the imagination, once a right is written into legislation and it can be proved that certain statutory requirements have not been properly met in connection with a particular incident, it may make life more difficult for everyone.  Under the charter, if a victim&rsquo;s expectations are not met, any inquiries, suggestions or feedback on any aspect of the treatment of victims of crime by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be dealt with by the liaison office.  While I understand the spirit of the amendments, I cannot accept the introduction of statutory requirements of this nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to elaborate on his curious argument that the offender could benefit and escape prosecution because of rights prescribed for the victim of crime.  While I appreciate that certain cases may involve sensitive information, the amendments provide that such information would not be given where concerns arose.  I do not accept the link the Minister has suggested.  He is loading his argument in suggesting that by legislating we would be interfering with the effective prosecution of crime.  In the European context, given the legally binding requirements of the framework decision, is the Government not obliged to legislate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister put a word in my mouth by suggesting I described Garda practice as haphazard.  As I stated, Garda practice in dealing with victims of crime has greatly improved and victim satisfaction with the pre-trial and investigation process is greatly enhanced by the goodwill shown by many garda&iacute; in providing information and acting as an informal liaison officer through, for example, giving personal telephone numbers and so on.  I am conscious that all these practices take place, that training is provided in Templemore and that a victim liaison office has been established.  I did not imply that Garda practice was haphazard but suggested it was not as structured as it could be.  For example, a specialist unit is still not <Col N="689"/>available in some areas where, fortunately, certain crimes may be so rare that the only garda on duty is not familiar with the complaint with which he or she is confronted.</P>
        <P>Criminal practitioners are aware of the significance of the initial statement a complainant makes to the Garda on first arrival at the Garda station, perhaps in distress or late at night.  This statement is the hook on which a trial may ultimately fall if there are difficulties with it.  It is vital, therefore, that garda&iacute; who take statements are trained in dealing with victims.  Perhaps this argument goes a little beyond the scope of the amendment but it is important that victims are informed of all their rights at an early stage.</P>
        <P>As I stated, I did not mean to suggest Garda practice is haphazard.  I welcome improvements in this area.  We are all conscious that, in general, the treatment of prosecution witnesses has improved significantly during the years.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has made a major commitment to change.  The Minister will remember a time when prosecution counsel were more or less told they could not even speak to victims or prosecution witnesses for fear of being accused of coaching them.  Matters have improved greatly in this respect.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan addressed the Minister&rsquo;s point concerning the potential abuse of legislation and its potential to bring down a trial.  I do not see how these amendments could give rise to such a scenario.  The Minister&rsquo;s point is, however, similar to one I made on amendment No. 50 regarding the need to be mindful of unforeseen consequences when legislating to make significant changes to the criminal justice system.  He is correct that the inclusion of certain obligations in legislation may have consequences.  In this case, I do not believe the consequences he outlined would arise because the rights provided for in the amendment are afforded to the victim or complainant and could not be used by the defence.  It is nonetheless important to consider potential consequences when introducing legislation on these fundamental changes to criminal practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, we will beg to differ.  On the point I made, I do not think one could equate amendment No. 50, which is pretty definite and tries to bring clarity to the serving of a book of evidence, with these amendments.  On the point I made on whether this could be used by an offender, if he or she had a very busy legal team, he or she could suggest that in fulfilment of the proposed section 7(1) which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A victim shall as soon as practicable, be given information by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ... by the Courts Service ... [by] the Director of Public Prosecutions about the following matters ... the progress of the investigation of the offence ... [and equally] the progress of the prosecution, if any, taken against any alleged offender or alleged offenders and, in particular, the date, time and location of each event listed in <i>subsection (2)</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">a difficulty could arise.  I hazard a guess that the progress of the investigation of the offence would cause severe difficulties and if the offender and his or her legal team found that the victim was being given far too much information, an effort would be made by a creative counsel to suggest that the prosecution effort or the investigation of the offence has been compromised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might comment on the obligation to legislate on the EU framework decision.  The Minister is suggesting that the amendments are too prescriptive.  However, the first amendment is not very prescriptive.  If that is the main objection the Minister has to these amendments, I do not see how that applies to amendment No. 4 which gives recognition to the victims of crime in terms of how they are to be treated.  A victim has the right to be informed as fully as possible of his or her rights and the remedies available to him or her, his or her role in the criminal justice process and of the availability of health services and social services, in so far as the resources are available.  That is not overly prescriptive but <Col N="690"/>does enshrine the general principle in legislation, which could be linked to the victims&rsquo; charter which changes from time to time.  I accept amendment No. 5, which inserts the new section 7, is very detailed.  It would not apply to amendment No. 4.  Perhaps the Minister can address those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to amendment No. 50 and said it simply clarified the law on serving the book of evidence.  The current law on it is perfectly clear.  The amendment proposes to change rather than clarify it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Equally, it makes it more definitive.  On the framework decision, compliance with it does not necessitate legislation.  One also has to take into account the fact that our legal system is not similar to the type of legal systems on mainland Europe.</P>
        <P>While we have sympathy with the sentiments of these amendments and I would not want it thought that we would go against any of the suggestions in them, it is not appropriate to put them in the Bill as a statutory requirement for a number of reasons.  I refer to the type of information which had to be given to a victim and made a point on amendment No. 2, which referred to treating the victim with courtesy and compassion and the victim&rsquo;s dignity and privacy.  They are subjective criteria.  What is or is not courtesy to the victim may be courtesy by the judge.  He or she may feel they are being treated with courtesy.  It could lead to endless legal disputes in that respect if it was put in place in legislation.  It is far preferable to have the type of scheme we have, namely, a victims&rsquo; charter, which is working well.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 4, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;10.&mdash;(1) This section applies to a victim of a sexual offence after a person accused of such offence has been convicted of the offence.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) No court shall order that the anonymity of the person convicted of a sexual offence shall be protected where a victim to whom this section applies informs the court that it is the <Col N="695"/>victim&rsquo;s wish that the identity of the offender be publicly disclosed, even where disclosing the identity of the offender may result in the identity of the victim also being publicly disclosed and where the victim confirms to the court an awareness of such risk.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns the publication of the name of the accused or offender.  It would apply particularly in the case of a victim of a sexual offence after a person accused of such offence had been convicted and would be to the effect that no court would order that the anonymity of the person convicted of a sexual offence be protected where the victim to whom this section applies informed the court that it was the victim&rsquo;s wish that the identity of the offender be publicly disclosed, even where such disclosure might result in the identity of the victim also being publicly disclosed and where the victim confirmed to the court an awareness of such risk.  The amendment is self-explanatory and I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s views on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  As Senator Regan said, it is very clearcut and simply seeks to put into statutory form the need for the court to be conscious that the victim has confirmed his or her awareness of the risk that disclosing the identity of the offender may result in disclosing the identity of the victim.  The practice is that anonymity should remain protected, even where the victim informs the court that it is his or her wish that the identity of the offender be publicly disclosed.  We have seen this happen in a number of cases.  It is an important amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s motivation in proposing this amendment.  However, the issue he raises needs greater consideration and should be addressed in more appropriate legislation.  The laws governing the anonymity of persons in sexual offence cases are very complex, as are the reasons for allowing it.  They, therefore, need careful and considered analysis.  Furthermore, any proposal regarding anonymity should not be advanced without close consultation with victims groups being a prerequisite.  The proper place for consideration of anonymity is a comprehensive review of the laws governing sexual offences.  I would be very reluctant to proceed in the absence of such a review.</P>
        <P>Currently, anonymity of an accused is legally confined to specific offences and situations such as rape offences or where the accused person&rsquo;s name might, as, for example, in an incest case, identify the alleged victim.  I intend to publish a major sexual offences Bill next year and anonymity provisions are being examined in that context.  The amendment is not appropriate for inclusion in this Bill, as it raises issues that need to be examined in the context of specific legislation dealing with sexual offences.  I suggest to the Senator that we do not rush consideration of this sensitive issue without adequate reflection or evaluation.  I, therefore, ask that he do not propose the amendment on the basis that I will give a guarantee that the matter is being actively considered in the context of the sexual offences Bill which is being looked at very intensively in my Department.  In particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, through the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, is looking at constitutional aspects in respect of the rights of the child in the Constitution.  There is also the judgment in the &ldquo;C&rdquo; case.  In preparing the Bill we are looking at the issue of anonymity as it relates to sexual offences generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister always has a very good explanation as to why an amendment should not be passed.  However, I understand his point in this instance.  No amendment has been tabled without being considered adequately, at least by me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not suggesting otherwise.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="696"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Minister was not suggesting that, but I make the point that this is a self-contained amendment.  It is in the context of a Bill designed to address the issue of the victims of crime and balance the rights of the offender and the victim.  The safeguards to which the Minister alluded, namely, those regarding the risk of the identity of the victim being disclosed, apply only where the victim confirms to the court his or her awareness of that risk.  The amendment has been formulated very carefully and should be addressed in a Bill which deals with the victims of crime.  I do not see how a delay would assist us in dealing with the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s reference to the proposed comprehensive sexual offences Bill is very welcome.  Many of us have called for a codifying of the law on sexual offences, which is what the Minister proposes.  It is both welcome and long overdue.  However, in the short time I have been a Member of the House I have noted &mdash; I am sure Senator Regan will have seen this too &mdash; that where we table amendments that seem pertinent to the purpose of a Minister&rsquo;s Bill, this being one such amendment, we are told they are not appropriate because a major codifying legislation is to be introduced in the next year.  We frequently receive this message.  I can understand why the Minister says this but it seems this is not about the substantive law on sexual offences but the procedure by which the anonymity of a victim may be preserved, even in cases where he or she wishes to have the identity of the offender made public.  We see this happening in the courts on an ongoing basis in cases involving sexual offences.  It is important to clarify the procedure in this regard and I do not see why we must wait for major codifying legislation, although, as I said, we all will welcome the introduction of such a Bill on sexual offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I ask that this issue not be dealt with on its own in this Bill.  There is provision in existing legislation dealing with such crimes as incest whereby the anonymity of the accused is always retained, even where the charge is dropped.  This is to protect the relationships of persons involved in the alleged incident.  Regarding charges of rape and sexual assault, no details are revealed when a person is charged but if he or she is convicted, the name of the victim may be identified if that person chooses to remove anonymity.  That is the law as it stands.  In 1998 my Department published a discussion document on sexual offences which referred to the issue of anonymity.  We are now well advanced in preparing sexual offences legislation and one thing we want to do is liaise with groups interested in the issue which is not an easy one.  It is very complex.  We would like to have it considered in more detail rather than have it dealt with in isolation in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned the accused.  The amendment deals with the person who is convicted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I thank the Minister for his full response but I reiterate Senator Regan&rsquo;s point that this amendment is self-contained and would be a change to procedure rather than the substantive law.  I welcome that the process to codify the law on sex offences is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I should have declared my own interests, in that I am looking forward to working with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions at a conference that we are holding in January to examine the process by which rape trials are run and the ways in which victims are treated therein.  I hope we will feed into the ongoing law reform project in which the Minister is engaged.</P><Col N="697"/>
        <P>While the amendment deals with a procedural matter, it is of some significance to victims and worthy of acceptance on its own merits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, line 31, after &ldquo;person,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;or any offence under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a straightforward amendment.  By way of introduction to it, I should say that as I said on Second Stage, I very much welcome the provisions in Part 2 of this Bill and the necessary changes being made to the victim impact procedure introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  We are all aware very obvious flaws were exposed in that Act, notably the fact there was no provision for families of victims of homicide to give statements to the court as to the impact of the crime on them.</P>
        <P>Section 5(2) of the 1993 Act simply applies to a sexual offence, an offence involving violence or threat of violence and an offence of attempting or conspiring to do the same.  Section 5(3) <Col N="698"/>provided that where a court is determining the sentence, it shall, upon application by the person in respect of whom such an offence was committed, hear the evidence of the person in respect of whom the offence was committed as to the effect of the offence on such person upon being requested to do so.  As AdVIC and others pointed out, this did not leave room for the families of victim of homicide.  Judges in the Central Criminal Court, in particular, and in the Circuit Court in manslaughter trials were very conscious of this and gave provision to families to make victim impact statements.  I am delighted the Minister has brought forward amendments to section 5 of the 1993 Act to clarify the law on victim impact statements.</P>
        <P>All my amendments to section 4 &mdash; many of them are technical &mdash; are designed to improve the procedure for victim impact statements and to ensure it is as effective as possible for the victims of crime while being mindful of the rights of the accused.  We are also aware this applies to an accused person who has been convicted of an offence where the court is determining sentence.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Amendment No. 9 extends the range of offences to which section 5 of the 1993 Act would apply.  I have not made any changes to the sexual offences in section 5(2)(<i>a</i>).  Following on from our debate earlier, I would say that it is somewhat ironic and symbolic of the state of our law on sexual offences that the definition of a sexual offence is contained in the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 rather than in a code on sexual offence.  The UK Sexual Offences Act 2003 is a much better model in which a much clearer hierarchy of sexual offence is set out.  That is just a by the way comment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 9 seeks to amend section 5(2)(<i>b</i>) of the 1993 Act and to extend the category of offences to which victim impact statements apply to offences not only involving violence or the threat of violence to a person but also to any offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  That is relatively confined and I do not seek to go beyond that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am conscious there are offences of violence not contained in that Act.  The difficulty is that there are offences in the 1997 Act which may not be covered by that global definition of an offence involving violence or the threat of violence.  I am thinking of offences such as harassment, which involves the creation of fear but which may occur without an actual threat of violence, or the offences of abduction of a child in sections 16 and 17 of the 1997 Act, for example.</P>
        <P>The Minister might be willing to see the provision for victim impact statements extended to offences of that nature within the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 but they are not currently covered or at least the section is ambiguous.  It may be that an offence of abduction of a child would involve the threat of violence but equally it might not if the person abducting is known to the child.  It might not involve overt violence or the threat of violence.</P>
        <P>I am simply trying to see if there is a way to broaden it out while keeping it within a relatively confined category of offences.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act seems to be a good codifying Act and the application of section 5 of the 1993 Act should apply to all the offences within that.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the amendment to the Minister.  Senator Bacik&rsquo;s formulation is more comprehensive and is a catch-all one which may be the intended purpose of the formulation in the Bill.  It is more fit for purpose and I support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator proposes that we include a specific reference to offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) of the new section 5 proposed to be inserted in the Criminal Justice Act 1993 by section 4 of this Bill.  As it stands, section 5 applies to sexual offences, offences involving violence or the threat of <Col N="699"/>violence and offences consisting of attempts to commit such offences.  There was a good deal of consensus that these were the types of offences in which mandatory consideration of victim impact evidence was most appropriate.  I am not aware of any representations from victim support groups for additions to the list.  The report of the balance in criminal law review group which considered victim impact statements did not make recommendations for amendments to the categories of offences to which section 5 applies.  The non-inclusion of an offence or category of offence in the section does not prevent the sentencing court from considering victim impact evidence where it takes the view that this would be helpful in the determination of the sentence in a particular case.  Such a consideration is a matter left to the discretion of the court.</P>
        <P>A specific amendment inserting an explicit reference to the 1997 Act would largely duplicate what is already contained in paragraph (<i>b</i>).  With regard to the offences in the 1997 Act, it is clear that most of them involve violence or the threat of violence.  The offences include assault under section 2, assault causing harm under section 3, assault causing serious harm under section 4, threats to kill or cause serious harm under section 5, syringe attacks under sections 6,7 and 8, and coercion under section 9.  All these offences involve violence in some shape or form.  Furthermore, paragraph (<i>b</i>), by its use of a generic phrase, captures many other offences which involve violence or the threat of violence, not just those included in the 1997 Act.  The offence of robbery under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 is an obvious example.</P>
        <P>While there is advice to a certain extent that the amendment is unnecessary, by proposing the explicit reference to the 1997 Act, the Senator is trying to capture a small number of offences under that Act which do not necessarily involve violence but which can cause substantial emotional distress to victims.  The limitation in paragraph (<i>b</i>) is that it does not appear to capture offences involving solely emotional distress to the victim.  The offence of harassment under section 10 of the 1997 Act is an example.  A person engages in harassment of another person if he or she, by any means, including the use of a telephone, persistently follows, watches, pesters, besets or communicates with a person.  To be guilty of an offence a person must seriously interfere with the other person&rsquo;s peace, privacy or cause alarm, distress or harm to that person.</P>
        <P>Other offences under the 1997 Act do not necessarily involve violence but are likely to cause emotional distress, including the abduction of a child under sections 16 and 17.  As mentioned, the non-inclusion of offences causing emotional distress does not prevent the court from taking into account the impact of the offence on the victim in sentencing but this is not a mandatory requirement.  However, I recognise that a small number of offences do not necessarily involve violence or the threat of violence.  I will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage in order to capture the offences which inflict emotional distress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful to the Minister who has put the case better than I did in saying there is a small number of offences that are not captured by the current formula in paragraph (<i>b</i>) but which cause emotional distress to victims.  I think he accepts in principle that these could or should be covered by the victim impact procedure.  I see him nodding in agreement, for which I am grateful.  Therefore, I do not propose to press the amendment at this stage.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that there has not been a representation to this effect.  </P>
        <P>Happily, these are relatively rare offences but the offence of harassment, often referred to colloquially as stalking, causes immense distress to victims, even where there is not any actual threat of physical violence.  The abduction of a child by parents or other persons under sections 16 and 17 equally could cause great distress without it being captured by the definition in paragraph (<i>b</i>).  I would be delighted if the Minister could bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to try to do what I have tried to do, perhaps using a different formula or phrase <Col N="700"/>he has used.  Most offences under the 1997 Act are covered by the formula in place.  I would not touch that formula but I am simply trying to add to it to include the very small number of extra offences which cause distress but which are not captured in the general definition of offences involving violence or a threat of violence.</P>
        <P>I refer to amendment No. 15 in my name which specifically makes it clear there would be a more general power for the court to receive evidence of an offence other than an offence to which this section applies.  This would be an alternative if we have not adequately captured the full range of offences in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>).  I am grateful to the Minister and delighted he will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that may extend the definition in the way I have requested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister has seen his way to considering an amendment on this point as it seems to have been well made.

However, there are times when we propose amendments which are not based on representations and which does not mean they are necessarily less worthy.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, line 14, after &ldquo;by&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or on behalf of&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment to section 5(3) of the 1993 Act.  The original section 5 provides that, &ldquo;a court shall, upon application by the person in respect of whom such offence was committed, hear the evidence of the person&rdquo;.  The new subsection restates the words a court shall, upon application by the person in respect of whom such offence was committed.  I simply propose to insert the words &ldquo;or on behalf of&rdquo; to make it clear the application could be on behalf of the person, for example, by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In section 5(2)(<i>b</i>) the Minister has broadened the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in respect of whom the offence was committed to include instances where a person has died, is ill or otherwise incapacitated, and a family member.  This covers the gap in section 5 of the 1993 Act.  I welcome the new paragraph (<i>b</i>) as it will make a significant difference in that it gives a right to family members to be heard at sentencing stage in homicide trials.  This is a vital provision. The amendment would not take away from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised the amendment is not necessary, as it is always recognised that an application can be made on behalf of a person by his or her legal team or a family member.  This is not a provision for which I would die in the ditch, so to speak.  I suggest the usual formula in such legislation is &ldquo;by the person&rdquo; and that the court has inherent discretion to allow a legal representative, an NGO or a family member to make a representation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and take his point that the amendment is not necessary.  I understand that in practice the application is made by counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions rather than by directly by the victim.  I take the point that the formula already captures this practice.  The amendment was proposed in the interests of trying to make the procedure clearer and the legislation reflect more accurately the practice in the courts.  I will not press the amendment at this stage.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 14 may be discussed together, by agreement, as No. 14 is consequential on amendment No. 11.</P></Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 11:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 7, to delete lines 27 to 33 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(ii) is&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(I) a person with a mental disorder (not resulting from the offence concerned), the person or a family member,</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The purpose of the first amendment is to clarify who may make a victim impact statement on behalf of a person with a mental disorder, whether that person is a child or an adult lacking capacity.  As subparagraph (II) is currently framed, the person himself or herself, a guardian or a family member may make this statement.  The inclusion of guardian with respect to adults lacking capacity presents some difficulties.  The Bill defines &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; in this circumstance as a legal guardian.  However, unlike children with mental disorders, adults lacking capacity do not, in many instances, have legal guardians and the term has very limited practical meaning with respect to adults.  This situation is to be remedied by the mental capacity Bill which is being drafted and intended to replace the wards of court system with a system of personal guardianship.  I intend to consider whether the personal guardian envisaged in the mental capacity Bill could be given the additional role of making a victim impact statement on behalf of an adult with a mental disorder, should the need arise.  This would be done in the mental capacity Bill.  In the interim my proposal is that subparagraph (ii) be substituted with a provision such that in the case of an adult person with a mental disorder not resulting from the offence concerned, a person or a family member may make the victim impact statement.  In essence the term &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; is removed.  In the case of a child with a mental disorder, his or her parent or guardian may make the victim impact statement.  The term &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; is retained in this case as its meaning is clear but &ldquo;family member&rdquo; is removed.  I intend to remove &ldquo;family member&rdquo; in this case to bring the section into line with the provisions of subparagraph (i) which apply to children under the age of 14 years who do not have a mental disorder, having regard to the broad meaning given to &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; and the inclusion of a specific reference to the child&rsquo;s parents.  This is achieved by amendment No. 11.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 14 is consequential and deletes the definition of &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; as it relates to a person with a mental disorder.  The definition of &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; as it relates to a child is retained.  Given the nature of the task at issue, that is, making a victim impact statement, I believe it is appropriate to ensure flexibility as regards who may make such a statement on behalf of a vulnerable victim.  I am satisfied, bearing in mind the wide definition given to &ldquo;family member&rdquo; for the purpose of this section, that my proposal achieves this in respect of an adult victim with a mental disorder.  I am equally satisfied this aim is achieved in respect of a child victim with a mental disorder.  I strongly suggest the House accepts these amendments.  The scheme of the mental capacity Bill was published in 2008 and the drafting has commenced in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  We hope to publish that Bill in early 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the amendment, which clarifies the position in respect of a person with a mental disorder.  I am pleased to hear the Minister state the mental capacity Bill is being drafted and that he intends to introduce it early next year.  I am conscious that my <Col N="702"/>predecessor as one of the University of Dublin Senators, Ms Mary Henry, carried out a great deal of work to try to reform the law on wardship and introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on mental capacity.  This is a long overdue reform and further amendments may be necessary to incorporate the new procedure for wardship of adults with mental disorder, as the Minister stated.  I support the amendment and it makes sense.</P>
        <P>I put one query to the Minister, although perhaps it is something I should know and I apologise if that is the case.  I am unsure why the age of 14 years is given in proposed new section 5(3)(<i>b</i>)(i).  How does this affect the Minister&rsquo;s proposed amendment?  The proposed new section 5(3)(<i>b</i>)(i) states that where the person in respect of whom the offence was committed &ldquo;is a child under the age of 14 years, the child, or his or her parent or guardian, may give evidence as to the effect of the offence concerned on that child&rdquo;.  I presume amendment No. 11 would only apply to a child under 14 years.  However, it is unclear how this would work in conjunction with the proposed new section 5(3)(<i>b</i>)(i).  Why is this the case?  Why is it limited to a child under that age?  Will this carry on into the paragraph the Minister wishes to amend with the introduction of amendment No. 11?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for the reference to 14 years of age is because in the Criminal Justice Evidence Act 1992, a distinction is made between children above and below the age of 14 years.  We are passing that distinction into the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, line 44, after &ldquo;on&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;the person between the commission of the offence and the death of the person and on&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to try to ensure every relevant aspect of the victim impact statement would be covered and that no further flaws or unforeseen gaps would emerge in the provision.  I propose the new section 5(3)(<i>b</i>)(iv) would be altered to expand the reference to the type of evidence which may be given.  This is really about the person in respect of whom the offence is committed.  Where he or she has died as a result of the offence, the legislation provides that &ldquo;a family member of the person may give evidence as to the effect of the offence concerned on the family members of the person who has died&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We have identified a gap in that there may be a time lag involved.  Such a situation could occur in tragic cases in which the person was initially assaulted and subsequently died as a result of the injuries received in the original assault.  Therefore, there may be a time lapse between the initial assault or offence and death.  We contend that in the event of such a case there should be an extra line in the legislation dealing not only with the effect of the offence concerned on the family members of the person who has died but also on that person between the commission of the offence and the death of that person.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we should have added the phrase &ldquo;where relevant&rdquo; because this may not be relevant in all cases.  However, it may be relevant in a manslaughter case in which a person is assaulted outside a late night chipper or bar and subsequently dies some weeks or months later.  By the time the case comes to trial the family members may give the victim impact statement.  However, rather than be confined to giving evidence on the effect of the assault on them, they should be able to give evidence on the effect the crime has had on their deceased relative.  Such a person may have been in a coma for some weeks or months and perhaps he or she suffered injuries which shortened his or her life to the extent that the trial ended up as a trial of <Col N="703"/>homicide.  It may not be a homicide trial because in some cases people are not convicted of homicide offences, even where a person has died as a result of the offence.  The Minister may be aware of cases in which a person is convicted of violent disorder but in which a person has died as a result of the offence.  However, for reasons of evidence the person accused of the offence may only be convicted of violent disorder or other related offences.  In such a case the family members may wish to give evidence which is broader than evidence about the affect of the offence on them.  They may wish to give evidence about the effect on their deceased relative also.  The Minister may indicate this is not necessary and that it is already covered by implication.  However, we have seen from the current provision in section 5 of the 1993 Act that it is important to be clear about exactly what family members may say.</P>
        <P>The Minister will note that amendment No. 13 seeks to deal with the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment in the O&rsquo;Donoghue case.  Without pre-empting that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are dealing with amendment No. 12.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious of that but there have been Court of Criminal Appeal judgments which have been critical, if only by implication, of the lack of clarity in the current procedures.  We wish to ensure the procedures are as clear as possible and as comprehensive as they need to be in the interest of the victims of the offence and the family members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The proposed section 5(3)(<i>b</i>)(iv) provides that where a victim has died as a result of an offence, a family member may make an oral statement as to the effects of the offence concerned on family members.  As the Senator indicated the provision does not take into account a situation in which the death of a victim, although resulting from the defendant, occurs sometime after the offence and he or she has suffered in the interim.  It does not allow, at least in express terms, family members to outline the effect of the offence on such a victim.  Under the proposed section 5(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) the court is required to take into account the effect of the offence on the victim and may require evidence or submissions in this regard.  The evidence or submissions referred to in that paragraph would consist of written reports compiled by the Garda with input from the victim, family members and medical personnel.  Through this means the court would have an opportunity to receive evidence concerning the effect of the offence on the victim who may have lived for some time after the commission of the offence.  However, there is merit in allowing family members to make an oral statement on this issue also.  While I am not inclined to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment today I call on her not to press it and we will discuss the issue will the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to introducing an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for indicating he will consider this matter.  It may be that the drafting is not the most elegant and that we should have inserted a proviso stating &ldquo;where relevant&rdquo;.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that there is a more general provision in the proposed section 5(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) which would cover the affect of the offence on a person who died or where there is a time gap between the commission of the offence and the death from injuries.</P>
        <P>However, as the Minister noted, it is important that family members should be able to give oral evidence to the court about the impact of the offence upon them and upon their deceased relative.  I am grateful to the Minister for indicating that he will consider this amendment and I will not press it at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P><Col N="704"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(5) Where a person in respect of whom an offence has been committed, or a family member of that person, proposes to give evidence under subsection (3) orally rather than in writing, it shall not be necessary for the court to give any particular direction or warning to that person in respect of his or her evidence.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I already have alluded to this amendment which is to deal with an issue that has arisen under the present regime and the existing section 5 of the 1993 Act.  Members and the Minister will be aware of the tragic case involving the conviction of Wayne O&rsquo;Donoghue.  Although I do not propose to deal with the O&rsquo;Donoghue case, Mrs. Justice Macken gave a judgment on it in the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning how victim impact reports would be dealt with.  It is fair to state her judgment suggested that the court should warn any relatives giving a victim impact statement concerning the impact of the offence on them where the relative has died that were the relatives to go outside certain parameters, they would be in contempt of court.  To a great extent, her judgment was based on what had happened in the O&rsquo;Donoghue case in respect of its victim impact statement.</P>
        <P>However, I argue that it would not be appropriate to give such a warning in a formal way.  I am conscious the Minister has not suggested that such a warning would be required and it certainly has not been included within this legislation.  In effect however, he has done so in a different way through the new powers in the new section 5(5)(<i>a</i>) as inserted by section 4 of this Bill which states: &ldquo;The court may, in the interests of justice, order that information relating to the evidence given under subsection (3) or a part of it shall not be published or broadcast.&rdquo;  I am fully in agreement with this provision.  It is the correct way to deal with the sort of scenario that may arise during a case such as the O&rsquo;Donoghue one in which certain information in the victim impact statement goes beyond the evidence offered in court.</P>
        <P>My proposed subsection, which would be inserted just before the proposed subsection (5), is intended to make clear that the court would not be obliged to give any particular direction or warning to a family member where he or she proposed to give evidence orally under subsection (3).  The Minister&rsquo;s subsection (5) deals adequately with the difficulty that arose in the O&rsquo;Donoghue case.  However, my concern is the courts still might take it on themselves to give a warning to family members and this seems inappropriate given that no other category of witness gets such a warning.  It seems rather unfair to single out the next of kin of deceased persons who have been unlawfully killed to receive such a warning.  While the Minister may state it is not necessary to include a subsection such as this and that it might be creating a hostage to fortune, it simply seeks to deal with some of the wording of Mrs. Justice Macken in the O&rsquo;Donoghue case.  It makes clear that courts are not obliged to give a warning but can deal with any difficulties that arise in the oral evidence through ordering that information given shall not be published or broadcast or that a portion of it not be published or broadcast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment.  It is appropriate to deal with the issue that arose in that case, whether through this amendment or another appropriate amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik took the words right out of my mouth as this amendment is completely unnecessary and in a way, its acceptance potentially would tie the hands of the presiding judge.  The Senator is correct that a controversy arose a number of years ago in which the mother of a deceased boy added additional material that had not been notified to either the prosecution or defence legal representatives or to the sentencing judge at the time <Col N="705"/>of delivering the victim impact statement.  At the time the additional material attracted enormous media coverage that was adverse to the person convicted of the offence concerned.  When this matter came to the Court of Criminal Appeal as part of the application by the Director of Public Prosecutions for a review of the sentence handed down in the case, the court made a number of important, albeit <i>obiter</i>, remarks as to how sentencing judges should approach victim impact statements.</P>
        <P>The judgment to which I refer is that of 18 October 2006 in the case of The People <i>v.</i> Wayne O&rsquo;Donoghue.  The court expressed the view that the statement should be submitted to the judge and the legal representatives of the prosecution and defence in advance of the making of a statement to ensure it contained nothing untoward.  This already is the practice and means the statements must be prepared in written form.  The court went on to state: &ldquo;While great sympathy must undoubtedly exist for the person making the victim impact statement, every effort must ... be made to ensure that the statement is not used to undermine the proper role of the prosecution in a trial, nor to seek to place in the public domain unfounded or unproven allegations against the convicted person who is awaiting sentence.&rdquo;  To ensure the statement is properly circumscribed, the court stated that the person making the statement should be warned by the sentencing judge that were he or she to depart from the statement in any material way, he or she might be liable to be found in contempt of court.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that this is what the Senator&rsquo;s amendment seeks to address.  It must be emphasised that the remarks were <i>obiter</i> and therefore are not binding.  Consequently, there is no obligation on a sentencing judge to give such a warning and the Senator&rsquo;s amendment therefore is unnecessary as it simply restates the law as it stands.  The remarks of the court serve a useful function in highlighting the dangers associated with the uncontrolled delivery of additional material to a statement.  Section 5(5) as inserted by section 4 of the Bill seeks to deal with this issue by giving the court discretion to prohibit the publication of all or part of a statement in the interests of justice.  Breach of this prohibition is a criminal offence and this mechanism will mitigate the worst effects of any departure.  Clearly, however it would be preferable were unfounded allegations against the accused not aired in the first instance.  If the sentencing judge considers that a direction or warning is appropriate in a particular case, I believe that option should continue to be available and it is.  While the Senator does not aim to rule this out completely, this is the reason I suggested the amendment simply restates the law and therefore is unnecessary and, as I noted at the outset, may in an unintended way overtly restrict the presiding judge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister and had anticipated what he would say on this issue.  As he stated, the difficulty does not arise with the written statements which are given on notice.  The difficulty in respect of the O&rsquo;Donoghue case, on which he has given greater detail, arose because the oral evidence of the mother of the young boy departed from the written statement.  I had at the time and continue to have immense sympathy for the mother who spoke from the heart as she was entitled to do.  The difficulty is that it showed up problems in respect of lack of clarity in the victim impact procedure at the time.  She clearly was unaware that a difficulty might arise and yet it did and it was unfair to the accused person to have brought up references to other information that had not been part of the trial process in which he was convicted.</P>
        <P>However, it would be inappropriate for bereaved relatives to be given the sort of pre-emptive warning that Mrs. Justice Macken referred to in respect of contempt of court.  This amendment seeks to ensure courts do not consider themselves to be obliged to give such warnings by virtue of the <i>obiter</i> statements of Mrs. Justice Macken in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Although I will not press this amendment at this stage, I ask the Minister, who is in a better position to so <Col N="706"/>do, to ascertain whether courts are in the practice of giving such warnings.  I also will check but if this is happening as a matter of routine, it would seem to be unduly burdensome on bereaved families.  I cannot discern the necessity for giving such a warning in every case.  While I do not believe this is taking place in every case, I seek to avoid the practice from developing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is better to leave it up to the discretion of the judge.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendment merely restates the existing law and I do not believe it adds anything in this regard.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 10, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(7) This section is without prejudice to the power of a court to receive evidence regarding the effect of an offence, other than an offence to which this section applies, on the person in respect of whom the offence was committed.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have already referred to this amendment, which is simply a saving amendment that would insert a new subsection (7) into the new section 5 of the 1993 Act.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This would provide that the section is without prejudice to the power of the court to receive evidence regarding the effect of an offence, other than an offence to which the section applies, on the person in respect of whom the offence was committed.  It makes clear that the court has a general power to receive victim impact evidence even outside the specific offences to which this section applies.  The Minister has indicated he accepts amendment No. 9 in principle, which ensures that offences beyond those involving violence or the threat of violence will be covered.  It may be, in that case, that this amendment is unnecessary if we can be sure the new formula captures all necessary offences.  In light of what the Minister said, this adds to the discretion of the court to accept victim impact statements in respect of other offences, which we may have overlooked and which may not be captured by the Minister&rsquo;s revised formula in the earlier section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 5 of the 1993 Act places a mandatory obligation on a judge to take account of victim impact evidence with regard to sexual and violent offences.  These are the categories of offences in which such a mandatory regime is most appropriate.  This statutory obligation does not prevent a judge from taking victim impact evidence into account in other cases if he or she considers such evidence would be helpful in determining the appropriate sentence.  Judges always have had this discretion and the creation of a mandatory obligation in certain categories of cases does not alter that discretion.  This is unnecessary, as Senator Bacik anticipated in acceptance of the other amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, line 44, after &ldquo;competent&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and suitably trained&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an amendment to which I made reference in my speech on Second Stage.  I am very glad to see greater provision made for children to give evidence through a video link and, under section 6, through an intermediary.  This is welcome but I am aware of cases where there have been logistical problems with children giving evidence by video link in sex offence cases.  This is a matter for the Courts Service, which usually deals very well with this by ensuring that an appropriate person is present in the room with the child where a child is giving evidence.  Clearly, the experience will be very traumatic for a child witness, particularly in cases involving offences of a violent or sexual nature.  Problems have arisen where an appropriate person is not available.  It is important we ensure that a person is not merely competent.  I am conscious of the Minister&rsquo;s provision in the new section 6(3), which states &ldquo;An intermediary referred to in subsection (1) shall be appointed by the court and shall be a person who, in its opinion, is competent to act as such&rdquo;.  My amendment seeks to ensure the person is not only competent but suitably trained.  In general, the Courts Service ensures trained personnel are used but I wish to ensure this is provided for specifically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  The term competent presumes that one is suitably trained but I draw attention to the fact that the Council framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings recognises the importance of this issue.  In the preamble sections 10 and 11 state:</P>
        <P LI="1">(10) The involvement of specialised services and victim support groups before, during and after criminal proceedings is important.</P>
        <P LI="1">(11) Suitable and adequate training should be given to persons coming into contact with victims, as this is essential both for victims and for achieving the purposes of proceedings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Even the framework decision recognised the importance of the points Senator Bacik raised in this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The word competent encompasses expertise, training or experience.  We can rely on the Courts Service to appoint persons capable of performing the role.  Sections 5 and 6 seek to apply the provisions of sections 13 and 14 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 to vulnerable victims when making their victim impact statement.  Sections 13 and 14 apply when a child or a person with a mental disorder is giving evidence in a trial concerning sexual or violent offences.  Section 14 of the 1992 Act concerns giving evidence through an intermediary who is also defined in that case as a person who, in the opinion of the court, is competent to act as such.  Any proposals to alter the requirement for a court-appointed intermediary would have to take account of section 14 of the 1992 Act.  It would be strange to have different requirements at the sentencing hearing to the trial itself.</P>
        <P>I am informed by senior management of the Courts Service that they are not aware of any competence issues being raised about staff employed as intermediaries under section 14 of the 1992 Act.  Currently court staff perform this function of intermediary and are selected competitively for that purpose.  Staff selected in Dublin currently undergo a training course with Barnardos.  This course is not available outside Dublin but arrangements could, if needed, be made <Col N="708"/>to supply staff members to undertake the task outside Dublin.  The number of cases outside Dublin is limited.  The provisions of section 14 of the 1992 Act appear to be working well and can be extended to cover the provisions in section 6 of this Bill following its enactment.  I do not propose to make additions to the statuary requirements for a person to act as an intermediary under section 6 of the Bill or section 14 of the 1992 Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the position but, although training is provided and the Courts Service does a very good job of ensuring those dealing with video link evidence are highly competent and well trained, it may be the case that people in this position are not suitably trained.  Given the very sensitive nature of the evidence and the fact that very young children are often involved in giving evidence through the video link, it is worthwhile to specify that the persons should be not only competent but suitably trained, particularly given that Barnardos is already providing this training.  It will ensure that people are suitably trained.  The difficulty that may have arisen, to which I referred, is that there are not sufficient trained personnel and if someone is absent there may not be someone suitable to take their place.  It is important to ensure there will always be a suitably trained person in place.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

	<P>I will not press this amendment and I am grateful to the Minister for his response.  There is nothing between our positions and it is a question of whether competent encompasses suitably trained.  The court will be satisfied that a person is highly competent but the amendment simply stresses the need for training in this situation.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, before section 7, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">7.&mdash;In an application under this section the court may make such order as it sees fit to facilitate legal representation of a person in respect of whom an offence has been committed or a family member as appropriate, where it is appropriate to do so.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This refers to Part 2 of the Bill.  I anticipate that the Minister will say this section is far too broad and that he does not see its purpose.  The genesis of this amendment is research I carried out with colleagues in Trinity College Dublin for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in 1998.  We examined the experiences of rape victims in Ireland during the trial process and contrasted this with the experiences of victims in other member states.  In continental European systems, where a different criminal justice procedure is used, the victim has a greater role in the trial process and tends to be legally represented.  In homicide cases this applies to the victim&rsquo;s family.  We were interested in seeing whether a similar representative provision could be made in Ireland, while mindful that in an adversarial trial process equality of arms must be preserved.  Therefore, it would be unfair to an accused person to have two against one.  Based on the report following that research, in particular recommendations based on the Danish legal system which is closer to our own, the provision in the Sex Offenders Act, to which I referred, for separate legal <Col N="709"/>representation for victims of rape and serious sexual offences was introduced albeit in a very limited form.  A complainant has limited representation rights; where there is an application in the absence of the jury by the defence to adduce prior sexual history evidence the victim may be represented and his or her counsel will have a right of audience before the court.  That is the type of scenario we recommended where it might be appropriate for a court to facilitate legal representation of a person.</P>
        <P>This is a facilitative section which would encompass that idea of legal representation.  I anticipate that the Minister will state this is too broad and that he does not see at what in particular it is aimed.  I suppose I am setting it out as a marker because this is something we should examine.  At present, I am researching how the limited right to separate legal representation we have in rape trials and serious sexual offence trials works in practice.  From that we might be able to extrapolate whether it could be extended.  I tabled this amendment to highlight the principle that legal representation of victims or their family members might be envisaged without breaching the adversarial trial procedures.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that prior to our research on rape law the Civil Legal Aid Act already provided that victims of serious sexual offences were entitled to legal aid for pre-trial advice and assistance.  In other words, they could consult a solicitor and get legal aid and that is still the case.  Very few victims are aware of that and avail of it.  However, the separate legal representation provision for prior sexual history applications is more widely used and that is of interest.  As I stated, I am putting down a marker with this amendment, which is broadly drafted, but it indicates my hope that the Minister will examine this principle and how it could be built upon in the interests of victims&rsquo; rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It is an important point, particularly in the type of crimes to which Senator Bacik referred.  I refer to the framework decision of the European Union, which states that, &ldquo;Each Member State shall safeguard the possibility for victims to be heard during proceedings and to supply evidence&rdquo;.  In that context it logically follows that if one is given the right to present evidence, one should have the opportunity to be properly advised and to be legally represented if that is deemed appropriate by the court in particular cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand the effort by the Senator to have this principle discussed but this has been examined in recent years and the strong conclusion is that there are constitutional impediments to full separate legal representation for a complainant during the duration of a trial.  The weight of legal advice available to the Department is that full separate legal representation would tilt the balance of a trial before a jury to such an extent that it would conflict with Article 38.1&deg; of the Constitution, which states that, &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission supported this view in its report on rape, and Justice Flood in the People <i>v</i>. MC on 16 June 1995 intimated that making an injured party an independent party in a criminal trial would be doubtful constitutionally.  The legal advice to the Department when the Sexual Offences Act 2001 was being prepared was that full separate legal representation in the presence of a jury would, in the words of the Law Reform Commission in its report on rape, deprive the accused of &ldquo;the long-standing benefits of a criminal trial conducted in &lsquo;due course of law&rsquo;&rdquo;.  The circumstances in which complainants are entitled to avail of legal representation are therefore of necessity very narrow.</P>
        <P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides for separate legal representation for complainants, rightly in my view, in a situation where an application is made to the court in the course of a trial to adduce evidence or cross-examine about a complainant&rsquo;s past sexual history.  The argu<Col N="710"/>ment in favour of separate legal representation for the complainant in rape and sexual assault cases was that it would provide much needed support for complainants, render the trial process considerably less traumatic for them and contribute significantly to bringing about an increase in the reportage of rape.</P>
        <P>The provision on separate legal representation, taken together with the provisions in section 26(3) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, allows a complainant in cases of rape and serious sexual assault to consult a legal aid solicitor who may accompany the complainant into court.  Procedures in place whereby the prosecution team arranges for pre-trial consultations with complainants to familiarise them with the legal proceedings and to explain the lay-out and procedures of the court and the type of matters which may be the subject of examination by counsel are agreed to have gone a long way to improve the position of the complainant in the trial process of rape and sexual assault cases.</P>
        <P>The measures introduced represented a serious effort to allay some of the real concerns of complainants in rape trials without breaching the fundamental principle of an accused&rsquo;s right to a fair trial.  The provision to allow separate legal representation where applications are made to the court to adduce evidence or cross-examine about a complainant&rsquo;s past sexual history was aimed at circumventing this constitutional difficulty.  As such applications are made in its absence, a jury would be unaware or unswayed by the apparent inequality of representation as between the accused on the one hand and the prosecutor on the other.  Having regard to the foregoing, I do not propose to make any alterations to the present position on legal representation in criminal proceedings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister and I accept what he stated on the potential constitutional and conventional difficulties with full legal representation throughout the trial process.  However, it is worth considering how representation rights could be expanded somewhat for victims without breaching the equality of arms principle.  I am grateful to Senator Regan for pointing out the European indications that there should be greater representation for victims.  It might be that the amendment could apply to post-conviction hearings which deal with sentencing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am also grateful to the Minister for outlining to the House the detail of the Sex Offenders Act provision allowing for separate legal representation.  As I stated, that was inserted on foot of research we published in 1998 with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  In that research, The Legal Process and Victims of Rape, we recommended that limited right of separate legal representation be introduced.  We did not recommend a fuller right.  However, it is worth examining how the right to representation could be extended not to the full level, as the Minister stated, but to other hearings in the absence of the jury such as post-conviction hearings, where it would improve the trial process experience for the victim.  I will not press the amendment at this stage; I will reserve my position until Report Stage, particularly given the time.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State.  This is a worthwhile motion which is concerned not only with mortgage arrears but also with indebtedness in general.  Personal indebtedness has become a serious problem due to the haemorrhaging of jobs that we have seen in the past year.  Irresponsible and reckless lending, overpriced mortgages and major falls in disposable income are the contributing factors.  Most consumers are adapting by changing the amount they are borrowing, making different lifestyle choices and curtailing excessive use of credit card facilities.  However, there are many who are in serious financial difficulty and we must help them.  The Government which has bailed out the banks and we, as public representatives, must take responsibility for the people in question.</P>
        <P>There are many forms of debt, including utility bills, credit cards, mortgages and car loans, and many find themselves in at least one, if not all, of these forms of debt through no wrongdoing on their part.  Salaries have been dramatically cut owing to the pension levy and health levy and many are no longer in receipt of bonuses and overtime payments.  These are the people who are told to feel lucky that they have jobs.  Many struggled to pay their loans during the good times; therefore, it is almost unimaginable what they must be going through now.  Why should people who have worked hard all their lives to provide for their families and never claimed anything from the State and who did not in any way cause this recession feel lucky?</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P>There are many who are no longer in a position to pay fixed-rate mortgages.  We should use NAMA to negotiate with the banks to establish a get-out clause in order that people currently facing heavy penalties for changing mortgages &mdash; some of up to &euro;11,000 &mdash; can change to variable rates.  This would allow them to benefit from lower interest rates, resulting in lower monthly repayments.  Subprime mortgage lenders appear to have the highest interest rates and also adopt aggressive tactics for the collection of arrears.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is calling on the Government to adopt an alternative system to the current court-centred approach.  I wish to be clear that there is a difference between those who will not pay back their debts and those who cannot.  I am concerned about the latter group.  We must support families and not allow them to feel further isolated and descend into despair.  Issuing court orders for debt enforcement is not the correct solution.  An alternative system would assess people who need the terms of their repayments changed in order that they may pay in proportion to what they can afford and, ultimately, repay their debts.  A person&rsquo;s home is his or her castle and we cannot let the current level of home repossessions continue.  There was a 100% increase in the number of applications for repossessions in the High Court between 2007 and 2008.  We must set an agenda which we collectively aim to achieve.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael believes the Government must establish a new central debt enforcement agency which will immediately take over the running of existing court procedures for debt enforcement.  The legislation is outdated and applies to a time when not many borrowed beyond their means and got caught up in greed and mass consumption.  I understand people must be prudent in how they borrow and admit that some have overstretched themselves but we cannot see families and little children losing their homes to the banks which we are bailing out to the tune of &euro;54 billion.</P>
        <P>The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and other money advisers say that in their experience, people under pressure from debt do not open registered letters.  The prospect of court hearings is so terrifying that they just hope the problem will go away.  As we all know, that will not happen.  We must bear in mind the type of person about whom we are talking: someone who has worked all of his or her adult life, never signed on the dole and always paid utility bills on time but now finds himself or herself in the formal courts system.  This is inhumane.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the protocol of the Irish Banking Federation and MABS which are working well together.  They have set out guidelines for people in debt to agree a sustainable repayment schedule with their financial institutions.  I hope this protocol is working and not totally aspirational.</P>
        <P>Financial services such as MABS have seen an enormous increase in the number coming to them for advice and help.  We in Fine Gael acknowledge and commend the work of MABS but are now calling on the Government to expand the organisation in a way that gives greater support to individuals and families facing enormous financial pressures.  This can only be done if the Government provides more resources for MABS in both finance and staff training.  There are so many who simply do not understand financial jargon and need their affairs explained to them in simple terminology and there are many who need the terms of their repayments changed in order that they can make repayments in proportion to what they can afford.</P>
        <P>We must proceed according to the principles of fairness, balance and enforcement on a case by case basis.  Alternative ways of dealing with indebtedness which could assist individuals <Col N="715"/>include debt counselling and advice.  Common sense should prevail when people end up in serious debt but fear, embarrassment and lack of confidence can inhibit them from contacting lenders.  Many people bury their heads in the sand in the hope that their problems will go away.  When people have been deflated by unemployment, their loss of hope can persuade them there is no reason to make contact with lending institutions.  I am also aware of cases in which people have agreed unsustainable terms or promised overly high repayments to satisfy their lenders.  This is where MABS can play a bigger role.  Experienced personnel could act as a third party, offer a level headed perspective and keep emotions calm while at the same time offering sound advice.</P>
        <P>Earlier this week, Professor David Blanchflower expressed serious concern about the toll of unemployment on family life and the skills and esteem of our talented workforce.  We have to find ways to stimulate the economy and return people to employment.  I am also fearful of increased rates of suicide and dependency on alcohol and drugs.  Financial stress also increases domestic violence and marital breakdown.  It is ironic, therefore, that many couples cannot afford to separate because of the recession and accordingly have to endure each other&rsquo;s company in adverse circumstances.</P>
        <P>In June 2009, the financial adviser, Mr. Liam Croke, told the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs that a lender can only offer assistance to couples when they are in arrears with their mortgages.  This outrageous fact is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s reactive agenda.  Banks should be obliged to encourage young people to pay as much as they can afford on a monthly basis.  Lenders should not advocate that borrowers get into unsustainable debt because prevention is better than cure.</P>
        <P>Too many people who genuinely cannot repay their debts are going to jail.  Fine Gael has drafted legislation which would allow the State to make regular deductions from social welfare payments or wages instead of sending people to jail.  Last June, the High Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to send a woman, Ms Caroline McCann, to jail for failing to repay her loan.  In her judgment, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy noted that the failure was not due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  Many people across the country would share the personal circumstances of the woman at the centre of this case, a single mother of two with psychiatric and alcohol problems who depends on the lone parents allowance.  When her debts, which totalled &euro;18,000, went into arrears her credit union obtained an order for her arrest.  She requested MABS assistance in applying for an extension of time but the application was refused.  This is the type of situation we must seek to avoid.  As public representatives, we have a responsibility to put in place a system that is both effective and personable.  It serves no purpose to fill our prisons at enormous expense to the taxpayer with people who genuinely cannot pay their debts.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has proposed measures to regulate debt collectors and prevent criminal gangs from acting as debt enforcers.  No legislation is in place specifically to cover debt collection services.  My party calls on the Government to take immediate action on regulating debt collection.  NAMA must include a homeowners&rsquo; support scheme to protect the 35,000 families in mortgage arrears.  The housing charity, Respond, also supports such a scheme.  The ESRI forecasts that 200,000 families will be facing negative equity by next year.  Fine Gael believes we must restore stability to the financial system and provide a mechanism to protect the tens of thousands of Irish families facing repossession.  To become eligible for the homeowners&rsquo; support scheme, applicants&rsquo; main residences must have a market value of less than &euro;750,000 and they must be at least three months in arrears, able prove a loss of income, have investigated different repayment methods and used the facilities of MABS.  NAMA would purchase the entire mortgage from the bank at the current market value and write down the loan to the benefit of the <Col N="716"/>homeowner, who would service the remainder of the debt while also paying a rental fee to NAMA set by market rates.  Subsidies may also be provided through local authority shared equity schemes.  The objective is to provide people who have shown a commitment to repaying their mortgages the opportunity to make affordable and sustainable payments.</P>
        <P>I ask my colleagues across the floor to support this motion because we have a collective responsibility to look after the people we were elected to serve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  Yesterday, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul published its pre-budget submission, aptly titled, Don&rsquo;t Push Them Over the Edge.  Many people feel they are living on the edge.  I commend Senator McFadden on her eloquent and humane presentation of the motion.  People matter to us.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, indebtedness has become a huge problem for many ordinary people who were happily sailing along two or three years ago.  Those who were most vulnerable during the Celtic tiger, namely, the unemployed, the elderly, the disabled and lone parents, have been joined by a new group of vulnerable people who worked hard and saved to purchase their family homes.  Five years ago, we had never heard about negative equity or NAMA.  People thought developers were gods who built houses across the country to save them from homelessness and social housing.</P>
        <P>It is alarming that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has experienced increases of up to 30% in demands for services.  The society is spending more than &euro;18 million per year, including &euro;6 million on food, &euro;3.8 million on energy, &euro;3.8 million on education and &euro;8.7 million on direct financial help.  These figures demonstrate that people are suffering.</P>
        <P>The motion calls on the Government to take urgent, immediate and proactive steps to support people and, in particular, to remove debt enforcement from the courts by providing an alternative dispute resolution system, allow us to regulate debt collection agencies, incorporate the home ownership scheme in the National Asset Management Agency and expand the money advice and budgeting service.  The Minister, in his previous incarnation, was involved in MABS, a fine organisation which does great work.</P>
        <P>To take the example of Monday last, 76 applications for home repossessions were listed in the High Court, of which 18, the highest figure ever recorded, were granted.  The number of applications for home repossessions before the High Court increased by 100% between 2007 and 2009.  I do not fly a flag for people who are careless or greedy but we must differentiate between those who will not pay and those who want to pay but do not have the resources to do so.  We all make mistakes and in that respect, <i>mea culpa</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>

	<P>He is big enough to admit a mistake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am human.  The economic downturn has left an increasing number of people in financial difficulty.  Self-employed friends of mine who had three, four or 12 people working for them are struggling to find sufficient work for themselves.  According to the Combat Poverty Agency, the ratio of personal debt to disposable income has increased from 48% in 1995 to 170% this year.  As I stated, the money advice and budgeting service provides a worthwhile service.  Money-lending gangsters are, however, parading the streets of our cities, towns and villages.  I have been contacted by people who have been threatened and intimidated by them.  We must collectively and without recourse to party politics send a message to these <Col N="717"/>gangsters that they have no place in society.  We want to develop our communities and promote values for our children that encourage family life and home ownership.  Without such values, society will break down.</P>
        <P>The debt collection sector must be regulated.  What is to prevent me or Senator MacSharry from setting up a debt collection agency tomorrow morning and collecting money in Cork or Sligo at exorbitant interest rates?  Private debt collectors are hijacking the role of the credit unions and MABS.  As a former member of the supervisory committee of my local credit union in Bishopstown, I understand the importance of the credit union movement and the great work it does.  I appeal to those with debt problems to contact their local credit union or MABS office to negotiate a plan for resolving their problem.  The Judiciary must also pause for reflection.  It should facilitate plans which would enable people to pay back specified amounts each week.  This is a matter involving people as opposed to commodities.</P>
        <P>We can talk about home ownership, the market value of a loan, borrowers and so on and use all kinds of fancy jargon.  I love the term &ldquo;negative equity&rdquo;.  If I had been wise, I would have bought a house 20 years ago.  When I was in college playing hurling and drinking pints, friends of mine were buying houses and now own four or five rental properties.  While I do not know if they are happy, I am happy even though I have only one house and can hardly manage it.  We must keep things in perspective.</P>
        <P>I believe passionately in people.  The level of credit card debt is frightening.  The banking sector and credit card companies should consider introducing a moratorium on the interest paid on credit card debts by those who are genuinely struggling to pay rather than those who would seek to hoodwink.</P>
        <P>As Senator MacSharry will acknowledge, I have not been overtly party political in my contribution.  I cringed, however, when I read the amendment.  The renewed programme for Government is a missed opportunity and a wasteland of promises.  One line in the amendment epitomises all that is wrong today.  It reads: &ldquo;notes that activity in the property market has remained low, making it very difficult to assess realistic price levels, so that any estimate of how many are in negative equity, or how long the position is likely to last is largely speculative&rdquo;.  People are in debt and in some cases on the brink.  We know property values have declined because we read constantly in the financial sections of the newspapers about the rate of decline in the property market.  We also know that people have lost income, have been placed on a four-day week or lost their jobs.  It is incorrect, therefore, to argue that it is not possible to make an assessment.  I appeal to the Senators on the Government side, who are decent human beings, to support the motion and set aside their amendment in the interests of those who are genuinely struggling.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator McFadden and the Fine Gael Party for using Private Members&rsquo; time to address this issue.  Since March, I and many other Members have been working hard to try to devise innovative ways to deal with the human cost of the international economic downturn and its effects on the national economy.  In that regard, I and a number of other people prepared a report which made a number of recommendations to the <Col N="720"/>Minister for Finance.  We presented the report to the Minister last August and I am pleased to note the amendment acknowledges much of its content.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no question that our economic difficulties are unprecedented.  The economy is the sum of the people in it and the problems people face must be addressed.  In recent weeks, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance have noted that the number of repossessions remains relatively low, notwithstanding the figures cited by Senator Buttimer on the number of cases before the courts.  At approximately 14,000, the number of mortgage holders in arrears is not especially significant relative to other years.  On the basis of available evidence, the type of actions sought by the Fine Gael Party and the group with which I was involved and which presented a report to the Minister do not appear to be necessary.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the good work done by the Financial Regulator in preparing a code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P>The Minster of State was very involved in the establishment and work of MABS.  It does excellent work.  I acknowledge the protocol it has signed up to.  It states it will not commence legal action and will suspend or adjourn legal action which may have already commenced, subject to ongoing compliance with a mutually acceptable, affordable and sustainable repayment.</P>
        <P>I would not describe the kinds of complaints and worries families are having in terms of mortgage arrears as a ripple in the context of what is coming.  Inevitably, as we constitute less than 1% of the eurozone economy and given the focus of Trichet in the European Central Bank on inflation, as the European economy begins to recover there will be difficulties for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Anybody who was up late last night would have seen that many of the international headlines focused on the outlook that the EU is on its way out of recession.  It is great news in theory.  In the short to medium term it is not particularly good news for us.  The eurozone economy, 99% of which does not include us, will inevitably demand interest rate rises.  This week Norway, which is not part of the eurozone, increased its interest rates.  Interest rates will inevitably begin to creep up here.</P>
        <P>People who had a double income and no children were put to the pin of their collar to borrow &euro;250,000 or &euro;350,000 to buy their dream home or first home to get on the ladder and start the ball rolling.  Such people are now in a different scenario.  Perhaps one of the jobs is gone, one or both people could be on short time or there may be two children to be cared for.  The complete outlook for such people has changed and there is no question that as interest rates rise the pressures on them will significantly increase.  When that time comes the demands on such people will be greatly increased and far from a ripple, it will be like a tsunami.  I am not trying to scaremonger, frighten people or create a mountain out a molehill.  It is basic maths.  It would be foolish in the extreme if we did not prepare for such an event.</P>
        <P>There has been some acknowledgement that we need to do this in the form of protocols from the Irish Bankers Federation.  We require a legislative basis for it.  Senator McFadden referred to the good development which emerged over the summer whereby a woman could not be put in prison for non-payment of a debt.  It is to be hoped a woman or a man could not be put in prison&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for non-payment of a debt due to refusal to pay or culpable wilful neglect.  It is something I very much welcome on the private debt side, in terms of credit cards and similar products, but such a provision should not apply to mortgages.</P><Col N="721"/>
        <P>I would like to see a proposal along the lines of that which we made in our report to the Minister.  I am glad to see the amendment I moved states the protocol for MABS and the IBF can be reviewed and renewed to include a series of other opportunities.  It is similar to our report and what Senator McFadden said regarding examining reducing the rates, giving people breathing space, longer maturity dates, rolling-up of outstanding interest, a bank taking equity in a house &mdash; I am not sure about that but it is an option &mdash; and a bank taking ownership of and leasing back a house.</P>
        <P>These proposals were mentioned in our report and by the Opposition.  A legislative basis needs to be put in place to guarantee that they will be actively considered.  One flaw with the protocol regarding MABS is that it states it is not a legal document.  Phrases such as &ldquo;mutually acceptable&rdquo;, &ldquo;where possible&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the event that&rdquo; and &ldquo;provided people liaise and work together in an effective and realistic way&rdquo; are used.  The code of conduct from the Financial Regulator refers to viable alternatives.  Who determines what is a viable alternative?  I have some worries about that.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge and welcome the fact that in our amendment we state we will consider all options but, similar to the Court Service of Northern Ireland, we need to put something more concrete in place.  Its protocol, which is not a million miles from the proposals from both sides of the House or those envisaged by MABS and the IBF, has a critical line which states &ldquo;Parties should be able, if requested by the court, to explain the actions they have taken to comply with the protocol&rdquo;.  Such a provision is not included in our protocol.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with this area.  I would love to see us introduce a further amendment to the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act, which we amended during the summer, focused specifically on mortgage defaulters.  I do not support the concept of a NAMA for people.  Irish people have their own homes and want to pay for them.  As we said earlier, if somebody has lost their job he or she wants to be able to stay where he or she lives.  When things become right for him or her again, he or she will live up to his or her responsibilities, continue to pay his or her mortgage and buy a home in the normal way.  We need to put in place the appropriate template for people to do that and which gives people breathing space while they get back of their feet.  There is no question that there will continue to be a proportion of repossessions and rightly so, because there will be people who, through wilful neglect, refuse to pay their mortgages.</P>
        <P>I ask the Cathaoirleach to indulge me.  Provident Personal Credit is a finance company which legally charges more than 180% interest in this State.  It is not engaged in any illegal activity in the collection of money but a rate of about 30% is more than enough to allow any financial institution to charge.  On illegal money lenders, while there are many laws in place in terms of enforcement and the use of illegal methods for collection of a debt, people are not coming forward to the extent they might because they fear harm and violence will come to them.  We need to examine the possibility of allowing the sworn testimony of a superintendent as enough to help to convict people who are engaged in illegal and criminal money lending.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I congratulate my colleagues in Fine Gael for tabling this very important motion.  The Government needs to be thoughtful, as Senator MacSharry has been, in helping us to confront the very serious situation in which we find ourselves and not just dismiss it.  One of the principal thrusts of the motion is the terrible situation regarding unemployment.  I have spoken about finance; it has never been reported in this House.</P><Col N="722"/>
        <P>I came up with an idea comparable to NAMA some time ago which I will not go into.  One of its elements concerned the land banks around cities.  It was a simple, perhaps naive idea, but I think it would help.  I suggested that some of this land be taken by the Government, divided into allotments and people be given small kits with seeds, plants and tools and title to the allotments.  It would get people out of the house and stop depression developing.  We hear from all the voluntary agencies that depression is a serious illness which attacks unemployed people.  The allotments would give them exercise and supplement their budgets and diets.  It is a simple idea which would not cost very much.  The Government should perhaps think about it.  Responses to this area will be a mixture of small ideas like that and encouraging small business and the grander vision, about which I will say a few words.</P>
        <P>We need to clear away a lot of red tape from small businesses and people who have a real entrepreneurial spirit, and do our damnedest to get money flowing, what is sometimes called risk capital, because the banks have become extremely risk averse.  It is extraordinarily important that we manage to get finance to people who have ideas and are prepared to act on them.</P>
        <P>I will give an example.  There is a very well-known Dublin company called Granby&rsquo;s which makes sausages and it is located just behind Parnell Square.  It is a small business that turns over a number of millions of euro and employs a considerable number of people.  It has come up with what I think is a very good idea of making so-called hot mollies, which are reasonably sized sausages like a frankfurter.  It has imaginative little trolleys in the centre of the city and at commuting times the company proposes to sell this product.  There would be a certain number of jobs from this and quite a manufacturing capacity which would make up some of the shortfall caused by the practices of certain supermarkets and so on.  The company has hit a snag despite the goodwill of local authorities because by-laws prohibit the casual sale of goods on the street without a casual trading licence.  As existing casual trading licences are restricted in number and hours of operation and limit the type of goods that can be sold, one is unlikely to get a casual trading licence for an existing location as long as there are no new casual trading areas.  A young man in charge of a traditional business has an opportunity to expand employment and give a good service &mdash; I have seen the project &mdash; and this is only one example.  It is simple and could perhaps be dismissed as naive but it will create employment and it is Irish.</P>
        <P>I have been speaking about seafood for a very long time in this House because it is one of the great unexploited resources of this country.  As Dominic Behan stated in his wonderful song, thank God we are surrounded by water, and it is still relatively full of fish and shellfish in particular.  These include crab, lobster, mussels and oysters, and such foods have not been sufficiently exploited.  I will be positive and say I was glad to see a Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, in Cork the other day visiting the first dedicated seafood development centre.  That is the kind of thing I have been screaming about for years.</P>
        <P>We have been exporting our seafood in bulk rather than packaged and prepared for the market, thereby losing approximately 80% of the value.  In effect, we hand it over to others.  I am very glad that we now have an opportunity to deal with value-added seafood thanks to the work of this Minister of State and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The development centre has an innovative section which I am sure the Minister of State knows about.  In it one can get advice on marketing and help with guiding an initial idea through to a fairly rudimentary export process.  It may look like small potatoes &mdash; or periwinkles &mdash; but that is where we will see growth.  These are the small elements that will withstand a financial storm.</P><Col N="723"/>
        <P>We should look to the bigger picture.  I am unashamed at having used this House to promote a number of projects, one of which is the metro in Dublin.  I have been advocating it for nearly 20 years.  I exploited a position where the Government changed without an election and Independent University Senators were put in the pivotal position governing the balance of power.  I used the opportunity to amend the Dublin transport Bill to include a rudimentary framework for a metro.  The Government should continue with the metro.  We can look to the jobs in construction that will be brought into play by this.</P>
        <P>Have a bit of courage and do it properly.  In consultation with the great imaginative figure of Cormac Rabbitt, the man who is the William Dargan of our day, I have advocated my mark II proposal of an orbital network, which could link with all existing transport networks rather than having a route direct to the airport.  Perhaps that could be included.  Whatever the Government does, it should not spoil the ship for hap&rsquo;orth of tar.  It should put in decent stations that people will respect.  A plexiglass box could be used like that at the Louvre station in Paris, displaying treasures from the National Gallery, the National Museum or the Ardagh chalice, the Book of Kells and the Tara brooch.  People should be given a sense of pride again.  The Abbey Theatre will produce a few jobs and lift our society.  It is not just pertinent to the economy and the feeling and spirit of the people will be helped.</P>
        <P>I have spoken for quite a long time about negative equity and warned about the position in which people would find themselves in having been offered 100% loans and gotten into difficulty.  The figures are frightening and something must be done.  MABS is a wonderful body but the Minister of State should tell his colleagues that it should be properly resourced and financed, which it is not at the moment.  It will be needed more and more as we slide to a catastrophic 350,000 people in negative equity, of whom 10% or 35,000 may suffer repossessions.  Despite what Margaret Thatcher said, we are more than an economy.  In this country we are a society.  We cannot permit such repossessions except to our undying shame.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unusual, in one sense, to see an amendment to a motion which is longer than the motion itself.  The spirit in which it is being tabled is not part of the usual cut and thrust of Government and Opposition politics.  All of us in the House recognise that a significant problem exists in our society that must be identified and dealt with.  The purpose of a debate such as this is to work through such identification and work out common approaches on how to deal with the problem.  From what I have heard of the debate, it has been conducted along those terms.</P>
        <P>I will read into the record a section which has been included in the recently revised programme for Government.  It is not my wont to read in most debates but for the sake of accuracy I would like to have these couple of paragraphs put in as a context for the debate we are having this evening.  The revised programme for Government, under a section entitled &ldquo;Protecting the Family Home&rdquo; states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will introduce new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments.  The existing statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) on debt default will be further reviewed with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations, including for example, the use by banks and lenders of more flexible mechanisms to avoid foreclosure in appropriate circumstances. These could include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />reduced rates</P><Col N="724"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />longer maturity dates</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />rolling-up of outstanding interest</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />bank taking equity in the house</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />bank taking ownership and leasing back to the resident with rent payments coming off the loan.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p11- ?><?oasys _ix ?>With reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions, the Government will examine ways of expanding its own mortgage support measures.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Under the section dealing with regulation of debt collection, the programme states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will reform debt enforcement in light of the deliberation of the Law Reform Commission, which has recently published a consultation paper on the matter.  We will regulate debt collection agencies.  We will create a new system of personal insolvency regulations allowing for a statutory non-court-based debt settlement system.  We will seek to establish a central Debt Enforcement Office to remove as many debt enforcement proceeds from the courts as possible.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have read this into the record because there are several elements included in the original motion which references the greater support of MABS, the use of the Law Reform Commission and how there should be regulation of debt collection agencies.  There is no disagreement from anyone on either side of the House on such questions.</P>
        <P>We must be aware of the scale of what exists as a potential problem in our society.  The debate which has been ongoing in the other House and which we will have in this House next week relates to a speculation-led property development debt of &euro;77 billion in many of our financial institutions.  The level of private debt altogether in our financial institutions at &euro;400 billion dwarfs our own State debt, and there is even a level of that debt which can be attributed to personal sources such as the use of credit cards and household mortgages. One is still talking about a sum of &euro;160 billion, which is NAMA multiplied by at least two.  The potential for default and the difficulties in which individual citizens may find themselves are very real and there is an onus on Government and the political system to ensure they can be averted.  The five bullet points in the revised programme for Government offer as good a code to help stem that as anything we might do as a political system.  Reduced interest rates and longer maturity dates, the rolling up of outstanding interest, the taking of equity by banks in a house or their taking ownership and leasing back or renting are some of the measures we must adopt to a greater extent.  We must recognise that the moratorium that was put in place, and is to be renewed shortly, has had an effect.</P>
        <P>Even under conventional methods the time difference between a debt being recalled and acted upon in a repossession is still approximately 18 months.  Once we have those kinds of benchmarks within which to work, there will be a timeframe in the lifetime remaining to this Government, and for whomsoever shall compose the next Government, to put in place measures that over the next five years will protect as many as possible in our society.  I hope today&rsquo;s debate will be an important contribution to that.  I cannot see any real political disagreement.  The amendment to the motion is an attempt to adopt most of what is in the original motion and in what the Government proposes and further embellish it.  That would give the <Col N="725"/>greatest agenda possible for all Members in this House to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible are protected from this risk and that the risk can be avoided in years to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Fine Gael initiative and this motion which my party will support, in content and intention.  Senator Boyle said he seeks to minimise the level of disagreement that exists.  However, when we look at the amendment we do not see a real engagement with what was tabled by Fine Gael Members.  Instead we see this tried and trusted formula, namely, to delete the entirety of what was proposed and substitute the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  I say this for the umpteenth time on Private Members&rsquo; business.</P>
        <P>That is unfortunate.  If there really were the level of agreement about which Senator Boyle talks, we should have had meaningful discussion between parties prior to the session and put down on paper the basis of the agreement the Senator claims exists.  We do not serve that purported agreement by knocking out the entirety of the proposal put forward by the Fine Gael Members and substituting the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  That is not agreement but the deletion and insertion of an entirely new motion.</P>
        <P>In her introduction, Senator McFadden carefully and very compellingly set out the context in which the issue was raised.  People face a very real human situation.  Members on all sides of the House know that and I do not suggest that colleagues on the opposite side are not aware of or do not confront or hear about this problem every day of the week.  I am sure Ministers do so too.  The question is what are we going to do about it and when will we do it.  The point has been made repeatedly that there has been a comprehensive response by the Government on this question.  I disagree with the proposal relating to NAMA.</P>
        <P>That ringing telephone shows incredible disrespect to the House.  I am sorry the Member is not present now because I do not like to say things when somebody steps out.  When a telephone rings, the very least one would do is switch it off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have pleaded with Members not to bring telephones into the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Even in circumstances where a mistake is made surely the telephone can be switched off.</P>
        <P>There has been a response on the banking issue.  When we talk about people who face or are trapped in negative equity, it is not merely rhetorical for us to point out they cannot sell their house with the benefit of long-term economic value.  A person stuck in negative equity who looks to sell to get out of a problem will have to sell at whatever market rate exists.  Whatever they manage to eke out will be little or nothing in current circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Compared with the gift of so-called long-term economic value that is to be assigned to loans in the bailing out of the banks, no such long-term economic value is being afforded or gifted to individuals who find themselves in negative equity.  They must face the music if they can manage to offload their houses for any price at the moment.  In the circumstances, it is fair to draw the comparison between what the Government did for the banks and what they have failed to do for individual mortgage holders.</P>
        <P>The other point about the Government amendment is that it is replete with references to the renewed programme for Government.  Senator Boyle echoed that in his speech.  I look for two things from the Government, as do all of us.  First, what is going to be done?  Second, when will it be done?  The difficulty is that the references to the programme for Government are completely devoid of any timelines in respect of commitments in these matters.  For example, the third paragraph of the Government amendment notes: &ldquo;the renewed programme for <Col N="726"/>Government envisages an examination of ways of expanding mortgage support measures&rdquo;.  When will that happen?  It is only an examination.  Where is the action or the delivery?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At the bottom of the first page the same phrase is used again, namely, &ldquo;the renewed programme for Government envisages an examination of ways of expanding mortgage support measures&rdquo;.  I do not know how that managed to get in twice.  It continues: &ldquo;and new measures to protect families having difficulties&rdquo;.  The section quoted by Senator Boyle noted that the renewed programme for Government also provides for the existing statutory code of conduct and the recently agreed protocol to be reviewed further.  That is a commitment to review.  The bullet points state that the new mechanisms &ldquo;could include&rdquo; the measures that follow.  Will they?  Is there any commitment to their doing so?  When will this be done?  The following paragraph &ldquo;notes the renewed programme for Government envisages that ways of expanding mortgage support measures will be examined with reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions&rdquo;, and continues: &ldquo;the renewed programme for Government envisages reform of debt enforcement in light of the deliberation of the Law Reform Commission&rdquo;.  These are the references to which Senator Boyle referred so warmly as being a response to what the Fine Gael motion seeks to achieve.  They are not commitments for action but are repeated references to reviews and examinations to happen in the future.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>As colleagues will be aware, my party proposed a very concrete set of proposals in this area in the other House.  I commend those proposals to my colleagues.  The Government code of conduct as introduced in February is simply not adequate in the circumstances.  It requires a very serious effort on the part of the Government.  People become concerned about the legal problems.  We all know a mortgage is a contract between a borrower and a lender.  There is a reluctance on the part of the State to intervene in that contractual relationship.  However, all the old rules have been thrown out the window in the current circumstances.  What we are doing in the context of NAMA is completely unprecedented.  Apart from the fiction of long-term economic value, the State is intervening like never before in contractual relationships by taking them over and stepping into the banks&rsquo; shoes.  If this can be done in respect of the banks and at a considerable cost, the full amount of which we do not know and might not know for many years, Fine Gael&rsquo;s relatively modest proposals to deal with the concrete, everyday dilemmas facing mortgage holders should commend themselves to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment because the Opposition&rsquo;s proposal is to incorporate in NAMA a home owner&rsquo;s support scheme to protect those families facing home repossessions.  However, NAMA&rsquo;s purpose is to protect the economy.  It is a single purpose vehicle and repossessions can be addressed by other means and methods.</P>
        <P>On most, if not all, other issues, we agree that the situation in which we have found ourselves is, in large measure, the making of the banks and credit institutions.  On the international scale, it is of their making in full measure.  The collapse of the sub-prime lending sector in the US is worth noting.  Housing loans were rolled over and sold forward in packages, the money from which was used to fuel the lending fire further.</P>
        <P>It is not that long ago that one might have received a note through the door asking whether one wanted to go on a holiday or to get &euro;15,000 with no strings attached.  Those of us who went through the 1980s and remembered interest rates at 18%, 20% and 22% and the difficulties in getting and holding on to a job until our knuckles went white because the only other option was emigration knew that those practices were dangerous.  In glossy store card offers, people were told they could borrow up to a limit and pay off 2% per month, but doing so would have taken 18 years.</P><Col N="727"/>
        <P>The banks have significant responsibility for allowing 110% loans, providing money to developers who were trying to outbid one another and pushing up the price of land to the extent that people who had not been around the circuit before believed that all one needed to do to get rich was get a job, of which many were available, borrow money to the maximum, buy a house and watch its value increase by 40% within two years.  The banks had a large part to play but, this notwithstanding, we could have got through it all with our exports as we had a good, strong economy.</P>
        <P>What the banks did internationally was pure criminal.  They knew it was wrong.  When people started to default, banks hid the facts from the regulators.  This story is almost biblical in that the banks have been forgiven a large debt because we need them to bail out the economy.  Time and again, the Opposition states that we are bailing out the banks, but neither I nor anyone in Fianna F&aacute;il holds a brief for a bank.  We hold a brief for the economy, which is what we have been doing.  We have helped the banks, but the way they will now treat people is how they will be judged.  Banks should not believe that they can return to the old days of 3% margins, putting people out of their homes and using a Victorian legal system to ensure the repayment of debts to the last penny after they have been forgiven significant amounts.  This Oireachtas and its future versions should protect people because we have not forgotten the lesson.</P>
        <P>MABS is doing a good job.  A system for the rescheduling of debts with banks, taking equity, rolling loans over and working with people to ensure they can repay a certain amount has been proposed.  It has never been acceptable that those who will not pay would not pay.  However, it has always been acceptable that those who cannot pay would not pay.  These are the people we are supporting.</P>
        <P>With this responsibility in mind, I remind the banks of a warning from the past.  If they start going after the poor people in question, there will be a strong feeling in the community to legislate to ensure that what we are proposing as a voluntary code of conduct will quickly become a legal one.  The banks&rsquo; future is in their own hands.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are going through difficult times, but better times are on the way.  However, I share my colleagues&rsquo; concerns regarding the rise in ECB interest rates.  It could easily come about.  We only constitute 1% of the euro market and there is no doubt the Germans, who have strong sway in Frankfurt and the ECB, have an historical fear of inflation.  As the threat of inflation returns and economies move forward, the ECB will raise rates.  However, we can take solace <?oasys _dc18- ?>from two elements.  First, ECB rates are historically low and are within no measure of the 18%,<?oasys _dc0- ?> 20% and 22% penalty rates paid in the 1980s.  Second, if the European markets are improving, there is no doubt our economy, as the world&rsquo;s most open economy, will start improving.</P>
        <P>While agreeing with much of the Opposition&rsquo;s comments, NAMA is not a suitable vehicle for ensuring the home owner&rsquo;s support scheme is put in place.  However, the voluntary nature of the proposed support scheme must be accepted by the banks in full.  There is more than hearsay evidence to suggest that some of the banks are using Ireland as a piggy bank, in that foreign banks are taking in deposits but not giving out loans.  They are using us to increase their tier 1 capital ratios abroad and are sucking money out of the Irish banking system.  If necessary, we should legislate to ensure moneys deposited in Ireland are given out on loan in Ireland.  The Irish economy comes before any or all other banks.</P>

	<P>While I accept the Senator&rsquo;s analysis of the culpability of the banks, the lack of international regulation and the disgraceful sub-prime lending in America, we cannot exonerate our Government of responsibility for allowing the building boom to go out of control for the sake of collecting revenue and allowing waste to develop in the economy and elsewhere.  I do not like taking issue with my good friend, Senator Hanafin, and he will take it in the proper spirit, but he has a future as a scriptwriter or fiction writer for the Minister of State.  Perhaps he could be a modern economist with a new commission.  Fair dues to him.  This is all part of the cut and thrust of debate and is worthwhile because we must consider matters from every perspective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate my colleague, Senator McFadden, on her presentation of this motion.  She has much compassion and empathy for people and a real feel for politics at a local level.  This motion was born out of that principle and that type of conviction.  It is a very worthy motion and, tragically, a very relevant one.  I congratulate her on her exposition of it and Senator Buttimer on seconding it.</P>
        <P>Tragically, indebtedness is a huge problem which arises from, and is aggravated by, unemployment.  The current unemployment figure is in excess of 400,000 people.  In June 2008 the Financial Regulator estimated that 14,000 people had mortgages in arrears.  It is now estimated the figure could be double that.  Some 200,000 people have negative equity and that figure will increase.</P>
        <P>I take Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s point that unfortunately there is a risk of interest rate increases.  I also accept the modification made by Senator Hanafin that we may not return to the 1980s.  Even if there was a marginal increase in interest rates, it would have a huge implication for people who have borrowed to the pin of their collar.</P>
        <P>The 2009 code on mortgage arrears, or the existing code on how mortgage arrears should be dealt with, is reactive in the sense that it is a timetable for court, repossessions etc.  It is not proactive in the sense of interfering to deal with the issue, engaging in conciliation, applying a moratorium on the debt in some instances, extending the duration of the mortgage or looking at interest rates or payment methods.  It is not that kind of system and that should be addressed immediately.</P>
        <P>The protocol between the Irish Banking Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service while worthy is not set out in legislation and that is a difficulty.  The problem with MABS is understaffing and the waiting list.  It is argued that some of the personnel in MABS do not have the capacity, or are not sufficiently qualified in all instances, to negotiate fully with lending institutions.</P>
        <P>I refer to the open court procedure.  Thank God we have not all had the experience of attending court, although nobody can say with his or her hand on heart that he or she will not do so in the future, especially if the doomsday scenario of a doubling or trebling interest rates <Col N="729"/>occurs.  Those who have attended court know it is archaic and unlikely to get the right reaction.  It is punitive, public and adversarial and does not provide a mechanism to deal with this issue.  The imprisonment of debtors is hugely expensive and is not a practical option.  Senator McFadden cited a court ruling earlier.  An alternative is needed.</P>
        <P>The legislation needs to be reviewed and a new proactive process must be put in place to try to resolve this difficulty almost like in marital and other disputes where a conciliation system applies which rectifies the difficulty.  That would be better than a punitive approach or a cornering of the debtor.  There will be dishonourable exceptions and where they exist, there is no option but to allow the law to take its course.  It probably was the case at one stage in our history where only very dishonourable people who would not pay came before the court but that is not always the case now.  We must adjust to the new reality.</P>
        <P>Despite criticism of it from the other side, and that is the job of a debate in the House, our concept of a home owner support scheme, or our amendment to the NAMA legislation, is worthy.  I commend that to the Government and ask the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to take another look at it.  I take the point we are attempting to save an economy but we take issue with the entire NAMA concept and propose an alternative.  Saving the economy is central but the economy involves house owners and property.  We have a society as well as an economy and both must be dealt with.</P>
        <P>We propose that part of a property would be taken over after negotiating the debt with the relevant financial institution.  A new price would be negotiated in light of changed circumstances.  NAMA would negotiate if there was an endangered property and take equity, if required, and charge a rental fee for the equity.  The debtor would then pay the remainder.  That is what Fine Gael proposes.  It could work in practice.  The Government argues that NAMA can work for property developers in a macro sense so why could this not work for house owners in a micro sense?</P>
        <P>If a debt on a house is &euro;400,000 and there is a write-off of &euro;80,000, the &euro;320,000 would be divided between equity to NAMA and the remainder being paid off by the house owner.  A rental would be paid to NAMA, almost like in the shared ownership scheme.  That should work in practice and should be considered.  MABS should also be extended.</P>
        <P>This is a worthy debate and I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  We should all work together and look at all practical solutions because we are dealing with considerable human misery which results in domestic violence, marital breakdown, substance abuse and suicide in some instances.  It is beyond politics in the narrow sense.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Fine Gael on tabling this worthy motion.  It is an important debate.  The Government amendment to the motion is equally responsive.  When there is as much agreement as this among the main parties, it is important to ensure we carry this goodwill forward to the budget which is a very important part of what we are trying to do.</P>
        <P>The motion suggests using NAMA as a vehicle for this proposal.  I support what Senator Hanafin said that we need separate legislation to deal with mortgages.  I have had dealings with Deputy Thomas Byrne in regard to a proposal he has written on mortgages.  We have taken advice from the chief executive officer of the Educational Building Society and he sees no reason we should not legislate in regard to mortgages and equity being taken by the banks.  That would be an important first step.  There is much merit in what was said but there should be separate legislation in this regard.</P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>There is no doubt but that everything has changed.  Senator MacSharry outlined a scenario which could be a doomsday one for mortgage holders, namely, if there was a substantial rise in interest rates.  Even an increase of 2% could put a large number of people under pressure and they would not be able to repay their mortgages.  If only one member of the household is paying the bills as a result of another member losing his or her job, as has happened in many cases, that would place huge pressures on the household.</P>
        <P>It is a bit rich for the Labour Party to talk about what it would do.  When it had an opportunity to do things for the less well off during its time in Government, it gave old age pensioners five shillings.</P>

	<P>An alternative Government would have the same situation to face and actions to take.  I am glad to see the House is in agreement on many issues this week on how the budgetary position should be tackled.  I do not wish to be petty but in reply to Senator Alex White, the Government has improved the living standards of everyone, including the low paid, by way of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, increases in pensions, social welfare, education and sports grants.  There has been significant investment in all these areas but there is a difficulty in maintaining it.  We must, therefore, look at how we can continue to support the same people but with less money.  When money is scarce, we need to obtain better value and savings will be needed in certain areas.  To extend the process over a longer period would create problems for an alternative Government and result in extra interest repayment of &euro;12 billion.  We must grasp the nettle now and tough decisions will be required.  Such decisions will not be pleasant but it is important they are taken for the future of the country, otherwise I foresee problems further down the line.  It is our job, as legislators, to ensure legislation on mortgage measures is in place.  That is the way to look after those who have mortgages.  We must ensure the banks do not take us to the cleaners like they did in the past five to ten years, offering unrealistic mortgages.  There is still sub-prime lending.  People who would not be given a mortgage anywhere went to sub-prime lenders and now have them.  Legislation should be enacted to cover not just our own banks but the entire banking system in the country.  It is important we do this because that is our job, as legislators.  I make that proposal &mdash; the legislation should come from this House in the first instance.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="731"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment my colleague, Senator Nicky McFadden, on initiating this Private Members&rsquo; debate and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran.  I am in agreement with much of what has been said, particularly by my party colleagues, Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Buttimer and McFadden.</P>
        <P>A number of issues have been raised in the course of the debate.  Senator Butler referred to the need for the Government to make tough decisions.  We have been listening for a long time to the excuse that the Government is unpopular because it had to make tough decisions.  No tough decisions have been made.  It is just 30 days to budget day and we expect tough decisions will be taken because they need to be,  otherwise what is already a very bad situation will be made much worse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government decided to spend &euro;4 billion on the recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the most reckless of all the Irish financial institutions and which will never again trade successfully.  The Government ignored advice from many sectors, not least the Opposition benches when we pointed out that this was good money after bad.  That &euro;4 billion would go a long way towards helping the people about whom we are speaking.  I am thinking, in particular, of many people in my own age group who left school or college and had no difficulty in finding work in the past few years.  Many of those jobs are gone.  I know many people who have left the country, handed back the keys to houses and will have a black mark against their creditworthiness which will remain with them if they ever return to Ireland.  That is the sad reality.  Thousands of families in new developments around this city and in the horseshoe commuter belt towns around Dublin and towns across the country paid extortionate amounts for houses that were not worth the money in the first place.  They did so in the hope and belief they would be able to remain in employment and meet their mortgage repayments but that has not been the case for many of them.  The Government has introduced certain measures such as NAMA, about which I have significant difficulties but at least it is an attempt to close a gaping hole.  However, very little has been done for private individuals.  The Fine Gael proposal to include private home ownership within the terms for NAMA is an attempt to show the ordinary suffering Joe Public that the Government is not just about bailing out banks but that it will do something for those individuals who have been badly hit.  That is the biggest credibility gap for the Government but it has made no effort to fill it.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed at the Government&rsquo;s proposal to amend the motion.  Senator Boyle said the Government amendment included the proposals made in the motion but that is not the case.  The amendment commends the Government on providing additional staff for MABS, which is a fantastic service.  As a constituency politician, I have been dealing with it in my seven years in the House.  In recent times I have referred many more of my constituents to its offices.  To seek to claim credit for providing five full-time additional staff for MABS is pathetic and bears no resemblance to the pressure that organisation has to bear.</P>
        <P>The Government seeks a clap on the back for the introduction of a statutory code of conduct in respect of mortgage arrears.  However, there is no reprimand for those who breach the code which seems to be voluntary in its operation.  It is all well and good for Government Senators to say that if the banks do such and such, we will introduce firmer controls, as we have reached that position already. The Government should do something more concrete to help people who find themselves in arrears on mortgage repayments.  As I stated earlier, the reality is that thousands of people are in that position.  The most recent figures on mortgage arrears for June 2008 state some 14,000 people are in that category.  It is estimated this figure is now greater than 30,000 and the ESRI forecasts that by next year some 200,000 people will be in negative equity on their homes.  This is a very disconcerting position, especially for any Irish person <Col N="732"/>because we have had a tradition for centuries of ownership of homes and property.  It goes to the very foundation of what makes us Irish because a major part of our struggle for independence and freedom was the fight for the land.  There is a sense that if one does not own the property in which one lives something is not right.  This is bred into our psyche.  The people have a great tradition of home ownership and rates of ownership are significantly higher than throughout the rest of the European Union and the world.</P>
        <P>This attachment to home is especially concerning for those families who face the possibility of repossession.  There has been a significant increase in the past 12 or 18 months in the number of cases coming before the courts and the number of repossessions.  By all accounts the figure will mushroom in the coming years.  The Fine Gael proposal seeks to remove the process from the confrontational sphere of open court.  It is very good and it should happen.</P>
        <P>The proposal does not mean people who made errors and who owe substantial amounts of money should be let off scot free.  However, it gives genuine people who, through no fault of their own, cannot find the money to meet mortgage repayments a degree of comfort to the effect that they will not face a team of barristers representing their financial institution across the floor of the court while trying to defend what, in many cases, is the only thing they own.  We are not discussing the protection of people who speculated in land or people who accumulated several houses or properties in other parts of the world.  At issue is the protection of the family home, which I believe is worth protecting.  The Government has done nothing in regard to protecting such people, the reason I have a significant difficulty with the current situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is my pleasure to return to the Upper House to contribute to this debate.  I compliment Senator McFadden on tabling the motion because it is timely and relevant to the current situation.  I thank her for her contribution and all those who have contributed to the debate.  Before I respond to the issues raised and go through generally what is at issue I make one or two specific comments.  Senator Norris is not here now but he covered a whole range of issues.  I refer to his comments on allotments in particular.  The practice is actively pursued in the Dublin area, especially by South Dublin County Council.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear the comments of Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Hanafin in respect of rewriting history.  I make no apologies for saying that with the benefit of hindsight the Government may well have made different decisions and pursued different policies.  However, the same also applies to the policies pursued by the Opposition.  With the benefit of hindsight they may have purported or supported different policies.  The Opposition should consider the Give it Back policy campaign which it ran in 2002 and some of its proposed changes in stamp duty.  If such policies had been followed they may have radically and adversely changed the problem we face.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people place a high value on home ownership and make great efforts to secure and retain their own home.  The Government has been supportive of this aspiration in good times and bad.  In the current economic situation, the Government&rsquo;s objective from both a social and an economic point of view is that home owners who lose their jobs should be assisted to retain their homes during their period of unemployment.  This is being done through the application of the new code of conduct in respect to mortgage arrears, support from the mortgage interest scheme under the supplementary welfare allowance system and the provision of advice on debt management through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</P>
        <P>Before setting out in more detail what the Government is currently doing for those facing debt difficulties, including the issue of mortgage arrears, I wish to address briefly the proposal <Col N="733"/>that a homeowner support scheme be incorporated into the NAMA legislation to support families facing repossession of their homes.  The housing market has been especially hard hit by the economic downturn.  It is a large and complex sector and I believe this proposal is unnecessary, overly complicated and would be costly to administer.  It would involve the State in further buying of loans from the banks and further increase taxpayers&rsquo; exposure.  I reiterate it is a priority of the Government to ensure as far as possible that difficulties of mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  Home repossession should be and generally has been the last resort for the lender.  I do not believe NAMA should be seen as the saviour of all ills.  Although the issue will not be dealt with through NAMA it does not mean it should not be dealt with or is not important.  Several measures may apply and I will outline these.</P>
        <P>The new code of conduct on mortgage arrears which was published by the Financial Regulator last February applies to all regulated lenders on a statutory basis and replaces an earlier voluntary code operated by the mainstream lenders.  The code applies only to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in Ireland.  I emphasise the code requires a lender to wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession such that there is no deadline looming after which this protection will expire.  In the case of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, which have been recapitalised by the State, this period has been extended to 12 months from the time arrears first arise, for the duration of the recapitalisation subscription agreement.</P>
        <P>The main features of the code include early recognition of problems, active management of arrears problems, examination of alternative solutions and repossession only as a last resort.  Lenders must distinguish between borrowers who are genuinely unable to pay and those who could pay some or all of the arrears but will not do so.  All genuine cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, which must explore with the borrower a number of alternate repayment measures.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has already undertaken an on-site themed inspection in respect of arrears and repossessions handling in selected mortgage lenders.  Further work on monitoring and enforcement of the code is ongoing.  Mortgage arrears continue to be closely watched.  While there are estimates of the overall number by different economists and commentators, based on various assumptions, the number of home owners actually shown, in returns to the Financial Regulator, to be in arrears for 90 days or more with institutions covered by the State guarantee is currently of the order of 15,000 to 16,000.</P>
        <P>The mortgage interest subsidy scheme under the supplementary welfare allowance system provides money, subject to a means test, towards the interest payments on a home mortgage.  The number of people assisted by the scheme has risen sharply from a low base and stands at in excess of 14,000 since the end of September.  More than 71% of those are in payment for less than a year and almost 2,300 are in payment for 18 months or more.  Applications to the scheme are regarded as lagging unemployment by some months and the rise in numbers is expected to continue for some time.  Funding for the scheme has been substantially increased for 2009.  Expenditure on mortgage interest supplement was &euro;12.2 million in 2007, &euro;27.6 million in 2008 and &euro;40 million was included in the 2009 supplementary budget.  However, this is expected to be exceeded and the final outturn for 2009 may be in the region of &euro;60 million.</P>
        <P>A review of the scheme is ongoing and it involves representation from the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a representative from the Office of the Financial Regulator.  The purpose of the review is to <Col N="734"/>examine how the scheme can better meet its objectives of catering effectively for those who need short-term assistance when they are unable to meet their mortgage interest payments, especially given the increased number of those in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  All aspects of the existing scheme are being examined and the group hopes to issue recommendations by the end of 2009.  The initial output from the review has been the issue of guidance notes on specific and operational issues for community welfare officers operating the scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government funds the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which provides valuable help to those in difficulty.  A new debt protocol agreement has been finalised with MABS and the Irish Banking Federation, IBF, that provides added reassurance for borrowers with the most difficult issues.  MABS is the main Government-funded service which provides assistance to people who are overly indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  It is important that people coping with debt difficulties take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance.  This can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties.  The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.  MABS now is dealing with increasingly complex debt situations in respect of clients who are presenting with multiple creditors and debts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country.  In addition, the MABS national telephone helpline is available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. from Monday to Friday at a LoCall number and budgeting and money management information also can be accessed 24 hours a day.  All MABS companies operate an appointment system for meeting clients.  Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and are dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the telephone helpline and to the MABS website in the first instance.  More than 90% of callers to the helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline adviser.  Approximately 10% of callers are referred to the local MABS for assistance.</P>
        <P>Historically, repossessions in Ireland have been low and while comprehensive statistics have never been kept, the Department of Finance has obtained reports from lenders covered by the State guarantee.  The total of legal repossessions of owner-occupier homes in this year to the end of September by those lenders is 20.  A comparison of repossession figures for IBF members, which are the mainstream lenders not including sub-prime, with figures from the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Council of Mortgage Lenders indicates that the repossession rates per 100,000 mortgages in the United Kingdom are 30 times higher than those in Ireland.  I note that the number of residential properties taken into possession by Irish Banking Federation members in 2008 was 99, and for the first half of 2009 the figure was only 70.  To put this in context, the equivalent figure in the United Kingdom was approximately 24,000 for the first half of 2009.  I understand there are approximately 11,000 mortgages in the United Kingdom for every 1,000 here.  Consequently, the position in Ireland is completely different.  These figures include a substantial number of voluntary repossessions and buy-to-let properties.  There were very few legal repossessions of owner-occupier houses.</P>
        <P>Media reports of repossession cases taken through the courts show that most involved sub-prime lenders which made mortgages available to borrowers who would not have been customers of the mainstream lenders, often because of perceived higher risks.  Cases in which borrowers stopped payment after a few months, failed to respond to repeated attempts to <Col N="735"/>contact them or even abandoned the house feature regularly in media reports of repossession cases before the courts.  However, it is clear that the scenario that some commentators put forward suggesting that thousands of ordinary families are at risk of being evicted from their homes very shortly is far from the truth.  These stories are unfairly and unnecessarily frightening for those who find themselves in difficulty.  The repetition of horror stories about a great wave of repossessions that is always just over the horizon can rightly be called irresponsible.  Members have been hearing these stories since this crisis began and yet the number of actual repossessions remains small a year later.</P>
        <P>All estimates of the extent of negative equity appear to be based on general economic assumptions but it is difficult to assess realistic price levels when property market activity remains low.  In any event, as being in negative equity does not change the level of mortgage payments, the problems it may cause are more long-term and should be considered on that basis.  The Financial Regulator has estimated that only a small proportion of borrowers with the covered institutions who are in negative equity are in arrears on their payments.</P>
        <P>The renewed programme for Government envisages an examination of ways to expand mortgage support measures and new measures to protect families having difficulties, including the introduction of new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments.  The renewed programme for Government also provides for the existing statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Banking Federation and the money advice and budgeting service on debt default to be reviewed further with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations, including for example, the use by banks and lenders of more flexible mechanisms to avoid foreclosure in appropriate circumstances.  These could include reduced rates, longer maturity dates, rolling-up of outstanding interest, a bank taking equity in a house or a bank taking ownership and leasing back the property to the resident with rent payments coming off the loan.  The renewed programme for Government also envisages that ways of expanding mortgage support measures will be examined with reference to the measures adopted in other jurisdictions</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s consultation paper, Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, provisionally recommends that the Irish enforcement system needs fundamental reform and that existing enforcement procedures should be replaced.  The proposed new system would be based on the introduction of a central debt enforcement office, which could build on the current arrangements and the removal of much but not all debt enforcement proceedings from the courts.The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s consultation paper recommends that a licensing system should be introduced for the debt collection industry and that subject to specified exceptions, all debt collectors and debt collection agencies should be obliged to hold a licence before operating a debt collection business.  All these recommendations will be fully examined in due course.  The renewed programme for Government envisages reform of debt enforcement in light of the deliberation of the Law Reform Commission that will include the regulation of debt collection agencies, a new system of personal insolvency regulations allowing for a statutory non-court-based debt settlement system and the establishment of a central debt enforcement office.</P>
        <P>The difficult and sensitive issue of persons who may be imprisoned owing to failure to fulfil a contract or contractual obligation is often raised in the context of debate on debt.  All Members are aware of recent media reports about large numbers of persons being imprisoned in respect of unpaid debts.  However, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that, at present, five persons have been imprisoned for failure to honour contract or contractual obligations since July of this year.  As a general point, the aim of the legislation with regard to enforcement <Col N="736"/>of court orders is to uphold contractual rights but with specific safeguards.  Despite what certain commentators might claim, a person cannot be imprisoned merely on the grounds of inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.</P>
        <P>In response to the High Court judgment on 18 June 2009 in the McCann case in which section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 was found to be incompatible with the Constitution, the Government provided a short Bill last July to remedy the situation on an interim basis.  The High Court found that the then section 6 did not require the debtor to be present in court, no provision was made for legal aid to an indigent debtor at risk of imprisonment and the reversal of the burden of proof meant that the debtor might be imprisoned simply because he or she had not proved that his or her failure to pay was not the result of wilful default.</P>
        <P>With the co-operation of this House, relevant new legislation in the form of the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 was enacted on 14 July 2009 and this ensures the court is in a position to hear from the debtor.  The Act amends sections 6 and 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.  It has the effect of ensuring that where a debtor does not appear, a court can issue a summons to ensure he or she appears and if he or she still fails to appear, can issue a warrant for his or her arrest.  This enables the court to hear the debtor and be satisfied as to whether the debtor has wilfully refused to pay and that all other steps possible have been taken to recover the debt.  The court will not imprison the debtor unless it is satisfied that he or she has the means to pay and may also postpone the execution of an imprisonment order until such time as it thinks just.  In addition, the court will inform a debtor of the risk of imprisonment and of his or her entitlement to apply for legal aid.  The new Act gives the court a clear power to vary the terms of the breached instalment order or alternatively to refer the parties for mediation.</P>
        <P>Members will appreciate that it was desirable to proceed as quickly as possible in view of the gap created by the High Court judgment.  The new Act takes account of the issues raised by the judgment and provides certainty for creditors and debtors whose interest is not best served by avoidance of their obligations.  The legislation makes it clear that imprisonment is a last resort and will facilitate the parties in addressing debt by every other means.</P>
        <P>The Government has measures in place to assist families in difficulty with their mortgages and to help them keep their homes.  The renewed programme for Government envisages further action to deal with problems.  Repossession, other than in high-risk sub-prime mortgages, remains rare.  The mortgage interest subsidy scheme is available for families in difficulty.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears provides borrowers with significant legal rights and makes repossession a last resort.  Moratoria of six months and 12 months for AIB and Bank of Ireland are in place.  MABS has been given extra resources to help those in difficulty with debt.  The renewed programme for Government envisages reform of debt enforcement, regulation of debt collection agencies and a new system for personal insolvency.  Imprisonment for debt-related reasons is now very rare and is governed by new, fairer, legal arrangements that protect borrowers who genuinely cannot pay.  I urge the Opposition to examine the Government&rsquo;s amended motion and consider supporting it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to share time with Senators Twomey and Mullen.  I found the reply of the Minister of State to be interesting and reassuring in ways.  I do not agree with the Government motion.  There could have been more movement towards the Fine Gael position.  I refer to the call for the Government to establish an alternative dispute resolution system to deal with cases where people are unable to repay debt.  The Minister of State could have <Col N="737"/>accepted this.  Members on the Government side of the House, including the Senator closest to the Minister of State at the moment, Senator MacSharry, have been seeking this and have raised it a number of times in this House.  The proposal has extraordinary merit.  As the Minister of State says, it is true that people will not be committed to prison without wilful neglect but that does not deal with the question of repossession.  I am reassured by some of the figures of the Minister of State on repossession.  I hope the media take note of this.  Last night, the presenter of a radio programme said he had never seen any repossessions in his time in court.</P>
        <P>I cannot agree with the Government amendment because the phrase &ldquo;notes NAMA is not a bailout for developers&rdquo; is true but the phrase &ldquo;extending it to homeowners would not provide them with relief&rdquo; is untrue.  NAMA could be extended beyond developers with their homeowners support scheme.  In the same way as NAMA will conclude at some stage with the Government owning equity in the banks, there is no reason why the State could not have shared equity in homes, as many local authorities do.  This proposition is dismissed and that is unfair to the Fine Gael position.  Fine Gael went to a lot of trouble to define a motion that is not harsh or condemnatory of Government.  It contains suggestions that could be examined.</P>
        <P>I figure that in the past three years, some 200,000 houses have been sold at an average price of &euro;300,000.  This amounts to some &euro;60 billion.  The total amount people paid for houses is very close to the figure for NAMA.  I am a supporter of NAMA unlike many Members on this side of the House.  There is no one suggesting anyone should go anywhere near this but the merit of the Fine Gael position is that it would give a personal balance to it and show the Government is providing support for ordinary people by recognising their problems.  There could have been a moment of hands across the House if we did so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for agreeing to sharing time.  Much of the motion is acceptable to most Members on both sides of the House.  It should have been incorporated into the Government&rsquo;s motion.  I am sad that this was not done.  The Minister of State presented figures to suggest there is no problem but significant problems exist.  The Minister of State should consider the percentage of take-home pay required to pay off mortgages.  Income is dropping, as is take-home income, and they must now pay a greater percentage of take-home pay in order to hold on to their houses.  To dismiss the idea that there is a problem is an insult to those who are trying to hold onto their homes.  There may be a small number of people going to jail or whose house has been legally repossessed but many have handed back the keys and many have reached an agreement with the banks.  Many are in dire straits and sacrificing other things, such as presents for their children and quality of life, in order to hold on to their house.  For the Minister of State to talk as if there is no problem is an insult to such people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government amendment contains no apology for the way the Government has landed the people in this mess.  When the banks were giving out 100% mortgages over 30 years and suggesting there should be no interest repayments, Deputy Bertie Ahern was saying that everything was grand and people should belt away.  The Government landed the people in this mess and gave them a false sense of security.  The Government should acknowledge that and try to do something for the thousands of people in this mess at the moment.  It should not be passed off as a bland issue that does not matter.</P><Col N="738"/>
        <P>NAMA is having a significant impact on this because the Government is up to its neck in trying to bail out the banks and stabilise the financial system.  The Government does not have funding to assist people in trouble right now because it is paying so much to stabilise the banks.  That should also be recognised in the contribution by the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing time.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I compliment the Fine Gael Senators on bringing forward this comprehensive motion.  The Government could have been more positively disposed to incorporating it in the response.  Without taking from the welcome figures the Government brought to our attention, I agree with the thrust of Senator Twomey&rsquo;s contribution.  The Government motion appears to minimise what remains a very unpleasant reality.  The Government notes that the rate of increase in arrears has moderated notably since the early months of this year.  That phrase is a giveaway because people are in dire straits.  To say the rate of increase has moderated is to minimise what is a very unpleasant situation for many people.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When thinking of this motion, I remembered the famous parable of the king, to whom the servant owed 10,000 talents.  The servant begged the king to forgive the debt rather than insisting on him selling his wife and children and the king relented.  The servant was ungrateful and, on going out, he met someone who owed him money, seized him by the throat and began to throttle him.  That reflects the position of the banks, who have had tremendous grace and favour shown to them.  The taxpayer is going bail for the banks and we all understand why this must take place.  The banks are not acting honourably towards people who find themselves in dire straits.  Today I read a report on the surcharges of interest that banks are imposing as penalties on people who are in arrears on mortgages.  It is necessary that we have measures to look after the small person in the same way as the more powerful interests in our society have been looked after in recent months.  I note what the Government said about the renewed programme for Government and examining the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It is time to examine the measures adopted in other jurisdictions, particularly individual voluntary agreements.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>In the past few days I spoke with a hard-working man who is self-employed.  He is doing his best to provide for himself and his family and he is in dire straits with mortgage repayments.  He just does not know what he will do if mortgage interest rates increase.  He asked me to speak in favour of measures to introduce individual voluntary arrangements to enable people like him to deal with their creditors.  They are doing their best to be honourable in repaying their debts but they find themselves in dire straits.  It is very important we work together and that the Government in particular gives a lead in looking after those good people and helping them in what must be very worrying times for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues on both sides of the House for their honest contributions.  However, I am utterly disappointed in the amendment, which is an insult to the people.  How dare Fianna F&aacute;il &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; anything.  The word &ldquo;commend&rdquo; is used four times in the amendment and &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; is used twice.  It is an outrage.  I am very angry about this.</P>
        <P>I asked about a number of issues.  I asked for a home-owner support scheme to be incorporated into NAMA; that is very reasonable.  I asked about the regulation of those terrorising and intimidating sub-prime debtors.  I asked about lenders being helped by a bank only when they get into arrears.  I asked about fixed-rate mortgage holders.  Senator Boyle then spoke about the renewed programme for Government and about how it &ldquo;envisages&rdquo; and how it will be <Col N="739"/>&ldquo;reviewed&rdquo;.  I am sick to the teeth of &ldquo;envisaging&rdquo;, &ldquo;reviewing&rdquo; and &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;.  The country and people cannot wait.</P>
        <P>As other speakers stated, the purpose of NAMA is to bail out the banks and it is correct to state it is not to bail out developers.  Why can we not support the poor honest to goodness people who were taken in by the Celtic tiger and the bubble to which the Government never put a halt?  Now, they find they will have to bear the brunt of losing their homes.  There has been a 100% increase in High Court repossession applications between 2007 and 2008.  Christmas is coming, and Senator MacSharry from Sligo spoke about a tsunami.  We are speaking about &ldquo;envisaging&rdquo;, &ldquo;reviewing&rdquo;, &ldquo;commending&rdquo; and &ldquo;welcoming&rdquo;.  Shame on you.</P>
