	<P>I have received notice from Senator Marc MacSharry that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the inequitable level of reduction in nursing places at St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Sligo.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the impending closure of St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital, Mulllingar.</P>
        <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Draft Planning and Development (Regional Planning Guidelines) Regulations &mdash; back from Committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, motion re Appointment of Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Statutory Provisions, to be take at the conclusion of No. 1, spokespersons having 15 minutes, all other Senators ten minutes and Senators may share time by agreement of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone in this country is appalled by the brutal murders we have just witnessed.  It is with a sense of shock and dismay that people hear the news bulletins once again full of stories of murder on the streets of Northern Ireland.  To see two young men, Mark Quinsey, who was 23 years of age, and Patrick Azimkar being brutally taken from their families in this callous way is outrageous.  It is a despicable act which must be condemned utterly and totally.</P>
        <P>Two soldiers who were simply ordering a pizza were shot as they lay injured on the ground and then shot again and murdered.  A 19 year old teenager and a 32 year old Polish man working for a pizza company were used as civilian shields.  To see two pizza delivery men who were simply trying to make a living being murdered like this and a statement describing them <Col N="486"/>as &ldquo;British collaborators&rdquo; is disgraceful.  There should be absolutely no ambiguity about condemning this murder for what it is.  These were murders, pure and simple.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no room for ambiguity, political ambiguity or any other explanation other than that this was a brutal murder.  To hear of Stephen Carroll, a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, being shot dead last night as he carried out his duty is equally appalling.  In a democracy every life must be valued.  There is no Irish life or British life; there is human life.  There are no terms such as &ldquo;collaborators&rdquo; or &ldquo;freedom fighters&rdquo;.  There are only decent people trying to do their jobs.  There are other people trying to take their lives.</P>
        <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I extend my sympathies and, I am sure, those of everyone in the House to the families of the soldiers and constable.  There can be no going back.  These lives cannot be in vain.  Those who are responsible must be apprehended and brought to justice as a priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, I regret No. 1, motion re Draft Planning and Development (Regional Planning Guidelines) Regulations, is not being debated.  I should have raised this matter with the Leader during the course of the week.  Will he reconsider it?  This issue has been raised by many Senators on both sides of the House.  For example, Senator MacSharry raised it three or four times and I raised it.  The Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security has considered planning and development legislation to accommodate and facilitate in particular tidal and similar developments beyond the foreshore.  I would like a discussion on that.  The metro and other infrastructural projects are going to plan and we should understand where we are going.</P>
        <P>Regarding the appalling series of events in the past three or four days in Northern Ireland, words fail us in these circumstances.  However, it is important that we state on the record that the people involved, no matter their perspectives or warped objectives, are enemies of the State, traitors to the common good and defiant of the will of the people as articulated in a series of referenda on both sides of the Border&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and supported by Governments in both jurisdictions.  Having spent 25 years trying to scramble our way out of chaos, we must stand together against those who attempt to plunge communities back into it.  It is not the time to focus on minor differences of opinion.</P>
        <P>We must take certain positive aspects from the events.  We must recognise that all political parties, North and South and in the UK, have a similar view in that they are all opposed to and have condemned the actions.  We should not get into further detail in that respect.  Those parties, elected by their communities, have articulated their views and there can be no gainsaying that fact.  We should send out a call to stand together irrespective of on which part of this island or the next island we live.  Protestant and Catholic, Unionist and Nationalist, Irish, Northern Irish and British should stand together in a solid phalanx against the evil influence that is trying to divert the course of peace on the island.  By the North and South working together, ordinary people can be given the confidence to know that there should be no shelter, support or cover for or rationalisation of these disgraceful acts of violence, in which two work<Col N="487"/>ing class English soldiers, a European pizza delivery man and a young man from County Westmeath who was working for the Police Service of Northern Ireland were shot by unthinking, unforgiving people.  It is not acceptable to anyone on any part of this island.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a graduate of the faculty of engineering and architecture at UCD, I am well aware of the problems facing many graduates in the construction industry.  They are borne out in today&rsquo;s figures for CAO applications, which show a considerable decrease in the number of people applying to study architecture and engineering in college.</P>
        <P>Last week, I called for a debate on the issue of apprentices in the construction industry.  Will the Leader extend that to a debate on the future of architecture and engineering students?  While we are in the depths of an economic downturn, it is important we do not lose sight of the fact that when we come out the other side we will need trained engineers, electricians and architects.  Will the Leader arrange a debate in the House on that issue as soon as possible?</P>
        <P>On a bright May morning ten months ago, I was lucky enough to attend the opening of the Battle of the Boyne commemorative site in Oldbridge in County Meath, which was attended by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the then First Minister, Reverend Ian Paisley.  We all believed on that day that there was a new dawn.  The banks of the Boyne never looked as bright and a future of peace and prosperity beckoned.  The events of the past 48 to 72 hours in the North, however, have filled us all with despair and disgust.  I do not know from where the people in question believe they are receiving support as it is clear they have no support from anyone in this country.  Their acts are traitorous and treasonous.  Apart from passing on our best wishes to the families who have lost their loved ones, I guarantee that everything will be done on this side of the Border to ensure their killers are brought to justice.  Those people have no role to play in the future of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, perhaps Members should have a debate on planning and development as notwithstanding that the motion before the House is to be taken without debate, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, this is an important issue.  I have called for such a debate previously and when considering the future, in which there obviously will be much less construction, it will be important to consider the issues pertaining to planning, perhaps with a view to relaxing certain restrictions in rural and regional Ireland in particular.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on public procurement.  I acknowledge that Ireland has obligations, as a full member of the European Union, in respect of participating in the various tendering processes and in advertising any public works in the <i>EU Journal</i>.  However, we are in extraordinary times at present and such times require extraordinary measures.  I ask for a debate pertaining to public procurement with a view to favouring Irish tenders where possible or, in so far as is possible, to go back to the most appropriate of Irish tenders within groups of international tenders.  It never has been more important to try to keep at home a certain level of expenditure and investment.  I refer to the smallest of items such as, for example, the uniforms worn here in Leinster House.  Although they are manufactured in Belgium at present, they were manufactured in the west for many decades before that.  When such items come up for renewal, perhaps we should consider buying Irish to the extent that our European constraints allow.  Moreover, I saw a report this morning to the effect that the HSE sources all of its bacon and pork products from outside this jurisdiction.  Perhaps there are ways in which this issue can be examined.  Our money would be best spent in supporting employment within this jurisdiction at present and Members should play a role in trying to enhance such measures.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>I wish to demonstrate my complete and unequivocal support for the condemnation of the horrific murders in the north of Ireland.  As Senator Fitzgerald noted, there is no British life or Irish life; there is human life, which says it all.  Members must be resolute and completely united in their condemnation of such recklessness towards a peace process that has been a great success.  There can be no substitute for peace and the murders and criminality that have been carried out over the past three days are to be condemned by all who call themselves reasonable people in these modern times.  We have moved on from the dark days of violence of the past and it is only through democratic means that we will grow our ambitions, whether towards a united Ireland or otherwise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice of condemnation regarding the callous murders carried out in Northern Ireland in recent days.  They were outrageous and despicable acts, in which two young British soldiers and one police officer were mown down and taken away from their families and the communities they were protecting.  No Member will ever understand the mind-set of the criminals who carried out such callous murders.  It has been an affront to the peace process, the political system and the civilisation of our country and Northern Ireland.  I am sure the perpetrators have not carried out these acts on behalf of any right-minded person in this country or in Northern Ireland.  They certainly have no mandate to do what they did.</P>
        <P>Members should again acknowledge the great work that communities and political parties, both North and South, have done to achieve the peace process.  Moreover, the work they continue to do on a daily basis should never be underestimated and Members on this side of the House never do so.  Members also must remind themselves of and acknowledge the great work of the men and women who work on the front lines in both Northern Ireland and southern Ireland to keep the peace and protect ordinary civilians.  I refer to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Irish Army and the British army.  It is correct that all political parties should condemn these murders because that is the political message Members must send out.  They should not be protected or harboured in any way and I ask the Leader to send such a message from Seanad &Eacute;ireann today to these criminal thugs, which is all they are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share in the condemnation of the murder of the two soldiers and the police officer in the north of Ireland.  I am particularly cognisant that it has been those who brought us the atrocity of Omagh who have started this cycle of violence, which must be ended immediately.  In discussing this issue, we must emphasise that a knee-jerk retaliatory reaction would only exacerbate the problem.  These attacks represent a blight on the body politic, a blight which has a particular resonance for the Irish because it reminds us of the potato Famine of the mid-1800s and the terrible events that followed.  What these gangster terrorists are attempting to do represents a similar attack on the body politic.  However, there is no going back.  Peace is the only way forward and these events will not deter any of us in our resolution to go forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I had intended to raise several issues today.  However, this is such a tragically important day that I will, like other Members, confine myself to the tragic events in Northern Ireland.  I agree entirely with Senator Hanafin that these people are gangsters.  Before coming into the Chamber, I heard a speaker on RTE radio claim they are not gangsters.  What else are they?  They operate in armed gangs to subvert the democratically expressed wish of the people of this island, North and South, and they care not a damn for the law or for family, decency or anything else.  In my book at least, whatever about the views of callers to Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio show, they are gangsters.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P>As Senator Hanafin said, these tragic events constitute yet another poisoned gift from the people who gave us the Omagh bombing.  These are people who, in the words of the great songwriter Paul Brady in his wonderful song, &ldquo;The Island&rdquo;, are &ldquo;still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone&rdquo;.  They have nothing positive to offer, only death.  It is as though the economic disaster we are all trying to face was not enough, they have to add murder, grief and misery.  As an Irishman and a representative of this noble House of Parliament, it is my view that they have dishonoured and sullied the name of Ireland throughout the world.  Their actions have brought shame on the country and will have negative political, economic and cultural consequences for us all.</P>
        <P>We do not know who the perpetrators are but we know some of their characteristics.  The first is arrogance.  They have decided, with no standing whatever, that they can decide who is a legitimate target.  How are they legitimate?  Why are they targets?  Who gave them this right?  Then they appoint themselves as executioners.  They certainly do not obey the laws of war in this regard; there is no chivalry there.  Wounded people lying on the ground are finished off with an extra shot.  It is an appalling situation.  Another characteristic of these people is that they are totally lacking in imagination.  They apparently cannot imagine the grief that will be caused to the families of these young people.</P>
        <P>We were all so hopeful prior to the events of recent days.  Only last week we celebrated the taking down of the bomb-proof shutters from the Ulster Hall so that it could be opened up as a place where people could listen to music and celebrate.  I presume it will now be closed.  Once again we are hearing phrases, such as &ldquo;widespread condemnation&rdquo;, we hoped never again to hear.  I am sorry to say that those responsible for these attacks are completely indifferent to such condemnation.  They are stupid people whose stupidity is shown by the fact that their actions are completely counterproductive.  Why in every generation must ordinary, decent people, from both communities and on both sides of the Border, pay the price of the education of these moral imbeciles?  They will eventually learn and will eventually say their actions were a mistake and were not worthwhile.  In the meantime, however, decent people will have to pay for all the suffering they cause.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an element of posturing in some of the condemnation we have heard.  The Real IRA and Continuity IRA will do this again.  They will kill someone else the week after this and the following month.  We will be standing around here hand wringing.  While Senators Fitzgerald and MacSharry speak for me on the moral issue, we should move on because we have a moral obligation to take our responsibilities.  The Chinese have a proverb that says you cannot stop the blackbirds of evil flying over your head but you can stop them making a nest in your hair.  We cannot affect what happens in Northern Ireland by hand wringing and condemnation but we can affect the Republic.</P>
        <P>We should have done more in peace time to mend community tensions.  The reaction to the killings was not uniformly fast and condemnatory of a murderous attack on human beings.  There was a 14-hour delay from Sinn F&eacute;in, which was caused politically by the SDLP taking a green position on the activation of the special reconnaissance unit.  This drove Sinn F&eacute;in into taking a 100% green position on the 50% green position.  The result was that Sinn F&eacute;in was paralysed politically in the aftermath of the killing at the weekend.  That is neglecting the peace process on the part of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and ourselves for not pressurising them to mind the peace rather better.  Dr. Johnson said that a man is to keep his friendships in good repair and we must keep the peace process in good repair.  It was not kept in repair; we wiped our hands of it.</P><Col N="490"/>
        <P>I ask Senators to stop posturing and to join with me in calling on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do what can be done.  From a security point of view, we have major emergency powers legislation available.  I will not mention the &ldquo;i&rdquo; word because Senators are already preparing their speeches about how we should not ratchet it up and we must not overreact.  I expect to read an exclusive interview with the Real IRA next Sunday explaining it all away.  I have been through all this in my lifetime, with the bleeding heart stuff and the apologias.  To those who are preparing speeches about not ratcheting it up, we have a moral obligation to shut down the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA on this side of the Border.  We can do so because we know their names.  The police and security forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na know their names and there are only 100 of them.  They use safe houses, they have friends and relations and we can shut them down.  We can use emergency powers so that they cannot run from the North.  That would at least free up the chief constable in Northern Ireland to look after the security situation there as best he can.  This will be borne on the bodies of ordinary policemen, Catholic and Protestant, over the next months because they will die.  Many more of them will die.</P>
        <P>We must do two things, first of all by shutting down the security situation.  I will not use the &ldquo;i&rdquo; word but I remind Members that internment never failed in the Irish Republic.</P>

	<P>It worked in 1922, it worked in 1939 and it worked in 1956.  It failed in Northern Ireland but never here.  We should put it to Sinn F&eacute;in that in the upcoming by-elections, unless they stop using weasel words and unless they come out cleaner and faster in their condemnation, they will pay a political price in the Republic for their weasel words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I do not believe for one second that anyone in this House was guilty of posturing and I ask Senator Harris to withdraw that suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A point of order must be on procedure.  The Senator has already contributed.</P>

	<P>Senator, please.  I am calling Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I come from a Border county and have three young boys in school in a Border town.  We breathed a collective sigh of relief ten years ago when the peace process was unveiled and the events of recent days have been greatly traumatic for those of us in the Border area, as they have been for the rest of the country.  It has been particularly traumatic and disturbing in our area that these atrocious, reprehensible murders have taken place.</P>
        <P>Those who perpetrated the murders do not have a democratic mandate.  On top of this, they do not have the right to appoint themselves arbiters of the country&rsquo;s destiny or executioners.  They do not have this right in moral law nor do they have a democratic basis for that.</P>
      
       <P>There must be significant co-operation between the police forces on the two sides of the Border to deal with the issue.  We must literally seal the Border.  I ask the Leader of the House to speak immediately with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after this session to ensure that even if there is disruption, every cross-Border movement is checked.  The Border <Col N="491"/>should be checked and sealed off.  There should be very rigorous support of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the activities of the police force in Northern Ireland.  There should be no ambiguity or lack of co-operation in the matter.  There must be an open, transparent and high level of police activity on this side of the Border.  Will the Leader specifically ensure that happens and is visible in the coming days?</P>

        <P>My next remarks are distinct from those of my learned colleague, Senator Harris, for whom I have great personal regard.  To be very fair to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, as I was coming up today in the car the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, very unequivocally condemned the murders and asked for co-operation with the PSNI, which should be welcomed.  It was a very clear statement.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We need a very visible, open and outward sign of police support on this side of the Border and police activity along the Border.  People must be apprehended.  In so far as Senator Harris is correct that the names are known to police, there should be follow-up activity and people&rsquo;s movements should be checked.  A huge effort should be made on the part of this State.  It is a crucial time in the history of the State and morality, Christian and religious ethics and the social and economic future of our country depend on this.  Will the Leader seek a specific meeting with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask for that level of activity?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>When the peace process was brokered &mdash; we commend all those who participated in that &mdash; how many people said at the initial stages that it was not possible, that divisions were too deep-seated and that agreement was not possible?  Thanks be to God those people were wrong.  When Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, who were at opposing ends of the political spectrum, came together to form a government in Northern Ireland, every right-thinking person on all sides, North and South, heaved a sigh of relief.</P>
        <P>What happened in the murder of those three people and the attack on the two innocent people delivering pizzas was reckless.  The operative word is &ldquo;wreck&rdquo; as that is what those people are trying to do; they are trying to wreck the peace process.  It is up to every right-thinking man and woman of all persuasions, irrespective of which part of this island they live on, to do whatever they can in encouraging our security forces, the Garda and the Army on this side and the relevant forces on the other side of the Border.</P>
        <P>This act has served nothing.  The three people who were murdered were reared by mothers.  They were human beings and there is no case whatever to be made for their murder.  It was a heinous and dastardly act, and no words of mine could describe how evil those people must be to have conceived such a reckless act of disregard for human life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join in the sentiments expressed by my colleagues in condemning the outrages of the past few days in Northern Ireland.  We have often had debates about terrorism and the need to understand its causes, while never condoning the acts of terrorists.  In truth, it is very difficult to have that debate in this context.  It is impossible to understand that after all the painstaking work of the peace process and having achieved the current arrangements, which are an honest and hard won expression of the aspirations of the different communities in Northern Ireland.  In light of all that, it is difficult to understand why this is going on and how it can go on.</P>
        <P>In truth, we need to contemplate the reality that there is a battle between good and evil in our world.  The line between good and evil runs down through the heart of every person.  When we say these people are sick psychopaths, we do not use such words to try to find a term of abuse for them but to try to sincerely diagnose the problem in as objective a manner as possible. <Col N="492"/> All in this House feel united about the need to do whatever is necessary, whatever is in our power to do, but we also feel, if we are honest about it, a deep sense of impotence because we know there is no easy solution, given all that has been done.  However, we know we must redouble our efforts to be united in the face of such evil.  We must work to educate our young people on all sides of the Border that this road leads nowhere.</P>
        <P>I fully commend what my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, said about the need to keep that Christian ethical core at the heart of the debate because that is the tradition we all share on this island.  We need to delve into that now as we seek to respond to such evil and prevent it from happening.  We also pray and hope, to paraphrase the words of O&rsquo;Casey, that the hearts of stone of these perpetrators could be taken and replaced with hearts of flesh.</P>
        <P>I request a debate on a more mundane but nonetheless important matter, that of education.  The National Competitiveness Council published a report today.  It indicates some important points and some challenging points.  It calls, for example, for the introduction of bonus CAO points for mathematics and new efforts to ensure students are rewarded for taking higher level mathematics.  It stresses the importance of computer and information technology in our schools, something I have stressed here previously in calling for a trebling of the budget for ICT in schools.  It stresses teacher quality and the need to recognise outstanding teachers and to reward them through the promotion system.</P>
        <P>I attended when an interesting contribution was given by Mr. Don Thornhill, chairman of the National Competitiveness Council, in his address to the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals the other day.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">He made one challenging and somewhat provoking observation when he suggested &mdash; as this report also suggests &mdash; that cutting class size will not necessary benefit students.  That is something to which the Irish National Teachers Organisation is profoundly opposed.  While not denying that this is a provoking statement, it is something we need to reflect on and we need to have this debate.  As we face into hard choices and some of them will be nasty choices around cuts, we need to have an honest debate about what is working well, what is working badly and the matters that must be prioritised and those that should not be prioritised.</P>

	<P>I support the other strong voices of Senators in the Chamber who condemned the brutal attacks and brutal murders in Northern Ireland at the weekend.  We have become so accustomed to peace in the North of our country that we could not believe our ears when we heard of those murders.  Even this morning when I heard at 7 a.m. that there was another murder, I thought that one of the men who was injured on Saturday&rsquo;s night&rsquo;s attack might have died.  I could not believe that there was a second attack.</P>
        <P>In condemning these brutal murders, I commend Senator Harris on his contribution.  I do not suppose there is any other Senator who has the same experience in regard to Northern Ireland as he has.  It is important to point out, and I say this as a member of the British-Irish <Col N="493"/>Interparliamentary Body, that since I began serving on it seven years ago, we do not talk about the Troubles in the North; we examine other issues in terms of building the North and moving forward with the peace process.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement will be 11 years old next month.  Perhaps Senator Harris was right, perhaps we had taken it for granted and had taken our eye off the ball when we should have been protecting and minding it.  Perhaps this is a wake up call and we will protect and mind it again.  It is interesting to hear the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, and the Taoiseach saying that no small group, regardless of how powerful it is, will be allowed to ruin what we have fought so hard to gain.  Many lives were lost in trying to gain our peace process.  A Senator on the opposite side has said there is no mandate for these people.  I ask the Leader to send a clear message and let that small group know there is no shelter for them on this island, North or South.  I agree with Senator Hanafin that there is no going back.  There is nothing to go back to but more death, hurt and pain.  There is an onus on everyone in this Chamber today to expose those who have carried out these brutal murders.  I ask whether it would be in order for the Leader to write a letter on behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann passing on our condolences to the families of the three murdered security officers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully endorse what Senator Harris said and I agree with him about posturing.  The priority is that these people should be apprehended and brought to justice.  The Continuity IRA has stated that as long as there is British involvement in Ireland its members will continue to murder people.  The Senator is correct that there will be further murders.  These people seem to attach no value to life.  Even after the British soldiers had been shot, they were shot again.  I have a 23 year old son who is the light of my life and I cannot imagine what it must be like for the poor mothers of those murdered.  They were scheduled to go on a tour of duty that they thought would be dangerous but they never got that far.  They were shot in cold blood on our soil, in our country.  I abhor the idea that they can send a coded message to a newspaper stating that as long as there is British involvement in this country they will continue.  We need to be very firm on the notion that there might be safe houses or any succour for these thugs in our country.  It is a message that should go out loud and clear from this House.</P>
        <P>Other than that I do not know what else we can do.  We must condemn the action.  I agree with Senator Harris that it took a long time for the so-called political representatives to come out.  They did not deny it, they said they condemned it, but they did not say anything about the poor unfortunate pizza delivery lads.  The implication was that they were aiding and abetting the people in the North.  It is an absolute crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues in condemning the brutal murders in the North.  I extend my sympathy to the families of those murdered and injured.  The exercise is purely to derail the political process and put down a trap to lure the British troops back on to the streets.  As many have said, there is no going back.  As Senator Harris said, if the names are known, and they are known, they should be rounded up.  There must be co-operation on each side by the police.  Those people must be rounded up.  There is no going back and that is reflected.  I do not know what more I can say.  Those people are a different breed.  They will not listen to what we say today.  They are not interested in what we are saying.  They would have a big laugh at that.  We must take action, and the only way to do that is through police and military co-operation North and South.  That is the only way forward.  I endorse many of the points raised by Senator Harris this afternoon.</P><Col N="494"/>
        <P>On another issue, I call for a debate on the reform of education and training, which was mentioned in today&rsquo;s report of the National Competitiveness Council.  It is a very good report which highlights areas where new courses will perhaps have to be introduced to reflect the skills shortage, and new ideas will be needed in regard to how we attract young people to become more involved in mathematics, science, investment and technology.  As has been said, while the lack of input into CAO courses in engineering and architecture is a sign of the times, we must not deflect from future growth in employment in that area, which must happen.</P>
        <P>The report is worthy of debate in the House on how we move forward and how we implement its good aspects.  I ask the Leader to fit this into the agenda at some time so we can debate the report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with colleagues in condemning in the strongest possible terms what has happened in the past few days in Northern Ireland.  I agree with Senator Harris that in the peace process in the past ten, 15 and even 20 years, if one goes back to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, words have been very important in progressing matters.  However, we have moved past words and in terms of dealing with these thugs; it is actions we need to put into place.  I agree with Senator Harris that there needs to be a relentless pursuit of these people and there can be no hiding place for them on this side of the Border.  Other Senators have spoken of a sense of impotence, to which Senator Mullen referred, and said we cannot be effective.  We can be effective if we insist no shelter is given to these people.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to his sons who are in primary school.  I remember being in primary school in the 1980s and listening to the radio in the morning, I would hear the news about who had been shot or blown up the night before in Northern Ireland.  Like everybody, I hoped we would never again have to turn on the radio in the mornings and listen to what had happened the night before.</P>
        <P>The arrogance of these people to think they can determine who are legitimate targets &mdash; they are our political legitimate targets and we should leave no stone unturned in their pursuit.  The stupidity, short-sightedness and counter-productiveness of what they are doing is evident.  The people on this island have moved on so much in the past 15 years and this is an attempt to drag us back to the dark days of the 1980s in particular, which I remember from my youth.</P>
        <P>I want to add my voice, as that is what I can do in this Chamber, but I know we can do other things outside the Chamber.  We need to ensure that the powers currently in place, to which Senator Harris referred, are examined and used to ensure these thugs do not bring us back to those terrible days we thought were behind us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the condemnation of these heinous murders that have taken place in recent days.  As a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, with colleagues from both Houses, I have had many meetings with Sir Hugh Orde and other members of the security forces, both north and south of the Border.  I found Sir Hugh Orde a very sensible man who knows what is happening.  He warned us at our last meeting that dissident republicans were very much to the fore and were capable of carrying out the crimes that have been carried out in recent days.  He is entitled to get every assistance from forces in England, Northern Ireland and here in the Republic to root out those people.  They have no mandate from the people and they have no right to do what has been done in their name in recent days, which was terrible.</P><Col N="495"/>
        <P>There is a saying in the west, and perhaps in other parts, that the darkest hour is before the dawn.  On television last Sunday I saw people of different religious persuasions coming together after their Sunday services to pray, condemning the murder of those two young soldiers.  That was amazing and some years ago it would not have happened.  One hopes the communities will stay together now.  I have no doubt that people have information concerning those who committed those crimes and they should give that information to the police and security authorities in Northern Ireland.  If they are in the Republic that information should be given over and those people should be rounded up and brought to justice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other colleagues, I join in expressing my outright condemnation of the brutal murders in Northern Ireland over the weekend and yesterday, and I express my sympathies to the families of those killed and injured in such a horrible way.  We all thought we had gone back in time when we first heard the news.  I heard it late on Saturday night and thought I was listening to an archive programme.  It was so shocking and appalling to hear again the words: &ldquo;Two soldiers have been killed in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  It brought home to all of us how fragile and precious the peace process is and how we may have come to take it for granted in recent years.</P>
        <P>Along with colleagues from this House and the other House, I have the privilege of serving on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a wonderful privilege to serve alongside Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the formation of this committee was a most historic development.  It brings home to us the importance of these types of initiatives in preserving the peace process.  In recent months we learned just how fragile our prosperity is but we thought that even if we were not leaving prosperity to our children at least we were leaving them a peaceful Ireland, one that we were creating and developing for them.  Now we know both peace and prosperity are equally fragile and precious.  I join again with others in expressing condemnation and the sympathy we all feel.</P>
        <P>I do not believe this is empty posturing.  It is important that we all speak out.  They may be only words but words have been hugely important both in stirring up hatred and anger in Northern Ireland and in creating peace and dampening down sectarian motivation.  We cannot underestimate the power of language.  It is an important and powerful gesture for us all today, on both sides of the House, to express universal condemnation of these awful attacks.  If there is one sign of hope it lies in the response of the communities in Northern Ireland and in the incredible outpouring of sympathy and support for the families of those killed and injured.  That is hopeful and optimistic and I believe we can build on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues, I join in condemning the brutal murders and injuries in the North of Ireland.  It is very regrettable that we are here today in this fashion.  Like others, I can remember the early days when there were recurring murders and injuries.  Along with many other genuine Irish people, I was hurt greatly to see this regularly.</P>
        <P>We have come a long way by negotiation and discussion.  What happened this weekend could have been prevented if there had been a sharing of knowledge and intelligence, not only between the security forces but by the public giving information to the security forces.  I plead with anybody who has information on what happened to let the security forces on either side of the Border know it.  This is important for the future.  In the past when people advised the security forces of proposed actions they prevented death and injury such as we witnessed this weekend.  It is only by the sharing of intelligence that we will make progress.</P>
        <P>I support my colleague, Senator Ann Ormonde, in her call on the Leader for a debate about the report on education and training.  As we move into the arena of economic renewal and the <Col N="496"/>smart economy, it is all the more important to incentivise students to take on academic interests such as those mentioned by Senator Ormonde, for instance, higher mathematics, physics and science.</P>
        <P>I welcome the beginning of the process of consideration of the Goodbody report on the taxi industry.  There are a number of ills in the industry which urgently require addressing.  When the process is completed and following discussions with the industry representatives and with the Joint Committee on Transport and the Minister for Transport, I ask that the House be given an opportunity to debate the amendments to the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice to the unequivocal condemnation of the killings in Northern Ireland.  We are all shocked by these events which are a blast from the past and is something we thought we had left behind.  The people killed are Mark Quinsey, 23 years of age, Patrick Azimkar, 21 years of age, and Constable Stephen Paul Carroll, 48 years of age, and one can imagine the misery that has been created for their immediate families.</P>
        <P>I have some inkling of this because my own grandfather was an RIC sergeant who was shot in an ambush at Tourmakeady in 1922.  I know from my own experience the effect this had on my father and it goes down through the generations.  We thought after all the killings in Northern Ireland that time would heal and we would leave this all behind us and yet here we have to confront the same situation again.</P>
        <P>I will make three points to show what we can do.  There is no doubt that in the atrocities of the more distant past, the people responsible were seen as heroes.  The atrocities of the Troubles were sanitised for the purposes of securing peace and the Good Friday Agreement.  However, there are actions we can take.  We can condemn such atrocities and this is what the House is doing today.  We can condemn the callousness of shooting pizza delivery people because it is beyond contempt.  With regard to co-operation on security measures and police co-operation in a European-wide context, we have held back from co-operation, from signing up to particular measures at European level, because of sensitivity with regard to Northern Ireland.  The issue of hot pursuit is something which is adopted by all other member states and recognised in terms of mutual co-operation between their security and police services.  We do not accept that principle here because of sensitivity towards Northern Ireland.  We have to be honest and face up to the problems we have.  The political context is different now and it allows for such co-operation.  If that was the one single issue that came out of this, this Government could sign up to those type of security measures which are a general feature of police co-operation in the European Union.</P>
        <P>I refer to the little bit of anti-British propaganda, whether at football matches or otherwise and politicians can slip into this mode.  There is a tendency to have that jibe at Britain and Britishness and that type of anti-British propaganda is what gives some comfort to those who perpetrate these atrocities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course we all condemn these senseless and mindless acts which have resulted, sadly and unfortunately, in the murders of an innocent policeman and two innocent soldiers, all lawfully going about their business in the North of Ireland.  We are all in <Col N="497"/>agreement on this matter although we may express ourselves differently.  Some are more passionate than others, as indicated by Senator Bacik.  Language is, of course, important, but perhaps some of us do not express ourselves with the same depth of feeling and passion as others.  That is natural, however, since there are different styles and we are all human.  It does not in any way lessen our feeling of condemnation and our duty to do what is right. </P>
        <P>I honestly say to Senator Harris that we keep our friendships in good repair and that is the way we shall go forward, of course.  Since we are, unfortunately, entering this sad new era which, hopefully, will pass quickly, perhaps the Leader might arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the Seanad so we might have a debate and receive an update in this regard.  I do not accept we are not doing everything in the South to apprehend these people whom I believe to be few in number.  Perhaps their identity is known and the intelligence is good and it would be good to hear from the Minister in this regard.</P>
        <P>In fairness, Sir Hugh Orde praised the Garda recently for helping and assisting so much, particularly in regard to the prevention of appalling assassinations in Castlewellen.  I should like if the Leader could arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address this House.</P>

I will pass on Senator Harris&rsquo;s suggestions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the conclusion of today&rsquo;s Order of Business. </P>
        <P>I wish to join with all Senators in condemning in the strongest possible terms the murders of the two young soldiers, 21 year old Patrick Azimkar and 23 year old Mark Quinsey at the barracks on Saturday night as well as the murder of Police Constable Stephen Carroll, which took place last night.  It is with a deep sense of sadness and revulsion that we learned of these despicable murders.  We had all hoped the senseless violence which was utterly rejected by the people of this island, North and South, was a thing of the past.  Tragically, a tiny group of people is attempting to undermine the peace and stability we have been experiencing here for the past decade.  They cannot and will not be permitted to undermine the will of the Irish people on this island and the peace we have worked so hard for.  This has been the greatest political achievement in living memory on foot of the Good Friday Agreement.  We must stand in solidarity to ensure that violence and hatred are not allowed to triumph over peace and democracy.</P>
        <P>On behalf of this House I extend our sympathy to the bereaved families of the men who have died and those who have been injured as well as to their friends and colleagues in the army and Police Service of Northern Ireland.  I look forward to seeing those responsible being swiftly brought to justice for these despicable crimes.</P>
        <P>The events depicted on television screens in the past three days, as Senator Bacik said, would make one believe one was watching a programme such as &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;.  I shall certainly pass on the strong views expressed by all Senators, particularly those of Senator Harris, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as regards what has taken place.  As Senator John Carty said, the sight of the three congregations coming together on Sunday and showing the people of Ireland the maturity that now exists in Northern Ireland has served as a shining example and hopefully will increase our determination to help in any way we can. <Col N="498"/> There is no safe haven in the South of Ireland and we want that message to go out loud and clear.  I wish the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces all the support we can give them.</P>
        <P>As we discuss the new appointment of probably one of the greatest Irishmen ever to serve the State, Mr. Dermot Gallagher, and what he did for the Good Friday Agreement, and the enormous respect he has earned both nationally and internationally, I look forward to the contributions from Senators in that regard this afternoon.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty in arranging a debate on planning, as called for by a number Senators.  Senator MacSharry has called for an urgent debate in this regard, and I believe it is timely.  Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; time will be coming up the week after next and we shall be including issues that colleagues have brought to my attention in relation to matters pertaining to planning issues, which are not assisting those who wish to develop and create employment against the background of the present economic difficulties.  They are seeking the help of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as regards simple understandings in relation to the Act.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan called for a debate on students, apprenticeships and all of these areas, particularly in relation to the construction industry.  As I said last week, I have no difficulty having such a debate.  Senator MacSharry highlighted some of the problems of protecting jobs in times of economic difficulty and referred to contracts for the HSE going outside the country.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have to lead by example on what may be done to assist all lines of industry and employment, particularly in times such as these.  The Senator stressed the issue of public procurement in particular and I have no difficulty in arranging a debate on these issues at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen, Ormonde and Callely called for a debate on education in light of the National Competitiveness Council report, which is published today.  I look forward to allocating time for this.  As I said during the debate on intellectual property with the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, the week before last, serious consideration should be given as a matter of urgency to increasing the points for mathematics and science in the leaving certificate.  This should be done as a matter of urgency because the American Chamber of Commerce has warned industry that we may not have the graduates available for meaningful employment if they do not posses the standards required in mathematics and science.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on the Goodbody report on the up-to-date situation on taxis.  I know he has always been very committed on this issue and I have no difficulty about time being allocated.</P>

	<P el="0">Before I speak to the motion on the appointment of the chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, I wish to place on the record of this House my sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of Constable Stephen Paul Carroll of the Police Service of Northern Ireland who was murdered last night in Craigavon.  His murder is not only a denial of his individual human dignity and right to life but it is an assault on the Irish people as a whole who have, in voting for the Good Friday Agreement, rejected violence, endorsed the principle of consent and unequivocally declared democratic means to be the only means of political discourse on this island.  </P>
        <P>Not unnaturally Members of this House will welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s assertion that the perpetrators will be hunted down and brought to justice for this appalling act, as will those responsible for the terrible murders of the two British soldiers in recent days.</P>
        <P>Following the untimely death of Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh, the Government at its meeting of 3 February decided to nominate Mr. Dermot Gallagher to replace Mr. Justice Haugh as chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P>On my own behalf and that of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Government, I place on the record of this House our sympathy for Mr. Justice Haugh&rsquo;s family and friends.  He was the founding chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  He worked energetically to get the commission up and running.  He was not satisfied that it should perform its tasks in a perfunctory manner and was tireless in his efforts to ensure that the staff of the commission worked to the highest standards.  He was known at the Bar Council for his learning.  He put that learning and his discernment to good use and to Ireland&rsquo;s credit during his time at the administrative tribunal of the United Nations.  His friends and colleagues will, no doubt, however, miss him most for his engaging company and great good humour.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 reformed the legislative basis of policing in Ireland.  Its overall thrust was to reform policing in a manner that enhances the accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while at the same time provide it with greater independence in the fulfilment of its role.  As Accounting Officer, the Garda Commissioner is now responsible for expenditure of the Garda Vote, for which he is directly answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Responsibility for the employment of the civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Act also provides for the Garda Inspectorate which acts as a driver of efficiency and effectiveness for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it benchmarks the performance of the force against comparable police services and international best practice.</P>
        <P>One of the most significant and most important changes instituted by the 2005 Act was the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  In particular, it replaced its <Col N="500"/>forerunner, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board.  The members of the board over the years and all the staff who served there are to be thanked for their commendable work.  The replacement of the board is in no way a reflection of the quality of their efforts, rather it is recognition of the weaknesses in the legislation under which they operated.</P>
        <P>As the body charged with handling complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the ombudsman commission is empowered to independently investigate complaints against Garda members.  It has also been conferred by the Act with policing powers of arrest and detention.  The commission&rsquo;s role and values are summed up in the words contained in its official logo, that is, &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo;, &ldquo;independence&rdquo; and &ldquo;impartiality&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The ombudsman commission has been in operation since May 2007 and has received just over 5,000 complaints to date, 3,539 of which have been finalised.</P>
        <P>I know there is much interest in the work of the ombudsman commission and, in particular, in certain cases it has dealt with, as well as other cases it is currently pursuing.  However, as it is a fully independent body it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific facts or other elements of any particular case handled by it.</P>
        <P>With regard to staffing matters, there are 98 sanctioned posts in the ombudsman commission, not including the three commissioners and four seconded Garda Superintendents.</P>
        <P>The ombudsman commission has invested heavily in the training and development of its staff.  In that area it has worked extensively with the University of Portsmouth and King&rsquo;s Inns in developing state-of-the-art training for its investigative staff in particular.  Its budget allocation for 2009 is over &euro;11 million, which represents a significant investment on the part of the State in the commission and also reflects the importance of the functions that are involved.</P>
        <P>Arising from the experience of its initial period of operation, the ombudsman commission has brought forward a number of proposals for amendments to the provisions of the 2005 Act governing the investigation of complaints against serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The proposals made by the ombudsman commission are still under discussion with the commission itself and with Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na authorities.  The issues concerned involve considerable complexity, not only from a legislative standpoint, but also from an operational one and require careful consideration by all parties concerned.  However, work has been done towards preparing the necessary statutory amendments and the Minister<b> </b>for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is hopeful any outstanding issues will be resolved quickly and that he will shortly be in a position to bring forward legislative changes to Government for sanction.</P>
        <P>The appointment of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is dealt with by sections 65 and 66 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  There is a specific formality about the appointment provisions which marks the importance of the commission and its independence.  In that context, it should be noted that the Act requires the President, Ms. Mary McAleese, to make the appointment.  Aside from members of the Government and the Judiciary, a very limited number of public appointments are made directly by the President.</P>
        <P>While a person is nominated for appointment as a member of the commission by the Government, it is a requirement that any such appointment must be approved by the Oireachtas in the form of the passage of resolutions by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad recommending the particular appointment.  This is the purpose of the resolution which is before this House today.</P>
        <P>The first members of the commission, Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Conor Brady, were appointed for a six year term with effect from 12 December 2005.  There was unanimous support in both Houses for those appointments.  I sincerely hope this will also <Col N="501"/>be the case today in respect of Mr. Gallagher, whose appointment received unanimous support in the other House last week.</P>
        <P>The tasks of the chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission are wide-ranging and demanding.  They include overseeing the investigation of complaints of misbehaviour on the part of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the exercise of policing powers by the commission, the management of a large-scale caseload and the supervision of the operation of the relevant provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  These, and the other challenges of the office, require a chairperson of excellent judgment in decision-making, proven management skills and the ability to lead a team of fellow commissioners, investigators and administrative staff.</P>
        <P>In Mr. Dermot Gallagher the Government has nominated a public servant who has served this country with great distinction for many years as a senior diplomat and in other fields of public administration.  In that regard, the Government is fully satisfied that Mr. Gallagher has the necessary capacity and qualifications to make an excellent chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  As Members of this House will be aware, Mr. Gallagher recently retired as Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  He also previously served as Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach.  At Secretary General level, which is the very highest post in the Civil Service, he managed the work of two Government Departments at the heart of Government with broad and complex remits.</P>
        <P>Mr. Gallagher is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most distinguished public servants.  In particular, he played a central role in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the ground breaking 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  As a Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs until a year or two ago, I saw at first hand the diligence, acumen, judgment and leadership skills he can bring to bear as chairman of the ombudsman commission.  He is undoubtedly one of the most senior and distinguished diplomats and administrators this country has produced and I know that from personal experience.  He has often acted to restrain people and ensure proper public decisions are made, and that is the character of the man.  I knew him for many years preceding my period as a Minister of State and he is the person who is fit for purpose in terms of this particular appointment.  He will add to the distinguished record of his distinguished, now deceased, predecessor.</P>
        <P>Section 66(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides that a person appointed to fill a vacancy following the death of a member of the ombudsman commission shall hold office for the remainder of the term of office of the replaced member.  The new appointee will, therefore, only serve until 2011.  Given the importance of the post and the limited duration of the appointment, the Government decided the position should be filled without delay.  It should also be noted that the nomination process adopted in the case of Mr. Gallagher is very much the same as that which was followed when the first members of the commission were nominated by the Government in 2005.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention another aspect of the terms of appointment.  There had been some speculation regarding the remuneration for this appointment.  The House should note Mr. Gallagher has offered to take on the position at an annual salary of &euro;90,000.  This will result in a saving of &euro;153,000 per annum for the Exchequer.  It should be noted that had Mr. Gallagher not retired from the Department of Foreign Affairs and remained as its Secretary General he would have earned &euro;253,000.  If he had been a High Court judge like his predecessor he would have earned &euro;243,000.  At a salary of &euro;90,000 he is returning and giving great value to the State in this important role.</P><Col N="502"/>
        <P>The role of any police force is extremely challenging.  At its core is the prevention and detection of crime and the maintenance of public order.  The role frequently brings garda&iacute; into contact with members of the public in what are often difficult circumstances.  To carry out their tasks, garda&iacute; are given extensive powers, including powers of arrest and detention.  These powers, although used in challenging and often dangerous circumstances, must be exercised in a lawful and proportional manner.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has been established to investigate complaints of misbehaviour by members of the public on the part of garda&iacute;.  It too has a very demanding role.  The highly skilled and dedicated staff of the commission require a chairperson equal to the challenges of the brief.  The Government considered carefully the question of whom to nominate to the post of chairperson.  In Mr. Dermot Gallagher the Government is satisfied it has found a public servant with an outstanding record of achievement who clearly has the intellectual capacity, expertise and personal dedication to lead the Garda Ombudsman Commission.</P>
        <P>I regard myself as an energetic Minister of State, but I was consistently surprised at the long hours worked by Mr. Dermot Gallagher in the Department of Foreign Affairs and I know he will bring this tradition of strong work to this role.  In these circumstances I am happy to recommend the adoption of this motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, and its role, are important to policing in Ireland.  Confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is absolutely fundamental to support for the police force in the detection and successful prosecution of crime.  The importance of this body is highlighted by the figures which have emerged on the number of complaints it received between May 2007 and the end of last year.  Out of 4,746 complaints, 374 matters were referred by the Garda Commissioner, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to the ombudsman commission.  These have not all been substantiated but it has led to those complaints being dealt with by the ombudsman commission and a number of cases resulted in prosecution.  There were 37 files sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and 25 cases were subject to disciplinary action, in line with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na disciplinary regulations 2007.</P>
      
        <P>The role of this body is very important.  It is also important that those who serve on the force have the requisite experience and skills to deal with this area of activity, the range of complaints and the manner in which they are dealt with.  There is no doubt that Dermot Gallagher has extraordinary experience as a civil servant at the highest levels.  Like Carmel Foley and Conor Brady, he will bring to the task the necessary skill and will complement other board members.  It is also good that the terms and conditions of his employment have been modified to reflect concerns regarding remuneration etc.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While I have no objection to the appointment, it seems like an inside job.  Transparency and openness in appointments to State bodies and boards are necessary.  This is not to detract from the qualifications, experience and merit that have seen Dermot Gallagher appointed to this important body, but what of giving Oireachtas committees, the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights in this instance, the opportunity to meet designated appointees?  Mr. Gallagher would acquit himself admirably, but openness and transparency in such appointments would be important.  Mr. Gallagher is an impressive civil servant who will contribute to the body&rsquo;s work admirably.  Not only will I not raise any objections, I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House.  Like my colleague, Senator Regan, I will speak in support of the motion.  As the spokesman for justice, equality and law reform for the Government side in the House, I wish to record my indignation at the unfortunate and callous murder of Constable Stephen Paul Carroll of the PSNI.  I also wish to indicate my indignation at the murder on Sunday night of the two British soldiers at a time when we believed we had left violence behind us.  After ten or 11 years of peace, a peace supported by 99% of people North and South, these appalling incidents are mind-boggling.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of a replacement for Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh, whose untimely death after a distinguished service caused this vacancy.  Like the Minister of State and my colleague, I have no doubt Dermot Gallagher will be an excellent replacement.  His record in the public service is long, his career is untainted and he has given unstinting service in many areas.  This is an important appointment and I place on the record my appreciation of the way in which he has accepted a reduced salary, the patriotic call to which I referred last week.  Perhaps other senior public servants, members of the Judiciary in particular, will reconsider their salaries.</P>
        <P>Dermot Gallagher has a long and distinguished career.  Between 1987 and 1991, he was an assistant secretary general in charge of the Anglo-Irish division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  From 1991 to 1997, he was our ambassador to the United States of America.  In 1997, he became the second Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin with responsibility for British-Irish relations.  Between 2000 and 2001, he was the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.  From 2001 to 2009, he served as the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is a significant curriculum vitae and Dermot Gallagher has acquitted himself with distinction.</P>
        <P>I concur with the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks in that Mr. Gallagher is a hard-working individual.  While I do not know him as well as the Minister of State does, I do not doubt his appointment is important, especially given the recent disastrous developments in the North.  It should be acknowledged that Mr. Gallagher was a key figure and intense worker in advance of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>The importance of the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission should be put on the record.  Since its inception in 2007, it has done considerable work.  Since May 2007, it has received approximately 5,000 complaints, more than 3,500 of which have been finalised.  This is an important fact given the cloud of suspicion and doubt that used to hang over the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Without going into detail, we should remember the County Donegal situation among others.  The new commission plays a significant role in allaying public fears because it adds a layer of security.</P>
        <P>The commission is a triumvirate.  As the Minister of State mentioned, appointments to it are made by the President on the recommendation of the Government, a rather unusual process.  It is worth noting that the commission&rsquo;s other members have good track records and that the commission has been doing good work.  I acknowledge Mr. Justice Haugh&rsquo;s significant work in this regard.</P>
        <P>Having studied the briefing note on the commission, I note that the commission has proposed legislative amendments to the 2005 Act.  While I am not familiar with the amendments, the proposal is proactive and welcome and indicates the commission&rsquo;s willingness to work with the Oireachtas in improving the role of the ombudsman&rsquo;s office.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>I support the motion and wish Mr. Gallagher every success in his new role.  I also wish the commission every success, as it is one of the most important bodies for the betterment of the police force.  In the course of time, it will prove to be an important stepping stone towards fairness and equity as far as the public is concerned.  I am confident this appointment is most appropriate and <i>par excellence</i>.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity for this debate.  I support wholeheartedly the appointment of Dermot Gallagher as chair of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Members today are focusing on policing and on police practices as they reflect on the brutal murder of Constable Stephen Carroll.  I join others, as I did previously, in expressing condemnation of the brutal killings both of Constable Carroll and of the two soldiers in Antrim at the weekend.  I also wish to express my sympathies to the families of all the men injured and killed.  Members already had an extensive discussion on this issue at which there was unanimous condemnation of these murders.</P>
        <P>This debate arises from another death, namely, the untimely death of Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh, the former chair of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  I express, as did the Minister of State, my sympathy to Mr. Justice Haugh&rsquo;s family.  I knew him, as did every practising barrister, and he was a person of immense warmth and sociability and was a very generous man.  His funeral was enormously well attended and a most warm and affectionate portrait of the man was painted at it.</P>
        <P>Arising from the death of Mr. Justice Haugh, the need arose to appoint a new chair to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  As the Minister of State noted, it is an entity that was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The commission came into operation on 9 May 2007 and has been in place for less than two years.  The figures and reports it has produced, therefore, must be read in a context in which there has been little time for the new procedures to bed down.  The commission&rsquo;s predecessor was the most unsatisfactory Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board.  It had been critical of its own shortcomings, arising from the weaknesses in the legislation under which it was established.  Consequently, the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was a welcome development.</P>
        <P>When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill was being debated, I, together with many others, contributed to the debates on the Bill within civil society.  Concern was expressed, and I was one of those who expressed it, that a tripartite commission was envisaged.  Rather than appointing one individual, as had been done in the North, it was thought fit at the time to appoint a three-person commission.  It still is the case that this was not a positive move in that in Northern Ireland, especially in the person of Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, the former police ombudsman, there was a great deal of identification among all sections of the community with the single person identified with receiving police complaints.  The effectiveness and success of the police complaints procedure in Northern Ireland was due in no small measure to the presence of one highly identifiable person, that is, the ability of one individual to make decisions and because there was no room for disagreement among the members of the commission with only one person at the top and so on.</P><Col N="505"/>
        <P>That said, it is a measure of the commission&rsquo;s success thus far that it has received so many complaints.  It is interesting to make a comparison with, for example, the number of complaints received in 2002 by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board.  The latter received 1,405 complaints that year, which then was a record number.  However, a much greater number of complaints already have come in to the commission in the short time in which it has been in operation.  This is a measure of enhanced public trust and confidence in it, which is welcome.  However, as I understand that amendments to the mechanisms of the commission will be put to both Houses shortly, the Minister of State might consider changing the nature of the commission.  Has he views in this regard?  A former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was highly forthright about the need for a three-person commission.  I was not convinced by his arguments at the time and I would be interested to learn whether the Minister of State shares his views on the need for a three-person, rather than a single-person, commission.</P>
        <P>At the time when the establishment of the commission was debated, I spoke about the need for accountability, transparency and respect for individual rights in any policing service.  Many people looked to the Patten report as a blueprint for what would be a successful model for policing.  That report had recommended the idea of an ombudsman and the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment also had been recommending some form of independent oversight for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for more than ten years before the 2005 Act came into force.  The idea of an independent complaints body was not new.  It had been sought for a long time and was needed to fulfil our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  It was a welcome development and has increased greatly the aforementioned three criteria of accountability, transparency and respect for individual rights within the police service.  Any comments I offer are by way of being constructive as a new era begins under a new chair of the commission in the person of Dermot Gallagher.</P>
        <P>Turning to the figures the Minister of State provided on the work of the commission and the available figures in its report, I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s figures obviously are more up-to-date than those contained in the most recent release from the commission itself.  The Minister of State said the commission now has received more than 5,000 complaints, which is interesting.  The most recent figures given on the website in January 2009 stated that the commission had received 4,746 complaints in the period from 9 May 2007 to 31 December 2008.  That is an impressive level of complaints in a relatively short time of just over 18 months and constitutes a measure of greater public confidence in this new body when compared with the previous entity.  However, there is some cause for concern regarding the large numbers of complaints that have been deemed inadmissible.  It is worth noting that 1,909 cases were deemed inadmissible and a further 220 files were awaiting an admissibility decision.  Consequently, more than one third, albeit less than one half, of the complaints on which an admissibility decision had been made were deemed inadmissible.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this figure which jumped out at me.</P>
        <P>It also is worth noting &mdash; working from the figures I have to hand &mdash; that of the cases investigated by the commission, 2,718 complaints were closed by 31 December last.  Of those complaints, 37 files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and there has been one conviction.  I do not believe Members should be looking for heads or anything like that and it is good to know there were only 37 cases which the commission considered the DPP should investigate.  Moreover, it is good to know that only one conviction has been necessary.  However, has the Minister of State a view on the small number of files that have been sent to <Col N="506"/>the DPP?  I should also state that 25 further cases were subject to disciplinary action under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s discipline regulations.</P>
        <P>I make these comments to be constructive because when one considers improving policing and public confidence therein, one must ensure the existence of effective and transparent mechanisms for oversight of policing.  In recent years in Ireland, there has been some dreadful abuse of police powers by individual members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given that the majority of garda&iacute; are impeccable and unstinting in the amount and levels of public service they provide, it is important any individuals who seek to bring the name of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into disrepute should be sanctioned.  This is in the interests both of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a whole and of individual garda&iacute; who try to do their job under difficult conditions.  It is with these interests in mind, as well as the interests of the community at large, that all Members wish to see in place a strong Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Moreover, all Members wish to ensure the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission are seen to be exercised effectively and that, where necessary, sanctions are imposed. I wish to mention briefly two other matters.  First, I refer to the joint policing committees established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act which were important in respect of trying to increase community trust in the force.  However, in the future, there should be greater commitment within the Garda to the principle of community or neighbourhood policing.  It is a matter that also was highlighted and emphasised in the Patten report as a vital component of any modern police force.  While I acknowledge the Garda Commissioner has been forthright about the need for increased community policing, for a long time there was a view within the Garda that community policing was not given sufficient importance and that garda&iacute; who were put to community policing duties too often were moved on too quickly before having gained the trust of their local areas.  This is important.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of the independent policing board.  At the time the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill was being discussed, a great deal of debate took place about the need for an independent policing board.  A previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took a strong view that there was no need for an independent policing board.  In making this case, he distinguished between this State and the North on the basis of the difference in the nature of the policing service in either jurisdiction.  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s view in this regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of Mr. Dermot Gallagher.  As a former civil servant with an immensely distinguished career, he will bring great expertise and authority to the position.  I wish him well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this issue, if for no other reason than to recognise the distinguished work of Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh whose untimely death led to the vacancy on the board of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  As the first person to chair the commission following its inception, he served with distinction.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate to note that Mr. Justice Haugh was of the view that there should be amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to empower the commission to carry out its function more effectively.  I welcome the indication by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that statutory amendments are at draft stage and that he hopes to bring these forward shortly.  I trust these changes will effectively address the concerns raised by the late Mr. Justice Haugh.</P><Col N="507"/>
        <P>In this context, perhaps the Minister will consider a further change, namely, a new and transparent process for the appointment of the chairman of the ombudsman commission.  In raising this issue, I wish to make absolutely clear that I am in no way questioning the suitability of Mr. Dermot Gallagher as successor to Mr. Justice Haugh.  Mr. Gallagher has served with distinction as Secretary General at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and in many other posts on the State&rsquo;s behalf, including at the United Nations in New York.  He was instrumental in the talks that brought about the Good Friday Agreement.  His father, like mine, served with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so he can be expected to be familiar with the operation of the force.  There is no doubt that he is eminently suitable to be chairman of the commission.  I welcome his agreement to accept an annual salary of &euro;90,000 instead of the &euro;243,000 previously associated with the post.  If he had accepted the higher amount, in addition to his pension of &euro;125,000, questions would have been raised regarding the appropriateness of a civil servant going on to be in receipt of a total remuneration in excess of his final salary.  His decision to accept a lower remuneration for the post of chairman is a mark of his integrity.</P>
        <P>However, I have some concerns about the appointment procedure.  To reiterate, this is not at all to reflect on Mr. Gallagher&rsquo;s abilities and dedication.  However, questions arise about such appointments to a statutory body by a Minister.  I expect the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will tell us it is the President who makes the appointment.  The reality, however, is that the latter merely signs off on the appointment after the Minister and Oireachtas have approved it.  It would be a very rare event for a Minister not to get his or her way in regard to such an appointment.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of the integrity of the individuals involved but of the integrity of the appointments system.  We already know people are appointed to State boards and agencies on the basis of friendship.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, told us so.  It is beyond credulity to suppose other Ministers have not done likewise.  I again emphasise I am not inferring any connection between Mr. Gallagher&rsquo;s appointment and his previous position as Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs when the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was in charge of that Department .  However, it is a highly politicised position which should, from time to time, if it is functioning properly, issue reports and statements that will be politically embarrassing to the Government.  The ombudsman commission was created to restore public confidence in the Garda by establishing a body that could deal effectively with complaints about the Garda free from political or any other type of interference.  The process of appointment of the board of the commission must be seen to be transparent.  Anything else would represent contempt for the public&rsquo;s right to accountable government.</P>
        <P>On today&rsquo;s Order Paper, the non-Government motion No. 33, in the name of Senators Norris, Bacik and Mullen, urges the Government to accept the recommendations of the recently published Transparency International report.  One of these recommendations is that all appointments to the boards of the State bodies should be subject to public competition.  I ask the Minister to take this on board in future.  Mr. Gallagher and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, are well aware that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is appointed under independent observation.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has called for the same appointment system to apply in the Republic.  It has also called for the Nolan principles, which lay down seven criteria under which these types of appointment should be made, to be observed in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The crucial aspect of this case is that the Minister is responsible for the appointment of the board of the ombudsman commission but only under the scrutiny of an independent panel, with no connection to the Department filling the post.  We have an independent body for <Col N="508"/>appointments at lower levels of the public service but no corresponding entity for top brass appointments.  This is another example of how procedures can undermine the public&rsquo;s confidence in the Government.  Allegations of cronyism will only go away when appointments to well-paid positions, funded by the taxpayer, are open, transparent and independent.  The adoption or adaption of the Nolan principles would represent a good start in this regard.</P>
        <P>I conclude by congratulating Mr. Gallagher on his appointment.  I wish him all the best in dealing with the thorny issues with which he will undoubtedly be confronted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Those who committed the murder last night of Constable Stephen Paul Carroll of the Police Service of Northern Ireland are pathetic, deluded and brutal fools and they do not speak in our name.  That message must go out clearly throughout the island.  That the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was a response to a model that has operated successfully in Northern Ireland is a coincidence of fact that does not mean we should ignore the seriousness or the consequences of this brutal murder.</P>
        <P>As a Member of the other House, I spoke during the debate on the original legislation about the difference of approach of a three-person commission as opposed to the single-person model that was already operating successfully in Northern Ireland in the person of Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan.  The commission in the Republic has also operated successfully and I take this opportunity to record our thanks for its ongoing work.  However, there has been and continues to be a reluctance among some in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to acknowledge the necessity for and value of the commission.  It is unfortunate that these views prevail, because they do not represent anything like a majority opinion within the Garda.  It is a cause for concern that questions continue to be raised about the need for an independent policing of the police.  The commission was established in the wake of a small number of incidents that questioned the validity of actions being taken by those who are there to enforce and guard our legal protections.  That is why we need an ombudsman commission.  I am glad it has operated successfully to date.</P>
        <P>The purpose of today&rsquo;s motion is to facilitate the appointment of a new chairman of the commission.  I join other Members in placing on record my appreciation of the exemplary work done by the proposed appointee, Mr. Dermot Gallagher, as Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, particularly his involvement in the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement.  It was my personal experience of him in that role that he was always open and willing to deal with Oireachtas Members on an individual basis rather than merely transferring inquiries to a principal officer or other departmental officials.  In terms of his character, experience, ability and commitment, Mr. Gallagher represents a good appointment.  While he has been subject to some level of media scrutiny in terms of his severance package on his retirement from the Department of Foreign Affairs, his subsequent action in opting for a lower remuneration for this important post says something further about his character.</P>
        <P>Other Senators have proposed that we consider new procedures for such appointments in future.  In this instance, however, the appointment must be proposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, agreed by the Cabinet, sanctioned by both Houses of the Oireachtas and, finally, signed by the President.  This is not the worst method of public appointment.  There are other areas we should first look to improve.  I would like to see a situation where the appointment of a new ombudsman or positions of that grade within the public service would be subject to a scrutiny procedure such as exists in the United States, where a joint committee or a committee of either House would have the opportunity of questioning the proposed appointments before the appointment is subsequently approved by both Houses.  That is not an issue in this case.  All this House needs to do is to welcome the appointment and to congratu<Col N="509"/>late the efforts made by the other members of the commission, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Conor Brady in respect of the work of the commission.  The legislation that will inform future changes to the commission will be based on the positive experiences of the people we have been appointed to this commission in the first instance.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach chun an r&uacute;n seo a phl&eacute;.  Cos&uacute;il le gach &eacute;ine eile at&aacute; tar &eacute;is labhairt ar an r&uacute;n, t&aacute;imid ar aon aigne leis an r&uacute;n os comhair an Teach.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is the subject of the motion before us.  As another Senator said, this was part of the overall reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2005.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which was provided for in this Bill, was an important innovation.  Among the people who served we are fortunate to have the chairperson, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, the former chief of police in Boston.  She brings a raft of policing experience to the post, which is beneficial to making improvements.  No matter what area we are involved in, striving for excellence should be an ongoing process.  This is required of all public services, not least within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>I welcomed the introduction of joint policing committees as part of that legislation.  I was disappointed that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government got its hands on it and succeeded in neutering it.  In practice, it is not the dynamic force that I felt it could be as a conduit linking the public and the police force, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a need for more regular meetings and that should be examined.  Greater interaction with the community was part of the original intention, but that is not happening.  In the run-up to local elections it will be difficult to add innovation to what is taking place but, subsequent to the local elections, there should be a reappraisal so that this is focused in the direction we intended it to go in when we spoke on the subject.  There should be no reluctance in this matter.  Senator Boyle alluded to a lack of acceptance on the part of certain members of the force to the introduction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, but I do not detect that to a great degree.</P>
        <P>There is a need for the commission and it is important that an independent body undertakes this work.  In the past, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board operated effectively but, given the unfortunate scenarios that developed, particularly in Donegal, it was essential that an independent body functioned in the restoration of public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the three-member constitution of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  We debated the point in these Houses at the time.  The Minister at the time, Mr. McDowell, was in favour of a triumvirate as distinct from a single ombudsman.  I should probably know the answer to the following question but I do not.  Are these full-time positions and do people work for 40 hours per week in these positions?  If the Minister of State knows the answer perhaps he will spell it out.  In 2011, when the term of office of the incumbents comes to an end, consideration should be given to reducing it to a single ombudsman commission.  If that can be done without a loss of effectiveness, it would be a cost-efficient measure.  In the administration of public services, this must be a <i>sine qua non</i>.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that we are debating this motion because it arises due to the untimely death of Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh.  As other Members and the Minister of State stated, he served with great distinction as the first chairman of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  I welcome the fact that we have moved away from appointing members of the legal profession to all quasi-judicial positions.  That was unnecessary and this approach is innovative.  Mr. Dermot Gallagher has had a distinguished career in the public service, serving in many parts of the world on behalf of the State with great commitment and dedication, which he will bring to this <Col N="510"/>position.  As a former Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs, he has wide-ranging experience that he will bring to this role.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State pointed out that since it was established 5,000 complaints have been received.  Will the Minister of State quantify the number of vexatious complaints received?  This was an issue as the legislation was debated in this House.  When investigated, vexatious complaints are found to be spurious and may well have been motivated by vindictiveness rather than genuine reasons.</P>
        <P>Many Members remarked on the sad and unfortunate killing of a PSNI policeman last night.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stands between us and anarchy at all times.  In general, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do their jobs with a degree of commitment and selfless dedication to protecting the State and its civilians.  Often this is at a cost to themselves.  There is a poster campaign illustrating this point to some extent.  It is important that we incentivise the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do its duty.  We must ensure that the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not scapegoated unjustly, which can lead to a loss of morale and motivation.</P>
        <P>I compliment Mr. Dermot Gallagher on not succumbing to the media witch hunt with regard to his salary when his position was first announced.  I welcome the fact that he is taking a reduction.  I do not know if the reduction is voluntary or otherwise.  Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate which it is.</P>
        <P>Admittedly, the setting of salaries can be subjective but the payment of &euro;243,000 for a position that is in general administrative seems to be excessive.  It illustrates to some extent the way we have gone with regard to bloating our payments across the board.  It is not confined to bankers but, unfortunately, can be seen in every walk of life.  It has led to lack of competitiveness and the area should be considered.</P>
        <P>The ombudsman commission is effectively administrative and can only recommend disciplinary proceedings having investigated the matter and established the facts.  It can refer issues to the Director of Public Prosecutions for charges to be pressed.  Its remit is to investigate complaints, as the Minister of State said, and promote confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have no doubt that the people who are there will be fully committed and will do that without fear or favour.  I am happy to support the motion in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>My Seanad colleagues spoke on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and its role, and I do not intend to go over that ground.  I intend to speak of the individual who will take over that office, Mr. Dermot Gallagher &mdash; Dag, as he was known in the Department &mdash; and his continuing career of service to the country.  Many people have been involved in the Irish peace process but very few could claim to be there from beginning to end.  Whereas many would have observed history, Dermot Gallagher lived the history and was there for much of it.</P>
        <P>He saw Frank Aiken as Minister for External Affairs all the way through to Deputy Brian Cowen&rsquo;s role in the Good Friday Agreement.  He dealt with Charlie Haughey and various other taoisigh, including Garret FitzGerald.  Going back to his roots in Leitrim, his first love, outside of the affairs of the country, is football in the county.  He still hopes that some day the boundary commission will reunite Leitrim, the partitioned county, as Mr. Gallagher often referred to it.</P>
        <P>I had the great pleasure of spending some time with Mr. Gallagher in Washington DC, and he is a public servant in the true sense of the word, in every way.  He played minor and under-21 football for Leitrim so if anybody wishes to have a discussion with Dermot Gallagher one should talk about Leitrim football rather than foreign affairs.  Generally, if one comes from <Col N="511"/>Kerry there will be a short conversation about Leitrim football, but he seems to be able to talk about it in minute detail.</P>
        <P>Mr. Gallagher developed significant knowledge of foreign affairs through Professor Desmond Williams in UCD before the hand of history touched upon him.  He was duty officer when Paddy Devlin, among others, came looking for guns to the Department of Foreign Affairs on the weekend when Catholics were being burned out of their homes.  Dermot Gallagher was the man who opened the door on that occasion.  Patrick Hillery, among others, was a member of the Government in charge and it was clearly a significant and seminal moment in Irish history in 1969.</P>
        <P>He went on to a post in San Francisco and ended up in Nigeria at one stage, where he founded a great relationship with the Irish missionaries who taught him much about the importance of public service and what really matters in life.  He was involved in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Stormont and Sunningdale agreements.  When Charlie Haughey came to power, although the Taoiseach had been vehemently against the agreement in opposition, Dermot Gallagher was told by him to &ldquo;fully and imaginatively&rdquo; enforce the agreement as agreed by the previous Government.</P>
        <P>He has a great knack for friendship and a great ability to get on with everybody.  While ambassador in Washington DC he struck up a relationship which was to have a significant consequence for Ireland.  His friendship with Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, meant that when Clinton was in the White House and when the British Government was arguing that Gerry Adams should not get a visa, which became symbolically important for the republican community in Northern Ireland, Dermot Gallagher could have, as he often said, a quiet and effective word in Bill Clinton&rsquo;s ear.  Where normally Ireland would hold no sway with the Secretary of State and the Department of State, Bill Clinton overruled his officials and insisted that the visa be granted.  As a result of a very brave step that was ridiculed by many in this House and the media in this country, Gerry Adams was granted a visa and the peace process started to take root because republicans believed they would get a fair deal.  Before that, the Americans were seen to be more on the side of the British Government.</P>
        <P>When he came back from America in 1997, he was put in charge of the section in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department tasked with the Good Friday Agreement and was there for all of it, until its conclusion over ten years ago.  He since retired from public service, but not for long.</P>
        <P>I wanted to put on the record of this House his service to this country.  He was there when guns were being sought by the Catholic community to protect themselves and he was there when the gun was taken from Irish politics.  It is a significant service to any state and one which should be on the record of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the last Senator in particular for his contribution in setting out the career and achievements of Dermot Gallagher, which are not so well known outside this House.  It is timely and appropriate that they be put on the record as they relate to the undoubted foreign policy triumphs in the wider world, on our island and in our relationships with Britain.  It is fair to say that when Dermot Gallagher was in command of the Department, it always punched above its weight.  By extension, Ireland, in foreign policy and other terms, punched above its weight because of his strong leadership.</P>
        <P>It is also fair to say, given the praises being heaped upon him both here and across the different political divides in this House, that he always acted in a non-partisan manner and was a prisoner to any political philosophy or ideology in the conduct of his duties.  He would serve <Col N="512"/>equally any Minister, no matter what their political colour or inclination.  That is a great source of strength in our public service at this time and always.</P>
        <P>As the last speaker pointed out, it is also noteworthy that Mr. Gallagher is more vocal and waxes lyrical about the trials and tribulations of Leitrim footballers than being overly animated by the latest setback or progress item on the foreign policy agenda.  Anybody who had the patience and perseverance to support, week in and week out, month in and month out the fortunes of the Leitrim football team in particular deserves any appointment or break he or she might get in this life.  I note Mr. Gallagher has been appointed chairman of UCD&rsquo;s governing body, which is again a singular tribute to the man and the work he has done for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan raised the issue, not so much about the personality of the new incumbent chairperson of the ombudsman position but the process itself and the idea that it is another inside job.  I disabuse him of that, not just by dwelling on the personality and character of Dermot Gallagher, who is an insider in the sense that he worked on the inside, and without courting personal publicity he has worked diligently for Ireland.  It is not an inside job but an open and transparent appointment made by the Cabinet in direct consultation with the Oireachtas and rubber-stamped by and gaining the imprimatur of President Mary McAleese.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, if we do nothing else in this Parliament and country, it will restore the credibility of the three major parties that serve this country well &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; and the people they have appointed over the years.  It is fair for a Government of the day to pick a person in this manner and appoint him or her.  Many considerations must go into an appointment as sensitive and as difficult as this, particularly given the policing record that Ireland has experienced North and South of the Border.</P>
        <P>My grandfather joined the force in its foundation years and it was not easy to do.  That police force was vigorously contested by none less than my own political antecedents and those of a republican tendency generally.  However, that force established its credibility over many years.</P>
        <P>Some Senators&rsquo; contributions dwelt on a comparison between our police force and the police force of Northern Ireland and the appropriate transparency measures introduced on foot of the Good Friday Agreement related to that police force.  We must be clear about this.  Policing in Northern Ireland was a hugely more contested concept in terms of the legitimacy of the policing arrangements there over the years than was our Garda force.  It is horses for courses in that different measures need to apply.</P>
        <P>This is not an inside job in that sense.  We have selected somebody of great public distinction who has made a great contribution.  The Government must retain the strength and maturity to appoint people.  One Senator referred to issues of cronyism and the cloud that might hang over our appointments system.  There certainly have been examples over the years of people appointing people to particular jobs for partisan or other reasons.  We need to keep that in check.  I agree with the Members who made that point.  The only way to keep that in check is by having a robust Opposition, a robust scrutiny process&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a rather perverse argument.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and people with courage and integrity on the Opposition benches to call foul if they believe a foul has been perpetrated in terms of a public appointment.  However, we all need to be sensible about these matters.  It is not good enough for Government always to abnegate its responsibility and hand over appointments to outside bodies of one kind or the other. They, too, in many ways in a moral sense can be corrupted or they can often opt <Col N="513"/>for mediocre appointments because they are afraid to take a chance on somebody who may be extremely good at the job, and their role in that respect could prove to be a worse result.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to the hard-working capacity of the new chairperson of this body.  Senator Bacik raised the perennial issue of whether it should be a three-person or a one-person body.  The Government&rsquo;s view is clear, namely, that it should not be a one-person body.  In the Irish context policing, and issues related to it, can be extremely difficult because of the precise smallness of our society.  This is one of the perennial issues and difficulties one observes in politics and even in matters related to finances and the banking sector, namely, the easy familiarity and the ease of access we allow ourselves in this Parliament, in the Government and throughout our society.  People talk about six degrees of separation but, in fairness to Irish life, because of our history of long-tail families etc., there is probably zero degree of separation between one person and another.  That poses its own difficulties.</P>
        <P>To my mind, the three-person construct around this body is appropriate.  I draw Senator Bacik&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the Act specifies that there should be a man and woman appointee among the three appointees.  Without over-stating it, that is a positive move towards addressing gender inequities that have existed on boards and continue to exist to this day in the membership of the Oireachtas in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Therefore, the gender aspect is important.</P>
        <P>The three-person appointment system is a good measure.  When sensitive work had to be done in our courts system when this island was assailed by the serious form of terrorism practised by the Irish Republican Army from the 1970s onwards, we depended on the non-jury Special Criminal Court to hand down judgments where issues such as the intimidation of witnesses, judges or otherwise might have been involved.  That three-person court worked effectively.  Despite many objections by civil liberties groups to its operation as a non-jury court, internationally in legal circles it was well regarded precisely because it had the balancing aspect of three judges, a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge and District Court judge.  It had a balance of those personalities and the balance of the different court systems.</P>
        <P>Such balance exists in this body in terms of its three-person aspect.  Ms Carmel Foley represents the consumer rights consciousness that has been very much part and parcel of our modernisation since 1970s.  Mr. Conor Brady is a distinguished person who has served with the media at senior level, having been an editor of a major national daily newspaper and in whose journalistic life pursued a strong form of investigative journalism.  He was not a docile, mundane reporter but rather was highly involved in investigative journalistic work, both as an editor and a practising reporter.  The merits of Mr. Dermot Gallagher are obvious to all Members on a cross-party basis in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan raised the issue of transparency and the views of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  He raised the notion of cronyism and the pall of cronyism hanging over this House.  I am not particularly conscious of it.  I have seen many appointments made by Fine Gael that were extremely good ones.  I have also many seen Fianna F&aacute;il appointments.  I have seen bad appointments made on both sides both to the Judiciary, important boards and elsewhere.  We are living with some of the consequences of board appointment in the banking sector by boards and executives who should have done better in terms of the calibre of people they appointed.  Those appointments will have to be rectified because it is not good enough to advance people purely on the basis that they are one&rsquo;s friends or one knows them.  They must have suitable characteristics and qualifications to do the job.</P><Col N="514"/>
        <P>Senator Boyle made a good point concerning the examination of a scrutiny procedure for appointments by a committee of these Houses.  It is not Government policy but at a personal level, speaking as a D&aacute;il Deputy, I would welcome that approach suggested by the Senator of having a level of scrutiny of such appointments through the committees of these Houses.  Unfortunately, because of the smallness of our country, we tend to politicise almost every controversy that arises inside and outside these Houses.  Unless such scrutiny is exercised responsibly, we would quickly descend into what I would call politicised lynch mob activity against individuals.  We would want to be careful of that.  I have no problem with such scrutiny at a personal level.  People who are put into positions that carry serious responsibilities should be robust enough to be able to withstand questions from D&aacute;il Deputies.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to the joint policing committees and the need for them to have more regular meetings.  He talked about the issue of whether this position is full-time.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is appointed on a full-time basis.  I have no doubt Mr. Dermot Gallagher will give all his full-time efforts to this particular task.  It is a busy and difficult job, all the more so because the ombudsman commission has formal investigation, detection and arrest powers.  Its officials can enter any Garda station and can interview anybody.  It has three strong teams.  Half of its staff of 98 people are devoted to the investigative side of things, which is as it should be.  That is a serious responsibility.  The expectation would be, although it is not prescribed in the Act, that the ombudsman commission should be full-time.  Given its members&rsquo; independence, it is left to their own discretion the number of work hours they put in.  There will not be an issue about Mr. Dermot Gallagher&rsquo;s work rate, given that I was often stunned to receive calls from him at 7 a.m., when he was already at his desk busy working.  At one level it was quite frightening to think that the permanent government was not only ahead of one and in the office before one arrived but was alive to the issues of the day that needed to be clarified and dealt with.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly referred glowingly to Mr. Dermot Gallagher&rsquo;s career.  We join in congratulating him on his appointment.  He will be the kind of the person who will exercise his role in a fair and proper manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Members for their contributions.  We have gone to a new point in Ireland in regard to policing where it is transparent, the systems are transparent and the investigation is real.  To underline the importance of this appointment but also the importance of the office, I advise the House that I had to rely on the ombudsman commission on one occasion.  I was surprised because I had not fully absorbed the full powers this body has under its tutelage.  I refer to the unfortunate case in my constituency where the driver of a Garda car killed a young man.  I was surprised to learn that every death involving a member of the force, whether on duty or off duty, is automatically referred to the ombudsman commission for investigation.  That is a strong guarantee in terms of role of this body.</P>
    
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The young woman who lost her son in this case was very worried and, not unlike many other members of the community, had doubts and reservations and perhaps had listened to gossip or rumours or had fears that something sinister had happened in this accident which involved the unfortunate death of her son.  I went to her house to talk her through the issues involved in the case after her son was buried.  I asked her whether she was happy a death was automatically referred to the ombudsman commission without any consideration of the barest facts, even if the facts were very obvious, even if it was very obviously an accidental death and even though that caused great personal concern and anxiety to the individual member of the force who was the subject of an investigation.  I asked that <Col N="515"/>young woman who had lost her son and was in deep grieving over the unfortunate circumstances of her son&rsquo;s death whether she was reassured by the fact that it would be automatically investigated and that there would not be an internal inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death.  She said the one thing that gave her great confidence in dealing with the grief and bereavement that she was going through was that it was now going to be investigated properly by somebody other than and independent of the normal investigative process of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is a tribute to appointing an office such as this one.  I again thank the Members for their positive contributions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to the House.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for ruling in order my motion to ask the Government to address urgently the inequitable level of reduction in undergraduate nursing places in St. Angela&rsquo;s College.  Undergraduate nursing education throughout the country has been cut by 16.5%.  This has been especially savage in the north west at St. Angela&rsquo;s College in Sligo, the only constituent college of the National University of Ireland north of a line from Dublin to Galway.  The cuts there are in excess of 31% in undergraduate intake, 25% on the general programme and an outrageous 40% on the intellectual disability programme.  In the Dublin area the cut has been just 7% on average.  Cuts in Trinity College and UCD have been 6.5% and 6.4%, respectively.</P>
        <P>One would question the rationale for cutting nursing education at all and especially at a time when the health service here is going through the most major reform ever experienced.  Nurses still remain the only 24-hour service providers within the system and are predominantly the face of the front line.  In recent times we have needed to recruit from across the world to ensure we have had sufficient nurses at the coalface.  We are now complicating this shortage further by not educating our own nurses for the future.  One would question why nursing was chosen to suffer cuts while other health care professional numbers have not been affected and other undergraduate discipline numbers remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>This further compounds the urban-rural divide given that the greatest cut in student nursing places will occur at St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo.  The national average cut is 16.5% and it will be between 31% and 32% in St. Angela&rsquo;s, which is double the national average.  It defies logic when one considers that Trinity College and UCD, among the biggest colleges in Ireland, are to experience the smallest level of cuts.  The impact on student numbers will be such that the overall viability and continuance of those colleges will not be remotely affected.  However, at St. Angela&rsquo;s College it will be very significant to have such a large cut in its numbers.</P>
        <P>A reduction of 40% on the intellectual disability programme is simply outrageous.  I am informed that the Health Service Executive director of nursing services took this decision which was then approved by the Minister, Deputy Harney.  I have been reliably informed that the director of nursing took this decision on the basis of the need for more nursing in Dublin.  Are <Col N="516"/>more students from Dublin interested in pursuing nursing as a career?  Is it from viewing hospitals in Dublin that the director of nursing services perceives that it requires more places?  Are the people of the north west not as entitled as those in any other region to apply to qualify as nurses in the north west as they have consistently done there and then work wherever they choose?</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that all the people who have qualified through the intellectual disability programme have secured employment locally through the Cloonamahon facility, Craig House and other regional or local services.  This constitutes further discrimination by the HSE against the north west.  We have had the ongoing debacle with the proposed removal of cancer services and now we have this.  It is a further indication that the HSE as an entity is detached from the will of the people and the needs of the people in regional Ireland.  More than 20% of the budget in the State is under the direct control of a third party organisation that does not respond to the direct wishes through elected representatives in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and Government and act appropriately.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to take to the Minister, Deputy Harney, and other members of the Government the ardent wish of the people of the north west to be treated equitably and fairly as those in other parts of the country are so that we will not need to take the lion&rsquo;s share of the pain once again.  First we had the cancer services and now the discrimination against St. Angela&rsquo;s College where nursing student numbers are to be cut from 65 to 40, whereas the cuts in Trinity College and UCD are minimal and will have minimal effects on the overall viability of the workings of those colleges.</P>
        <P>We should consider other revered Government policies such as balanced regional development, the national spatial strategy and taking care of the students of the future.  If a person wants to study nursing and there are not sufficient places at St. Angela&rsquo;s College, he or she will need to come to Dublin where the cost of living including rent is higher.  As the spatial strategy would aspire to, should we not create more capacity before demand?  I believe a region such as mine with St. Angela&rsquo;s College acting as that education centre could take more students.  The level of cuts, if any, at St. Angela&rsquo;s College therefore should be substantially less.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for hearing my plea and I hope in earnest that something can be done to reduce the level of savage cuts on the undergraduate nursing places at St. Angela&rsquo;s College.  It has experienced the highest percentage cut of the 13 nursing schools with a cut of 31% compared with a national average of 16.5%.  However, our biggest universities, Trinity College and UCD, have to take least pain at between 6% and 7%.  I ask the Minister of State to take that on board with a view to reducing the level of cuts on St. Angela&rsquo;s College.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue for his area.  By way of background I should explain that following the publication of the 2009 Estimates for public services, the Health Service Executive was tasked to deliver savings of &euro;115 million.  Among many other issues, a reduction in nurse training expenditure is needed to contribute to achieving these savings.  The total cost to the health services for both undergraduate and post-registration nurse education is in excess of &euro;117 million per annum.</P>
        <P>Savings of &euro;5 million in 2009 will be achieved as follows.  The number of places on the undergraduate nursing degree programme will be reduced by 310 places, from 1,880 to 1,570.  The reductions will take place in all 13 higher education institutions in the country which provide this programme and will relate to the areas of general nursing, 197, a reduction of 18.64%; intellectual disability nursing, 60, a reduction of 25%; and psychiatric nursing, 53, a <Col N="517"/>reduction of 15.45%.  The total is 310 which, as the Senator explained, equates to a reduction of 16.49%.  These reductions will result in savings of approximately &euro;1.65 million in 2009 and &euro;3.3 million per annum from 2010 onwards and will be effected mainly in those areas not experiencing nurse shortages.  There will be no reductions in the undergraduate programmes for midwifery &mdash; 140 places &mdash; and children&rsquo;s and general nursing, integrated &mdash; 100 places.</P>
        <P>In the second area, nurses trained under the apprenticeship and diploma models undertaking part-time degree courses can apply to their employer to have their course fees paid in return for a service commitment to the public health service.  This initiative has been in operation since 2001 and should have been completed in 2005.  Its purpose was to give serving nurses and midwives the opportunity to avail of the degree course, thereby avoiding a two-tier nursing and midwifery system.  It will be no longer available for new entrants from 1 January 2009, resulting in a saving of &euro;2 million next year and about &euro;3.8 million per annum from 2010 onwards.</P>
        <P>In the third area of specialist practice courses, further savings of &euro;1.35 million in 2009 will be achieved by reducing places on the various post-registration courses in specialist clinical practice.  These three cost-saving measures will produce cumulative savings of &euro;5 million in 2009 and &euro;8.45 million per annum in future years.</P>
        <P>By way of background, the OECD public management review, Ireland &mdash; Towards an Integrated Public Service, published in 2008, in its case study on reconfiguration of the health services noted:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">One statistical characteristic of Ireland is its very large number of practising nurses (15.2 per 1,000), which is twice the OECD average, just below Norway (15.4) but much higher than UK (9.1) or France (7.7).  The number of nurses graduating every year is also high (14.4), above Norway (10.1), UK (8.6) or France (5.9).  This contradicts the universal perception of a &ldquo;shortage&rdquo; of nurses, held by health actors in Ireland who were interviewed by the OECD.  Partial explanations come from the fact that some 40% of nurses in Ireland work part-time (as compared for example with 26% in France for nurses working in hospitals).</P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to geographic and demographic concerns which are Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s chief concerns, the percentage reductions in undergraduate student places take account of geographic and demographic trends in nursing placements whereby it is not always possible to fill all vacancies in the eastern region, whereas outside of this region the number of graduates being produced may exceed demand.  Accordingly, the estimated one third reduction on the western seaboard should go some way towards correcting this imbalance.  The percentage of reductions in the 13 higher education institutes also take account of the situation whereby the removal of the full intake of the nursing degree programme, which in some cases forms the backbone of an institute, could cause great difficulties for the institute as a whole.</P>
        <P>Against this background, it is important to note that the Minister has approved a strategic review of the nursing degree programme which will commence this year.  Overall, the review is designed to provide a systematic analysis of what is being achieved by expenditure under both capital and revenue headings.  It should also provide sound evidence and a critical analysis of the preparation of nurses for practice.  The findings will provide a basis to inform decision makers on the future direction of pre-registration nursing education programmes in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I raise this issue which has become very woolly recently because there has been rumour upon rumour in the Mullingar <Col N="518"/>area.  As late as three weeks ago, I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who informed me he would meet senior management at St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital, Mullingar, and then, lo and behold, there was a big headline in the local newspaper that the hospital was to close.  After further checking and research, I realised the Minister of State had asked for a plan from the hospital management regarding the proposed closure and also for a plan for the patients.</P>
        <P>There are 110 patients in St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital, some of whom have been living there for more than 50 years and do not know anywhere else.  It is their home.  This is my chief concern.  While we all agree these horrible institutions must close, we must also prepare proper facilities and homes for these people.  There has been very little consultation with staff, some of whom have worked at the hospital for a very long time.  Very good work is done at St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar which has been a sanctuary for these people, some of whom travel from as far away as Naas.  The joined-up thinking in the Health Service Executive is that St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital will now take people from Naas in an overflow situation.  One gentleman from Naas has nowhere to go as he has been there for so long.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is to become of these people?  The hospital is chock-a-block at present.  An acute bed unit is needed for people with acute psychiatric illness.  The facility that had been promised for the general hospital in Mullingar has gone by the wayside despite promises being made years ago.  There must be proper rehabilitation facilities for people who are being discharged into the community as well as psychological support and supportive employment, which is quite haphazard at present.  There is far too much dependence on prescribed drugs for patients.  We need to figure out ways of helping people to live with dignity in their communities.  Some of them might even be able to go home if they were to have a proper outreach plan.  I believe the term is an assertive outreach plan which is a patient-centred plan that would meet the needs of the patient and would not be in any way woolly.</P>
        <P>Family support is very important.  Families are very worried about relatives who have been long-stay patients at St. Loman&rsquo;s.  Social support is also needed.  For people to live in an austere grey psychiatric hospital or live alone in a community where nobody visits them or where there is perhaps only one community worker is not the solution.  I am concerned that people would be put out on the rubbish heap, as it were, with nowhere to go, which is the case at present.  I have very little confidence in this regard.  A sum of &euro;3.5 million was received from Westmeath County Council for a tranche of land on which it built houses but this money has not gone back into the psychiatric or mental health services in Athlone, Mullingar and the Westmeath area.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will probably refer to A Vision for Change which was launched in 2006 and has been referred to many times in this House.  It is a great document and refers to &euro;21.6 million each year for seven years and &euro;151 million in addition to existing funding for an additional 1,803 posts.  While we are in a very different climate than we were in 2006, at the same time, &euro;796 million was recommended to be put back into the services.  The document also states that when the valuation of each building and the lands in the mental health services is complete, that money would sufficiently counterbalance the capital costs of all of the required mental health services referred to in A Vision For Change.  Forgive me for being cynical but I know what will happen &mdash; the money will simply be ploughed into the Department of Finance.  With regard to adolescent psychiatric services, there was an announcement last year that an additional two beds would be provided.  Mental health is the poor relation of the health services.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to reassure the people of the midlands and the entire mid-Leinster area of what is to happen to those in the region who have psychiatric illness or intellectual problems.  Services for the intellectually impaired are provided now on a day care basis in a ward in St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital and 30 people have been able to avail of this.  No recommendation <Col N="519"/>has been offered for that service facility, which is called Lough Sheever, nor for the highly trained and experienced staff.  Where will they go?  I apologise for taking this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator McFadden for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the plans for the closure of the remaining old psychiatric hospitals.</P>
        <P>As the Senator mentioned, A Vision for Change is the report of the expert group on mental heath policy.  It provides a framework for action to develop modern, high quality mental health services over a seven to ten-year period.  The Government has accepted the recommendations of the report which, when implemented, will overhaul the existing mental health services and provide community-based interventions that are accessible and effective in promoting recovery and reintegration.</P>
        <P>The report recommended that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented and that the funds realised by the closures be reinvested in the new mental health infrastructure.  The Health Service Executive has disposed of a small number of psychiatric properties to date and the funds realised have been surrendered to the Exchequer.  The Department of Health and Children recently received a submission from the HSE outlining the projects it considers should be funded from these disposals and it will pursue these proposals with the Department of Finance.  The Department of Health and Children will seek also to agree an overall approach on the extent and timing of property disposals with the aim of facilitating the modernisation of the mental health infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The closure of the old psychiatric hospitals, the realisation of their asset value and the reassignment of staff from the hospital to community settings is key to the implementation of A Vision for Change.<i> </i> Concerns have been expressed that the closure programme has been delayed unnecessarily.  However, we must realise and recognise that no hospital can close until the needs of all the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings, such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres, and the necessary community-based, multi-disciplinary community mental health teams have been established.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, visited St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital last month to check on progress in respect of the proposed closure.  He was assured that the reconfiguration of the St. Loman&rsquo;s campus, which currently accommodates 119 patients, is the single highest priority for the HSE local office.  He was informed also that a development control plan for the hospital has been finalised.  In the plan there is provision for appropriate accommodation for all those patients still remaining in St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital.  Briefs for the provision of this alternative accommodation have been drawn up in consultation with staff.  In line with national policy, the phased relocation of patients to more appropriate community-based facilities has commenced.</P>
        <P>Although psychiatric hospitals were the mainstay of mental health services in Ireland for many years, the type of person-centred, recovery-oriented care recommended in A Vision for Change cannot be provided in such large institutions.  The focal point of modern mental health services is the community, and developing a community-based service is the way forward.  I, therefore, assure the Senator that the Government is fully committed to the closure of the old psychiatric hospitals, which I stress will be completed only when the needs of all remaining patients have been appropriately addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  Most of it concerned A Vision for Change, which we all accept is a very good document.  However, the Minister of State mentioned a development control plan.  Is it possible to get a copy of that plan?  I am <Col N="520"/>sure it is freely available.  Does the Minister of State know what it contains?  That was the bones of my Adjournment matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned provision for appropriate accommodation and the phased relocation of patients to appropriate community-based facilities.  My concern relates to the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, which is the operative word.  What is to become of the enormous facility at St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital?  It is a massive old building and is a protected structure.  Perhaps the Minister of State will return to me in her own time with answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the building is a protected structure, I know the Senator would not say it was necessarily the most appropriate place for modern care for the patients involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the plan about which the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, was advised when he visited Mullingar.  He was advised that the development control plan for the hospital had been finalised.  The phased relocation of the patients to more community-based facilities has commenced.  That is not to say it is being implemented, but there is a plan for it.</P>
