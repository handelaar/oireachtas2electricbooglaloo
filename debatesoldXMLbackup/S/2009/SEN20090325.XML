	<P>I have notice from Senator Maria Corrigan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to give an update on the current status of the request by the Institute of Clinical Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy to be registered as a designated profession within the meaning of section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify when the proposed building programme for Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen, County Galway, will receive sanction.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure there will be no reduction in teacher numbers at Aphort national school, Aran Islands.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to use the flexibility allowed under section 8 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009 to recognise the serious anomalies and injustices perpetrated by subjecting university research workers, in particular those in receipt of funds under the Health Research Board post-doctoral research fellowship scheme, to the pension levy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to exempt fishermen who do not target cod or who have caught less than 1.5% from the days-at-sea scheme, and to ensure the polyvalent entitlements of these fishermen are safeguarded.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, Senators on all sides voiced their serious concerns regarding the proposed national strike.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to meet the unions, which I hope will ensure the planned day of action will not proceed on Monday next.  As many Members observed, the proposed strike would be completely contrary to the national interest, would damage the country&rsquo;s reputation internationally and would further damage the economy.</P>
        <P>If the social partnership negotiations are to recommence and if they are to encompass the proposed budget, I wish to make it clear that Members on this side of the House want full access to the information that will be provided to the social partners.  We do not want the Seanad and the D&aacute;il to be bypassed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to be provided with the information that is required to allow us to participate, in a meaningful way, in the debate on decisions that will affect our children&rsquo;s lives and the future of this country and its economy.  As Deputy Bruton made clear in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Government has not supplied the information we require in respect of budgetary matters.  It is unacceptable to discuss national government or national partnership in a context where information is not being shared within the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Why is the Government behaving so deferentially towards the banks?  Today&rsquo;s editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> states the Government&rsquo;s attitude to the banks is quite extraordinary, particularly in light of the fact that taxpayers&rsquo; money has been used to bail out the banks, which made a number of remarkably bad decisions that have led to the economy being placed in such an uncommonly dangerous and serious position.  Why is so much deference being shown to the banks?  During the debate on the relevant legislation in this House and in the Lower House Fine Gael tabled amendments that would have prevented the payment of certain bonuses.  It appears the legislation introduced by the Government was not sufficiently strong.  Why was that the case and why did the Minister refuse to accept the amendments put forward by my party?  The Government had no difficulty introducing legislation containing a retrospective clause designed to take money from old age pensioners.  Why can this not be done in respect of bonuses and pension schemes which clearly run contrary to the national interest at this point?</P>
        <P>I am concerned with regard to appointments to State boards.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, made such an appointment recently and the gentleman in question has resigned on foot of certain taxation issues.  We must <Col N="717"/>put in place a new system in respect of appointments to State boards.  It is important, in the national interest, that such appointments should be scrutinised by the Oireachtas, either by a particular committee or, as proposed by my party, by the Seanad.  This House would be the ideal forum in which to scrutinise these appointments.  The time has come for cronyism to end.  It is now time that such appointments be made in the public interest.  One way to ensure that the latter would be for the Seanad or an appropriate committee of the Houses to hold hearings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for listening to the suggestion I made yesterday to the effect he should contact and engage with the social partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important move forward but it is incumbent on us to consider the next step.  The points raised by Senator Fitzgerald are extremely important.  However, I wish to provide another perspective.  The debates that will take place in the Seanad in respect of the economy etc., will revolve around Ireland Inc.  However, those that will take place between the Government and the social partners will relate to the Irish people.  This House has not engaged in the type of wide-ranging debates on social justice, inequality etc., that one would have expected.  There are certain individuals who raise such matters on a regular basis, but there is no engagement in respect of them.  However, the debates that will take place within the social partnership framework will focus on matters such as fairness, certain elements of taxation, social justice and so on.</P>
        <P>If the proposed national strike is, as expected, called off, let no one be under the illusion that this will have happened on foot of what is happening to the economy.  Those who will be responsible for calling off the strike do not trust the people who are in charge of the economy.  They are of the view that, like everyone else, they have been booted by the latter.  Let us not believe that this is the end of something; it is rather the beginning of something.  We have an opportunity to clear out the individuals responsible for placing us in the mess in which we find ourselves and to move forward.  In that context, I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that we should discuss this matter on a step-by-step basis.</P>
        <P>In my experience, it is not the case that the Government makes available to the social partners information which is not made available to everybody else.  However, the documents which contain such information are not exciting; they are comprised of dull CSO figures, economic indicators and views expressed by the Department of Finance.  When such documents are circulated, how many Members will read and discuss them?  Under the Constitution, the Government may not make available to Opposition parties any budgetary documentation because to do so would result in a breach of Cabinet confidentiality.  There will not be a debate on the budget.  Rather, we will engage in a debate on the views of particular people that will inform the budget.  There will be a great opportunity for Members to engage in such a debate tomorrow and I look forward to that.</P>
        <P>It is time the House debated third level fees.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue to which I refer has been raised on a number of occasions but there is now a real need to give consideration to it.  This is a classic example of the social partnership approach.  I guarantee that the debate on this matter in the House will focus on costs, the children of millionaires etc.  Third level education is as important as primary level education.  It represents an investment in the economy and all our futures; it is not a gift to <Col N="718"/>certain people.  Third level education should be paid for by the State for its citizens in order that we might obtain a return in later years.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the way in which we should consider this matter.  I ask the Leader to make time available for a debate on third level education at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the news that the social partners are to reconvene for discussions on the economy.  However, I wish to place on record the fact that the outcome of these discussions will have no moral standing, particularly if they fail to address the completely unfair cuts to public sector pay.  The contribution that has been deducted from the salaries of public sector workers, on foot of legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, must be taken into account in any financial formula that is arrived at in the discussions.</P>
        <P>The unions were right to walk away from the process because they were not given adequate time to consider the implications of the pension levy.  When it was put forward initially, what was on the table was called the national economic recovery plan and the pay cut to be imposed on public and civil servants was intended to save &euro;1.4 billion.  The latter figure was eventually reduced to &euro;900 million.  It now appears that public sector workers in semi-State bodies will not be subject to the cut, so there will be a further reduction of &euro;160 million.</P>
        <P>The imposition of the pension levy on retained firefighters must be discontinued.  These individuals have been subjected to the levy, even though they do not receive pensions.  The levy must also be removed from all workers who do not benefit from public service pensions.  In addition, we must end the anomalies which have led to some workers on lower rates of pay losing more money than those earning &euro;10,000 more than them.  There should be far larger cuts in respect of certain individuals &mdash; for example, those earning &euro;300,000 whose salaries will be reduced to &euro;270,000 &mdash; because what is in place at present does not constitute sharing the pain.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiative under which 27,000 transition year students are to be trained in CPR.  Clonmel is a HeartSafe town and is the only town in Ireland on which this status has been conferred.  Under the HeartSafe programme, some 15 automated external defibrillator, AED, machines are located throughout the town and ten different people are trained to use each machine.  I am the chairperson of the programme and I call on the Leader to ensure that all public servants and Members of this House should be trained in the art of CPR.  As public representatives, community leaders and individuals who are quite often involved in addressing large groups of personnel, it is important that Members should lead by example.  Transition year students who avail of the programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I apologise for interrupting the Senator but certain Members are chatting among themselves.  There is plenty of room outside the Chamber for those who wish to talk to each other on an informal basis.  Courtesy should be shown to the Member who is in possession.  I again apologise for interrupting Senator Prendergast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Defibrillators are available on-site in the Houses of the Oireachtas and all personnel should be aware of their location and how they are used.  These machines are so easy to use and they help save lives.  I welcome the initiative in respect of transition year students but I would like it to be extended to Members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Members should all be conversant in how to resuscitate someone if it should prove necessary to do so.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Since my party&rsquo;s participation in Government several appointments have been made by both Green Party Ministers &mdash; for instance, a former secretary general of the Labour Party was appointed to the chair of Sustainable Energy Ireland and a key member of the Labour Party, a brother of a former party leader, was appointed to run the board of the ESB.  The person in question in regard to yesterday&rsquo;s activity is a former Progressive Democrats candidate.  At every opportunity the ability of the person should be considered.  I am pleased that, when compromising circumstances arose, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government took it upon himself to talk to the person concerned and that person took immediate action.  That contrasts wildly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Please, we are having questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate should take into account those factors because we are living in circumstances where people in society are hanging on by their fingertips months after the compromising behaviour that has brought shame on this country.  We need this debate.  We, as a Seanad, can inform a better system and we can be the mechanism for putting that in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I missed some Members yesterday who indicated early.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a matter relating to carers, which I have raised in the House on many previous occasions.  I would like the Leader to organise at the earliest opportunity with the appropriate Minister a debate on carers, the rules governing carer&rsquo;s allowance and what possible further assistance we can give to the people providing full-time care and attention to elderly persons in our community.</P>
        <P>My colleagues will be aware that the Carers Association will hold a session for all of us in Buswells Hotel and I encourage people to attend.  One of the aspects of today&rsquo;s presentation from the carers&rsquo; groups is to ask us to reflect upon the fact that approximately 160,000 people provide full-time care and attention in the community.  Even though some carers are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, they fall under the radar from the point of view of an economic statistic. <Col N="720"/> They ask that we would at least recognise by way of GDP calculations the work being done by those people.  I ask the Leader to put whatever measures are necessary in place to recognise that fact.</P>
        <P>The issue I have raised many times in the House is that of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  To the eternal credit of a previous Minister, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, he made tremendous strides in making the carer&rsquo;s allowance payable to a significantly larger number of people.  Equally, as I said directly to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs some months ago, I am very disappointed at both her attitude and commitment to the carer&rsquo;s allowance system.  I was very surprised at her lack of a holistic approach to caring.  As a minimum we should remove the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance so that everybody providing full-time care and attention to people in need of it receive that allowance.  It would be a tiny financial burden as per the figures supplied by the previous Minister, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  Even in today&rsquo;s hard-pressed economic times, the cost of providing non-means tested carer&rsquo;s allowance to full-time carers is minimal, but it would be a strong statement as to where we, as a community, stand <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>our elderly.</P>
        <P>I welcome to an extent the progress made in regard to a fair deal and the provision of assistance for nursing home care but I would be very disappointed if we saw a nice, tidy, clean bed in a clean nursing home as our only aspiration for the elderly.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>It can only come about through changes to schemes such as the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I hope that even in these hard-pressed financial times we will respond to groups such as the Carers Association because the way we respond to our elderly and to the people providing full-time care in the home and the community speaks volumes as to where we are and more important where we are going as a society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, very much welcome the talks the Government has initiated involving the social partners and hope they will lead to early progress.  Will the Leader indicate when the details of the package associated with the recapitalisation scheme proposed for the banks, specifically the &euro;3.5 billion each for AIB and Bank of Ireland, will be made known?  I accept there were some difficulties in regard to salaries and bonuses, and, obviously, there are other matters to be dealt with.  I would like the Leader to comment on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, taxpayers are actively assisting the banks in the interest of the economy and in the national interest.  As a result of the guarantee scheme and the measures relating to recapitalisation, restructuring seems to have been forgotten about, even though it was mentioned many months ago by the Minister for Finance.  Apart from legal power, the Government has significant moral authority.  It has two public interest directors appointed to each of the financial institutions concerned.  I hope the Government is not long-fingering the situation in regard to Irish Nationwide because, as I understand it, the Minister for Finance has asked the two public interest directors there to conduct an inquiry, which could <Col N="721"/>be open ended. We can easily and speedily empower the Director of Corporate Enforcement to deal with financial institutions not incorporated under the Companies Act.  I would like to hear the Leader&rsquo;s view on this matter because it is of the utmost importance.  All this is damaging to confidence and without confidence we will not be able to go forward.  Will the Leader update us on the Government&rsquo;s position?</P>

	<P>It was my intention to propose an amendment to the Order of Business today to debate a motion tabled by Senator Ross and me that Seanad &Eacute;ireann views with concern the proposal by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to organise a one-day strike and calls on it to cancel that proposed day of action, acknowledging as we do that the recent budgetary provisions have led to serious inequities, which require to be addressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased that, in light of the developments of the past 24 hours and since it looks very likely that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will respond to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s invitation and that we will not have the folly of a day of action on Monday, it is not necessary for me to propose the amendment.  It is worth repeating, however, what I said previously, that leadership is what we need at this time.  To even consider leading people into strike action suggests a profound lack of leadership in certain quarters where one would expect more.  It is almost as though people are looking into the abyss and they think they are at the movies.  We are in a very serious situation.</P>
        <P>I much preferred Fine Gael&rsquo;s approach to that of the Labour Party yesterday.  It does not behove us to say that it is bad for people to go on strike but to use the opportunity to have a tilt at the Government.  There is a long and inglorious history in this country of deploring certain actions and then blaming somebody other than the perpetrators &mdash; I acknowledge that happened in much more grave situations.  Leadership is about taking an unpopular stance.  I do not like the phrase &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo; but it is important that we facilitate the best national effort in dealing with the real crisis that is before us.</P>
        <P>Ba bhre&aacute; liom a lua go bhfuil an eagra&iacute;ocht ASH Ireland ag iarraidh go gcuirfear &euro;2 sa bhreis ar luach 20 toit&iacute;n sa bhuis&eacute;ad at&aacute; le teacht.  Bh&iacute; pl&eacute; faoi seo againn cheana agus is cuimhin liom rud a d&uacute;irt an tAire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, nuair a bh&iacute; an buis&eacute;ad is d&eacute;ana&iacute; againn, which was introduced more recently than we all care to remember.  He made the point that one consequence of increasing the price of cigarettes would be to increase the risk of smuggling.  I do not believe that is a sufficiently substantial reason not to look seriously at significantly increasing cigarette prices.  It has been said that an increase of &euro;2 on the price of cigarettes would net &euro;420 million for the economy.

        <P>We would all like the people to take the opportunity presented to us by global Earth Hour on Saturday at 8.30 p.m. when lights will be turned off for one hour.  This is not only a symbolic but a substantial opportunity to generate awareness about the importance of our environment.</P>

	<P>In the recent past many colleagues have called for debate on the HSE.  I re-echo that call for particular reasons, not least the impending proposal of the HSE to remove a specialist dermatology service from the hospital in Mullingar.  A dermatologist was recruited for the hospital but she was provided with only scant resources.  Now she has left and two new dermatologists are to be recruited, not for Mullingar but for a hospital well known to the Cathaoirleach.  In that regard, I find the actions of an individual are questionable and ask the Leader to arrange as a matter of urgency for the Minister, Deputy Harney, to come to the House to give the reason for this.  I also ask that the individual or individuals concerned be called before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to explain the &ldquo;rationale&rdquo; for this decision.</P>

There are many opposing forces in the country, whether in the social partnership or political system or among the general public, as a result of the unrest that exists and there is greater need than ever for all of us to pull together.  The Government must show leadership in this regard.  It must set the template to allow the social partners and the Oireachtas, both D&aacute;il and Seanad, engage in finding a way to fight our way out of the economic mess in which we have found ourselves and to contribute constructively to the debate to formulate a strategy to get us out of this crisis.</P>
        <P>The participation of Oireachtas Members in negotiations is vital.  Social partnership has served the country well and has been vital, but the Oireachtas has been sidelined to a large degree.  The people are now looking to their political leaders for leadership.  We should unite the three areas in the negotiations.  The first aim should be to achieve fairness.  If fairness is applied across the board, people will understand and buy into the process.  We also need honesty.  We need honesty from Government with regard to the crisis and need to know the full measure of it.  We hear conflicting messages from various Ministers with regard to the deficits faced by the country.  We need honesty and up-front figures so we can all work together to get out of the crisis.  We also need full realisation across all sectors of the crisis, so that we all buy into the rescue process and can believe and agree we can work our way out of it.  That is the only way we can get out of it.</P>
        <P>The budget is due on 7 April.  We are all aware of the despondency and frustration among the public.  We on this side of the House recognise that difficult decisions must be made and taken.  I appeal to the Leader to speak out in his parliamentary party and send the message to Government that it cannot be all slash and burn or cuts across the board.  As leaders in the Oireachtas we need to bring some vision and hope to the people.  We need to offer hope to all sectors.  We need vision and innovation and must promote those areas and bring stimulus packages to the economy.  It must not be all one-sided cut and burn.  We must provide a stimulus, create jobs and find alternative strategies to replace the thousands of jobs that have been lost.  I appeal to the Leader to engage with us and the people and we will work our way out of the crisis.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s initiative for talks with the social partners.  Hopefully, we will see good social and industrial progress as a result of those endeavours.  I join Senator Bradford&rsquo;s call for support for the good work of the Carers Association and for <Col N="723"/>its day today.  Enda Egan and his team do tremendous work.  We are all aware of the importance of home care and I wholeheartedly support him in that regard.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader contact telecom service providers to find out what supports and priorities are in place when there is a breakdown in the systems?  It has been brought to my attention that a business that depends on its telecommunication system was advised when it reported a breakdown yesterday that it will take approximately four days to deal with that.  We all understand these are challenging times for businesses, but there is a need for an emergency response repair unit for each of our telecom providers to ensure a satisfactory response is provided to the business community.</P>
        <P>I remind the Leader of the need for restructuring of the fee and collection process for TV licences.  The application of the existing system is unfair and the method of collection of fees is expensive and obsolete.  I ask the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister to see what progress can be made to ensure we have a fairer, more effective and less expensive system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I find myself in the highly unusual position of disagreeing with my distinguished colleague Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole on virtually everything he said.  I disagree first on the issue of fees.  I have always objected to the phrase &ldquo;free fees&rdquo;.  It is an ugly phrase and a complete oxymoron.  It is nonsense and means nothing.  There is no such thing as free fees because someone somewhere is paying.  It is inappropriate that the poorest in society, old age pensioners and so on, should have some of their tax money distrained to pay for fees.  That is wrong.  I have said this to the student leaders and said it publicly in Trinity College.  I know saying this will not get votes for me, but I believe in telling what I see to be the truth even though people may not like what I say.</P>
        <P>The real battle is elsewhere.  It is taking place as we speak between the Department of Finance and the Department of Education and Science.  We should be fighting to ensure that moneys brought in by a change in the regime will be ringfenced for third level education.  It must not go into the general Exchequer.</P>

	<P>This must be our fight if we really value education.  Another battle to be fought is that for an appropriate means test.  We must not disadvantage anybody.  It would be shameful to take money from the poor to educate the rich.  I know that argument does not appeal to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, but I feel strongly about it.  I have spoken to my friends on the left who have talked about changing the tax regime.  That is all right in a utopian world, but in advance of a change in the tax regime, it is nothing other than ideologically driven rubbish to suggest this country can afford not to look after the most vulnerable.</P>
        <P>I half disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the issue of the inclusion of this House in the general discussions on the economy and the disproportionate weight given to social partnership.  He is quite wrong about equality not being discussed here but being discussed in that forum.  It is the other way round.  I watched in horror as the trade unions stood idly by on the margins as the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty and other agencies were destroyed and obliterated by the Government in this House.  I used my Private Members&rsquo; time to discuss the issue, but nobody paid any attention, including the media which was issued with my speech and those of others taking part in the debate.  The debate took place here, but it was not covered.  The trade unions should be ashamed of themselves for not standing up and fighting on that issue.</P>

That is not accurate and I ask him to reflect upon it.  I understand opposition from the Leader has placed the Cathaoirleach in the embarrassing position of having to say continually he must hear contributions from Members that were not allowed on the preceding day.  There is a backlog and it is a nonsense and farce.  Will the Leader state when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will meet?  I ask him not to oppose, on this occasion, the extension of the Order of Business so Members can be facilitated.</P>

	<P>I, too, welcome the social partners&rsquo; acceptance of the Government&rsquo;s invitation to have talks with it.  I am sure Senator O&rsquo;Toole had some little part to play in that.  His contribution yesterday was very important and it established in the House a proper and unanimous position on how the unions, including the social partners, should approach the present crisis.  A new model of social partnership will have to be devised.  The old one worked very well in recent years but we now find ourselves in a different position.  We will, therefore, have to devise a new model.  This is important.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, to come to the House to consider the fact that there are three tourism organisations, something we do not need.  I suggest that they be amalgamated into one organisation.  The quangos we have cost us approximately &euro;6 billion in total.</P>

This would result in a substantial saving in the context of the budget to be introduced very soon.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn referred to the Health Service Executive.  We were told it would be reorganised into four units but we have not seen any evidence to date as to how it will be structured.  Will the Minister for Health and Children answer questions in the House in this regard?  There is considerable duplication to be dealt with and issues arise regarding middle management.  These issues should be dealt with in the context of the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today concerning the comments by the German Social Democratic Party spokesperson on European affairs, Mr. <Col N="725"/>Axel Sch&auml;fer.  He stated Germany is prepared to assist countries within the eurozone that are in economic difficulty but that &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be the case that, in a referendum, people say &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t need Europe, Europe is hindering us&rsquo; and then, months later when in difficulty, say, &lsquo;We need help. Where&rsquo;s Europe?&rsquo; &ldquo;  He implied aid from Germany to a country in economic difficulty like Ireland would be contingent on such reciprocity or a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  Those statements, which are very crude and may concern German internal politics more than European policy, show where things have gone wrong for Ireland.  Many of the measures, funds, concessions and derogations we obtained from the European Union were based on goodwill towards Ireland.  It now appears it is <i>realpolitik</i> and that there will be nothing for nothing.</P>
        <P>One must ask where it went wrong.  After the 2001 budget, an early warning was given by the European Union to Charlie McCreevy, then Minister for Finance, suggesting it was too expansionary, that expenditure was too high and that it would create inflation and lead to trouble.  We rejected the recommendation by Brussels and since then our economic policy was such that we decided we knew best, could go it alone and do it our way.  This has led to our current economic difficulties.</P>
        <P>Two issues arise in this regard.  The editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> has pointed out in that newspaper&rsquo;s editorial today that Mr. Sch&auml;fer has used crude language but that we must adopt measures to ensure we will not need emergency aid from the European Union.  This is critical and we have an opportunity to achieve this, beginning with the budget in April.  Furthermore, we must repair our relationship with the European Union.  When we voted to join the European Union, it was in our economic interest.  To pass the Lisbon treaty is not about our place in Europe or about this, that or the other; it is about our basic interest in restoring and securing our economic future.  I ask the Leader to state whether he agrees with this assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday in this House we had an exceptional show of unity on the proposed general strike.  It was quite clear that the general good of the country superseded that of sectional interests.  I, as with other Members this morning, welcome the regeneration of social partnership.  It will be far more effective to have formal discussions than to depend on a microphone at the back a truck outside the House.  We all know full well that a sense of realism is developing among the people as regards the crisis we face.  I sense many sections of the media are demonstrating a sense of responsibility and we should build on this.</P>
        <P>The Opposition makes a very good point when it seeks a more clearly defined, pivotal role in what is happening.  Just because a particular model applied in the Oireachtas in the past does not mean it should continue to apply in the middle of a crisis.  We should listen a little more closely to the speakers on the other side of the House to determine how this might be achieved.  This problem will not go away in one to three weeks and people are setting parameters of four or five years.  It does not mean we will not see progress within a 12-month period but we must batten down the hatches and accept that it will take four or five years to address the problem.  If this is the case and based on what happened in this House yesterday, there are opportunities for offering the type of leadership that has been requested here in debates on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>This House has been subject to media scrutiny in recent times.  I regard much of it as entertainment and as exceptionally peripheral.  It is just because there is a vacuum at present.  We should study closely the opportunities that are now being presented to the Seanad.  We do not need constitutional change to have reform because we can achieve it ourselves and provide the leadership that is required.  However, this will require courage and we must be non-partisan in this regard.  We are being watched very closely by the people, particularly the most vulnerable, not only those who have lost jobs, which is traumatic in itself, but also those who fear they may lose theirs.</P><Col N="726"/>
        <P>We need to send out a strong message that we are united in trying to find a solution to the problems that arise.  We need to send the message beyond this island because it is still an attractive destination for investors.  I am not referring only to the &euro;100 million contract during St. Patrick&rsquo;s week.  I know for a fact this is still a country that will attract investors.  However, they will look very closely at what environment is being offered to them.  We should not glibly pass over comments that may come from the Opposition here each day.  We should try to see how we interact and how we can build on it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join other Senators in welcoming the developments with regard to the strike.  I am glad to hear Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; recognise that there is unanimous agreement in the House that a strike would be a retrograde step.  This point does not seem to have been picked up by all Senators.  We welcome the developments and it is good news.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader help with regard to the recent issue of humanitarian aid for Gaza?  He may be aware that four containers from the Galway region have been held up by the authorities in Egypt.  Is it possible for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make efforts within the European Union to put pressure on the authorities to release this aid?  There is a need for this aid to be released and to get through to the people of Gaza as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I wish to pick up on a point made by another Senator who made several swipes at the Labour Party this morning.  Senator Alex White did not pick the panel for &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; last Friday night in the same way as Senators David Norris or Donie Cassidy did not pick the panel.  Senator Alex White was asked to go on the panel which was picked by somebody else.  Senator Alex White is a good defender of gender balance and he is excellent at speaking on minorities.</P>

        <P Just="Left">We need to discuss third level fees and how best to move forward on this matter.  Many good suggestions are being made inside and outside this House.  It would be great to have a brainstorming session on this matter.  We may not get anywhere but this is what this Chamber should be about.  We should thrash out issues and do what we can.  We have received very bad press recently and it is up to us to fight the case that we are well able to conduct our business with knowledge and know-how and articulate those views very strongly.</P>
        <P>There has been bad press with regard to a bail out in return for conditions with regard to the Lisbon treaty.  This is not on the agenda.  However, we should debate this matter in the House and incorporate a discussion on Seanad reform and how best we can move forward with regard to social partnership and bringing forward a new agenda for the Lisbon treaty and other <Col N="727"/>issues.  This is not a talk shop.  Many of our views are taken up.  I want all of us to echo this across the floor.  Otherwise, we will be downgraded and this is not good enough for any of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that we are not a talk shop and that the Leader has the ear of the Taoiseach, will the Leader highlight the Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by Fine Gael last week on how we could save the country &euro;34 million to &euro;40 million by reducing the number of Ministers of State by eight and the number of Oireachtas committees by ten and by not allowing serving Members to avail of ministerial pensions?</P>
        <P>To pick up on what my good colleague across the floor stated on the Midland Regional Hospital, in the recent survey conducted by the HSE, Mallow Hospital, St. Vincent&rsquo;s and the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar were described as satisfactory.  The overall results of the survey were deplorable.  No hospital got a good rating but at least those three were satisfactory.  The idea that services would be taken from the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar at this crucial time for the people of the midlands is an outrage.</P>
        <P>I have raised the issues of the services provided by the colposcopy and sexual assault units which will be removed from Mullingar to a hospital in Tullamore which has no obstetrics or consultants to deal with such issues.  Will the Leader bring the Minister for Health and Children to the House and raise the issue with her and the Joint Committee on Health and Children that dermatology services will not be removed from Mullingar Regional Hospital?  This is like the underlying operation of the Hanly report.  We need to keep our services for local people in local areas.  I call on the Leader to ensure this continues.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Prendergast&rsquo;s comments on defibrillators and CPR.  I compliment the GAA and the VHI.  The VHI has provided free lessons to people on using defibrillators.  I do not know where is the defibrillator in this House.  There is no point in having them tucked away in presses or lockers if people do not know where they are or how to use them.  The same applies to bingo halls, churches and schools.  This is another issue which the Minister should come to the House to discuss.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Like others I welcome developments and the talks that will ensue with the social partners.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that there is talk of bail outs from other countries.  We are so far removed from the reality of a bail out that we should put it in perspective.  In the 1980s when the debt of this nation was at 130% of GNP, and not 30% as it stands this year or 50% as it will be next year, and interest rates were at 18%, this country managed to pay in full its debts.  It seems to be a bit of a nonsense when our debt will be at 50% next year and interest rates are at 4.5% that people are talking about default.  There is absolutely no possibility of this whatsoever.  This country is well placed to deal with an international crisis.  Yes, there was a problem in the banking industry.  However, we have ensured low taxation which allows for an increase if necessary.  We have ensured a low national debt, which is at 20% if we include some of the external assets.  We have put away money in the national treasury.  I suggest that we are very well placed and the discussions that take place on this issue are a nonsense.</P>
        <P>This week we recognise organ donors and we hope to have a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this issue.  I look forward to this debate and to a full and wholesome response.  I hope we can do something to ensure there is an assumption of consent to organ donation.  It is particularly important that this is fully supported at hospital level to ensure people understand what is happening.  This happens in Spain and it seems to get very good results.  This is not a matter of legislation only.  We must ensure support.</P>
        <P>The International Criminal Court in the Hague has issued a warrant for the arrest of the leader of Sudan.  This is entirely appropriate.  President Roosevelt warned the German Nazi&rsquo;s <Col N="728"/>that they would face retribution for their crimes and there seemed to have been a fall-off in the amount and extent of their crimes in the reality that they were losing the war and that they would pay.  It is good that people will be held accountable here and now for their crimes.</P>

	<P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to the fact that we will all be in a much better humour next Sunday evening because we will have an extra hour of daylight.  This is an old topic of mine and I want the Leader to point out to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that we can do something about this.  There will be an opportunity next October to join central European time and it would be a win win situation.  It would benefit business, tourism and road safety as well as in terms of energy savings, which are now more important than ever.  The benefits would be such that we should not turn aside the opportunity to join central European time permanently, apart from the fact that we would all feel better about it.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue in the past and we were told that we must talk to our neighbours about it, but we do not need to talk to our neighbours about it.  If the Minister declared that next October we will not go back to winter time but will stay in line with central European time, the benefits in being able to do business with Europe and in many other ways would be great.  Even though some will say that we should not do so without Britain doing it as well, but we led the way with the smoking ban and the plastic bag levy so we can lead the way with this.  The benefits are such that I believe that Britain would follow us very quickly.  We are in danger of saying that we should not move out of the nursery without nanny, but I believe that we should leave the nursery even if nanny does not come with us.  We should set that standard.  I want the Leader to point out to the Minister the benefits of using central European time<b> </b>the whole year around.  The extra hour of daylight is of such benefit in so many different ways that we should do so immediately.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Prendergast, Boyle, Coghlan, Coffey, Callely, Buttimer, Regan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Ormonde and Hanafin welcomed the possibility that the national strike will be called off next Monday.  I had the opportunity to inform the House yesterday that the Taoiseach had called on everyone concerned back to talks about the economic plan.  Some colleagues might not have realised that that took place in the House, but with committee meetings also taking place, it is not easy to be everywhere.  The initiative taken by the Taoiseach will hopefully bear fruit.  Everyone responsible has said how important it is for the image of Ireland throughout the world that this strike does not take place, and, please God, it will not take place.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Norris and Ormonde called for a debate on third level fees.  I have no difficulty in making time available for this.  Senators Prendergast and McFadden called for all public persons, including Members in this House, to be trained in CPR.  I congratulate all organisations, particularly voluntary organisations, including sporting organisations, that have done great work to fund raise for equipment and training in this whole area.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford and Callely called for a debate on carers.  I know carers are in town today.  Senator Bradford pointed out that there are 160,000 people working directly in that service.  The former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, made an indelible mark in helping carers.  I have no difficulty in making time available for such a debate.  When the Minister is in the House tomorrow, I urge Senators to make their case about means testing for carers.  The worth of the work done by carers cannot be repaid in monetary terms alone.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen spoke about motion 37 on the Order Paper in his name and that of Senator Shane Ross, which is related to calling off the strike.  I hope that events have overtaken that.  I <Col N="729"/>gave the Senator my word on the phone yesterday that I would visit this after the Order of Business today.  Maybe we should leave it until Private Members&rsquo; time at 5 p.m. and see what progress takes place during the day.  I have no difficulty in taking the debate tomorrow after the pre-budget statements if progress has not been made.  There is nothing more important to this country than calling off that strike.  I thank the Senator for putting down the motion.  He also brought to the attention of the House the fact that private and public buildings across Ireland will be among those 1,000 locations in the world that will be pitched into darkness next Saturday at 8.30 p.m. for Earth Hour.  I welcome that call, but we have a dilemma in Mullingar because I understand that the Labour Party conference, which will take place there at the weekend, will be broadcast live on television at that time.  I must discuss that issue with colleagues to see if we can bring forward the broadcast time.</P>

	<P>Senators Glynn, Buttimer and McFadden brought a very important point to my attention, the rumour that the dermatology unit in Mullingar might be closed.  Almost 500 patients have been waiting for years for dermatology treatment in the Westmeath-Longford area and we will not take this lying down.  There will be an urgent debate on this tomorrow afternoon on the Adjournment, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach.  I urge the chairperson and members of the health committee as a matter of urgency to bring the person responsible before the committee next week to answer for this because it is not acceptable, particularly to the people of Longford who have no hospital and agreed to come to Mullingar for treatment.  Everything is going to larger towns and influential areas, but Mullingar does not have a third level institute or other services even though it has a huge population.  It certainly needs support.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that she would reward the hospitals that are leading by example.  Yesterday I congratulated the management and staff at the hospital in Mullingar on their achievements as outlined in the latest report on hospital standards.  It is a credit to Trevor O&rsquo;Callaghan, the staff, consultants and everyone who are making Mullingar the shining example to Ireland.  This is the third report in which Mullingar has been at the top in terms of quality.  Surely the Minister cannot allow an individual in the HSE to change this.  Is this the gratitude the HSE will show to the hospital that is leading by example?  We will watch and see.  The Minister gave her word in this House that she would reward those who are making the best efforts and leading by example.  I have known her for over 30 years and I am watching this space on how she will deal with this.  I know she will deal with it.</P>

	<P>Senator Callely spoke about telecom supports.  I certainly can give him an undertaking that I will raise these matters urgently with the Minister.  I thank him for bringing the issue to the attention of the House.  Senator Norris raised the timeframe for speaking in the House.  We already extended it to ten minutes because we know how long-winded the Senator can be from time to time.  In fairness to you, a Chathaoirligh, you give the Senator latitude, but I suggest he take up the matter with the leader of his group and we can discuss it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on organ donation.  There is no difficulty in making time available for this.  It is a very worthy request and all sides can support it.  Senator Quinn called for a permanent move to central European time.  I realise Senator Quinn has made the proposal before to leave central European time, which has been known as new time throughout the years, all year round.  There could be a significant advantage in energy savings and the other areas outlined by the Senator.  We can discuss the matter and I am prepared to allow time to consider it at the appropriate time when the Minister is available.</P>
        <P>We can discuss the possibility of having another pilot scheme.  I recall some years ago it was done on a pilot basis, but in rural Ireland it was not successful because it was dark until<?oasys _jy ?>9.30 a.m., especially in December and January.  There was a good deal of concern among parents because children were going to school and waiting for buses at crossroads and various other places at that time.  However, Ireland has moved on considerably since then and it is never the wrong time to do the right thing.  We can debate and discuss the matter to establish how we can make progress in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler called for a debate on tourism.  I am pleased to inform the Senator that tourism will be discussed in the House this afternoon between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.  That will be an ideal time and opportunity for anyone who wishes to make views known to the Minister in respect of the challenges in the tourism sector, which are the same as every other sector at present.  We look forward to the debate with the Minister this afternoon.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan remarked on where our interests lie.  They lie in the heart of Europe.  We all support our membership of the European Union.  Ireland is a changed place since 1973 when the late, great Jack Lynch signed our admission to the European Economic Community.  Let us consider where we would be now were we not in the monetary section of the European Union.  Interest rates are at an historic low, which is the only positive thing occurring at present to give people hope for the future in respect of mortgages and in respect of investment on the other side.  We will do anything we can on this side of the House and I realise almost all colleagues on the other side of the House fully support the proposed referendum on the acceptance of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>We have made many friends and colleagues within Europe, whether from dealing with the Cohesion Fund or the Leader programme.  Such funding has transformed our infrastructure, for example, roads and water and sewerage schemes.  Europe has been to the fore in all the positive things that have occurred in Ireland in the past 30 to 35 years, including developments in agriculture such as the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We have been net beneficiaries to the extent of a ratio of 5:1 in respect of our investment, which is magnificent.  We see ourselves in the future at the centre stage of the European Union.  I fully agree with Senator Regan in respect of most of the views expressed regarding where we are going in the future.</P>
        <P>I will pass on the strong views of Senator Hannigan to the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the delays being experienced by the four truckloads of humanitarian aid for Gaza and its poor unfortunate people.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden again called to have the Fine Gael proposals on Oireachtas reform discussed.  I will pass her views on to the Taoiseach this afternoon.  If time is required and if it is necessary, we will revisit the matter.  Last week we discussed Seanad reform as part of an excellent debate.  It was one of the best debates which took place in the House in respect of reform.  We certainly will consider it because the Minister is due to revert to the committee by 22 April.  We hope that will be one of the final deliberations on the report before us.  If anyone <Col N="731"/>has any further proposals or anything for consideration, the time to submit them is before 22 April.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding that we are taking all remaining Stages of the Bill today, will the Minister of State consider asking his officials to draft an amendment to try to streamline the Bill and make it more user-friendly?  This is the reason I make the request and to remove any ambiguity.  There is a reference in section 4 to a date not less than 50 days and not more than 60 days.  Will the Minister of State facilitate a break between Committee and Report Stages to ask his officials to amend the section to give a specific date and clear timeframe to anyone reading the Bill?  This would remove any ambiguity and allow the Bill to be streamlined and made more user-friendly.  It would make it easier for the ordinary person to read and understand the legislation.  The Minister of State should remember that there will be many candidates who will have to comply with the Bill, who will be busy with electioneering and campaigning, and who will wish to comply with the legislation which, it appears, will be in place after today.  Will the Minister of State consider the proposal to set a specific timeframe of either 50 days or 60 days?  Support would be forthcoming from this side of the House were he to do so.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 4, to delete &ldquo;shall incur&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may apply to their election expenses&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment has been tabled to remove any ambiguity with regard to the wording of the section, which states that where a political party authenticates the candidature of a candidate at a local election, the party shall incur ten per cent of the amount of the election expenses.  We on this side of the House believe the term &ldquo;shall incur&rdquo; is a rather strict one to use.  Will the Minister of State consider amending the wording to read &ldquo;the party may apply to their election expenses ten per cent of the election expenses&rdquo; to which that candidate is entitled?  It allows a little flexibility and removes the strictness of the term.  The wording seems somewhat strong so perhaps the Minister of State would consider the amendment for this reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>On the earlier point made by Senator Coffey, the Minister will make an order in respect of the number of days.  We have provided in the Bill for between 50 and 60 days, as the Senator mentioned.  The reason these parameters have been set is to ensure the policy is set in primary legislation.  If no upper or lower parameters were set, the Minister of the day effectively would have an unfettered ability to set the spending limit period by order and, in theory, could act against the spirit of the legislation.  I assure the Senator the Minister will make an order in respect of the number of days.</P><Col N="732"/>
        <P>In responding to the amendment, it may be beneficial if I outline in greater detail the intention behind the provision contained in section 4, which deals with the allocation of a portion of a candidate&rsquo;s spending limit for the use of the national agent of a political party.  As is the case with D&aacute;il and other election codes, the spending limits for local elections will apply to individual candidates in the first instance.  However, unlike the spending limits which operate for other electoral codes, candidates nominated by a political party will be deemed to automatically allocate 10% of their spending limits for use by the party&rsquo;s national agent at national level.  For example, a party candidate with a limit of &euro;7,500 will be deemed to automatically allocate &euro;750 for use by his or her party.  There is no provision to allow this figure to be varied upwards or downwards by written agreement between a candidate and the national agent of his or her political party.</P>
        <P>The maximum the national agent of the party may spend will be the sum of the amounts allocated by the individual candidates.  This can be spent nationally or within an electoral area and the national agent may also authorise a designated person locally to incur a portion of the expenditure that has been allocated to him or her.</P>
        <P>Under the current arrangements for D&aacute;il elections, when candidates allocate a portion of their limit for use by the national agent of their party this must be done in writing.  Given the number of candidates involved in the local elections, this approach would create significant administrative difficulties and would be unwieldy to the point of being inoperable.  A position will therefore apply whereby 10% of a candidate&rsquo;s limit will be deemed to be allocated for use by the national agent.  This will allow sufficient latitude for political parties to fund their election campaigns at local elections.  An option is also available to vary the amount, although this would have to be done in writing.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that written agreements would follow a similar form to those used at general elections where a candidate or his or her agent can apportion part of his or her spending limit to the national agent of his or her party.  The wording of the Bill as it stands achieves the objective I have set out and has been approved by the Parliamentary Counsel.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  While I understand his position, clarity is required on this issue.  For example, in the event of a candidate standing for election to both a town and a county council, how will the 10% figure be calculated?  Will the candidate allocate to the national agent 10% of the total expenditure limit or 10% of the larger of the two limits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>In such circumstances, the candidate would allocate 10% of the combined figure to the party&rsquo;s national agent. </P>

        <P LI="1">In page 8, line 3, to delete &ldquo;7&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to extend from seven to ten days the period within which candidates must remove election posters to avoid prosecution under the Litter Pollution Act.  Polling usually takes place on a Friday or at the weekend and is immediately followed by the count.  Many staff and supporters of election candidates are involved in these activities, which are fundamental elements of democracy.  Those involved in election campaigns are also involved in the important function of attending post-election counts.  Given that voting takes place at weekends and counts take time, it would be reasonable to facilitate candidates who have been through a tough campaign in the name of democracy by giving them ten days to remove posters.</P>
        <P>Candidates who have worked to promote the interests of their local community and parties would not allow their posters to remain up beyond the date prescribed in legislation.  If the seven-day requirement stands, they will certainly do their utmost to meet the requirement but it would be reasonable, at a practical level, to extend the period to ten days to take account of weekends and counts and to give candidates an opportunity to mobilise their election teams to remove posters.</P>
        <P>Candidates, whether defeated or successful, who have campaigned hard, visited homes throughout their respective communities, dealt with many issues and been through the trauma of a count must drag themselves and their teams out after the election to remove posters.  The proposal to extend from seven to ten days the period within which this must be done to take account of the weekend which normally follows an election and counting arrangements is a reasonable one.  It would be fair to give candidates and party activists more time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I address the amendment, I will address a point raised yesterday by a number of Senators, including Senators Buttimer and Hannigan.  The issue of whether the cost of removing posters counts as an election expense will be addressed in guidelines which will shortly issue from the Department.  However, the removal of posters after polling day will not be considered as an election expense for the purpose of making a declaration of expenses.</P>
        <P>On the issues raised in the amendments, the current exemption from prosecution enjoyed by exhibitors of posters for elections or referenda for a period of up to seven days after the poll provides an adequate and reasonable time to allow for the removal of posters.  It is not proposed, therefore, to accept the amendments.</P>
        <P>I fully recognise the important role posters can play in informing the electorate and raising awareness of upcoming polls.  The Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003 clearly recognise that election posters are an essential part of the electoral process.  Section 19(7) of the Litter Pollution Act provides an exemption from prosecution for exhibitors of posters for elections or referenda provided these posters do not remain in place for longer than seven days after the poll.  This legislation has been in place since 1997.  The proposed amendment to the Litter Pollution Act stipulates that it will only be a littering offence to exhibit election posters if they are in place outside the time limits specified in legislation.  This is necessary to control postering to ensure the litter problem does not arise in the first instance.</P>
        <P>In the autumn of 2008, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, held a public consultation in respect of the control of election postering.  Of the 117 submissions received during this consultation period from politicians, local authorities, community groups and members of the public, only one included a recommendation to change the time limit allowed for candidates and parties to remove posters following a poll.  Non-compliance with this requirement has been one of the main sources of complaints received <Col N="734"/>by the Department in respect of the exhibition of election posters during recent elections and referenda.</P>
        <P>It cannot be considered an onerous task for election candidates or parties to ensure they remove posters within one week of polling.  The litter legislation places responsibilities on all parts of society to ensure they contribute to keeping Ireland litter free.  The provision on election posters will ensure the activities of the polling process do not have a negative impact on the country in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is clear from previous polls that posters can be erected quickly.  Therefore, it is not clear to me why the removal of these same posters can be a much more time-consuming task.  I do not consider that political parties or candidates are being asked to contribute more than that required from all citizens to ensure Ireland remains as free from litter as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification and before we finalise this part of the legislation, when I asked the Minister of State a question on Committee Stage regarding the 10% incurred by the party, he said it was a percentage of the combined total.  Is that 10% of the total of the town council and the county council or all of the county council and one quarter of the town council?  The Bill states: &ldquo;Where a candidate contests an election for both a county council and a borough or town council, the election expenses which may be incurred by or on behalf of the candidate in connection with his or her candidature at the election shall be the limit appropriate to the electoral area in the county in which the candidate is nominated plus one quarter of the spending limit appropriate to the electoral area&rdquo;.  I raise this query to clarify the Bill and allow for a better understanding because confusion can be caused.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must remember that when candidates are in the thick of elections and trying to comply with legislation, the legislation must be clear and there must be clarity in respect of these points.  The last thing any candidate wants to do is to be on the wrong side of the law and we must be careful in the signals we send out in that regard.  We already have an indication from the Minister of State that it is 10% of the total amount of the county and borough councils.  I would like that clarified.  Is it 10% of all of the county council and one quarter of the town council?  That is what it appears to me but there is no clarity in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Coffey.  My understanding is that it is 10% of the candidate&rsquo;s limit.  If the limit is &euro;15,000 plus one quarter of the &euro;7,500, it is 10% of that  limit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that clarification but it is a pity that it is not clearer in legislation.  If it is 10% of the limit, why not state that in the legislation?  I <Col N="735"/>would have thought that would be a fairly simple thing to do and it would remove much of the lack of clarity about which we are talking.  I thank the Minister of State for his clarification on it.  I am aware the Minister is issuing guidelines to local authorities and I asked on Second Stage whether those have been published in anticipation of the signing of this Bill into law.  If they have not, perhaps it is timely that the Minister would take the views of the Fine Gael Party into account to give a clear understanding to local authority officials who might be advising candidates and to give candidates a clear understanding of their obligations under law.  As I said at the outset, they will have a lot on their plate.  It concerns the fundamentals of democracy.  They will need all the assistance they can get to try to comply with legislation because that is what they want to do but the Department and the local authorities must help them achieve that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I again thank the Senator.  The circular has gone out to local authorities but the guidelines will be sent out as soon as the Minister signs the order.  That will clarify the position, especially for new candidates, in regard to the guidelines.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Even though this is a short Bill it is an important one.  The amendments to the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 made by the Bill will facilitate the introduction of a cap on spending limits for political parties and candidates at local elections.  The capping of electoral expenditure is of particular importance to aspiring first-time candidates and to candidates with limited means.  A cap on spending limits will provide a level playing pitch for new candidates.  The amendment to the Litter Pollution Act provides important clarification regarding the time limit prior to a public meeting, election or referendum from which posters can be erected.  The importance of the Bill is reflected in the speed of its passage through both Houses in a tight legislative deadline so that it could be enacted for implementation at the forthcoming local elections.  I thank the Senators for their constructive contributions, especially Senator Coffey and Senator Brady who are present in the House, to the debate on the Bill on its passage through the House.  I acknowledge the work on the Bill of the officials of the Bills Office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the fact that Fine Gael supports the Bill.  We thank the Minister of State for bringing it before the House and the officials who assisted in drafting it.  It is welcome that we now have election spending limits on local election candidates.  As I said on Second Stage and on a number of occasions, I admire any candidate who puts their name forward for election, whether it be a local, national or European election, to represent the community from which they come.  This Bill will provide a level playing pitch for anybody who wants to enter politics.  Previously, candidates might have been intimidated by high expenditure from well-established or better-off candidates and might have felt they could not compete if they entered the political field.  This Bill will go a long way towards addressing that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raised concerns in the debates regarding the expenditure limits for urban candidates versus rural candidates and asked the Minister of State to keep an open mind on this legislation and review how it affected candidates and our electoral system after the local elections which are ten weeks away.  This is a Bill that will serve our democracy well.  Candidates will welcome it.  It is important that the Bill would be signed into law by an tUachtar&aacute;n and that the guidelines for local authorities regarding the effect of this legislation on local elections and candidates would be forwarded as soon as possible because we are only ten weeks away from the local <Col N="736"/>elections.  Candidates will have a great deal on their minds.  They will be trying to deal with issues daily and it is a difficult climate currently with the economy in its current state.  The last thing they want to do is fall foul of legislation because they do not realise its full implications.  Will the Minister of State ask his Department officials to engage fully with local authority officials?  I ask local authorities also that they would designate a member of staff to deal with any queries from candidates because the last thing they need is to be passed from person to person in local authorities with no one knowing the guidelines or who is responsible for them.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing the Bill before the House.  It is a step forward in our electoral process.  It will help local government in general and democracy in particular.</P>

He always makes sensible suggestions and amendments to legislation.  I agree with everything he has just said.  Regarding a level playing pitch, perhaps in future we could examine the way Seanad elections are conducted with a view to putting expenditure limits on those too because it is difficult to compete in some cases.  Perhaps we should ban free holidays and the like.  There are many areas we could examine in this regard because that is not a level playing pitch.  One could be slaughtered with one swipe on that, as it were.  That is something we should examine.</P>
        <P>I thank all concerned, particularly the officials who always come here and do their job with the greatest efficiency.  This should be acknowledged in the House.</P>

	<P>I commend my colleagues in the Seanad for tabling this important motion.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the subject of Irish tourism.  I recall the interesting debate we had on this subject last <Col N="737"/>November.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members and promise to consider carefully any suggestions that are made.</P>
        <P>The national and international economic landscape has changed dramatically in the past year.  I am acutely conscious of the concerns and anxieties of people working in the tourism and hospitality sector.  There is no doubt the industry is facing serious challenges, particularly in the short term.  This country is now fighting for its economic future.  Unless we can commit ourselves to restoring stability to the public finances, there will be no economic recovery.  The world is looking on and we need to persuade the international markets that we are capable of and willing to take the tough decisions required.  The strong message I want to get across is that the Government is operating within a clear framework for dealing with the current crisis and stabilising the public finances.  As well as the measures that will be taken in the upcoming budget, this involves stabilising the financial and banking sector, a firm commitment to achieving the necessary savings in public expenditure, measures to secure in the short term the stabilisation of the economy and to maximise economic activity and employment through major capital projects and helping those who lose their jobs.  We intend to work together to implement a reform agenda, including building Ireland&rsquo;s smart economy, upskilling those in the labour market, delivering public service reform and finalising a comprehensive framework for future pensions policy.</P>
        <P>As Senators are aware, we are experiencing the impact of an international recession of unsurpassed severity.  All major economies, including our key source tourism markets, are suffering or will suffer this year.  The Government recognises the future prosperity of the country will be determined by the actions we take now.  We know that much painful readjustment remains to be done but we are committed to taking the tough decisions necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to appreciate, as I know Senators do, the progress we have made in the tourism industry over recent years.  Irish tourism, operating within the framework of the New Horizons tourism strategy, has performed exceptionally well since 2001.  After the successive shocks of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, SARS and war in the Middle East, Ireland was one of the first countries in western Europe to return to growth in 2003.  Even in the very challenging environment that pertained last year, our foreign revenue earnings from tourism are expected to have been reduced by no more than 3% to 4%, still amounting to around &euro;4.7 billion.  Overseas visitor numbers declined by just over 2% in 2008.  The domestic market also held up well in terms of revenue and numbers.  These declines must be seen in the light of progress made over the previous two decades.  We must bear in mind that in 1990, overseas visitors numbered just over 3 million, compared to 8 million in 2007.  In 1990 domestic tourism generated &euro;500 million in earnings, compared to &euro;1.7 billion in 2007.</P>
        <P>I will now consider prospects for 2009 and beyond.  Based on the impact of changes in the world economy on tourism and travel, both globally and in the island of Ireland, Tourism Ireland has developed a range of scenarios for likely performance in 2009.  The factors considered include the likely economic state of key source markets as well as elements such as air access capacity, consumer travel behaviour and consumer confidence.  The target for 2009 is to sustain visitor numbers and revenues at no less than their 2005 and 2006 levels and to consolidate our position during the year with a view to an eventual return to growth.  This is against a backdrop in which the World Travel and Tourism Council is projecting a contraction of 3.6% in the tourism industry worldwide in 2009.  Tourism Ireland will be reviewing prospects on an ongoing basis as the year unfolds and will revise its forecasts on a quarterly basis, given the rapid pace of change in the external environment.</P>
        <P>I remain optimistic about our future prospects.  With the right public policy framework, a strong partnership with the industry and active and responsive tourism agencies, we have every <Col N="738"/>reason to be confident in our capacity to manage our way through these exceptional times and return to sustainable growth in the medium term.  There is a large market out there to be captured.  Tourism revenue across the world is valued at &euro;462 billion annually, or just over &euro;1.25 billion a day.  The industry represents over a third of the world&rsquo;s exports of services and, even allowing for a decline in 2009, more than 9% of world gross domestic product.  Most importantly, the industry is expected to maintain its growth trend in the medium term.  The Irish tourism industry is resilient and is well placed to capture its fair share of this market.</P>
        <P>At a time of unprecedented economic challenge, tourism and hospitality remains a resilient, labour-intensive industry providing work opportunities throughout the country.  While the sector is by no means protected from the current downturn, there are still an estimated 280,000 jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry.  As I said earlier, the sector contributed an estimated &euro;4.7 billion in foreign revenue earnings last year, with an estimated Exchequer tax return of more than &euro;2 billion.  The medium-term prospects for international tourism remain positive and there is no reason why Ireland cannot continue to gain market share if we get our competitiveness right and sustain our investment in marketing, product development and training.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland is a North-South body, responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination.  The objectives of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing strategy are to convince overseas consumers that now is the best time ever to visit, to show them the tremendous value available from industry partners and to demonstrate how easy it is to get here by air and sea.  We must position Ireland to take advantage of opportunities that will arise as the global economy stabilises.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s commitment is to market through the challenges, work closely with industry partners and fight for every bit of business that is there to be won.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland has reviewed all its marketing programmes and will keep them under the microscope to ensure they maintain the maximum flexibility and responsiveness necessary in this difficult trading environment.  The new and refreshed global advertising campaign, &ldquo;Go Where Ireland Takes You&rdquo;, has been rolled out to help position the destination and keep it front of mind with consumers.</P>
        <P>Most importantly, Tourism Ireland is engaged in a huge tactical marketing programme right now across all major markets, communicating strong reasons to visit together with clear, price-led messages.  It is working with the industry to bring the best available offers to the attention of consumers overseas and to make it easier for them to book.  It is also investing in co-operative and partner-led marketing and has front-loaded spend to prioritise bookings for the peak holiday period.  The aim is to mount an integrated and concerted marketing effort, with tactical co-operation with industry partners the cornerstone of the approach.</P>
        <P>A major part of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s focus in 2009 will be on expanding the home market with a specific marketing campaign to persuade more Irish people to take a break at home this year.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s consumer research indicates that there is further potential in the short break market, with fewer Irish people considering a short break abroad in 2009 and more considering short breaks in Ireland instead.</P>
        <P>The home market represents up to two thirds of hotel bednights.  An intensive marketing programme incorporating television, radio, press and outdoor channels will put out key messages, such as the convenience and increasing value of holidaying at home.  Let us not forget that more than &euro;6 billion was spent abroad by Irish residents in 2007 and even a small proportion of this would make a major difference to Irish tourism if it were spent at home in 2009.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s recent research confirms that the main issues of concern for hotels and other tourism enterprises are the economic recession, weakened consumer demand, energy and labour costs and local authority charges.  The industry is also concerned about access to credit, <Col N="739"/>the regulatory framework and labour regulation through the JLC process.  How can the Government help to deal with these issues?  One way is to ensure our programmes and supports are refocused to meet business priorities.</P>
        <P>During 2008 F&aacute;ilte Ireland worked directly with in excess of 2,000 tourism businesses.  In 2009 it will be investing extensively in providing direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.  The key elements of the support package in 2009 will include a new mentoring support service providing one-to-one advice, a new &ldquo;Biz-Check&rdquo; service designed to provide operators with on-site business diagnosis and solutions support, further expansion of initiatives to improve on-line marketing and business skills generally within the industry and a significant investment in on-site training of industry employees in customer care and food preparation.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also continue to roll out its executive management programme and the Optimus programme to help enterprises to achieve excellence in every aspect of their business by providing a practical approach to improving business and customer service.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland, through its business tourism forum, is placing increasing emphasis on attracting conventions, meetings and other business groups to Ireland.  It has been gearing its resources to provide support and leadership to the business tourism sector.  A priority has been the creation of a working partnership with the professionals in the industry, drawing on their experience and on their needs to deliver high quality products and marketing strategies.  A new industry-centred conference alliance will provide greater support for Irish delegates who are prepared to lobby for association conference business.  The national convention centre in Dublin is on target to open in September next year and has already secured a significant level of conference bookings to the value of &euro;45 million.</P>
        <P>Labour now represents a large proportion of costs to the industry and this cost impacts directly on international and domestic competitiveness.  I have been in contact with the T&aacute;naiste on the issue of wage costs and industrial relations structures, in particular the issue of double-time payments on Sunday.  Some progress has been made in addressing the Sunday issue and I remain confident a solution can be found.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has put in place a structured dialogue with the banks to ensure a greater level of transparency in the provision of credit facilities for business during the current difficult period.  I will also be meeting the banks separately to raise the specific problems being encountered by the tourism industry which mainly revolve around the availability of working capital and the treatment of businesses that may be facing difficulty in respect of loan repayments.</P>
        <P>The tourism industry touches virtually every parish in Ireland.  I am conscious of the important role it plays in bringing much needed employment to the regions and the positive role it plays in promoting balanced regional development.  Exchequer investment has as one of its fundamental objectives the stimulation of regional development.  This expenditure is supported by the establishment of five regional tourism development boards in the south east, the south west, the west, midlands-east and the north west.  Dublin Tourism has also been reconstituted.  Shannon Development created a separate regional board to reflect these structures and detailed development plans for each tourism region have been produced and published and are being implemented.  These plans serve as an important framework and resource for the various spending agencies in optimising the tourism benefits of their investment thereby adding to the social and economic impact locally of such spending.  Progress on the implementation of the plans is being reviewed by departmental officials in co-operation with the tourism agencies.</P>
        <P>One of the strengths of Irish tourism has been the robust policy framework that has been developed for the sector.  This includes clearly defined implementation arrangements through the State tourism agencies and a strong partnership approach with the industry.  To ensure our medium-term strategic approach is still fit for purpose and takes into account the rapidly chang<Col N="740"/>ing economic and social environment, I established a high level tourism renewal group before Christmas to examine current tourism policy and programme priorities.  The group, which is chaired by Mr. Maurice Pratt, has been tasked by me to set out by mid-year the key actions to be taken to ensure tourism continues to be a major industry for Ireland and that the right strategies are in place to maintain the long-term sustainable growth of Irish tourism.  The group has met formally on three occasions and has examined issues such as business tourism, cultural tourism, branding and international tourism policy trends.  The group has also engaged in two full-day consultations in recent weeks, directly engaging with key players in the tourism industry and the access transport sector as well as key policy Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am pleased that the House is taking an active interest in tourism, perhaps our longest standing, and arguably most important internationally traded service industry.  We all recognise that these are extraordinarily challenging and difficult times for every economic sector and tourism is not immune.  With a robust strategic and policy framework, however, strong partnership between the public and private sectors, effective State agencies, appropriate investment in marketing and product, and tourism enterprises which are now on a par with those anywhere in the world in terms of management capacity and quality, Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry will rise to this challenge and can position itself to come out of this downturn even stronger than before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his overview of the situation.  I also wish Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland well with their plans.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to see the Minister alive and well after his recent visit to the IHF where we both learned about the difficulties facing the sector, although we already knew about them.  The Minister made an unexpected visit to a place I have an affinity with, the Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.  He saw the three championship golf courses, the warmth of the welcome there and the great tourism product it offers.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is a 70% stakeholder in that fine facility and there is great co-operation between the club and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, something that will continue.  I know the Minister will continue to nurture it and in that regard I wish him every success.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to hear what he said about the convention meetings and other business groups that F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s business forum is encouraging to come to our shores.  I am also delighted the Minister is going to meet the banks on the crucial question of the availability of working capital and the treatment of businesses in this sector.  Many such businesses in the south west and elsewhere are hard pressed in these difficult times.  To see us through this crisis it is important the banks are sympathetic and understanding.  They should be prepared to defer interest payments where necessary as well as rolling over and reconstituting business loans and overdrafts.</P>
        <P>The Minister has established a group under the chairmanship of Mr. Maurice Pratt and I wish it well.  It is examining business and cultural tourism which form a key part of the way forward and are so important to the future of our economy.</P>
        <P>One of the most patriotic things any citizen could do is to holiday at home this summer and encourage one&rsquo;s relations and friends to do likewise.  This would protect vital jobs in the tourism sector.  The recent release of tourism figures highlighted the fact that 2009 will be a challenging time for our tourism industry, as the Minister has outlined.  Visitors from Britain, our biggest market, accounted for most of the 8.4% drop in January 2009, continuing the downward trend of last year.  Our tourism is a vital source of employment, accounting for more than 300,000 jobs throughout the country, and is especially important in the south west.</P><Col N="741"/>
        <P>A number of tourism initiatives should be introduced to attract more visitors to Ireland, including a concerted marketing effort, particularly in the United States, specifically targeting the Irish diaspora.  In addition, a new golfing tourism initiative could build on the successes of Padraig Harrington and Rory Mcllroy as ambassadors of Irish golf, with co-operation from golf clubs on more flexible pricing arrangements.  In fairness, however, we now have competitive green fee rates.  The Minister will have heard of the tremendous marketing efforts we are spearheading in Killarney under the guidance of our general manager, Mr. Maurice O&rsquo;Meara.  Other golf clubs are doing likewise and we encourage any of them who are not yet behind the effort to do so quickly.</P>
        <P>Rigorous enforcement of quality standards for sewage treatment systems by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is required to avoid water contamination such as we had in Ennis and Galway.  This resulted in much damage to the tourism industry during peak season in the recent past.</P>
        <P>The tourism sector undoubtedly is suffering from poor decisions such as the introduction of the airport departure levy and the failure to tackle spiralling business costs.  My party has proposed a number of initiatives aimed at revitalising the sector, including a dedicated ring-fenced marketing budget for Shannon Airport, commencement of the Adare and Castleisland bypasses, production of a targeted tourism plan by September, extension of the deadline for the mid-Shannon investment scheme, and a dedicated marketing initiative to capture the potential of the pre-clearance facility to be introduced in Shannon this summer.</P>
        <P>Unemployment, as we know, has exploded and in the south west the live register shows an increase of 83% in my county of Kerry and 88% in Cork since February 2008.  The number of overseas trips fell by 8.4% to 502,100 in January 2009 compared with 548,400 recorded in January 2008.  There were 424,200 overseas trips to Ireland in January 2009, which was a drop of almost 3% from the same month in 2008.  Visits by residents of Great Britain accounted for virtually all of this decrease, falling by almost 16,000 or 7% to 208,300.  There is an urgent need therefore to target the UK, our nearest neighbour, more aggressively.  Residents of other European countries and North America recorded slight increases to 149,500 and 45,200, respectively.</P>
        <P>We obviously need to build on this and providing free travel for European senior citizens would be a useful initiative.  It was recently suggested by the Irish Hotels Federation.  The Minister must have heard that suggestion in Killarney, as I did.  Senior citizens have more time to travel and are more inclined to do so.  It would be hoped they also would have useful disposable income that we would be happy to receive.  It would not cost very much for rail and bus providers to make that free travel facility available to European senior citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tourism sector is one of the country&rsquo;s most important indigenous industries, worth an estimated &euro;6 billion to the economy and employing in excess of 320,000 people.  It is especially valuable in the south west with an estimated 4 million tourists spending &euro;1.2 million in 2007.  However, we are shooting ourselves in the foot with the departure levy, holiday home tax, the hike in VAT and a failure to tackle cost and competitiveness issues.  In addition, when funding was available, there was a failure to prevent restrictions in transport services or to invest adequately in tourism attractions such as the Natural History Museum, the Abbey Theatre and the National Archives.  Now, when the cultural tourism product is such a vital part of the industry&rsquo;s future, funding is not available to maintain buildings or expand exhibition space.  With regard to VAT, Senator Ellis could tell Members more about the need to become aligned with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s rates, thus encouraging more visitors to come south.</P>
        <P>Speaking of cultural tourism, it was a major disappointment that Killarney House was not included in the F&aacute;ilte Ireland list of national products being funded.  This is a truly historic <Col N="742"/>house in a magnificent setting.  It practically overlooks the lakes, yet it is almost in the town centre within easy access by all visitors to this tourism capital of the south west.  This was the home of the Earls of Kenmare, Lord Castlerosse and, more recently, the late John McShain, the man who built Washington.  At the moment it is being allowed to deteriorate further and I am asking bluntly what we are going to do to stop this rot which is surely a national disgrace and a major blot on the home of Irish tourism.</P>
        <P>I understood the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, was interested in this project being included.  One presumes he still is.  Despite an early hiccup, I believe his Department had not just vetted Killarney House but approved it for inclusion on that list of cultural tourism projects to be funded.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on that point or let me know the position.  Perhaps there is still hope for it.  I sincerely hope there is.</P>
        <P>A major concern of the tourism sector is the problem with the Office of Public Works with staffing levels and opening hours of visitor attractions.  This has only recently been resolved locally because we all kicked up a fuss over the opening hours at Ross Castle in Killarney.  They were restricted until there were strong objections and we all made suitable representations to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I thank him for redressing the situation at Ross Castle.</P>
        <P>One of the problems is the fragmentation of tourism.  In Killarney, for instance, Ross Castle and Muckross Abbey come under the aegis of the OPW.  Meanwhile, Killarney House and Muckross House come within the remit of the national parks and wildlife service.  They should all be under the aegis of one body or Department.  This fragmentation is not helping tourism.  The restrictions on opening hours are akin to abandoning the plan to develop the National Museum at Collins Barracks.  For years, the Government claimed it would develop the museum space as a new tourist attraction.  Its recent confirmation that this is no longer the case came as a blow to the beleaguered sector and is a short-sighted cutback.</P>
        <P>Reducing opening times at heritage sites is greatly hindering tourism and should also be reviewed urgently.  How is tourism to flourish, or even recover from the collapse it is beginning to suffer, if some of our prime attractions are closed?  I am pleased, however, the opening hours for Ross Castle were reinstated.</P>
        <P>Other concerns of the sector include the introduction of the airport departure levy which has resulted in job losses and acted as a disincentive to tourists.  It should be reviewed as the decline in business for regional airports is having a knock-on effect in regional areas, particularly in the south west with the difficulties facing Shannon Airport.  Energy charges, local authority charges, VAT rates and taxi charges are adding to the cost of doing business for hotels and other tourism providers.</P>
        <P>Inadequate transport links must be tackled.  Fine Gael proposes a dedicated ring-fenced marketing budget for Shannon Airport which would benefit the south west.  Transport routes must be enhanced with the production of a tourism plan by Shannon Development.  The deadline for the mid-Shannon investment scheme must be extended.  A dedicated marketing initiative must be launched to capture the potential of the customs pre-clearance facility to be introduced in Shannon this summer, the first of its kind in Europe.  This will allow US visitors to clear customs at the airport and for it to grow routes to regional airports in the US.  It should also stimulate spin-off tourism growth in the south west.  Tourism employers should be exempted from paying PRSI on new staff to encourage recruitment, and cost issues must be tackled to ensure competitiveness is restored.</P>
        <P>In the short time allocated for the debate, I have been only able to hint at the many and varied issues facing the tourism industry.  I wish Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the tourism <Col N="743"/>renewal group under the chairmanship of Maurice Pratt well.  So much of our tourism industry&rsquo;s future depends on their efforts and I hope they will bear fruit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, to the House for this renewed debate on the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>Recently there has been criticism of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programmes of Ministers when they actually encourage people abroad to note that Ireland is open for business, be it for industry or tourism.  It is also an opportunity for Ministers to meet first, second, third and fourth generation Irish people who wish to be associated with Ireland and encourage them to take their vacations, as the Yanks call them, here.</P>
        <P>However, the media attacks Ministers left, right and centre for promoting Ireland.  That is wrong.  It is time the media realised we are all in these difficult economic times together.  Any effort by a Minister to promote Ireland should be undertaken, irrespective of cost.  The costs are not excessive when considered in the real world.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will send their executives and officers around the world to promote industry in Ireland.  The Minister&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programmes are the same &mdash; the promotion of our tourism industry.  It is imperative we are allowed to promote the sector freely and without hindrance from the media.</P>
        <P>Most people around the world have access to the Internet.  When Irish descendants abroad check the Irish newspapers on the Internet, they just see attacks on Ministers travelling abroad to promote the country and it being run down.  The cutbacks in this year&rsquo;s ministerial programmes were entirely wrong.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to the US President, Mr. Obama, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, showed the American people the affinity between Ireland and America.  It will have done much to promote tourism.  It is wrong that Ministers should be criticised when they go abroad to promote this country.</P>
        <P>Much progress has been made in the tourism sector over the past ten years.  The number of quality hotel beds available compared with ten years ago is phenomenal.  The hotel sector has become increasingly competitive with other countries.  Hotel prices in Dublin city are 40% of what they were five years ago which encourages people to visit.  The amount of weekend tourism to Ireland has increased phenomenally.  High quality tourism facilities are being promoted at competitive prices.  The recent drop in rates for the dollar and sterling have affected the tourism industry but it has made so much progress in becoming competitive.  Many of the international hotel operators have become involved with Irish hotels in the past seven years.  This is the type of progress that will lead to a sustainable tourism industry when the recession finishes.</P>
        <P>The maximum amount of money possible should be allocated to marketing.  It is welcome that Tourism Ireland markets on an all-Ireland basis.  For too long there was a myth abroad that Ireland was not a safe destination.  Fortunately, this has disappeared along with the famous line between North and South.  Many visitors will visit Belfast and Dublin, and sometimes the south west.</P>
        <P>The west and the north west, however, are still suffering from lack of promotion.  Some of the best tourism facilities are provided in the region but access is still a problem.  We must continue to invest in our airlines, regional airports and road infrastructure.  A road journey from Sligo to Dublin in two and a half hours is a major improvement from five years ago when it could take from three and a half to four and a half hours.  The improvements in the rail network are phenomenal.  The Sligo line has an additional five services daily.  The standard of the rolling stock provided by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann encourages people to take intercity breaks and visit outside of Dublin.  Many in the industry in the west have informed me that people will now travel from Dublin to the west for a mid-week break by train.  The fastest growing market <Col N="744"/>for out-of-season, mid-week breaks is among those who are retired.  These individuals can use their bus or train passes and travel, free of charge, to their destinations.  As a result, they make tremendous savings and are encouraged to take short breaks at various locations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The hotel industry has begun to meet the needs of the market and can provide accommodation and food at extremely competitive prices.  Certain first-class hotels are offering mid-week breaks for two for as little as &euro;150.  Such breaks typically include two nights bed and breakfast and one evening meal, which is tremendous value.  However, we are losing out in terms of our inability to sustain this type of trade and the employment to which it gives rise on a year-round basis.  A difficulty existed for a number of years in that some individuals were of the view that too many eastern Europeans or other non-Irish nationals were involved in the tourism trade.  However, the position is changing because many young Irish people see tourism as offering them a future, be it as bar staff or in other positions within the general hotel industry infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Another important development in the tourism industry relates to air access.  Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Aer Arann and others are providing competitive rates in respect of flights to some of our smaller regional airports in particular.  This is a welcome development.  These rates can only be provided on foot of the subsidies that are on offer from Europe.  It is extremely important to ensure that these subsidies remain in place in the long term because without them, some of the regional airports and smaller airlines will not be able to survive.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to Killarney, and everything is local when it comes to politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the capital of Irish tourism, and the Department&rsquo;s headquarters and the Minister&rsquo;s office are located there, which is something we welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not dispute what is the capital of Irish tourism, where all the leprechauns reside or anything of that nature.  Everybody accepts that Killarney, as a regional centre, has tremendous facilities.  However, the facilities in other centres are equally good but these places are not as well marketed or do not receive the same exposure as Killarney.  Some of the promoters and venue owners in Killarney do tremendous work in the context of attracting tourists to visit the town and attend various shows and gigs.  This is what tourism is all about.</P>
        <P>There were a number of excellent tourism attractions on offer in Dublin during the past three months.  For example, the international matches involving the Irish rugby team provide the tourism and hospitality industries with tremendous opportunities.  In addition, between 10% and 20% of those who attend high-profile concerts in Dublin come from outside the capital.  People tend to forget that many of the venues in this country that were developed with the assistance of tax breaks etc. will make a far larger contribution in the long term than will other projects that are still in receipt of major grant aid.  We pay for industrial jobs but we do not make a similar contribution when it comes to jobs in the hospitality sector.</P>
        <P>There is a need to continue to pump money into the area of marketing.  In the future, marketing will be more important than any other factor when it comes to the tourism industry.  It all revolves around how one sells the package, regardless of whether one is offering a three, five or seven-day break.  There is a need for co-ordination among hotels, guesthouse owners and others in the industry.  The bed and breakfast sector met its demise because hotel beds have become so much cheaper than was the case 20 or 25 years ago as a result of the investment made in the hotel industry.  It is sad that this has happened.  People who use bed and breakfast <Col N="745"/>establishments are usually keen to maintain their privacy and experience a little of Irish life.  These individuals will continue to use such establishments.</P>
        <P>Everyone is aware of the difficulties that arose on foot of the rates of pay that had to be applied in hotels, bars and restaurants on Sundays.  This matter has been tackled by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Kelleher.  Rural establishments were placed at a serious disadvantage compared to their counterparts in Dublin, when they were obliged to offer staff the rates of pay to which I refer to their employees.</P>
        <P>Golfing and spa resorts have become big business.  I compliment those who included first-class golf courses as part of their hotel developments.  Some of these courses are of the highest standard.  While the weather in Ireland is not always ideal and has a particular bearing on golf and other outdoor activities, we must do whatever is necessary to provide all-weather facilities in hotels, be they spa facilities designed to keep wives happy or indoor sports facilities.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, it is hoped that the national conference centre will be open in 2010.  If it is marketed properly, this centre will make a massive contribution in the context of filling hotel beds in this city and in places situated within a 50-mile radius of it.  As everyone knows, it is extremely tiring to be obliged to spend an hour travelling from one&rsquo;s hotel to the venue at which the conference one is attending is being held.  The new national conference centre will provide us with an advantage in this regard.</P>
        <P>Certain parts of the tourism industry have been left behind.  The coarse angling sector has been allowed to deteriorate.  Questions must be answered in respect of how this sector has been promoted and with regard to how fish stocks in certain lakes and rivers have been protected.</P>
        <P>We could discuss the challenges facing the tourism and hospitality sector at length.  Another part of the industry that is beginning to expand is that which relates to green tourism.  Eco-friendly tourism is a growth industry.  A hotel in Carrick-on-Shannon in my constituency was recently presented with a European award in respect of the progress it has made in the area of energy saving.  I never expected a hotel in a rural area to receive such an award and the establishment to which I refer is the first of its kind in the country to do so.  The owners of the hotel decided to go the eco-friendly route in promoting their establishment and the facilities on offer there.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well.  He will have the full support of all Members with regard to the action he will be obliged to take to market this country as a tourism destination.  As stated, the media has a duty to ensure that those promoting Ireland are not hindered and that aspersions are not cast upon their activities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire.  I wish well in their endeavours those involved in the campaign to make the Cliffs of Moher one of the seven natural wonders of the world.  I hope they are successful because the Cliffs of Moher are a magnificent attraction on the west coast.</P>
        <P>It is good that the Minister has remained in the House for the debate.  Some of his colleagues tend to leave before debates of this nature have concluded.  As he stated, tourism is important to every parish, village and townland in Ireland.  Leadership is required in respect of the serious challenges we face.  The tourism industry is one of the best vehicles at our disposal to promote Ireland as a place to visit, live, do business and relax and enjoy oneself.  However, some of the activities that sullied the name of Ireland during the past week &mdash; I refer to the robust exchanges that took place in certain areas on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &mdash; leave a lot to be desired.  The Ireland of the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte must be reinvented and we must eliminate thugs and their activities from society.  I am concerned that the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival is being adversely <Col N="746"/>affected by alcohol-imbued, anti-social behaviour.  The type of behaviour to which I refer spoils the great work being done by many people throughout the country as it attracts all the headlines.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to a framework for the future but I have yet to see that from Government.  I hope we can take measures to ensure the stabilisation of the economy and, more importantly, to implement a reform agenda in the tourism sector.  The implications for the tourism sector are significant.  It is imperative for our future prosperity that we have a tourism industry that is buoyant, creating employment and attracting visitors.  I hope that can be done.</P>
        <P>I wish to emulate Senators Coghlan and Ellis and make a parochial reference to my city of Cork, which is the gateway to the south west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The southern capital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan can lay claim to Killarney being the tourism capital of Ireland but in order to get to Killarney one has to go through Cork.  The city and county of Cork must be promoted through business and cultural tourism.</P>
        <P>Cork Airport is fast becoming the gateway and entry point to the south west but it must be resourced, debt-free and autonomous.  I compliment the staff and executives of Cork Airport who are doing a good job in promoting Cork.  I am concerned that Cork Airport could become a white elephant because of the charges there and other off-site issues.  It is important the Government addresses that issue.</P>
        <P>In order to gain access to west Cork and parts of Kerry we need the Cork to Swansea ferry.  I congratulate the various tourism and sectoral interests in west Cork who have been actively promoting the ferry.  That link to the United Kingdom is absolutely necessary and it is imperative it is restored.  The people of Cork, especially west Cork, require support for that.  They have had many pledges of support from people and business.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on the provision of monetary support through investments, for example, the buying of shares and the pledging of donations to get involved in the ferry and to get its money back?  We have heard nothing substantive from the Government on the matter in terms of a cash investment in the ferry.  I urge the Minister to respond to the matter in his reply.</P>
        <P>Cork city is losing out because it does not have an active convention or conference centre.  The Minister referred to Dublin.  My base is Cork and I am concerned that we do not have a convention centre there.  Killarney has an active convention centre in the INEC that brings in shows and various events that attract people to Kerry.  Sadly, we do not have that in Cork.  It is imperative that as part of its the renewal programme through an economic stimulus package the Government would assist Cork City Council in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister referred to the regions because they are important in the overall scheme of things.  The Minister has seen Waterford Glass closing in his city with the loss, which I hope will be only temporary, of the visitor centre there, which was one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country.  It would be a shame if that lay idle for much longer.</P>
        <P>We must emphasise the issue of cost.  Senators Ellis and Coghlan referred to Sunday pay.  However, in my view the cost factor has not been tackled.  I refer to the cost of getting access to this country, the departure tax, and the cost of accommodation, meals, wages and everything else.  It is a major problem.  I am sure that when the Minister speaks to visitors about coming to Ireland they talk about the value they get for their money.  We can talk about the exchange rate and the sterling or dollar differential but compared to countries within the eurozone the cost here is significantly higher and that is costing us big-time.  We need to introduce incentives in that regard.</P><Col N="747"/>
        <P>Let us take the example of tourists coming to this country from England or Spain who are staying in a cottage and buying food and groceries.  Let us consider what value they get for &euro;100 or &euro;200 in England or Spain compared to this country.  It is absolutely daft and it is killing us from a tourism point of view.  Last week our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, spoke about people staying in Ireland and in his opening remarks the Minister referred to taking X amount of money back from the billions that are spent abroad.  However, one should look at the value people get when they go to Spain with a family of three or four children compared to this country.</P>
        <P>Are we going to get real about the cost of tourism in this country?  We have to entice people.  We are all in favour of that.  We have a tremendous product; a beautiful, rugged natural landscape.  We have great attractions and we used to have a great welcoming population.  People look at the cost of a room rather than the cost of a bed.  It is important that we stop pricing ourselves out of the market.  The Minister referred in his speech to Sunday rates of pay.  That is one of the biggest impediments to people staying in business across the country.  I sympathise with the people who are working in the industry who have to earn a wage but we must examine Sunday rates.</P>
        <P>The banks, our infamous friends, are not helping the owners of bed and breakfast establishments, small hoteliers and restaurant owners.  They must introduce liquidity to the market because it is depriving people of their livelihoods and killing off business, which we should not be doing.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will have good news for the Cork to Swansea ferry this afternoon.  It is important that we have an attractive market to sell in the United Kingdom with Cork and Kerry.  Tourism is one of our biggest employers and we should not lose sight of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Buttimer.  It is rare that I do, but I agree with him about the Cork to Swansea ferry.  I will return to that point.  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Mansergh, for their assistance to Kerry in opening Ross Castle last week four weeks earlier than all other OPW sites in the country.  As the Acting Chairman, Senator Coghlan, is aware, that is in no small part due to the great work of the Killarney chamber of commerce and tourism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>And your good self, Senator Daly.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>While we are in the mutual admiration society, I include your good self, Senator Coghlan.  That work was done by proving that Killarney, which is the capital of tourism, as the Acting Chairman and the Minister are well aware, does not just have a six-month season, it has a year-round season.  It would beggar belief to have spent such an inordinate amount of money on the restoration of Ross Castle, which is iconic in posters dating back more than 100 years, and then for it not to be open when people come to visit it and Muckross House during St. Patrick&rsquo;s week.  It would be a disgrace to find that its doors were closed even though we had spent millions trying to open them.  That campaign carried out by the chamber of commerce, the hoteliers and the tourism industry shows, as will the other examples I will outline, how the private sector has to prove its case during the economic downturn.  People must act, as they cannot expect the Government to provide everything.  Showing how many days the castle was open last year and the footfall that went through it in the same period proved the case that an exception should be made of Ross Castle.</P>
        <P>I have been part of some of the many delegations on the Cork to Swansea ferry to the Minister and the Minister for Transport to try to get Government funding.  However, EU restrictions are such that were the Government to hand out large amounts of money to any <Col N="748"/>company, that would bring down the wrath of the great Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  If the Swansea-Cork ferry was to get money from the Government, Michael O&rsquo;Leary would probably want money also.  EU regulations would not permit that.  Therefore, we must find more imaginative ways to raise funds.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Swansea-Cork ferry group, led by John Hosford and the captain and chairman of the Port of Cork, has come up with an innovative way of funding the project.  Shareholders are being sought who will co-operate and pay &euro;1,000 towards a part share or who will form a group and pay &euro;10,000 for a share in order to buy a part in the new Swansea-Cork ferry, which as Deputy Buttimer said, is vital for the people of south Kerry and west Cork.  It is estimated the ferry will bring &euro;22 million annually into the Irish economy following the first option investment of &euro;5 million.  From the Government&rsquo;s point of view, this would be money well spent, but the restrictions imposed by the European Union with regard to Government funding of private sector organisations and industry are such that we cannot develop the ferry service in the manner we might want.</P>
        <P>The Swansea-Cork ferry project is an example of the private sector and individuals involved in the industry coming together and not relying on Government to provide leadership.  In the current economic times it is important that the private sector and individuals provide leadership themselves and prove the case.  There is a sustainable economic argument to be made for the Swansea-Cork ferry in terms of viability because we currently have transporters and lorries heading all the way to Rosslare in order to travel to England.  There is also environmental damage in terms of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions as a result of the loss of the Swansea-Cork ferry over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>I was talking to John Hosford before coming here today and he and I are hopeful the matter will be resolved in the near future.  One of the upsides of the economic downturn is that ferries have become available.  The group has identified one in Scandinavia that is suitable for use in Cork as it has a shallow hull and, hopefully, the receiver of the company there will conclude negotiations with the consortium that has come together to develop the Swansea-Cork ferry.  It is foolhardy in the current economic times to rely on the Government alone to provide these vital links between Ireland and the United Kingdom or France.  It is important people realise their futures are in their own hands.  While the Government will give them whatever support it can, it is limited in what it can do because of the current financial situation and the rules imposed within the European Union.</P>
        <P>Another project deserving support is the Centre of Contemporary Irish Culture in Kenmare, something I am sure Senator Coghlan supports.  Bord F&aacute;ilte has granted &euro;6 million towards the building of this 20,000 sq. ft. exhibition centre with seven different galleries.  This is an unusual undertaking that will cost &euro;12.5 million.  The Government will provide &euro;6 million through Bord F&aacute;ilte and it is up to the town of Kenmare and its population of 1,700 to come up with the other &euro;6 million.  This is not an amount one could get from a church gate collection or a raffle.  John Brennan, from the Park Hotel in Kenmare, organised a public meeting at which he presented the argument on the vital necessity of this centre in order to take advantage of the upswing.  In the past eight weeks he and the people of Kenmare have raised over &euro;1 million in pledges for the centre.  I am aware they must collect a further &euro;5 million, but at a time when people are strapped for cash, I must commend their vision in taking on the inordinate task of raising &euro;6 million and on having got so far so quickly.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  As with most strategies currently, we must rely first on ourselves with regard to our tourism strategy.  Where the Government can assist, it will, but people working in tourism in Kerry, Cork and all over the country have always relied first on themselves.  They have proven to be world leaders as a result.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="749"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am one of those people who grew up in the tourism business and welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue.  I am not going to point out what the Government should do to solve the difficulties because the current difficulties will not be solved by the Government but by ourselves.  I grew up in the tourism business and I advise anybody starting out, particularly young people starting in life, that if they get the chance to be born again they should do their best to be born into a family that runs a holiday camp.  Living in a family that runs a holiday camp is a smashing way to grow up and a great business experience.</P>
        <P>My father opened Red Island holiday camp in Skerries in 1947 when I was, obviously, only a baby.  I grew up in a business that was totally different to the business I later became involved in, namely, the grocery business.  The business my father built had 250 bedrooms, catered for 500 guests and provided hot and cold water and central heating.  The guests arrived from England by boat and plane and were met by buses.  They paid for their holiday &mdash; travel, accommodation, food and entertainment &mdash; on the day they arrived.  The deal my father made with them was that they would not need to spend any more money because everything was included in the initial price.  Imagine what it is like when one grows up in a business in which the objective of the business is not to sell one&rsquo;s customer something extra, but to ensure the guests come to the owner at the end of the week and say they had a great holiday and will be back again the following year.  I put that argument to the young people visiting the House today and to all people in business.</P>
        <P>The objective of every business is to get the customer to return and that is in our hands each time we make a decision, particularly in the tourism business.   That objective is the real objective of business, but it is where this country has tended to fall down.  We have tended to believe that the way to get more business is by advertising and promotion.  Those strategies are useful in getting people here for the first time, but the ideal way to get guests or tourists is through word of mouth.  We need people who will say they were here, had a great time and will return this year.  This does not just apply to Ireland as a whole, but to each county and town.</P>
        <P>Some years ago when my family was still young we went to Glenbeigh on holiday.  I remember hearing the parish priest there say at mass on Sunday that things were not good at the time, but the way to success for the parish was to make guests welcome.  Later that night when we went looking for a babysitter, we got a local babysitter but were told when we wanted to pay that there was no cost because the parish priest had said the people were to make guests welcome.  It was very interesting to see the effect of the priest&rsquo;s words on the parishioners, that they should make guests welcome.  This is something lacking in Ireland currently.  We have fallen away from that attitude and there is a danger that we will point out instead what the Minister and Government should be doing up in Dublin.  My concern is that this happens on a regular basis.  It regularly happens that when a group of people in any part of the country join together to solve a problem, such as the closure of a factory, the first thing they do is send a delegation to the Department.  That is not the way to succeed.  We must individually recognise that if we are to solve the problems facing us, we must act individually as families, villages, <?oasys _dc18- ?>towns, counties and regions.  Last year, room occupancy in the country&rsquo;s 920 hotels fell to 58%,<?oasys _dc0- ?> the lowest rate since 1994.  The biggest drop was in the number of bed nights sold to American tourists.  This figure decreased by 23%, or almost one quarter, by comparison with the previous year.  The number of beds sold to British tourists fell by 15% while the number of EU visitors dropped by 7%.  Many other businesses throughout the country are losing business also.</P>
        <P>There is a danger that we will say we can do nothing about this but that is not correct.  I recognise from my business career that even in very tough times there are people who succeed, just as there are those who fail during very good times.  It is within our remit as individuals and communities to address the problem.  In these times, it is very easy to be pessimistic.  Those <Col N="750"/>with longer memories know that the tourism and hospitality sector, as with any other, operates in cycles.  I remember Bloody Sunday and the burning of the British Embassy in 1972.  There was a huge drop in the number of tourists and nobody came from Britain that year.  That was such a long time ago but when we consider what has occurred more recently, we will note that the industry experienced a fall in the number of visitors in 2001 and 2002 following the events of 11 September 2001 and also as a consequence of the economic downturn in the wake of the dotcom disaster in the same period.  However, the sector recovered and there was an increase in the number of foreign customers in each of the following five years.  We can do something about the current trend but we must not lose confidence and must take action ourselves.</P>
        <P>When I was in college in the 1950s, I was involved in the co-operative movement.  An Comhar Taisteal was established in this era.  It was the co-operative travel organisation based in Gardiner Street in Dublin.  It made a deal with CIE and interested parties in west Cork whereby, for &pound;2, CIE would take a family from Dublin to the nearest station in west Cork, where they would stay in a local farmhouse.  The local farmer would meet the family at the station, usually with a horse and cart &mdash; there were not many cars around in the 1950s &mdash; and offer them a holiday in that part of the world.  My role in the co-operative movement &mdash; I was a teenager at the time &mdash; was to present farmers with the opportunity of generating new income by having Dublin families holiday in Cork.  This really was exciting.  In those days, people did not go away on holidays, except to relatives.  In this case, however, our customers, who were from Dublin and certainly did not have relatives in the country, went to west Cork.  The greetings and the welcome were remarkable and the initiative was a great success.  This is not the kind of tourism we think of today, which involves guesthouses, swanky hotels with big swimming pools and every other facility.  It involved living the way of life the city dwellers did not otherwise have a chance to experience.  We can do a considerable amount as individuals as well as doing so as communities.  I would love to see us do more in this regard.</P>
        <P>Let me refer to some other areas.  We know the saying that talk is cheap but we need to return to basics and make it easy for people to book hotels and guesthouses.  We need to give them what they desire.  They need the packaged product to highlight what is on offer.  We need to showcase ourselves in the best possible light and educate our customers, not only on what is on offer but on what is available free and of the best possible value.</P>
        <P>I was contacted today by the Irish Travel Agents Association, which is urging the Minister to halve the cost of bonding for travel agents.  Its letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1">There will be no cost to the exchequer and no risk to consumers but a genuine prospect of jobs being saved in our industry.  Every job saved is also a saving of &euro;20,000 to the exchequer every year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The association also states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We believe 2,500 jobs are at risk.  [In this regard it states] &ldquo;we fear these are &lsquo;invisible jobs&rsquo; because they are spread amongst small businesses nationwide not clustered in one town or city.  The tragedy is that a simple, cost free, act of red tape reduction could do a lot to save these jobs at no cost to the exchequer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The association refers to bonding for Irish travel agencies:</P>
        <P LI="1">Quite apart from recessionary pressures, these jobs are at serious risk due to the fact the industry is regulated by outdated legislation introduced as far back as 1982 [I was not aware of this].</P><Col N="751"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The legislation imposes a burden of regulation that is overseen by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) and bears little relationship to either the operation or the work practices of today&rsquo;s industry.  More importantly, the regulation fails to achieve its primary objective, the protection of the travelling public.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">While there are many aspects of the regulation that are not working, the part that is causing most difficulty at industry level is the requirement for Travel Agents to provide financial security by way of a bond equal to 4% of annual turnover.  While travel agents have no difficulty providing an appropriate level of financial security to protect our customers, the statistical evidence clearly shows that a maximum 2% of annual turnover is adequate rather than 4% insisted on by CAR.  Given today&rsquo;s financial environment, the requirement to provide twice as much bonding as required is driving companies out of business.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am making the case for the travel agents without full knowledge of the point they are making.</P>
        <P>We need to remind people, particularly the Irish, that one does not have to travel abroad to have a really good experience.  Ireland has an abundance of attractions to offer.  There are great sights to be seen, fabulous beaches, great national parks and golf courses, some of which were mentioned today, and great walking and cycling trails.  There are great visitor attractions and cultural and heritage sites.  Just last week, <i>The Irish Times</i> produced a lovely book on the walks one can do in various locations around Ireland.  It was very interesting to see it.</P>
        <P>We will struggle to attract the same number of foreign visitors we attracted in recent years and it is therefore vital that we focus on the domestic market and attract the Irish to holiday at home this coming year.  It is not only important for tourism but vital to our economy.  Hotels are playing and will play their part in providing some fantastic deals.  All one must do is check the daily newspapers or the Internet to obtain evidence of the fantastic deals on offer.</P>
        <P>The value of sterling is such that it is very attractive for shoppers to go to the North to shop.  It is also making it very difficult for the British to come to Ireland because it has become a lot more expensive.  We must really work harder.  I am confident that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing its job of attracting people to the island of Ireland.  The real task is to make their experience such that they will come back again.  We are helped a great deal by what the Minister and F&aacute;ilte Ireland can do but, if we are to succeed, we must realise the matter is in our own hands.  If this is the case, we just have to believe in ourselves.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ag tarl&uacute;, c&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; againn go rialta go dt&iacute; seo.  T&aacute; athr&uacute; ag teacht ar st&aacute;das na turas&oacute;ireachta an t-am ar fad.  Maidir leis sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh seans againn &mdash; ag brath ar an taith&iacute; at&aacute; againn &mdash; &aacute;r dtuairim&iacute; a nochtadh chuile l&aacute; agus chuile seachtain.  I am delighted we are having this debate again.  We have had it on several occasions.  Very often on the Order of Business tourism is mentioned.  This is as it should be because it is almost a moveable feast.  The tourism environment is changing and business is becoming more competitive.  People, perhaps because of economic pressures, have decided we should achieve value for money.  All these issues arise and for this reason it is important to have a continuing debate on and assessment of what is happening on the ground.</P>
        <P>Kerry people are particularly good at promoting their own county.  This was evident today but it is evident generally.  Deputy Jimmy Deenihan has done me the honour of asking me to officially open his conference on cultural tourism tomorrow night.  It will be held in Listowel.  The reason I mention this is that Listowel is an example of how tourism should be promoted.  The people there live their culture and cultural tourism.  Perhaps this is the point made by Senator Feargal Quinn with regard to people power when dealing with visitors.  We should not always be checking the till to see how much money we are getting.  The money will come.</P><Col N="752"/>
        <P>It is absolutely vital that our reputation for friendship is cultivated and that we are particularly careful to be attentive to the needs of visitors.  Often that is not very tangible.  One must listen and see precisely what they want.  Visitors may want to trace their ancestors and, for example, if their name is &ldquo;Clifford&rdquo;, one may be able to tell them that a family of that name lived down the road two generations ago and that if they visit the local cemetery they might see the grave space or the remnants of the homestead.</P>
        <P>I saw a case where a family came back from the United States to a particular part of County Clare.  They wanted to see where was the homestead but all that was left was a heap of stones where the grass was growing.  They photographed the particular site.  They picked up little stones and put them into their pockets to bring them back to the United States.  To the cynic, this might seem like an unusual exercise, but to the visitor it is part of their spiritual inheritance.  This is more powerful than all the advertisements on television or in the newspapers.  It has an emotive and emotional context of which we must be conscious.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will mention Cashel later and I will not miss the opportunity to do so, but with regard to Listowel, there are more writers per square foot. in Listowel than in any part of the world.  One could name ten significant writers from there.  One must ask oneself why is this the case.  One reason relates to something Bryan MacMahon stated on a television programme and mentioned in one of his books.  The local library service asked him whether a branch could be established in his school and he told them not to do so but to establish it in the building across the road.  When he was asked why, he explained that if the library was established in the school it would be associated with the school but if it was established in another building it would be associated with the community.  The context of community for tourism is absolutely vital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I examined the statistics for January and these are encouraging when one considers the numbers.  I went to get my hair done a short time ago and the barber mentioned that places were busy and that there were many visitors around.  To hear this from people shows that the resilience of our tourism industry will stand us in good stead.  I can remember going to the United States at the height of the Northern Ireland Troubles and meeting people there who knew nothing about it except the headlines in the newspapers or what they saw on television and, generally, these were of a tragic nature.  All these people felt that Ireland was engulfed in war at that time.  For Bord F&aacute;ilte, as it was then, to try to offset this negative image of Ireland was virtually impossible, yet it succeeded in doing so.</P>
        <P>Now, we have a two-pronged approach.  I was speaking with a DUP representative during a debate on what cultural tourism meant.  I made the point that we are particularly lucky to have a single body to promote the entire island of Ireland, namely, Tourism Ireland.  It is doing a great job and we do not have a negative image going out.  We must also remember that previously, publicity campaigns were threatened and undermined by a new tragedy.  The global economic downturn is no more daunting than the challenges we faced in the past.</P>
        <P>I agree that we must focus on ourselves rather than on what Governments should be doing.  The infrastructure is there and it has been supported.  No matter where one goes, we have good roads for people to travel.  However, we still have things which are exclusive to ourselves.  We still have national monuments, a great literary tradition, great Irish music, great sports and a great image worldwide.  We never colonised any other country in the world and the friendship of the Irish is well known.  However, it is up to the community and the individual to promote the country and we should start talking tourism up rather than down.</P>
        <P>In recent months, several bodies have come before the Oireachtas committee which deals with tourism.  These include Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and tour operators.  All these groups have been positive.  The next step is to get this positive attitude across within communi<Col N="753"/>ties.  On every occasion, I state that it is absolutely vital that we maintain and sustain the bed and breakfast network.  It might seem to be irrelevant because there are so many hotels which provide good rates at present.  However, the personal experience in a bed and breakfast stays with the visitor for a long time.  There are possibilities in this sector.  If we could tweak the law a little and allow bed and breakfast establishments to have alcoholic beverages available for customers, it could make all the difference to this sector of the industry.</P>
        <P>Let us try to get organised at community level.  Tourism boards at county level have disappeared statutorily.  To some extent, the regional tourist boards have been marginalised.  Apart from Dublin Tourism and Shannon Development, to a large degree the others do not have a structure.  Even on a non-statutory basis let us try to have a forum within each community to sell itself.  I like the little anecdote Senator Feargal Quinn told about a parish priest in Kerry stating that the way one keeps one&rsquo;s visitors is to look after their needs.  Communities need a forum to highlight these matters and find ways and means of developing them.</P>
        <P>I paid tribute to Kerry and the manner in which the people there are able to promote it.</P>

	<P>One of the finest monuments in Europe is the Rock of Cashel which 300,000 people visit every year.  However, the hotel infrastructure in the region does not have the best history.  Perhaps when an opportunity arises, we can do something to endeavour to keep the coach loads that come to the Rock of Cashel within the functional area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House to hear this debate.  I listened closely to the contributions of the Minister and Senators.  I agree with most speakers that tourism is one area that has huge potential, even in the difficult economic climate.  Tourism is one area that can be recession-proof if, as previous speakers stated, people contribute in a positive way.  However, they will need the assistance of the Government and I am interested to hear the comments of the Minister on the strategies the Government might have to grow tourism in the country.</P>
        <P>One of the main areas where the Government can assist the regions is the facilitation of infrastructure to assist and promote tourism in areas such as access to the regions.  We have regional airports.  Rail links and even bus corridors are very important as they give tourists the opportunity not only to visit Dublin and the Pale but to get out to the regions where they will see the real Ireland and the attractions.</P>
        <P>One area with huge potential, which has been mentioned by other speakers, is families holidaying at home.  The tourism industry is targeting and promoting family short breaks.  Will the Minister discuss with F&aacute;ilte Ireland promoting in the United Kingdom these short breaks here?  Cities such as Manchester and Birmingham have huge populations and there is direct access through Waterford regional airport to Waterford and the south-east region.  There should be marketing campaigns in these cities to offer short breaks that are good value for money and promote the tourism product in this country.  Ireland needs to go back to playing to its strengths.  Traditional bed and breakfasts and country farmhouses have lost ground in the last few years to the bland hotels that have been sprouting up around the place.  I had the pleasure of visiting a country farmhouse in Sliabh gCua, Touraneena in County Waterford.  It is an award winning farmhouse, and the people running it provide a simple product.  They introduced people from Europe, Canada and the US and such people are coming back.  The simple tourism product is the real Ireland of the welcomes.  They get good, clean accommodation and good directions to places to visit in the area.  Although the people running the farmhouse have advertised on the Internet, it is the experience they offer people that brings <Col N="754"/>such people back.  We need to go back to those old characteristics and tourism will benefit from that.</P>
        <P>While the economy was strong over the last few years, there was much focus on spas and golf clubs, which are important products.  However, we need to strengthen tourism by assisting communities.  Senators have already spoken about how people can contribute to tourism.  Communities themselves offer a great product, and I have been involved in a project on the links between Waterford and Newfoundland in Canada.  Over 100,000 Canadian visitors came to Ireland last year.  The Canadian economy is still doing quite well, and those tourists are still likely to travel.  However, only 40% of those tourists visited the south-east region, and only 9% spent a night in the region.  This is the case, in spite of huge cultural links between Waterford, the south-east region in general and Newfoundland in Canada.  Simple work can be done to attract more Canadian visitors to our region.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me to contribute to this debate without mentioning Waterford Crystal.  The Minister has this in his heart and has done much work in the background to retain the visitor product at Waterford Crystal.  This facility attracts over 310,000 visitors per annum to Waterford and the south-east region.  It contributes millions to the Exchequer, and the spin off business from the visitor attraction at Waterford Crystal for hotels, guesthouses, pubs, restaurants, and even the liner business into the Waterford Estuary, could be lost unless we address this issue urgently.  I call on the Government to come with a strategy to fill the vacuum that has been created by the loss of Waterford Crystal to Waterford city.  Some local business people are doing their utmost to come up with an alternative facility so that crystal can be manufactured in Waterford and an attraction provided, but this is a world recognised brand and we cannot afford to lose such an attraction in the south east.  The Government should treat this issue with the urgency it deserves, because it is essential that this visitor attraction remains in Waterford.</P>
        <P>This debate has been very welcome.  Tourism can survive this recession.  We concentrated in the past on promoting spas and golf clubs, but we need to go back to assisting communities.  Local authorities have a role to play, and Waterford County Council is involved in a progressive tourism product, that is, the Waterford food fair.  The Minister opened the fair last year and I attended it.  It attracts people from Ireland, the UK and from Europe.  It goes back to what is good and different about Ireland.  We are selling our food, an indigenous product, and we are promoting tourism around that, and hotels, guesthouses and restaurants will benefit.  The food fair was a local initiative that was assisted by the local authority and by Government agencies, but we need more of this and we need to market it more often.  That is the way we can grow tourism in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his portfolio.  He has a serious challenge ahead, because marketing Ireland is a big task.  Ireland is the good food nation, it is the Ireland of the welcomes and it is a great ambassador for its music over the years.  It is a remarkable country for its sportspersons, and we saw great achievements last Saturday.</P>
        <P>I knew our Minister when he was a Minister of State.  I saw him come in here on the evening of a budget that had just been read in the other House for the first time, yet he took questions from all the eminent Senators.  At that stage, I said that Deputy Martin Cullen was certainly going to make his mark in the Government.  I wish him well in his portfolio.  It is an extremely important portfolio because it is responsible for a huge amount of employment in the services sector.</P>
        <P>I want to talk about three areas of tourism, namely, wages, local authority costs and energy costs.  Energy costs have completely gone out of hand.  Prices charged for gas and electricity <Col N="755"/>are unsustainable.  Any industry that provides substantial employment &mdash; guesthouses, hotels and so on employ 30, 40, 50 and up to 200 people in some cases  &mdash; should obtain a specific rate from the Government, after which no more can be charged per unit of electricity or gas.  There are 800,000 people working in the small and medium sized sector in Ireland.  These people work in the local family run businesses and they have been around for 25 to 30 years.  They are not fly-by-night businesses.  They are the backbone from which the country will come out of the recession.  We can be assured that the people running those businesses are making no money today.  They are surviving and hoping that in a couple of years they will be able to keep the loyal, dedicated people who helped them build up their business over the years and who are rearing their families all over Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are the people and the businesses the Government should be looking after.  However, the ESB raised prices by 17.5% in August, while Bord G&aacute;is raised prices by 20% in September.  The companies made a big deal about reducing prices by 10% next month for domestic users, but what about the people who are creating employment?  What about people who are supplying the wages?  The Government has a duty in this budget to look after those who are providing employment, because if there are no golden geese, there are no golden eggs.  It is as simple as that.  It is not acceptable that the price of gas and electricity has increased by 40% in two years.  If we look at the prices across the Border, we must lead by example.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach knows the value of a job to us in the midlands.  We look forward to having him for the longest time, because he is an exceptional Taoiseach.  We all saw only too well on our television screens on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day the wonderful welcome the man from Offaly received in the US from the new President, with his connections in Moneygall.  There are nations in the world that would give their right hand for the welcome and the amount of time that our Taoiseach was given in Washington.  Our Cathaoirleach, Senator Moylan, the man from Banagher, accompanied the Taoiseach and showed the strength of the Offaly connection on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  The people of Ireland are looking to Brian Cowen and Martin Cullen, the Minister in charge, to deal seriously with energy costs for tourism business.</P>
        <P>Experienced officials from the Department are sitting here listening to my contribution, so they should be made aware that the Irish hotel sector has its back to the wall.  The people involved are keeping it going because most of us are born to tradition.  We are keeping it going because we hope that something will happen that will give us a break.</P>
        <P>The second major challenge is to deal with the sewerage charges and water charges levied by local authorities.  Not alone are they charging us for water that comes in, but they are now going to charge us for the water that goes out.  If there were a commitment to keep people in jobs, and there is, and we are all in it together on both sides of the House, let us give priority to those who are providing employment.  When the economy recovers and the opportunities for further employment present, these very employers, that is, the small and medium sized family businesses, will take on staff and train them under F&Aacute;S schemes, given the proper incentives.  There is no point in starting F&Aacute;S schemes in areas without knowing where the jobs are going to be in one, two or three years.  However, if incentives could be given to the hotel, guest house and tourism sectors to enable them to train the chefs, waitresses and receptionists of tomorrow, they would gladly hire such people and train them now.  If the incentives exist the people are there to respond.  They responded when the tourism business was in its infancy in the late 1950s and early 1960s and in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
        <P>Ireland, the good food nation, has come a long way.  We hosted the Ryder Cup.  An Bord Bia was responsible for a wonderful marketing campaign promoting Ireland as the good food nation.  There are marvellous chefs and tremendous cooks here.  There is wonderful food, but the problem is the high cost of wages.  Who can pay &euro;20 per hour?  The Acting Chairman comes <Col N="756"/>from a place to which I go on holiday every year.  There is not a year when I do not visit the Gleneagle Hotel in Killarney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is most welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Acting Chairman on his appointment as president of the wonderful golf club in Killarney, which is a great honour for him and his family.</P>
        <P>Who can pay &euro;20 per hour?  One can visit France, Portugal or Spain where there is guaranteed sunshine.  All we have in Ireland is the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, the welcomes, the beautiful scenery, the countryside and the good food and accommodation.  There should be a suspension of whatever agreements are in place.</P>
        <P>Last Sunday three weeks, I arrived in Dublin Airport.  I tried to get lunch in six hotels nearby the airport, but not one of them was serving lunch on a Sunday and I could not believe it.  In the end I asked a person in a hotel in Liffey Valley, who recommended that I go to the Deadman&rsquo;s Inn, a pub, because there is a lovely lunch there.  It was beautiful and fabulous, because there is a different wages regime.  Why is the hotelier being penalised?  Why are the people willing to work, to avail of work and have their employment next door to where they live penalised?  Some common sense should prevail in respect of this penalty, because everything is in place.  Restaurants are in place for six days of the week and cannot open on Sunday because of wage costs.  It is impossible to break even.  These are some of the points I wished to make.  I sincerely hope something can be done with energy costs, because they are a real penalty and many people are hurting very badly because of them.  They will influence whether some establishments will remain open for November, December, January and February this coming Winter and Spring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on tourism, a very important topic.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and I compliment him on the job he is doing as Minister with responsibility for tourism.  There is great scope for promoting Ireland and for increasing tourism.  However, we are falling down in many areas.  Many new initiatives could be put forward.  I question some aspects of the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Some areas which could be promoted are not being promoted.  The tourism authority has fallen down in respect of aspects that it has promoted heavily in the past but has abandoned in recent years.</P>
        <P>Let us consider golf.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland was heavily involved in promoting golf.  Then we hosted the Ryder Cup.  I am sorry we are not hosting the Ryder Cup this year, rather than the year it came, because that year Ireland was very expensive and the country robbed people who came here.  I was very disappointed in many cases with the service provided by the country to people who visited to attend the competition.</P>
        <P>When it was over, F&aacute;ilte Ireland forgot about golf to a large degree.  Following this, P&aacute;draig Harrington came into his own as a world class player and F&aacute;ilte Ireland no longer sponsored him.  Perhaps it could not afford to continue sponsoring him.  I listened to the BBC after he won the last British Open competition and the people who organised the British Open stated that P&aacute;draig Harrington was the greatest ambassador ever in the history of the British Open golf championship.  As a country we abandoned him.  Perhaps we could not afford him, but it should be that we could not afford to be without him.</P>
        <P>I heard from a person at home that P&aacute;draig Harrington visited Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin to meet a young lad who was picked on the Connaught golfing team.  He spent time with the lad and brought to him the flag from the 18th green at which he won his last major championship in the USA.  He returned again and gave the lad his sponsorship cap. <Col N="757"/> These are things that P&aacute;draig Harrington has done, but our tourist board abandoned him at a time when we should really have dug in.  There are lessons to be learned.  We should have continued to promote golf.  We should have approached golf clubs and hotels and told them to cut their hotel rates and green fees.  Instead they went wild and now we do not seem to have tourists in that department.</P>
        <P>There is not enough done in respect of promoting fishing, especially deep sea fishing.  Very little is being done in this area and there is a great opportunity there.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Coffey, commented on our national games, both hurling and Gaelic football, and the GAA.  Is there any reason why F&aacute;ilte Ireland could not buy thousands of tickets for games such as the Leinster final?  Such games could be promoted in England, Europe and America.  We have Croke Park which is one of the greatest stadiums in the world at present, but for the Leinster final it will probably only be half full.  Why can F&aacute;ilte Ireland not work out a package with the GAA for match tickets, hotels and flights and promote it in England, Europe and the USA for such events as the Leinster final and all Ireland semi-finals, during which the stadium may not be full?  Many people in this country go to cup and soccer matches in England.  Some go to the USA for basketball matches.  Some go to bull fighting in Spain.  Why can we not do something similar?</P>
        <P>Earlier, Senator Ellis commented on Ministers leaving the country for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  I have no difficulty with any aspect of that.  Any politician who leaves the country for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day does his utmost to promote the country and area whether he is a councillor, Deputy, Senator or Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Such people leave no stone unturned when they are away to promote their area, county, province or country.  I have no problem with that aspect of it.  I am aware Senator Doherty wishes to speak and that the Minister must reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a slight difficulty with that, because according to the Order of Business the Minister will respond at 4.50 p.m.  However, I call Senator Doherty, who has a few minutes to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Burke as am a roinnt liom.  T&aacute; a fhios againn gur ceist th&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; an turas&oacute;ireacht sa t&iacute;r seo agus go bhfuil laghd&uacute; ar an m&eacute;id turas&oacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; ag teacht isteach &oacute; thar lear.  Given the economic circumstances, it is important to maximise tourism spend and the tourism sector&rsquo;s potential.  Many Senators have ideas and suggestions on how to achieve this difficult objective.  I concur with some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Quinn to the effect that this objective will be primarily achieved by people on the ground developing innovative strategies, delivering on ideas and securing additional value from the natural beauty and assets of their local areas.  However, I also subscribe to the view that support must be provided at national level.  Responsibility for much of the work required in this area falls outside the Minister&rsquo;s portfolio.</P>
        <P>I produced a report for the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs entitled Awakening the West: Overcoming Social and Economic Inequality, a large part of which addressed the issue of tourism.  The north-west region has experienced a 30% decline in overseas visitors since 1999.  In 2006, counties Clare, Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal generated only 9% of overall revenue in tourism.  Counties Leitrim and Roscommon generated only 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, whereas County Galway contributed 9.3% of the overall figure.</P><Col N="758"/>
        <P>Given that the problem in rural areas is one of access, we must examine ways to support access to the regions.  The Government decision to freeze national roads projects is unwelcome as it will not benefit the tourism sector.  Let us put ourselves in the shoes of an American tourist flying into Dublin Airport.  If he wishes to visit County Donegal, he will not have access to a rail service and if he wishes to visit the west of the county, he will not even have access to a public bus service.  Tourists wishing to visit my county must rent a car and many of them are reluctant to do so.  For this reason, it is vital that we have a joined up approach to road, rail and bus infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Information and communications technology is another key issue.  Irish Rural Link, in a presentation to a joint committee today, provided a case example of a tourism product project which was severely hampered owing to the absence of broadband in the area in question.  As a result, bookings could not be taken over the Internet for up to nine weeks.  Difficulties of this nature create additional problems for the tourism sector.</P>
        <P>I welcome the support provided for regional and local airports, particularly the Government&rsquo;s decision to exempt smaller regional airports from the air passenger tax, which will be of benefit to the regions in question.  The Government must, however, focus more strongly on cultural and Gaeltacht tourism.  Of the approximately 6.4 million overseas tourists who visited Ireland in 2006, more than 2 million cited cultural and heritage reasons for their visit.  We must support the cultural and heritage tourism sector, on which we have failed to capitalise in recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s indulgence in allowing me time to contribute to the debate and I will conclude shortly.  I come from the Gaeltacht.  Most of the people who make return visits to the Gaeltacht first visited the area to attend Irish language schools.  In addition, most parents of students who travel to the Gaeltacht this summer to learn the national language will spend a night in the Gaeltacht while visiting their sons or daughters.  The Department should, through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, have access to all relevant information on this group.  As such, it should target families who will visit Gaeltacht areas for a day by putting together packages with a view to extend such one-day visits to two or three days.  It should, for example, highlight the assets of the areas in question with a view to maximising this form of tourism.</P>
        <P>I could say much more on the tourism sector, which will be crucially important to national recovery.  Tourism accounts for 3.9% of GNP and makes an even larger contribution to the economy of the west than to that of the east.  That is the reason I focused on the west, a region in which much work needs to be done.  While those involved in many tourism projects are doing their best, I adhere to the philosophy that if one builds, people will come.  When one travels abroad one sees tourism resorts which have been created for the tourism market.  We must consider taking a similar approach here, while avoiding the establishment in west Donegal or elsewhere of resorts such as those in Ibiza.  We must use all the resources at our disposal to build on the tourism product.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their thoughtful contributions to this debate.  There is no doubt that since my previous visit to the House last November, Senators have remained abreast of developments in the tourism sector.  They will not have been surprised by the issues I highlighted earlier in the context of the economic challenges we face.  These challenges are global and impact on our core markets in the United States and the United Kingdom. </P>
        <P>It is interesting that figures for January show increases in visitors from mainland Europe and North America of 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively.  I hope this somewhat surprising trend will be sustained throughout the year.  The overall position is that 424,000 people visited Ireland in <Col N="759"/>January, a decline of 2.9% on the previous year.  Clearly, the various markets have been impacted in different ways.  The other interesting figure from the most recent data is that the number of Irish people taking breaks abroad fell by 8.4% in January.  This may be indicative of a new trend among Irish people to take weekend breaks at home.  Perhaps many more people will also take their summer holidays at home this year.  I sincerely hope that will be the case.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the robustness of the tourism sector, which is our largest industry.  Senator Cassidy and others noted that 320,000 people are employed in the general hospitality area, which contributes more than &euro;6 billion in foreign earnings to the economy each year and generates returns of between &euro;2 billion and &euro;3 billion to the Exchequer.  It is also a unique industry in that it drills down into the smallest villages and areas in the country and delivers substantial benefits to areas with no other sustainable businesses.</P>
        <P>Recent dramatic improvements in the quality of the stock in the hotel sector have been encouraging.  Senators referred to the cost of hotel accommodation.  Clearly, economic circumstances have had an impact on the sector.  It is interesting to note that the cost of hotel rooms in Dublin has declined by approximately 20%, with the cost of rooms in the rest of the country down by 17%.  While one can view this development in two ways, it indicates that competitiveness is returning to the system.  This will make Dublin a much more attractive capital city as it competes with other European capital cities for tourists.</P>
        <P>In general, given the good quality of the hotel product here, recent cost trends improve the tourism product.  As Senators noted, this will be beneficial during the remainder of the year.  This is one of the messages the major tourism organisations, particularly Tourism Ireland, which represents the entire island, are trying to get across.  The readjustment in tourism marketing campaigns is also working.  Tourism is a tough market but the various organisations in the sector are working together with private tourism interests to bring a sharp focus in our main markets on delivering significant numbers of tourists who will spend money.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of Killarney House.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the national parks and wildlife service and the Office of Public Works are considering Killarney House as a priority for investment under F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism capital investment programme.  Discussions are ongoing with all three organisations on the scope and costs of the works required.  The current position is that consultants have been appointed to prepare a scheme for the renewal of the gardens and these preparations should be completed shortly.  A building conditions survey has also been commissioned on the house to precisely specify the extent of remedial work required.  Following this a design scheme will be prepared for the restoration of the House to service a probable visitor centre for the national park.  Thereafter, cost estimates will be prepared.   Work is under way on this matter.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That can lead to a positive outcome.</P>
        <P>I want to mention another issue before I conclude.  I have been trying to lay serious emphasis on cultural tourism and the bringing together of all the cultural bodies.  Approximately 3 million people visited our cultural tourism institutions in 2008.  That is a significant figure which demonstrates clearly that all of our small and major museums, art galleries and music festivals have a major impact.  Culture is one of this country&rsquo;s easiest &ldquo;sells&rdquo;.  It is the automatic touchstone people have to Ireland&rsquo;s tradition.  Our music, art, drama and actors are being feted throughout the world.  They have been hugely successful in all fields of their activities.  That is a more coherent emphasis that I want to promote in terms of a cultural tourism package.</P>
        <P>Other speakers referred to the work of Good Food Ireland which, incidentally, has done incredible work with the Volvo Ocean Race.  I understand its representatives have located in <Col N="760"/>all of the stops and have had huge success promoting Irish food.  The investment by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in that particular project has gained much added value in terms of what we can achieve.</P>
        <P>In case Senator Coffey thinks I would not refer to it, I wish to say that Waterford Crystal is a significant issue to Ireland and as other Senators have said, it is one of the key brands identified with this country.  I send out the message that I remain available, as does the T&aacute;naiste, to talk to KPS Capital.  We are anxious to meet with its representatives to determine how we can now work with them for an investment in some smaller scale manufacturing of a high end quality that would enhance a very good international quality tourist trail and invest in a tourism facility as well, not alone to sustain what already exists but, as others have said, with a view to turning it into an iconic visitor centre which would easily double the numbers and, in time, go beyond the 1 million figure.  That work must be done but we are waiting to meet with KPS Capital representatives to see where they stand on their future prospects for investment in Waterford Crystal and are willing to support that in any way we can.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators for putting down the motion.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to come to the House to listen to the debate and I look forward to future debates with the Senators.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the various Government interventions in broadband which have led to improved choice, quality and prices of services and the national broadband scheme which will make broadband available in those parts of the country not currently served.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome the Bill regarding the investment in broadband services.  Foreign investors coming to Ireland have two requirements, one of which is a good telecommunications system and the other being transport.  The overall goal for the Government is to ensure that its communications policy continues to drive the Irish economy and break the digital divide.  A key strategy in achieving that goal is to ensure the widespread availability of affordable broadband for business and citizens.</P>
        <P>The current position is that broadband is not widely available here.  We had a meeting last week with Eircom representatives who admitted it is not financially viable to provide broadband in some rural areas of the country.  I spoke to a person involved in the telecommunications business before coming into the Chamber who told me that last week, a businessperson from Cavan was in contact with him and he was told in no uncertain terms that Eircom could not provide him with a broadband service.  Eircom is inhibited by the regulator from investing what it believes is necessary in the infrastructure to make it attractive to customers.  That is a problem that must be examined.  That happens in the United Kingdom as well, not just in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The current Eircom network providing broadband is not sufficient for businesses because it is low speed.  The problem that arises is that if Eircom collapsed tomorrow there is no plan B.  If Eircom collapsed, the other telecommunications providers would not be able to provide the service required.</P>
        <P>Government support will be needed to secure the long-term viability of the network, not only in cities but also in rural areas.  We must make broadband available to customers wherever they want it, at a cost that is affordable and within a specified period.  Not too far from here in Malahide and such places, broadband is non-existent.  A businessman to whom I spoke last week had to let two of his staff go because Eircom was unable to provide him with a broadband <Col N="761"/>service.  In the case of another person who has broadband, Eircom was unable to repair it.  The infrastructure is run down.</P>
        <P>Finance must be pumped into the provision of broadband if we want to broaden the provision and provide the service the customers require.  If we do not do that, jobs will be at stake.  I am aware of a case where two people were let go.  Another person cannot relocate because proper telecommunications service cannot be provided.  I support what the Minister is doing but I would like to him to examine the points I have raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Minister and the Government want to ensure their communications policy drives the Irish economy and breaks the digital divide.  The key strategy in that strategy is to ensure there is widespread availability of affordable, always-on broadband for businesses and citizens.  I am happy to note that the Minister recognises there is a lack of service in regional areas outside the main urban centres and that he has undertaken initiatives to address that problem by providing grant aid.  There is also recognition that more remote areas find it difficult to access broadband.  There are now people living in those areas who work from their homes three days per week and do not get a fast service, if any service at all.  That is frustrating for people trying to do business.  </P>
        <P>As someone from County Mayo I am aware that in the west of the county there is a demand for broadband but the people are not getting the service they require.  In south Mayo I am getting the same complaints from constituents.  While they live near Eircom bases they do not appear to be able to get the service they require.</P>
        <P>The national broadband scheme will bring broadband to areas of the country which currently are without coverage.  It is being provided by 3 Ireland independently of Eircom&rsquo;s plans.  This may be no harm, because Eircom has not done the job it promised to do.  This body is contracted to meet challenging roll-out targets and provide higher speed broadband as the scheme is implemented.  Implementation will be on the basis of electoral divisions.  The Minister has provided a major contribution from the Exchequer, which is welcome.  I hope the scheme will provide access to broadband in remote areas which are finding it difficult to get the required levels of service.  Urban centres seem to be fairly well looked after but rural areas are not.  This has a major impact on people living in those areas.  In fact, they are quite annoyed about it.</P>
        <P>There has been much negativity about Ireland&rsquo;s progress in the area of broadband but there is positive news too.  We should note that it is not all bad news.  As late as June 2007 there were 500,000 subscribers; now there are more than 1 million.  There are 40 operators in the market at present compared with three in 2000.  This gives an idea of where we are going and of the demand for the service.  The latest global innovation survey, which was published recently, placed Ireland third out of 40 advanced economies in the area of broadband improvement.  There was a 6,088% increase in the number of subscribers from 2005 to 2008.  This is welcome news.  I hope this progress will continue and that we get the service we deserve and that is being demanded.</P>
        <P>My colleague mentioned the appearance of Eircom representatives at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in early March.  They said they were reviewing the level of investment in next generation broadband networks owing to the economic downturn.  I may be wrong in saying this but I do not think it provided a great service when the economy was going well.  It did not do enough to ensure remote regions were provided with broadband access, whether by fibre-optic cable or by satellite.  It did not do a good job and I am delighted independent bodies are now coming in to pick up the slack.</P><Col N="762"/>
        <P>The representatives at the committee said that Eircom planned to upgrade its core network from copper wire to fibre-optic cable in urban centres and regional towns throughout the country by 2011.  That is not good enough.  It has had plenty of time and opportunity over recent years to improve the service but has not done so.  This will leave rural people without a hope of being provided with broadband.  Eircom is the largest and best resourced body to provide these rural areas with vital services but it has not done so.  It merits criticism in this regard.  It has not given the service that was expected through the years.  Despite the times we are in, Eircom also said there were technical difficulties providing broadband to people in rural Ireland who live more than 5 km from a telephone exchange.  I must challenge even that because I know people who live within 1 km of a telephone exchange and do not get a satisfactory broadband service.  This is to be deplored.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Government is pushing ahead with the national broadband scheme and I hope it will rectify many of the shortfalls that currently exist in rural broadband provision.  I compliment the Minister on his actions.  I know he is trying to advance this process.  It is vital, especially at present in view of the economic downturn.  There are opportunities.  I know quite a number of people who have set up businesses in their own homes aimed at foreign markets, and if they had a good broadband service they could bring much more money into our economy from abroad.  I ask the Minister to take our comments on board and to consider the more remote regions, especially along the west coast, where there are different problems to those existing in large urban centres.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Senator Twomey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed the amendment must be seconded, so each Senator must take his own slot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you for your direction, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister.  Apart from being unduly exuberant, the Government is somewhat premature in congratulating itself on its success in the area of broadband to date, <Col N="763"/>which is why we tabled a sobering amendment to give some balance to the discussion.  I hope Senator Carty sees fit to accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>There are many misconceptions about the current level of broadband coverage.  One of the most distorting aspects is the maps that have been available to date which do not always show the topography of the country and the areas, such as valleys, that are not covered.  I can identify large areas in my constituency that are not covered, and I know this to be the experience of colleagues in the same area.  We have not reached a level of coverage that is anything like adequate.  I was dealing recently with representations from an area beside a large provincial town which does not have broadband coverage.  I am told of areas 15 miles from Dublin, including in Wicklow, without proper coverage.  This emerged at the meeting today of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Coverage is by no means universal and quite sketchy in many places.  The maps hide areas in which coverage is bad.  The national broadband scheme is welcome but the delay in its implementation is regrettable.  However, even with the national broadband scheme, 12,000 homes would not be covered, which represents a considerable area without coverage.  This information is provided by the organisation Irish Rural Link and the figures are accepted by the Department.  The lack of a full broadband service is serious, with large tracts of the country not covered by the national broadband scheme.  Dernakesh, in the hinterland of Cootehill, a reasonably sized provincial town, does not have broadband coverage.  This is repeated throughout the country.  As a Senator I get communications from councillors who regularly tell me they do not have broadband.  I have heard this message in Westmeath, Louth, north County Dublin and Wicklow, all the counties in my own area and across Connnacht-Ulster.  It is important to widen coverage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Eircom is not in a strong position to deliver next generation broadband services and that is a concern.  It has admitted its financial position is difficult, with a debt burden of &euro;3.7 billion, and the parent company in Australia, Babcock &amp; Brown, is struggling to survive.  That has implications for the delivery of next generation broadband and our economic development.  The Government must intervene.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources expressed the view that Eircom would need to be taken into State ownership to attract investment and ensure sufficient capital for the development of next generation broadband.</P>
        <P>The amendment points out that broadband, especially next generation broadband, is critical for economic development by ensuring the availability of on-line booking, video conferencing and access to knowledge across the world.  It is vital to the maintenance of rural businesses, the rural economy and the lifestyle of people in the country.  At a time when jobs are being lost, it is important that broadband is available to maintain existing jobs and to provide access to information for students.  It is an important communications system in the modern world.  It is as important as a road network was in the past.  The need is critical.</P>
        <P>The initial date for full broadband coverage was the end of 2009.  The Minister has postponed that in recent pronouncements and, assuming optimum success, we are still 20 months from complete coverage according to his most optimistic projections.</P>
        <P>There are question marks around mobile operators providing broadband services and the speed of those services.  The national broadband scheme is welcome but we are not satisfied with the speed of the roll-out of broadband and the extension of the projected dates for full coverage.  The maps that exist do not offer an adequate account of the existing situation in many rural areas that lack coverage.  Progress to date does not merit the passing of the motion without accepting the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  The Minister is aware of the difficulties Eircom faces in providing infrastructure because Babcock &amp; Brown does not have the neces<Col N="764"/>sary funding.  The national broadband scheme he recently announced has been granted to 3 Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to take issue with some of the points Eircom made at the committee last week.  It was stated that it is not possible to get broadband more than 5 km from an exchange and that wireless broadband companies cannot provide the same coverage or bandwidth.  That is untrue.  Wireless broadband companies can provide the same speeds as Eircom, with 2 megabyte capability in both uploading and downloading.  One wireless broadband company of which I am aware can provide up to 8 megabytes for specific customers who need such download speeds for their businesses.</P>
        <P>The difficulty faced by wireless broadband companies is the varying standard throughout the country.  Many of them are set up by individuals who lack the necessary specific expertise in software to provide a service to the customer and in hardware to run the masts and provide the infrastructure to ensure the broadband works at all times.  The provider must also be a businessman because funding is needed to run the company.</P>
        <P>My sister lives one mile from the nearest exchange near Rosscarbery in west Cork and cannot get broadband while my brother can receive up to 8 megabyte speeds on the wireless broadband system.  He owns the company that does it; that is how I know I am right.  He can provide up to 8 megabyte broadband speeds to specific customers, with 2 megabyte speeds for all customers using the wireless broadband system.  He understands the Minister&rsquo;s predicament but he makes clear that what is being said about wireless broadband companies is not true.  They are efficiently run, have the technology and the business acumen and can provide broadband at the speeds necessary for people to enjoy broadband in rural areas.  The problem is that some of the schemes that have been set up are not very well run.  While I suppose the Government has little say in how they are run, it can give the impression to some people that wireless broadband does not work.  The Minister should become more involved in what is happening in that sector because it could provide a solution to many of the problems currently facing broadband.  There will be no easy solution, however, because the system in most major towns has been structured in such as way that it will be impossible to implement in an economically viable way for those companies wishing to use it.  It is just too expensive.  Eircom will not put the necessary millions into the system unless we buy it or put substantial State investment into the company.  Those are the existing problems for the fixed-line broadband service.</P>
        <P>Satellite is not an alternative because it is far too expensive.  In addition, mobile phone technology for broadband is not even as powerful as wireless systems.  Speakers have focused on broadband problems in rural areas and the solution lies with the wireless system.  I ask the Minister to meet with people like my brother and others who run these sorts of companies.  They are usually small outfits and may not interest the Minister to the same degree as the problems he would be faced with concerning Eircom.  They have solutions to offer, however, and it would be worth discussing the matter with them.</P>
        <P>Those are the main points I wished to raise.  Broadband is a major issue for politicians.  Public representatives are always hearing about people&rsquo;s unhappiness with the lack of access to broadband.  Even in major towns there are problems with Eircom lines not functioning properly, as well as problems with the demand system due to the cost of access.  We have broadband problems both in urban and rural areas, but they are not insurmountable if we put our minds to them.  Some of the Government&rsquo;s strategy will work, but more effort needs to be put into it.  We can get through this if we put our minds to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for the opportunity raise this crucial issue for the development of our country.  I do <Col N="765"/>not think anyone can be complacent about this matter and, having listened to the concerns expressed by Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Brady and Carty, I do not think they are being complacent.  They are very much aware of their constituents&rsquo; concerns and interests in having a better broadband service.  The first fundamental question is to ask why this is of such importance.  There are three reasons, the first of which is the economic one.  Many of the new jobs we will create as we trade our way out of the present economic crisis will arise from trade on the Internet &mdash; that network of networks for which broadband provides access.  Broadband is not an end or a benefit in itself, except for the access it provides.  The faster, more ubiquitous and easier that access is, the better for companies and individuals to be enterprising on that network.  In that way they can trade not only in Ireland but across the world in a seamless, clean, quick and efficient manner.  It is therefore central to our economic development in a way that we are only just starting to understand and explore.  As a country that has excelled in recent years as an open economy, trading internationally, it is critical for us to have a top class broadband network so we can avail of those opportunities which we are only starting to consider.</P>
        <P>Second, broadband is vital for the democratic development of our country.  One of the other uses of the Internet is the social networking that can take place on it.  In addition, it involves collaboration and a democratic engagement and involvement that can take place through the use of those networks.  During the recent presidential election campaign in the United States we saw a further step up in terms of people becoming engaged and actively involved in politics, which is what we all aspire to see happening regardless of our political background.  The Internet is therefore an important tool of democratisation in the development of our society.</P>
        <P>Third, the important question &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; arises.  I believe the Internet will be of crucial importance in meeting many of the environmental objectives we have.  It will cut down emissions and the use of resources.  People often refer to the &ldquo;Internet of things&rdquo; whereby we will go from one website, weblink or datapoint to another.  It will increasingly be a network that connects devices for electronics, transport, monitoring and machines in the home so we can use them more efficiently.  It will be centre stage in how we deliver efficiency to expand the economy in a way that meets the green economist Herman Daly&rsquo;s criteria of having qualitative development rather than quantitative growth.</P>
        <P>For those three reasons the roll-out of broadband is crucial.  If one looks at which countries have been successful in this respect and where networks have developed best, it is clear that competition has driven it.  In Holland and the United Kingdom where they have good networks that are ahead of ours, the competition between cable and fixed-line phone companies to provide such network access has driven the development, bringing speeds up and prices down.  While we have lagged behind in recent years, that competition has been more in evidence.  Because of it we have seen investment by companies and improvements in the situation.  As Senator Carty said, in June 2007 we had some 500,000 broadband connections whereas we now have roughly 1.2 million and the figure is rising.  We have come back from bottom of the league to tenth in the EU out of 27 member states.  We cannot be satisfied with that, however, because we need to be in the top three.  We need to match Denmark, Holland, Britain and other countries.  We recognise, however, that we have come some way.  We have 40 operators which are all equally important in that competitive market.  We do not see one operator as the sole possible provider.</P>
        <P>We must also recognise that in instances there has been real market failure.  The reason we have been lagging behind is because Eircom as a fixed-line company, and the cable operator, in those crucial years from 2002 to 2004 when the new Internet was developing, failed to invest in their networks and provide broadband access to the public.  They would say that was due to the lack of a business case but the reality was that we were not giving people the opportunity to connect and by dint of that we were falling behind and losing jobs.  We also lost the sort of <Col N="766"/>Internet connectivity that is expected in a modern, knowledge-based society and thus our ability to obtain services from such networks was hindered.  Because of that market failure the Government has over a period made a series of interventions and will continue to intervene to stimulate competition and get the services we want.</P>
        <P>One of the key initial investments that makes such obvious sense now, although at the time it was fought tooth and nail by certain sections of the public service because we may not have had a top notch cost-benefit analysis, was in our international connectivity.  A State investment in a global crossing-fibre connection to the wider world Internet, was a crucial investment.  It improved our position through cheaper international connectivity and higher band width speeds, which brought business to this country.  Continuing that tradition of investment, recent contracts have been signed concerning Project Kelvin, which is an international connection from the United States to the north west of this island, connecting down through Monaghan and Cavan &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Reilly will be glad to hear &mdash; to Dublin.  That will add to our international connectivity thus ensuring quick and fast connections with the rest of the world.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government has engaged in a number of different schemes to boost market efforts.  Initially with the group broadband schemes, some 127 rural communities were given the opportunity to access the type of operators referred to by Senator Twomey.  They often operate with innovative fixed-line and wireless solutions which we must turn to because of our demographic situation, which is different to most other countries.  Up to 40% of houses are located in rural areas where it is difficult to run a DSL connection any distance from an exchange.</P>
        <P>Beyond that there was the development of the metropolitan area networks in two phases.  It was a massive investment by the State in fibre connections in most large towns and several large cities.  That investment will prove to be a long-term real benefit to the State, as we need to move to fibre as our main transportation network for heavy data traffic.  There will be space for cable, mobile, fixed, wireless, satellite and other operators.  They will be able to work best when they get their volume data transactions on to fibre.  New photonic systems will be able to carry large volumes of data, multiples of what is carried by present systems.  The metropolitan area networks were an important long-term investment by the State in that regard.</P>
        <P>The issue of covering rural areas that could not be included in the metropolitan area networks scheme did not go away.  Neither did the group broadband schemes solve the problem.  In recognition of that, we have signed contracts on a national broadband scheme which is aimed at getting to the 10% of the population which otherwise would not be served.  The best way to manage the scheme was to go down to the smallest local area district &mdash; the electoral district.  We reached agreement with the EU under the competition rules that where there was a significant minority of the population in any such electoral district which could not get broadband, it could be provided on a subsidised-supported basis.</P>
        <P>That is what happened with the competitive process involving several different companies and leading to the contract being awarded to 3, a Hutchinson Whampoa company, which in turn is a major international company providing 3G broadband access with guaranteed broadband transaction speeds.  It is a crucial and important development for the social, economic and environmental agenda.  The public sector involvement of &euro;79 million, out of the &euro;200 million project, shows it is not an insignificant investment and the political importance of covering those areas that would not be provided with that broadband service.</P>
        <P>We need to push further and not rest.  In the next-generation broadband discussions, we engaged with a range of different industries, not just telecommunications but the computer and broadcasting industries.  Several developments from these discussions have emerged.</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>It is proposed to ensure high speed 100 MB connectivity broadband in our schools and a wireless connection for every classroom.  For example, a French classroom could connect with a classroom in Mayo or Donegal to provide a real-time interaction and different learning experience.  Another example would be a mathematics class being able to download the latest leading physics lectures from MIT at the click of a mouse.  Teachers and students having that ability would change the education system.  This would be the greatest benefit of the State intervening to provide such access to schools in an open and competitive manner which supports the market.  It also will have a knock-on effect in the provision of high speed broadband services to other services and households in the area.</P>
        <P>Another development in the strategy is to provide a one-stop-shop wherever there is State infrastructure with ducting, which could carry a fibre network.  It will be co-ordinated to allow businesses access to it.  Likewise, the planning system must be changed so that any new housing developments will have high-speed fibre connections to ensure householders do not have to retrofit their residences.</P>
        <P>The most crucial advantage Ireland has in the development of a broadband network is its available wireless spectrum.  Access to it, unlike in other countries, is not restricted because there is not much of a military demand for it and because we are an island.  The use of that spectrum in an innovative way to test new wireless systems and applications is an advantage.  We have given clear directions to the communications regulator to use the spectrum wisely and put us ahead of other countries which might not have the same resource.</P>
        <P>It is crucial, be it the cable or fixed-line telephone companies, to make the investments now that will deliver the next generation of broadband services on their networks.  Be it building a fibre connection to a telecommunications cabinet to ensure high-speed connection to the nearest homes or be it upgrading the cable television system to provide broadband, such investments will provide a future for those companies and provide an income, not just from their traffic but others sharing it.</P>
        <P>In this way, a business case can be built up for what is a difficult and costly investment.  Failure to do that will see this country falling behind again and missing out on the jobs we need to create in this economic crisis.  The State will do whatever is possible to support this type of investment in a competitive market.  There must be a more co-operative, but at the same time competitive, approach to ensure access for a range of different suppliers is made much more easily and everyone benefits economically.  That is the nature of this new Internet world.  It is a more collaborative and open world and ages away from the old days of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs where the one company managed the whole process.  That was the time when one had to wait nine months to get a telephone and someone could listen in on the exchange.  We are in a faster, more open-access and distributed Internet world now.  We need to be good at it.  The companies which fail to invest in it will fail in the short run because it is a fast-changing world.  This is what we must achieve.  It is no small task and one we cannot ignore or be slow in taking on.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech because I was not happy with the wording of the Government&rsquo;s motion that Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomed the Government&rsquo;s intervention in broadband provision.  It was far too complacent while the Minister was much more open and explained his plans and hopes for achievement in the area.  It was far more honest.</P><Col N="768"/>
        <P Just="Left">On 12 December 2007, Senator Ross also tabled a motion on broadband access.  During that debate I pointed out one of the four principle issues in the last Australian general election was broadband roll-out to every house in the country.  The Australian Government of the day lost the election because of its failure to roll out high speed broadband.</P>
        <P>I accept many other factors will determine how people vote on this Government, but the broadband issue is very important.  I live less than 15 km from Dublin city centre and yet I cannot get broadband in my home.  I was pleased the Minister said there would a subsidised-supported basis for those households which cannot get broadband.  I am probably one of those but I am frustrated that I have to do so.</P>
        <P>I am still concerned at Eircom&rsquo;s reluctance to invest in next-generation broadband, which hits people in sparsely populated rural areas hardest.  Eircom stated that the economic downturn forced it to review its investment in next generation broadband, which will be a major disappointment for many of its customers.  Eircom is carrying a huge debt burden, in the order of &euro;3.7 billion, and is losing market share.  Its Australian parent company is in even worse shape and is struggling to survive.  This means Eircom is not well placed to deliver what the country needs, namely, a high-speed broadband service.</P>
        <P>People in rural areas will be obliged to depend on wireless technology for their broadband needs.  This is not ideal because the connection speeds will be relatively slow and will be dependent on the number of users accessing the service at any one time.  For personal users, low-speed broadband may be adequate.  However, for most businesses, first generation broadband will not suffice.  Unless rapid progress is made in respect of high-speed broadband provision, rural dwellers will fall further behind their counterparts throughout Europe.  In Sweden, for example, 80% of farms already have access to the Internet and one third of those who live on these farms use the Internet daily.  Ireland&rsquo;s rural internet service is closer to that provided in regions such as Tuscany in Italy and countries such as Hungary, where only one quarter of farmers use the Internet.</P>
        <P>Last year the Government rejected Eircom&rsquo;s request for a State investment of &euro;150 million to support its &euro;500 million plan to provide a faster broadband service to 70% of the population.  If the figures I have provided are not correct, perhaps the Minister will correct them.</P>
        <P>We will eventually reach a situation where it will be much more attractive for businesses to locate in Northern Ireland if high quality broadband services are not available here.  One need only consider the recent advances made in the North in this regard.  Almost 30,000 customers in the Balmoral area of Belfast are to be given access to super-fast broadband on the BT network early next year.  This is part of the largest ever investment in super-fast broadband in the UK in a project worth some &pound;1.5 billion.  The speeds available by means of this model are more than ten times as fast as those obtainable by most households in this country.  Why are we not taking a similar approach and investing properly for the future?  I am confident that the Minister, who spoke about the future, intends to do the right thing.  We must exert pressure to ensure that he does so.</P>
        <P>Access to high-speed broadband is a key requirement for modern business and is also a critical factor for national economic recovery.  The Government will be obliged to reassess matters if, as seems increasingly likely, Eircom is unable to deliver on its commitments in respect of future investment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments and his commitment.  However, I am concerned that people do not fully recognise the importance of broadband services.  I urge the Minister not to be complacent.  I am of the view that the motion before the House displays a degree of complacency which really must be avoided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  Like Senator Quinn, I express my appreciation of the Minister&rsquo;s optimism and vision and I welcome a number of the points he raised.  In particular, the Minister stressed the importance of business and indicated that he envisions a future in which we will take both a co-operative and a competitive approach.  He stated that he does not see these two coming into conflict with each other but that they are vital in the context of how we will deal with the challenge we face.</P>
        <P>In recent years, when we were more conscious of our excellence from an economic perspective, we used to refer to the need to develop facilities in rural areas throughout Ireland.  We also spoke about the importance of people in such areas being in a position to do business.  In addition, we perceived this matter in eco-friendly terms, particularly in the context that provision of broadband would reduce excessive commuting to areas of high population density.  At present, we have become distracted by more grave considerations.  Nonetheless, the matters to which I refer remain real and significant issues.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware of the views of Irish Rural Link, representatives of which made a presentation on the roll-out of broadband services to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources earlier today.  Irish Rural Link describes the national broadband scheme as the good, the bad and the inadequate.  As the Minister knows, Irish Rural Link is of the view that the lack of broadband services in many areas adversely affects indigenous entrepreneurship and will jeopardise our economic recovery.</P>
        <P>While the representatives of Irish Rural Link welcome the national broadband scheme, it is worth placing on record the concerns they raised.  For example, they pointed out that 12,000 homes and business premises which cannot access broadband services are excluded from the national scheme and that provision has not been made in respect of them.  The way in which the scheme has been rolled out on the basis of electoral areas means that some people who are already in a position to access broadband services will be included.  In addition, those who live in electoral areas that are not included under the scheme will not be able to access services.</P>
        <P>It is right that we should emphasise the importance of people doing business.  However, it is not the case that we are ignoring people&rsquo;s domestic use of the Internet.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s vision of the development of a kind of participative, democratic community.  There is no doubt that technology will be essential in the context of achieving this.  Technology, including broadband services, will be vital with regard to enabling people&rsquo;s proper engagement as citizens of this country.</P>
        <P>As everyone is aware, however, we operate in an economic context.  It is a healthy economy that makes everything else possible.  In light of this, we must ask what will be done for those who own the businesses that comprise the 12,000 homes and business premises which cannot access broadband services.  Is there any way in which specific provision might be made for these businesses or households?  Would it be possible to provide subsidies to households or businesses which might be able to prove that they are not in a position to access broadband services in a way that is economic?</P>
        <P>I recognise that the success of the national broadband scheme will depend primarily on mobile broadband technology.  Such technology has its advantages and its limitations.  I accept that a minority of people will be able to access broadband by means of satellite technology.  However, a large degree of subsidisation will be required in this regard.  If we are serious about the importance of facilitating businesses in rural areas, we must take action in respect of the 12,000 businesses and households which cannot access broadband services.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that ComReg has questioned the reliability of mobile broadband technology.  When it was first announced, it was stated that the national broadband scheme would provide universal broadband coverage.  However, people&rsquo;s views in respect of it began <Col N="770"/>to become more pessimistic.  The Department began to describe it as a first step and stated that many of the issues raised in respect of it would be addressed by measures that would be introduced later.  The Minister, when speaking in Silicon Valley, referred to the investment of &euro;223 million as a gap measure.  That is particularly disquieting because as part of its submission to the joint committee, Irish Rural Link highlighted case studies relating to two businesses, both of which have been severely challenged and frustrated by the lack of high quality broadband services.</P>
        <P>I wish to sound a note of affirmation in respect of the Minister&rsquo;s vision, which I share, of a future where people participate.  I particularly welcome the fact that he placed schools at the heart of his vision in the context of the role they can play in facilitating other members of the community in accessing broadband services.  Will he indicate the position with regard to the 12,000 homes and businesses currently excluded from the scheme?</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate, which presents us with a great opportunity to reflect on the issue of broadband, the progress that has been made and the work that must be done in the context of rolling out broadband services to every community in the country.  When widely available, broadband provides an affordable, always-on service for businesses, schools and individual citizens.  It is important that such a service is made available.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As the Minister indicated, the provision of broadband is mainly a matter for private sector operators such as Eircom and others, which operate in a liberalised market that is regulated by ComReg.  It is important that private providers fulfil their obligations in areas for which they have responsibility.  I have never subscribed to the notion that just because only a few people live in a particular area or because it is not economically viable to do so, private providers should not provide broadband services.  That notion is wrong.  I am of the view that Eircom fell short in respect of its public obligation in this regard.  Nevertheless, the Government has intervened where the market failed to provide the service.  There have been a number of initiatives by the Government such as those mentioned by the Minister, including the group broadband scheme which was like the old group water scheme.  The latter was technology neutral and it subsidised the implementation of 127 projects nationally, all in rural areas.  Small to medium-sized service providers supported competition using a range of different technologies and that really assisted small rural areas.  Those infrastructural interventions helped increase competition in the regions by facilitating the introduction of a new service to many small, mainly rural areas.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The other service being subsidised by the Government was the metropolitan area networks, MANs.  The assistance provided by the Government was facilitated by the Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme.  The MANs are ultimately State-owned.  I know there are a number of MANs in my county that have been funded by the Government.  They provide open access telecommunications networks to towns and cities that did not previously have a backbone service available to them or would not have it to this day had the assistance not been available from the Department.</P>
        <P>The Government has intervened to provide broadband to many rural and regional areas that would not have had it owing to the lack of commitment from the private sector.  In addition to the group broadband and MANs schemes the Department has introduced a new scheme.  Broad consultation has taken place over a long period and that scheme will be rolled out nationwide.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, referred to the national broadband scheme, NBS, that was sent to <Col N="771"/>tender.  A contract was signed between the Department and a private operator which tendered for the scheme.  The scheme will provide affordable, scaleable broadband services to rural Ireland.  Many such areas do not have a broadband service currently and the scheme will provide an extension of broadband facilities to rural areas that would not have the service readily available at present.  It will bridge the digital gap and give Ireland a better ability to engage in the knowledge society and knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the work that has been done by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, in developing the national broadband scheme and bringing it to its current position.  A contract has been signed and there is a definite period of 21 months from December last from which broadband will be rolled out to at least half the areas by the end of this year and all areas by September 2010.  That will mean significant leaps forward for many areas.</P>
        <P>The national broadband scheme will provide broadband to many areas in my county.  I have a map showing some of the areas that will be facilitated by the national broadband scheme.  Other parts of the country will be assisted also.</P>

	<P>I welcome the work that has been done to bring the scheme to fruition, especially in rural areas such as those in Donegal that did not have broadband.  Why should someone in a city have the service available when someone in a rural area does not?  Equality of provision is important.  I welcome the steps taken by the Government to achieve that.</P>
        <P>In his address the Minister referred to the challenges not only in rolling out the national broadband scheme to 1,028 electoral divisions throughout the country.  Obviously that is a challenge but it is one that is being met in a planned, constructive manner.  I have every belief that the investment of &euro;225 million will be delivered upon.  In 2002 or 2003 fewer than 4,000 customers in the country were able to avail of broadband but today approximately 1.2 million customers are availing of broadband.  That is a huge advance in a short time.  The Minister highlighted the ways those advances have been achieved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make two final points.  The Minister referred to the schools issue.  I believe it is vital that steps are taken to provide broadband to all primary and secondary schools in the State because pupils need to be able to obtain information digitally.  I know the Minister is addressing that issue.</P>
        <P>The second point relates to carrier lines.  While not directly linked with broadband, it is linked in an indirect way.  Where there are carrier lines in certain areas broadband cannot be made available through the telecoms lines.  My view is that Eircom is not fulfilling its commitment to fund carrier lines.  I urge the Minister to examine how we can address that issue.  The other matter that dovetails into that is where an exchange has been provided but the cable network leaving the exchange is so weak that the radius of coverage from the exchange is not adequate.  They are two issues that could be addressed.  I accept that some of the private companies are engaging with the Department to examine the matter.  Senator Brady worked for Eircom where he provided long years of service and he will be aware of what I say.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman and my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, who has been in the House much longer than I have.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am most grateful to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for so graciously allowing me to speak because otherwise I would not get a chance to contribute to this debate at all.  A minute should be more than sufficient time.</P>
        <P>As I understand it there are two principal problems.  The first is geographic spread and the second is speed.  I do not think they have been completely addressed by the Government despite its best efforts but it is making progress.  The significant difficulty is the reliance on mobile broadband.  As far as I can understand it, internationally this is regarded as satisfactory as a back-up service but not as the principal service because it does not have the adequate speed or capacity.  That is a significant problem.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s motion is bland in the extreme and almost invites the kind of negative response which it got.  What a pity.  We should all be pushing together because this is so necessary in terms of attracting international business.  If the unnecessarily negative elements of condemnation had been removed from the amendment on this side of the House then I think we could have rolled the amendment and motion together in a satisfactory way and we could have all got behind the Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to telecommunications.  That is the one aspect that is missing from the whole argument.  I note that when a debate took place on legislation introduced by this side of the House in Private Members&rsquo; time, no one but me mentioned the background.  The seeds of this problem were sowed in the privatisation of Eircom&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which was then raided by Tony O&rsquo;Reilly.  It was a smash and grab raid and then there was asset stripping and absolutely no investment in broadband.  That is where the whole problem originates.  If this side of the House wants to condemn the Government and State institutions for their lack of investment and lack of progress, why does it not condemn equally private business for what it did in holding this country back?  It is important that the record of this House should show that at least one Member of this House understands that vital point.</P>
        <P>I support the Government and would encourage it in every way I can to complete the programme of establishing broadband throughout the country, bearing in mind those two critical factors I mentioned, namely, geographical spread and megabyte speed.  Mobile broadband is not going to solve the problem.  It may be a makeshift answer for the time being but it is not sufficiently sophisticated or complex to attract international investment into this country, which is what we need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power.  I look forward to debating this issue.  It is important we debate broadband, especially in the current economic climate and given that there has been so much doom and gloom, threats and challenges to the Government and the country.  We need to start focusing on what is positive. We need to start looking at the smart economy and to consider areas of investment.  Despite the expectation of the budget it is my belief, which I have stated in regard to schools infrastructure, that now is the time to invest in infrastructure.  We must reboot the economy.  This would result in bringing people off dole queues, thereby making a social welfare saving.  In terms of taxation revenue and social welfare outputs, each job lost to the economy costs approximately &euro;20,000.  We are losing 1,000 jobs per day.  The Government needs to show initiative in terms of the smart economy, but also in terms of putting infrastructure in place now so that when the economy picks up we will have sufficient capacity in education and technological infrastructure to deal with that upturn.  Hopefully, it will come sooner rather than later.</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>While the announcement by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with regard to the signing of the contract with the 3 mobile network is welcome, it falls far short of what is required to compete with other countries.  This is true in particular for rural areas, as one sees when one teases out the issue and takes a closer look at what comes behind the announcement.  We need to view the issue in terms of international standards rather than just take an Irish view.  We need to consider it in terms of how we can compete with economies, skills pools and the technological resources of other countries.</P>
        <P>Some of the countries considered to have less well developed economies than ours have a much better broadband infrastructure and lower wage costs.  As a result, they are taking thousands of call centre and back office business processing jobs from Ireland.  We must be mindful of that.  A poor broadband infrastructure further diminishes our already slim prospects of attracting foreign direct investment to rural areas, as high speed broadband is considered a basic tool of modern day business.  High speed broadband is not just a necessary tool for multinationals or larger factories.  We need to remember the small entrepreneurs and small businesses in rural areas.  They may only provide a small number of jobs, but if we have enough of those types of businesses, they will deliver sufficient jobs.</P>
        <P>My town of Dunmanway lost manufacturing jobs, like many other towns of its size in the greater south Kerry and west Cork area.  However, we have tried to get over that.  For example, local authorities have provided land banks to small food processing operators.  This is an area of activity that might not have been considered significant ten or 15 years ago when we were used to companies offering 300 jobs.  However, these days a company such as that which provides ten jobs needs all the support it can get, whether a land bank from the local authority or broadband infrastructure it needs to survive.  Small industries such as this and entrepreneurs will not be enticed into rural areas unless we have decent broadband infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Some years ago a person of significant international scientific standing from west Cork who worked with several universities made the point that if there was proper broadband infrastructure in Dunmanway, which we now have, he could work from home.  His experience could be multiplied.  Many people who could have worked from home were, because of inadequate broadband provision, confined to larger population centres and cities.  They did not have the option to work from home nor gain the benefits of being able to do so, such as no transport required, fewer CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, lower costs because of not having to run a car and fewer demands on road infrastructure.  We need to bear in mind that our regional road infrastructure is not great.  I am aware we have great primary routes and our motorways have expanded.  We now have ring roads, and the M1 and M50 etc.  That is good, but in the recesses of west and north Cork and south Kerry, the road infrastructure, while not bad, is not up to national road standards.  It is important we give people the opportunity to work from home.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks I contacted the Minister on the issue of broadband provision for someone living in the Rossmore area, a village between Dunmanway and Clonakilty, where proper broadband infrastructure is not available.  This presents difficulties for the individual in question.  I wrote to the Minister about this, but I do not think that because of my representation it will happen immediately.  However, it is important the Minister is aware of the situation.  If we can cite personal experiences or examples for the Minister, these may help colour the thinking on the issue and illustrate the necessity for proper, decent roll-out of high speed broadband.  Access to this is essential, particularly in rural areas.</P>
        <P>There is an issue also with regard to rural schools where we have a better chance of delivery of the curriculum if we have proper broadband infrastructure.  In that regard, I wish to mention a wonderful occasion on Sherkin Island recently.  This relates to broadband provision for schools and the islands off the coast of west Cork, Bere Island, Cape Clear and Sherkin Island.  The wonderful occasion on Sherkin Island took place when DIT, in conjunction with Sherkin Island Development Society, presented certificates to people who graduated with a BA in <Col N="774"/>visual design.  The Minister for Education and Science was present on the occasion and there was significant media interest.  It was wonderful to see the governors of DIT and the Minister perform a graduation ceremony and award BA degrees.  This was a tribute to the Department, DIT and the community on Sherkin Island who launched that BA programme approximately five years ago.  When heading to the island on the ferry, the last thing one would think would be that people took the boat to the island to be presented with their degrees by the governors of DIT.  However, it was a wonderful experience.  The ceremony highlighted the importance of broadband infrastructure on the islands.  Schools on the islands will be much better able to deliver their curriculum with better infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I do not want what I have to say to sound political, but rural Ireland needs the proper roll-out of broadband.  We need Government action.  The programme is already behind schedule.  The contract was due to be signed in July of last year, but it was not signed until January this year.  This is a delay of almost a year.  We need to get going on the contract and to keep upgrading what we have.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This Fianna F&aacute;il motion welcomes Government support for the development of broadband across the country in the context of the programme for Government and the smarter economy document.  There is no denying that with regard to broadband roll-out we are not where we should be.  However, there is no denying either that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is committed to bringing us to where we need to be.  A number of Government initiatives over recent months show the direction we are going in terms of broadband.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy mentioned the need for broadband in schools.  There is a commitment towards achieving a national roll-out and effective programme in that area.  While there are criticisms of our broadband strategy because we are catching up so slowly, we should not forget that what makes us catch up may not be what we need in the longer term.  The criticism I would make would be that while we need to provide broadband access to as much of the country as possible, to do so in the short term through satellite and WiFi technology is not what is required for the longer term.  We need a physical infrastructure to provide a full broadband system.  I am confident that will and can happen, but we also need to meet the short-term need.  It is to the country&rsquo;s detriment economically that we do not have the infrastructure in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The real beneficiaries of a national broadband strategy would be rural communities.  However, I am heartened by seeing rural communities that thrive despite this lack.  A number of weeks ago I visited a small community in Waterford called Dunhill Ecopark, an initiative run by four community groups and villages in the local area.  The combined population of the area is 1,700.  Despite the minimal support received from State agencies, some 133 people are employed in the ecopark.  The main activity is an excellent food processing business, but there are also services such as a local credit union.  Bodies like Teagasc also occupy some of the units in the centre.  What was surprising was that while an ecopark such as this or any kind of semi-industrial facility needs technology to help it go further, there was no mobile coverage available while I was in that area.  Not having even that level of infrastructure was an impediment.  I was grateful because it allowed me, for the two hours for which I was present, to devote my full attention to what people were saying and to take lessons on board.  It struck me that this was precisely the type of community that would benefit from realising the full potential in this area and of full broadband roll-out.  The park has the necessary sense of initiative and is conscious of the need to marry technology with the effort and commitment that will result in progress for the local communities.  If we can identify such communities and provide the technological links and resources to bring the components together, I will have a lot of confidence in the future of our communities.</P><Col N="775"/>
        <P>When I worked very briefly for the National Rehabilitation Board, which was subsumed by F&Aacute;S, one of the jobs I was given was to consider information technology for people with disabilities, particularly those with hearing and visual disabilities.  This was in the early 1990s.  I must admit I failed miserably on the report, partly because technology was so badly developed at the time and partly because of my own ignorance of the field.  It says something about the speed of progression of technology that we now take for granted what was non-existent then.  Not only do we need to put in place the desired infrastructure, we need to put in place a plan to get us to where we need to go regarding the technological advances that are likely to happen over the next five, ten or 15 years.  This is the real challenge for our economy.</P>
        <P>We have depended on actions that seemed easy, such as the over-lending of money and building of property.  What we need to do is plan an economy that considers the technological possibilities of 2020 and 2030.  This is the real importance of this debate.  It is not so much a question of determining what we are lacking and what is not being done but of determining collectively where we need to go.  The wider community does not sense this is occurring.  People realise how far we have come technologically but it will require an exponential leap forward to go where we ought to go technologically.  This will require a lot of resources and a particular type of commitment.  Ultimately, I wonder whether there is political interest in achieving this.  Both Houses operate in a parliamentary system in which, it is sad to say, there are many Members who pride themselves on their ignorance of technology and its use as a tool for politics, information and communication.  Until there is sufficient intelligence and usage in this regard, it will be harder than it ought to be to make progress on national policy in this area.</P>
        <P>I support tonight&rsquo;s motion because it is a call for stating there is intent to make badly needed improvements and a commitment to take us to where we need to get to.  If we can identify our destination, the future of our country will be better as a result.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This motion is self-congratulatory.  Senator Quinn said it is a bit complacent and Senator Ross said it is bland, but I believe it constitutes an arrogant proverbial pat on the back for the Government.  It &ldquo;welcomes the various Government interventions in broadband which have led to improved choice, quality and prices of services and the national broadband scheme which will make broadband available in those parts of the country not currently served&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is in touch with his brief and I believe he and Senator Boyle were honest, if not somewhat aspirational, in their comments on broadband.  In spite of this, the reality is that the Government&rsquo;s record on broadband rates has been appalling.  Since 2002, Ireland has been at the lower end of the scale in terms of penetration and speed.  To suggest otherwise is ludicrous.</P>

	<P>As a country, we are far behind in this area and, despite plan after plan and promise after promise, we are doing no better now than when the Government first took office 15 years ago.  To suggest we should in any way congratulate the Government on its constant rehashing of the same plans is ludicrous and disgraceful.</P>
        <P>There is a perception that broadband rates in Ireland are awful, and the reality is the same.  When selling our economy as a location for foreign direct investment, broadband infrastructure is of great importance.  While the Government constantly talks about it, we see no action.  There is a serious digital divide in this country between rural and urban areas, and this is discriminatory and unacceptable.  In the current climate, we cannot afford to be at a disadvantage.  Rural areas need to compete for business just as much as urban areas, as has been said by all my colleagues.  The lack of broadband is an appalling drag on a rural community.  The Minister of State might think I am exaggerating but he should note there are areas of County Westmeath <Col N="776"/>with no access to broadband, as implied by Senator Quinn.  The reality is that 15 miles from the greatest urban hub, Dublin, there is no broadband access.</P>
        <P>Last year, the European Commission published its Progress Report on the Single European Electronic Communications Market 2007, in which report Ireland got a bad score.  We are well below the EU average in terms of broadband infrastructure and broadband take-up.  Ireland stands at 17% in terms of broadband take-up.  In urban areas, there is 90% DSL coverage.  In rural areas only 70% can choose to avail of broadband.  Countries such as the United Kingdom, Denmark etc. are far higher up the list and we are grouped with newer member states despite being members of the more advanced EU 15.  This is a very sad reflection on the Government, which has talked for so long about improvement in this area.  I am really sorry to say we have failed consistently to take action.</P>

Fine Gael spoke about delays and put forward very good suggestions.  My colleague, Deputy Coveney, did so time and again but they were not accepted.  We called for all new buildings to be required to install open access fibre broadband connections.  The Minister spoke about this today and I welcome the fact that he has taken this suggestion on board.  Fine Gael suggested the Department should undertake an audit of all publicly and privately owned telecommunications infrastructure so gaps can be prioritised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Broadband is as important to business in a rural area as road transport or energy access.  I am trying to be emphatic because I meet many people who are despairing of the service in rural areas.  According to the 2006 census, householders in Longford-Westmeath are less likely to own a PC and have Internet access than other householders in the State.  Only 13% of households in Longford-Westmeath have broadband access compared with 20% in Dublin.  That is neither fair nor acceptable.  The playing field for attracting investment is not level.  It does a disservice to those who study in Athlone Institute of Technology or for the Open University.  Immediately, they are at a disadvantage.  Businesses are less likely to locate within the midlands.  We are part of the midland gateway and our prime focus is to bring new jobs into the Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore gateway.  It is an absolutely essential ingredient to add to the infrastructure of our area.  With the certainty that the next few years will be tough for Ireland it is more important than ever that there is investment in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullen referred to Irish Rural Link, which is based in Moate, County Westmeath.  I compliment it on its consistent lobbying for sustainable rural development.  It stated it has real concerns that the Government broadband scheme will not deliver 100% coverage and has serious technical limitations.  I agree with the group that it is totally unacceptable that the scheme is based almost entirely on mobile broadband technology.  Irish Rural Link claims this is unreliable and has serious capacity problems.  Irish Rural Link also stated that mobile technology may be a cost effective solution but it is not really broadband.  Therefore, I do not believe it is the solution to Ireland&rsquo;s broadband problems.</P>
        <P>As Senator Mullen stated, Irish Rural Link, in February, published a report entitled The Good, The Bad &amp; The Inadequate, the essence of which is that the quality of connection for rural areas is completely unacceptable.  The group&rsquo;s document shows that 12,000 homes and businesses are in areas which are not covered by the new Government scheme.  There needs to <Col N="777"/>be a contingency plan to allow for delays relating to planning permission for the 160 telecommunication masts needed to deliver the scheme.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?</P>
        <P>In our proposal we ask that the Minister updates the committee every six months on how broadband is progressing.  This part of the motion at least could be accepted.</P>

	<P>I have mixed feelings about this motion although I will vote against it.  There has been an improvement in the attitude of this House and the other House towards broadband and it would be churlish not to recognise it.  Approximately two years ago I tabled a Bill on broadband in the previous Seanad.  There was no interest in it and there was no realisation of the problem whatsoever.  It was absolutely staggering.  I do not know whether it collapsed but the number of Senators who wished to speak on it was extraordinarily and embarrassingly small and there was no recognition of the fact that broadband was an important piece of infrastructure which had to be developed very quickly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Approximately six or eight months ago, I introduced another Bill on the issue and there was a vast improvement not only in the interest in it but in the Minister&rsquo;s attitude and in the knowledge in this House.  One of the problems with the development of broadband in this country has been the negligible knowledge of and interest in this area from Members of the Oireachtas and members of the Cabinet.  It may have been a generational problem or a lack of interest.  This has developed and the fact that the Government has tabled a motion, albeit giving itself a pat on the back for things it probably has not done, shows that at least there is some acknowledgement that this is a real problem which must be tackled and is recognised in the Government parties.  This is progress which I welcome, acknowledge, applaud and celebrate.</P>
        <P>However, this is not enough.  The Minister is not here but I wish to acknowledge his commitment and interest in this subject.  In recent months, for reasons which I do not understand, he rejected a Bill on broadband in this House.  To table a motion of this sort stating how wonderfully the Government has done, when it rejected a Bill on broadband in this House, seems to be somewhat inconsistent.  That particular Bill was left open for the Government to amend it.  However, it did not want to do so and the reason is simple.  The Government did not wish under any circumstances to commit itself to targets which were modest for the outlay of broadband.</P>
        <P>I suspect the Government does not have the confidence itself to produce the figures, numbers and targets which are necessary.  I do not know why this is.  Perhaps it is due to a shortage of money.  In what has been stated today, in the motion and in the Government&rsquo;s programme there is a lack of conviction that these targets will be met.  The Bill set out simple targets and it was for the Minister to be accountable for this, which is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the country.</P>
        <P>In years to come, particularly in years of recession, it will be more important that we have broadband than roads in terms of development.  It is more important in attracting overseas and internal investment.  Let no one say to me that the lack of broadband or the way we have fallen behind in broadband does not affect overseas investment.  I cannot prove that it does but no one can prove to me that it does not.  However, it is an undeniable fact that if we continue to be behind in this area, and I acknowledge the improvements that have been made, overseas investment which is so vital and becoming scarcer will be scared by the fact that we do not have this particular piece of infrastructure which is so necessary.</P>
        <P>During this debate, somebody on this side of the House mentioned how important it was not only for overseas investment and multinationals, who are coming here in smaller numbers, <Col N="778"/>but also for very small businesses and people working at home to have broadband.  This is difficult for a Government to measure but it is absolutely vital for small businesses also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points made by Senator Ross.  I was also impressed by what the Minister stated in his speech.  However, in all fairness it takes a brass neck to table this motion.  I do not take from the commitment and honesty of my colleagues on the other side of the House.  However, it is shameful where we are in the broadband league.  Look at where we stand in the OECD league, the European league and the global league.  We are down with Zambia and other such countries in terms of our connectivity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier, I heard Senator Quinn speak about his difficulty.  I live 15 miles from here and I cannot get broadband at home.  I get broadband by satellite very expensively and very slowly and this is the way it will remain.  Eircom will never provide me with broadband through copper wire because it will not invest in upgrading it.  As I stated 15 years ago, when it was being sold, Eircom would never bring broadband to Belmullet.  At that stage I did not think it would not bring it to north Dublin either.  However, this is the reality.  As Senator Ross quite rightly stated, this is impacting at all levels.  He outlined the possible, probably and potential poor effects on the development of industry.  The most significant thing, mentioned in Senator Doherty&rsquo;s report on the west of Ireland, is that we cannot develop the region without broadband access.  Not only can we not develop it, we are losing the intellectual, creative and other abilities which could be distributed through broadband in many parts of the west.  That is completely wrong.</P>
        <P>I do not know the answers to this.  I met the people from Irish Rural Link today, and they make the point that even with the best efforts of Eircom and the Government, there will still be thousands of houses which will not have access.  Broadband access should be made universally available and should be supported by the State, because it is an investment in the State.  It is as important as education.  Senator Ross said it is as important as roads, and I want to say it is as important as education.  Research depends on it, as does any kind of development.  Human contact depends on it.  For somebody from the west who wishes to keep in contact with a son or daughter in Sydney, voice-over Internet access is the only cheap way to do it.  There are many losses and difficulties, and we are going backwards on this issue.</P>
        <P>I listened to what the Minister said, but I do not agree with his enthusiasm because I do not see it happening.  In my area, which is 15 miles from here, I cannot see how we will ever have regular, full-speed broadband available to us under the current circumstances.  If we cannot do it in north Dublin where there is a huge population, then we can be sure that nobody will care about the places in the west with a smaller and more widely distributed population.  A decision must be taken for the country.  Broadband is as important as roads, education, industry and employment.  That is why we need to make it available at this stage.</P>
        <P>My suggestion is to make it available at satellite level.  It is too expensive for people to pay the full rate for fast broadband speeds, but at least they can get fast download broadband speeds that should be supported by the State in those areas where it is not otherwise available, even though upload speeds are not available there either.  There is no solution to this and I do not think speakers on the other side of the House have recognised that.  The plan put forward by the Government, Eircom and others means these areas will never get broadband.</P>
        <P>The Minister made reference to telephones.  I was one of those people in 1971 who had to wait up to two years for a telephone to be installed, but this is different because broadband will never be available under the current plan.  People are being ruled out of it, and that is why I cannot support the Government position.  I will be fully supportive of the Fine Gael amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important motion and amendment on broadband.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House.  The last two speakers have put their finger on the pulse, when they outlined the problems with rural areas, small industries and with working from home.  The Minister has a great grasp of what is happening and what needs to be done, but it seems he is not in a position to carry it forward.</P>
        <P>The statistics before us show that 40% of the population live in rural areas.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is 15 miles from the centre of the capital city and I am astonished to think that he cannot get access to broadband.  I thought I was bad enough being three and a half miles from the centre of the largest town in the third largest county in the country, which is Castlebar.  I can only get mobile broadband access, but as other speakers have pointed out, this breaks down and is slow.  If I was running a small business from home, it would not be adequate.  Senator Ross is quite right.  If we are to progress as a nation that will be flexible with our workforce, then we must provide broadband access to everybody.  While the Minister means well and has a great grasp of things, he must make a commitment to roll out broadband to everybody across the country.  It is our future and is as important as education, roads and industry.  Everybody recognises that, including the Minister, but he is doing little about it.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross stated there have been certain improvements in responses in the last couple of years, but the service has still not been rolled out and it is not there.  Where do we go from here?  I was astonished to hear that copper wires with broadband provision were not rolled out 15 miles from the centre of the capital.  It will not be easy to develop the west, but broadband is essential.  We have no proper road infrastructure from the east to the west, especially in County Mayo.  There will be a dual carriageway to Galway sometime in the next 12 or 18 months, but we do not have a fast train to any part of the country.</P>
        <P>People working from the home in small businesses in rural areas rightly need broadband, and 100% coverage across the country is essential.  I agree with the amendment tabled by my colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, and I agree with the last few speakers on this important issue.  Broadband will be the lifeblood of the country in the years to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not be having this debate at all.  We have had a number of debates on broadband, some of which have been sparked by worthwhile motions proposed by Senator Ross which should have been supported by the House.  We are talking about a technology that is at least a decade old, and a national broadband strategy that even the Minister recognises will not address the needs of customers in modern Ireland.  We are so far behind it is hard to believe.  It is very frustrating to be talking about a national broadband scheme and whether it will be delivered on time and cost friendly, when we know the service is very limited and does not meet the needs of the population, especially the needs of the business and tourism sectors.  I gave the example today provided by Irish Rural Link about tourism projects that cannot reach their potential due to the unavailability of broadband.</P>
        <P>We have been forced into having this debate because vast swathes of the country still have no access to broadband.  There have been claims that broadband is as important as education, roads and so on.  I have already said broadband today is like running water or electricity.  People and businesses need it, and it needs to be provided.</P>
        <P>I genuinely feel the current Minister is committed to broadband and I listened with interest when he announced the national broadband scheme.  He was speaking on either RTE or Newstalk, and he was being pushed into answering whether it would definitely be delivered by the end of 2009.  He hung his colours to the mast and stated it definitely would be in place by then.  The interviewer pushed him to say what he would do if it was not delivered and he repeated that it would definitely be delivered.  Thank God he did not say he would do something drastic if that did not materialise because since then the date has slipped twice.</P><Col N="780"/>
        <P>There is a very sizable digital divide.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the report I carried out for the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs called Awakening the West: Overcoming Social and Economic Inequality.  The report shows the digital divide between east and west.  Although three out of ten customers have access to broadband, the level is still far below where we need to be in terms of Dublin.  According to the recent Forf&aacute;s report, in the Border region of the west the rate of broadband connectivity is only 12%.  In significant swathes of the west there is no broadband connectivity and most of the west has a level of connectivity between 10% and 17%.  In fact, 17% is the average in the west.  This has resulted in significant limitations.  Where there are difficulties in terms of access to the west because of lack of infrastructure, broadband has the potential not of eradicating those difficulties, because those issues need to be addressed, but of easing them.  It is possible for a business to communicate with another business or do the work over the Internet which does not require physical infrastructure.  This should be provided and it should be done quickly.</P>
        <P>I refer to some specifics.  Everyone knows the MANs, metropolitan area networks, scheme proved to be a waste of money to a certain degree.  Under phase 1 some &euro;18 million was spent in five towns which have no customers whatsoever.  One such town is in my parish of Gaoth Dobhair.  Let us consider County Donegal.  Some &euro;10 million was spent on the metropolitan area networks in Carndonagh, Ballybofey, Buncrana, Ballyshannon, Bundoran and Gaoth Dobhair.  The majority of those towns have no customers because the cost of connecting to the network is excessive.  However, the Eirnet group facilitated a co-operation between Donegal County Council and Derry City Council to fund broadband connectivity.  This was overseen by the European Union and involved North West Electronics Wireless Networks.  Since then, there has been a significant increase in the number of people who can access broadband.  However, North West Electronics maintains that with an additional &euro;0.5 million it could connect everyone in the county to the network, including businesses and people in their own homes.  It further maintains it could do so at a faster speed and with a better service than that provided by the national broadband strategy.  I am not privy to the figures in terms of the contract that has been signed by 3 Ireland.  However, we should consider value for money.  A large part of County Donegal comes under the national broadband strategy.  We should consider whether it represents value for money to award the contract to that firm, or whether better value for money and greater speeds are available elsewhere.</P>
        <P>One reason this is the wrong debate is that broadband is not only about availability.  The cost and affordability of broadband is also in question.  My research has highlighted the problems faced by business.</P>
        <P>Let us consider broadband speeds in Ireland at present.  The average speed is approximately 2 megabytes.  Some 19% of products in Ireland have a speed of 2 megabytes compared to 47% of products in Britain and 55% of products in France with greater speeds.  The fastest speed here is approximately 6 megabytes, but the cost of that service is four or five times the cost in other countries in Europe such as France, Germany and Hungary.  For example, an Irish business pays more than &euro;2,000 per year for a 6 megabyte ADSL, asymmetric digital subscriber line, service, while its counterpart in Germany pays &euro;534 for a 16 megabyte service.  In France, the annual cost for an 18 megabyte service is &euro;530.  Let us remember that in 2000 in Ireland the corresponding cost was for a 6 megabyte service.  In Sweden for a 24 megabyte service the cost is slightly less than &euro;1,200 per year.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is aware of these figures, because report after report has shown that we have low speeds, high costs and low availability.  The problem is that we are discussing something which should have been done ten years ago.  We should have been investing at the height of the Celtic tiger.  The Six Counties has 100% coverage many times over and there are proposals as part of its programme for Government for speeds of up to 100 megabytes for <Col N="781"/>businesses, which is greatly in excess of what this State is considering.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider several points.  The national broadband strategy has identified areas which are not connected.  Leitrim County Council carried out a survey and found areas that the Department claimed were connected which were not in fact connected.  This should be revisited and a proper audit should be carried out.</P>
        <P>We must examine the possibility of reducing costs for people.  We must also move with the times and catch up very quickly.  There is no point in discussing next generation networks in ten or 20 years time.  We should have next generation pilot projects where possible.  For example in my home county of Donegal it would be possible to have pilot next generation network schemes and to introduce speeds of up to 100 megabytes per second in towns.  That would give us a cutting edge not only in Ireland or Europe, but throughout the world.  We could attract serious investment if there were a serious carrot to entice multinational companies or other industries into an area with such a network available.  There is no point in attempting to do so with old technology and when other countries are moving in a certain direction in terms of next generation networks.  We must begin to invest State money and pilot schemes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A significant problem and one of the reasons we are discussing this matter now is the privatisation of Eircom.  It should be acknowledged by the Government that this was a wrong strategy.  The main Opposition party argues for selling off more State agencies.  However, that is a wrong strategy and Eircom is an example of why that view is completely and utterly flawed.  Ministers and taoisigh are down on bended knee begging Eircom to provide services which it will not and cannot afford.  We must consider the re-nationalisation of Eircom in order that broadband, an essential service for every community and business, is and can be provided by direct State intervention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the very fine contributions made and I especially thank the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I am aware the Minister, Deputy Ryan, means well.  I refer to a matter raised by Senator Norris, that is, the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  I worked in Telecom &Eacute;ireann and I was a trade union official and president of a union in that company.  I never believed it was a good idea to privatise Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  Telecom &Eacute;ireann gave a terrific service to its customers at that time.  Its staff were excellent and superb and well qualified, such that 1,100 went to work on contract in England.  The opposite is the case now.  There have been four or five owners of Telecom &Eacute;ireann since I left.  Each one came in, stripped the assets and ran down the infrastructure.  The public received a worse service and that was the result of privatisation for the people of the country in respect of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>When I was involved in the union we held marches and called for the fat cats to keep their hands off Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  I apportion some blame to the unions because they became partners with the company and the company put forward carrots and sticks which they accepted.  I refer to the ESOP, employee share ownership plan, and so on.  That is why we are in the situation in which we find ourselves.  When I was in Telecom &Eacute;ireann some 20 years ago we discussed broadband and we said exactly what has been said today.  Why do we not have it?  The reason is that the fat cats came in their droves.  There were more chiefs than Indians, but they all looked after themselves in a similar fashion to what took place in the banks not long ago.  I wish to put this on record because it is important for me that I do so.  I hold sincere convictions on the matter.</P>
        <P>It has been stated that it is very important to have telecommunications infrastructure in place to attract investors, whether foreign investment, investment in Ireland or wherever.  If one does not have a good telecommunications system, this will not occur.  When the economy turns around, and I have no doubt it will do so, we must be ready to get out of the traps and to grab the opportunities.  If we do not have a good broadband system and a good telecommunications system, that will not occur.</P><Col N="782"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Privatisation is not always the right thing to do.  Telecom &Eacute;ireann was sold for the price of a couple of warehouses, or for peanuts.  It is not always a good idea when business becomes too cumbersome in a company such as Telecom &Eacute;ireann to get rid of it, or to say that because it is too much hassle someone else should look after it.  It was a bad mistake, although I realise it was the Government in which I am involved which was responsible.  We cannot look backwards because we all make mistakes.  We must move forward and deal with what we have.  I have every confidence in the Minister, a sincere person whose heart is in the right place.  All is not lost and I am hopeful the problem will be resolved when the economy turns around.</P>
        <P>Ireland will be in a position to encourage foreign investors to locate here if we are able to offer them the best telecommunications system in the world, as was the case when Telecom &Eacute;ireann was the provider.  At that time, our telecommunications system was more advanced than those of France, Britain and many other countries.  This is no longer the case because the fat cats were only interested in themselves, greed took over, the service to customers deteriorated and infrastructure was not sufficiently upgraded.  While there are large quantities of copper in the ground, it is completely useless.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  I thank the Minister of State for attending.  This matter concerns the Institute of Clinical Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy, the ICHP.  It requires to be registered as a designated professional body within the meaning of section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  Under that Act it would require protection for the titles of hypnotherapy, hypno-psychotherapy, hypno-analyst and hypno-counsellor.</P>
        <P>This matter raises the important subject of regulation.  Great strides have been made in recent years with the introduction of the Act in 2005 to ensure professional registration of a number of social care and psychology bodies.  In the areas of counselling, psychotherapy and hypnotherapy it is important to undertake whatever measure is necessary in this respect, primarily to afford protection for the public.  It is important that it would not be possible for any person at will to hang up a sign and claim to be a psychotherapist.  It is a title that merits protection.  It is in the public interest that such protection is afforded.  One of the benefits of the Act is that in addition to introducing regulation for the professional bodies, it also shines a spotlight on the need for continuous professional development and a commitment to keeping abreast with all the changes and developments in each of the areas that are protected.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is aware of the work the ICHP has undertaken in recent years to bring about a system of self-regulation.  It has gone as far as it can by itself.  It tries to collaborate with other professionals.  It encourages its members to abide by the criteria for regulation within the organisation but it would like to take it one step further and formalise it by way of legislation.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could indicate whether there is to be a positive response to this.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will be taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professions.  This new system of statutory registration will apply to those in the 12 specified professions regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed.  This is the first time that fitness to practice procedures will be put in place for those professionals on a statutory basis.  The structure of the system of registration includes a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, which has overall responsibility for the regulatory system, and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.</P>
        <P>As a first step in the implementation of the system of statutory registration, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council was established by the Minister for Health and Children in March 2007.  The council recruited a chief executive officer in May of last year and is currently working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated in the Act.  The council has decided that social workers and physiotherapists are the two professions from among the designated 12 <Col N="784"/>which are most suitable for early registration.  It has accordingly prioritised the establishment of the social worker registration board and the physiotherapist registration board during 2009.</P>
        <P>While the proposed system of statutory registration applies in the first instance to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include, by regulation and on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system as appropriate.  Section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act provides for the inclusion of additional professions in the system of statutory registration and constitutes a framework for guiding future decisions in this regard.  The factors used to consider the inclusion of professions in the system of statutory registration include the extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession&rsquo;s practitioners, the existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed qualifications and the commitment to continuing professional development.  The future consideration of hypnotherapy and psychotherapy for registration as designated professions under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 will be examined in this context.</P>
        <P>The immediate priority of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council is to put in place the regulatory structures for the 12 designated professions.  It is not envisaged that additional structures will be considered for inclusion within the scope of the system until registration boards for these professions are established.  Until the council has put in place the structures required to establish the 12 initial registration boards, the Minister for Health and Children strongly encourages all relevant professional bodies within hypnotherapy and psychotherapy to continue to collaborate in order to strengthen self-regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and welcome the positive comments he has made regarding the consideration of the ICHP in the context of those criteria.  I appreciate there is much work involved in trying to establish bodies for the initial 12 professions, but we must consider the public interest and the issue of public safety.  The criteria outlined by the Minister are laudable, but I have one further suggestion which the Minister of State might pass on to his colleague.  Where any professional body is considered in the context of these criteria and is found either not to meet the criteria or not to be in compliance with them and therefore to be ineligible for registration, the Department should make this known to the public.  Members of the public would thereby be encouraged not to access the services of such an organisation.  There is a real issue of public safety with regard to some of the therapies and interventions offered by people who are not registered and are not in continuous professional development.</P>

	<P>I hope the Minister has good news for me because I do not recall much good news on previous Adjournments.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to inform the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, when the proposed building project for Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen, County Galway, will receive sanction from the Department.  The board of management applied for a school extension ten years ago, but no action was taken.  In subsequent years the original application was followed up, but no progress was made.  In March 2007, 1,600 local people signed a petition highlighting the urgent need for a school extension, and in July 2007 the parents&rsquo; association <Col N="785"/>met the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to seek his help.  In September 2007 the Minister visited the school as promised.  On 1 May 2008 the Minister arranged a meeting with the parents&rsquo; association and the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, so the school could highlight the urgent need for development.  On that occasion the former Minister was presented with the petition containing 1,600 names and also 220 letters signed by the parents of children attending Scoil Mhuire, which are now on file.</P>
        <P>During the past year other local TDs have asked questions regarding the lack of progress in the Department&rsquo;s building unit.  The response has been the standard one, and I do not want to hear this response again this evening:</P>
        <P LI="1">An Application for capital funding towards the provision of a new school building has been received from the school authority.  The long term projected staffing assessment and the further progression of the proposed building project will be considered on an ongoing basis in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi annual school building and modernisation project.</P>
        <P>Currently, Scoil Mhuire has five prefabs, no library, no computer room, cramped facilities and a playground space which is being gradually eroded by the addition of new prefabs.  On a recent visit to the school, I saw a learning support teacher working in a converted broom closet.  The electrical system is in need of a complete overhaul and cannot cope with the load in winter; the heating system is similarly deficient.  The school has doubled in size over the past few years and continues to grow.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science we had a first-of-its-kind presentation on school planning and the school building programme from Frank Wyse of the Department of Education and Science.  He told me that Moycullen was a growing area and that there are more children in the zero to four age category than in the junior classes.  This indicates that a major increase in pupil numbers is still to come.  His conclusion was that various factors indicated that the issue of Moycullen should be addressed.  His recommendation, based on CSO data, was that it was important to upgrade and extend.  With that in mind, I ask the Minister to give some definite information on when the project will begin and to provide a timeframe.  I also ask, if there are any hitches along the way, that these be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position of Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen, County Galway.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the school planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  A <Col N="786"/>proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P>There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision for desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>For Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen, County Galway, the original brief for this extension project was to provide sufficient accommodation for a long-term projected staffing of a principal, 12 mainstream class teachers and ancillary staff, and the project was assigned a band two rating.  The Department has been contacted by the school authority regarding its projected long-term needs and is awaiting submission of a detailed proposal from the school and its patron in this regard.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  The project for Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen, County Galway will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  However, given the competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this stage to be precise about when this project will go to construction.</P>
        <P>The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is &euro;656 million which represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.  The Senator will understand that it is not possible to progress all projects at the same time.  However, the Minister is committed to continuing to invest in school accommodation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding the school building project for Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This relates to Athphort national school, oile&aacute;n &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r, D&uacute;n na nGall, i gcro&iacute;-l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta.  The school board of management was notified earlier this year that the two teacher school was to lose one teacher.  The school was shocked at this news and I am raising the issue on behalf of the school and the greater island community.</P>
        <P>The school currently has an enrolment of 11 pupils in eight different classes.  It is unacceptable that the school would be reduced to a single teacher.  It is an island school and the understanding is that the minimum number of pupils required for two teachers is eight.  In this instance, because there is a second primary school on the island, it does not count, a policy the Department should re-examine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Athphort national school is an island school located in the heart of the Donegal Gaeltacht.  As such, key issues such as health and safety make the reduction to a single teacher inap<Col N="787"/>propriate.  This is a gaelscoil and the work that has been done by the staff and parents at the school is to be commended.  It would be a retrograde step to cut numbers so that one teacher is dealing with eight classes when it is already difficult to provide the necessary educational opportunities through the medium of Irish.  Families have moved home to &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r and the children of those families have learned Irish at this school.</P>
        <P>A family on the island hopes to send their child in the coming years to the school and that pupil will have special educational needs.  Such factors should be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>It is a three classroom school with toilets, kitchen and ancillary facilities.  The school management authority has made a huge effort to develop the school, which was originally built in 1915.  Teaching is through the medium of Irish and all pupils are eligible for sc&eacute;im labhairt na Gaeilge payments from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Any downgrading of the teaching complement of the school would have a negative impact on the development of the Irish language not only in the school but in the Athphort area and the island as a whole.</P>
        <P>The Minister cannot make a decision tonight but the school authorities have lodged an appeal with the independent appeals board.  Given this is a unique situation involving an island school where the Department proposes to reduce teacher numbers from two to one, with all the implications that will have for the pupils, the Department will hopefully review its policy position on islands with more than one school.  There are two schools on the island because of the size of the population, which should be taken into account.</P>
        <P>I am not looking for a decision tonight but I do want the support of the Minister and I am glad to see Senator Boyle is also interested in this issue and I welcome his support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for sharing time.  People may wonder why a Cork-based Senator would be interested in this item but my father comes from the Athphort area of &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r and he attended this school until he finished his education at 13 years of age.  On those grounds and because of the numerous telephone calls I have received from my extended family on the island, I support Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s call on the Minister and the Department to maintain this as a two teacher school, as all such schools should be.  We should recognise &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r as one of our more populous islands.  It is a place to which emigrants have increasingly returned in recent decades, so to cut a teacher would give all the wrong indications for the future development of the island.</P>
        <P>While I may be factually incorrect about this, I think that when the school opened in 1915, one of the teachers on the island was the great writer and social commentator Peadar O&rsquo;Donnell.  We should keep sight of the social and historical consequences of the decisions we make concerning such schools.  Despite the appeals process, there is a good case for the Department to take a more appropriate decision on defending a two teacher school at Athphort on &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senators for raising it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The mainstream staffing of a primary school, including Athphort national school, is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  This is a transparent and clear way of ensuring all schools are treated consistently and fairly, and know where they stand.  The schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils.</P>
        <P>The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were <Col N="788"/>included in the budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.  There is no doubt the budget measures concerning staffing will have an impact.  There is simply no easy way to control or reduce public expenditure.</P>
        <P>When the country was able to afford it, the Government reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher of 35 pupils, down to the current level of 27 pupils.  The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in that context.  Significant additional support went into schools, particularly in the area of special education.</P>
        <P>The Government also reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools to an average of one teacher for every 20 pupils in junior classes and an average of one teacher for every 24 pupils in senior classes.  These will not be changing in 2009.  When one adds up all the teachers in the system, there is one teacher for every 16 pupils in our primary schools.</P>
        <P>Under a system that allocates additional teachers at different step points under a common schedule, it is a fact of life that changes in enrolment can effect the mainstream staffing of a school.  In any year, and not just this year, when enrolments are falling in a school this can result in the loss of a teacher.  Equally when enrolments increase, a school can gain a teacher under the operation of the staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>The key factor for determining the level of mainstream teacher resources provided by the Department to primary schools for the 2009-10 school year is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  There were 11 pupils in the school referred to by the Senators on 30 September 2008, which under the appointment and retention procedures entitles the school to one principal teacher.  The school had 16 pupils on 30 September 2007.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule for the 2009-10 school year, primary circular 0002/2009, has been published on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.  As I have outlined, the schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly, and know where they stand.  If the Minister for Education and Science were to change the staffing schedule to allow the schools that are due to lose a teacher to retain that teaching post, he would be treating them differently from other schools with the exact same number on the rolls, and he does not propose to do so.  The system should not create anomalies or operate on the basis that one or more schools should be treated differently to others.</P>
        <P>The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedule.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, circular 0002/2009, available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Senators that an appeal has been submitted to the appeal board.  I will endeavour to get the result of that communicated to the Senators in due course.  I note their comments on the special position of islands generally.  I will ensure the Minister is made aware of the comments that have been made this evening.  I thank the Senators for raising this matter.</P>
