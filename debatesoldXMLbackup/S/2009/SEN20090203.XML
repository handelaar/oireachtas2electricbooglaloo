	<P>I have notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to explore with his Northern counterpart, the GAA and the federation for sport in the North the potential for an all-Ireland sports for peace project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to clarify the decision to cancel the sports capital programme for 2009, and whether he will put in place a mechanism to support and assist local sporting and community voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport to honour his commitment under Transport 21 to proceed with the upgrading of the proposed N4, Mullingar to Longford-Roosky scheme, to benefit the people of the midlands.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Keaveney and Buttimer as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator McFadden as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Gas (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Second Stage; and No. 2, statements on the report on EU scrutiny (No. 21) entitled Provision of Food Information to Consumers.  It is proposed that No. 1 shall be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business; spokespersons may speak for ten minutes, all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by leave of the House.  No. 2 shall be taken on the conclusion of No. 1 and will conclude not later than 6.30 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes, all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I will oppose the Order of Business if the Leader cannot arrange for the Government to send a representative, preferably the Minister for Finance, to the House <Col N="546"/>to outline to us the Government&rsquo;s plans.  I understand the D&aacute;il is being briefed at 4 p.m. today and I would ask that the Seanad is also briefed today on the Government&rsquo;s plans, given the breakdown and failure of the social partnership talks last night.  Agreement could not be reached and, as we know, the Taoiseach had put his faith and confidence in that strategy of working with the social partners which ended in failure last night.</P>
        <P>It is a failure that has a significant consequence.  We are all concerned about Ireland&rsquo;s standing internationally and the costs of borrowing internationally.  Every day that we do not give out a message of confidence from this country, and a message that we are dealing with the &euro;2 billion cuts that are required, is costing us &euro;55 million, or &euro;385 million a week.  There is the possibility that the cost of borrowing will increase for this country if we do not give out a message that we are facing the issues head-on and making sound decisions.  I ask the Leader that we are briefed today on the Government position on these issues.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has been making suggestions for a number of months.  Again today, the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, suggested that the Taoiseach would stop bypassing the D&aacute;il and Seanad and come in to discuss how the &euro;2 billion in cuts might be achieved.  We have suggested that both these Houses should be used today to debate how these savings can be made.  In particular, Fine Gael would say we need tough decisions but they need to be fair and equitable.  We have stated we are prepared to work with the Government to arrive at these solutions.  We have already called in recent months for the Government to take tough decisions.  We have suggested various routes, all of which were ignored.  I feel strongly that the people out there, particularly those in small businesses and those who are unemployed, need to see an action plan from the Government.</P>
        <P>We have been saying this for a long time; this has been going on since last July.  In September a pay agreement was introduced, in October the budget was introduced and now discussions with the social partners are taking place.  There has been a very inconsistent and indecisive approach from the Government in recent of months and it is time for this to end.  The people seek a plan and reassurance; they are very concerned.  Will the Leader facilitate a discussion with a Minister today to discuss the &euro;2 billion in cuts required?  Fine Gael especially wishes to discuss how we can protect the most vulnerable and the people at the front line so that vital services are maintained.  However, we recognise this is a crisis for the country and that everyone must play their part.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that the talks involving the social partners did not reach a satisfactory conclusion last night.  It is also important, as Senator Fitzgerald remarked, that we discuss this matter.  I have put the suggestion to the Leader, who has some difficulty with it.  We must recognise that there are 2 million in the workforce, 300,000 are unemployed and 300,000 working in the public sector.  That leaves 1.3 million people working in the private sector.  Most of those are not on high salaries, although probably half are.  It does not matter whether they are up or down, there are certain things we must recognise.</P>
        <P>The majority of the public sector earn less than &euro;60,000 per year.  The union leadership found itself in a situation last night where it was asked to propose to union members that money be taken from people earning &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 and upwards per year to pay the banks, which continue to be run by the same people who caused the problems in the first place and who earn multi-million dollar annual packages.  This will lead to social and industrial unrest.  No leadership could propose that with a straight face to any group of people.  I ask my colleagues on the Government side of the House to consider what we witnessed with the medical card proposal and other proposals.  That was simply a matinee performance compared with what will occur.  We have already witnessed social and industrial unrest in Greece, Iceland and <Col N="547"/>in France last week and it is increasing.  People are ready to make a commitment and are ready to take the pain, but it must be equitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not only public servants who say as much.  One can put the question to anyone in the street, asking their views on the way with which the banks have been dealt.  We are taking our money and investing it in banks which are the cause of this problem and which are still being run by the same people.  It simply is unacceptable.  No matter what people try to convince themselves of, there is no way this will ever fly.  I appeal to my colleagues on the Government side of the House to consider that point.  That is the reality and it will not change.  We must be very serious about this matter.</P>
        <P>I seek an answer to one question.  Let us consider a sum of money, whether it is &euro;60,000, &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 per year.  It does not matter where one begins, no one could argue that everyone earning above a given amount should be charged more, nor could anyone argue with public servants being asked to pay additionally for their pension.  However, if one does not deal with these issues and only focuses on 300,000 people from a workforce of 2 million people, half of whom earn less than &euro;60,000 per year, to try to pretend to solve a problem, which it will not, while the people who caused this problem are swanning around looking down at us and not paying the price, it just will not work and it will cause industrial and social chaos.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader explain how the House can take itself seriously, or how it can have any self respect if there is no debate following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks at 4 p.m?  I appeal to the Leader to answer that question.  How can the Parliament maintain any self respect if the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement is not debated?  Apparently the Leader will suggest that it is not entirely clear whether that statement will contain any substance.  This is even more worrying.  If the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement contains nothing of substance, then he must get into his car and travel to the Phoenix Park.  That is the only place for him if he has nothing to say to the people this afternoon.  There has been months and months of inaction, despite the worsening news regarding the public finances, job losses, failure to put forward proposals and so on.</P>
        <P>It amazes me that after so many months of inaction, the Government could think it then could turn around at dead of night in the middle of a blizzard and table proposals at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. and expect to resolve such massive issues.  This constitutes taking people less than seriously in this entire discussion.</P>
        <P>Members of the main party on the benches opposite always have prided themselves on being in touch with the people.  Consequently, I presume they know what people are saying at present, which has gone far beyond people simply complaining about this or that decision by the Government.  People are saying there is no Government, that no one is in charge and no one is making decisions.  This is an extremely serious moment for Ireland, which I do not underestimate.  Like Senator Fitzgerald, I certainly do not make light of it.  It may surprise some Members on the Government benches that Members of the Opposition do not seek to grasp this opportunity to engage in political point scoring of the nature that could be seen from the parties on the Government benches when they were in opposition.  This is a highly serious moment for our country and a debate is required in this House this afternoon.  Even if a Minister is not available, Members should have the debate anyway, as Ministers have not contributed greatly to this debate in the past couple of weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should have the debate this afternoon.</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P>I will conclude by noting that the Government as a whole, including the Leader, should engage to some extent with the Opposition parties.  The latter merely seek information and, as Opposition parties, do not seek necessarily to make the decisions because that is a matter for the Government.  However, information should be provided to, and there should be engagement with, the Opposition parties.  Moreover, there should be a little respect for the institutions of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I was greatly concerned last weekend to hear a section of a debate that appears to have escaped under the radar at national level.  It pertained to a decision taken by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to halt immediately the sports capital grants that have been so helpful to Irish sporting organisations since 1987.  I note with interest that Senator Buttimer has decided to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  However, this issue deserves to have the Minister come before the House to explain how this decision was arrived at.  The decision was taken to cease immediately one of the most successful sporting grant schemes, certainly in Europe, in recent years.  All Members present could name ten or 15 projects in their localities that have benefited from it.  Although the national lottery stated last year that its 2007 sales were the best since the lottery began, accumulating a figure of &euro;245 million, out of all that income, not a single cent can be spent on Irish sporting organisations this year.  This was a major decision taken by a Minister without reference to this House.  I ask that the Minister appear before the House.  Perhaps the decision is logical and perhaps he knows best but I would be extremely interested in hearing him explain that logic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White in appealing to the Leader to have a debate today on both the economy and the talks with the social partners.  Were the Leader to make a case for the abolition of the Seanad, by not having a debate, he would be doing so today.  Members must be relevant and must have a voice on behalf of those who put them in here.  By not having such a debate, Members are acquiescing in the Government&rsquo;s mishandling of events over the past six months.  The Opposition has stated repeatedly that the process was wrong and that bypassing both Houses of the Oireachtas was a misstep and, unfortunately, this morning this view has been proven to be correct.</P>
        <P>While I hope the Taoiseach has a plan to hand at 4 p.m. today, I greatly doubt it.  Does he intend to re-engage with the social partners and what information is required?  Where is it and why can Members not get it?  Senators are democratically elected Members of this House and are here on the people&rsquo;s behalf.  I appeal to the Leader to stop running, to take the bipartisanship that has been offered to him and to have the debate.  He should consider the example of President Obama yesterday, who appealed to the Republican Party in the United States.  Fine Gael appeals to the Leader, on behalf of the people, to put aside politics and to engage with it, because that party never has been found wanting regarding the economy, and Senator Fitzgerald has offered an olive branch to the Leader today.  This issue is about people, mortgage holders, small businesses and public servants.  It is also about the people in private industry who have been caught and were paid under the radar.  Let us have a debate.  If the Leader does not allow it, he should tell the House why.  Do not give us spin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Like others, I feel a debate on the economy is necessary.  More than anything else, the attendance of a Minister during that debate would be necessary.  I can understand why none might be available today, given that Ministers are reporting to the D&aacute;il.  I am delighted that a debate has been scheduled for later this week, as we must all take stock of where we are.</P><Col N="549"/>
        <P>Given that the Taoiseach has invested much time and effort, listening to people saying he has done nothing is galling.  It was a matter of months spent negotiating and in discussions.  He made a decision on how he would proceed and tried to build a consensus because we would work better together.  We in Ireland are insular and usually discuss only ourselves; we are inclined to forget that our international standing is equally valid.  For this reason, the Taoiseach has invested much time and effort in the partnership process.  It is regrettable that it did not work in terms of reaching an understanding of the importance of the requisite &euro;2 billion in savings.  All stakeholders in the economy would have taken responsibility for necessary decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In another sense, failing to reach an agreement through the partnership process has advantages in that the supremacy to govern has been restored to politicians and to the political process.  I listened to Senator O&rsquo;Toole with interest.  While I agree with many of his comments, given that his perspective must be dwelled on, we must remember that the union leaders who were in attendance had a vested interest.  Last night, their vested interests were driven home.  No one will criticise them for looking after their vested interests, but the Government must look after the national interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government had a vested interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>As the unions believed they could carry the day, a deal could not be struck.  I hope the Government reaches beyond union leaders and looks to the people.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald to the effect that Members on all sides of the Houses should work together to do what is necessary.  There is no doubt we should be concerned about the next generation.  As someone who grew up during the tail end of the last recession, I know what this means.  It is a sad day when young people do not enjoy the prospect of a job or future in this country.  We must put the politics and sniping aside and consider what the nation can do to hold our international standing high, to benefit the country and to serve the long-term interests of everyone, including those in our profession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley in that there are vested interests, but that is why they were there.  The trade unions are an interest group, as are the employers and the Government.  I was impressed by the remarks of Mr. David Begg and other union leaders, namely, that their vested interests include a significant and superior vested interest in the welfare of the country.  They are prepared to do a deal, but only one that can be sold.</P>
        <P>There has been much bumbling and fumbling around in the dark.  Some debates in the House have been without substance because nothing was placed before us to be properly debated.  We were debating in a vacuum.  It is nonsense.  We need decisive action and the Government must bring the country behind us.  It is a question of confidence.  I am not an economist and I know little about these matters, but I listened to a commentator this morning say that a part of the borrowing problem is the way in which we are estimated internationally and that, unless clear action is taken, we may be downgraded.  Germany is paying 3% on its borrowing.  We are paying 5.5.%.  That will get worse.  This is clear, practical and tangible.  We will pay more unless we can demonstrate that we have the capacity to address this problem seriously.</P>
        <P>Can we examine the implications of a very interesting but rather sad report published yesterday?  It was carried out by the Children&rsquo;s Research Centre in Trinity College Dublin and the School of Education at University College Dublin and concerned the mental health of young gay people.  The material it confirms is shocking.  I suspected it might be like this from my own experience.  Some 80% of the wide variety of students interviewed by these two major universities experienced homophobic bullying in school.  I cannot think of any other group that would experience this level of bullying.  A total of 40% have been threatened with physical violence <Col N="550"/>and 25% have actually been kicked, punched and beaten.  I am part of that 25%.  Would any other group tolerate this?  This raises again the question of the appropriateness of the exemption of the churches from the operations of the Equality Agency because regrettably this prejudice comes from the churches.</P>
        <P>The great poet, Seamus Heaney, launched Yeats festivities last week in Sligo.  Unfortunately, however, a very important Yeatsian environment is being tampered with.  Fort Louis is a house once owned by the Yeats family with which the young poet was familiar.  On page 53 of his <i>Autobiographies</i>, he gives a charming account of sailing a toy boat on the little stream in front of the landscaped garden of his great-uncle&rsquo;s house.  Now the stream will be culverted, the trees removed and that aspect of our cultural heritage will be obliterated.  While this is a matter for local decision, will the Leader be kind enough to draw this to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to see if something can be done to protect this place?  The work is being undertaken only to prepare the way for some kind of ribbon development that probably is not necessary in Sligo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the measured and positive response from the Opposition to the news about the economy.  We should not ignore this but use it as a base on which to build not just for the coming weeks but also in the coming days.  We should listen carefully to what was said here.  While the social partners may not be on board formally, they are in spirit.  It is quite clear in the contributions from the unions and the employers that they realise we need partnership.  Their concern, which might be a matter of timing, is that they might find it difficult to avoid fragmentation within their own groups if they had to do the initial selling of it.  This is a totally different situation from that which existed years ago and brought about industrial unrest.  We must therefore be measured in what we say to make sure that we keep all the partners on board in the coming days.  </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This House has an important role to play in these discussions.  The Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Enda Kenny, said that he was prepared to lay aside other items which should be discussed today in order to focus fully on the economy.  There will be certain parameters and time-scales to which it will be difficult to respond but all of that is a step in the right direction.  Only with that type of united approach and respect for each person&rsquo;s opinion can we hope to make progress.  The bottom line will have to be those who are most vulnerable in society.  That includes those who are suffering because they have lost their jobs, those who cannot pay mortgages and so on.  Whether we have to bring the banks into line regarding the repayment of mortgages, or whatever, everything must be part of a recovery plan.  I think this will unfold in the next few days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  It is extraordinary that in both Houses, the Opposition is continuously calling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not hear about any amendment to the Order of Business.  Maybe Senator Regan supports her opposition to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am opposing the Order of Business.  The Opposition has been calling for information on the economy, indications from the Government on its proposals, and some sense of direction on where we are going.  The pleas of the Opposition have been rebuffed at every turn.  We are asking today whether we can have a briefing on what is happening.  My understanding is that the Leader is not prepared to accede to that.  While the Opposition benches have been endeavouring to have constructive engagement on this issue, Ministers have given speeches which are full of platitudes and generalisations which have no relation to the problems at hand.  It is very disappointing that this is the situation.</P><Col N="551"/>
        <P>It appears that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s strategy on the social partnership talks has been ill-conceived from the beginning.  Partnership has worked in a time of economic growth, where trade-offs exist and the goodies can be spread among the different sectoral interests.  That is not the situation now.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has explained the difficulties of the unions in selling a deal to their members, and I think these are the difficulties that exist.  It is understandable that the unions should want the Government and the Taoiseach to make the decisions and lead from the front, rather than imposing the burden on them to sell a deal that is harsh for their members.  However, that is the problem.  We have spent all of this time, yet still we have no decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is for the Leader. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s nerves may be shattered after the disastrous decisions that have been taken in the budget, be it on medical cards for the elderly and so on.  However, I would have thought that the Taoiseach would have found his composure after the long recess and found an ability to take decisions.  I hope that he will be in a position to do that this afternoon.  The social partnership talks, and social partnership itself, have proven to be a straitjacket on decision-making by the Government.  It is about time that the Taoiseach got the message.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the calls for statements on what the Taoiseach is going to announce, but at an appropriate time.  There is ample opportunity for all of us to hear it at first hand in the D&aacute;il, where matters like this should be first announced.</P>
        <P>I also share the views of those who would like to see tolerance.  Having fought in a number of constitutional campaigns, I am quite mindful that there are few things as intolerant as some of the Irish liberals.  The very people who expect tolerance sometimes show little tolerance in their views and in their statements, in their direct attacks on the church and in their misrepresentation of people who have sincerely held views.  Sometimes, those very sincere views are held by people who defend a person&rsquo;s right to have his or her view, but would disagree strongly with those views.  That does not give a person a right to say that another person is homophobic if he or she follows the church&rsquo;s teaching, which includes caring for everybody, no matter what their views.  If people in this House reflected on what they have said and how they have denigrated the church at times, they might stop and think how intolerant they are themselves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to ask the Leader again to arrange for the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House.  I am concerned about the effect the national service plan will have on the HSE plans for reconfiguring maternity services.  It seems there will have to be a minimum number of births per unit.  It is suggested that this is necessary to ensure comprehensive and safe services for all patients.  That suggestion is an insult to every midwife who is delivering care in this country and elsewhere in the world.  One does not need a centre of excellence to have a baby, or to deliver a baby.  One does not need to deliver a specified number of babies to be said to be proficient at delivering babies.  It is a shocking insult to suggest that a person who delivers ten babies would not be as good at delivering babies if he or she was delivering just five babies.  HSE officials need to start talking to the people on the ground who represent various constituencies throughout this country.  We constantly hear about the &ldquo;reconfiguration&rdquo; and &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; of services.  We are actually being told that services are being taken from us.  The cutting of services is being presented to us as a <i>fait accompli</i>.</P>

	<P>I will be parochial by referring in particular to Clonmel, which has had more than its fair share of torment in recent times.  The people of the town have had to deal with floods and snow, etc.  The relocation of breast services to Waterford was a welcome development.  The decision will predominantly affect women.  Under the new configuration of services, gynaecological services will be provided in the surgical ward that is being relocated to Waterford.  It has been suggested that changes should be made to maternity services at a hospital that delivers 1,200 babies each year.  Why is that the special number?  Who makes such decisions?  One does not need a centre of excellence to have a baby.  The next thing we will be told is that we should only have sex in the city.</P>

I agree with Senators O&rsquo;Malley and Hanafin &mdash; perhaps we should go to the other House to listen to what is said.  Like everybody else, I heard at 6.30 a.m. this morning that the talks had failed.  I almost had a seizure.  We were all hanging on every last word in the hope that the talks would succeed.  It is regrettable.  Everybody was amazed and saddened that a better result was not achieved this morning.  It annoys me, of course, to hear Opposition Senators saying the Taoiseach did nothing.  I listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. this morning.  Everyone who spoke on the programme who had been involved in the talks made it clear that the Taoiseach and others did great work to move forward the talks.  I commend both sides &mdash; the Government and the people to whom the Government was talking &mdash; for working tirelessly to try to achieve a positive result.  It has been suggested that the Government was wrong to introduce the pensions issue at such a late hour.  The Government has been criticised for that.  I am a novice &mdash; I do not know what goes on at talks of this nature &mdash; but I understand from people who are in the know on these matters that the talks in question were organised no differently from similar talks that took place in different times.  I am glad that the social framework is still in place and that the unions are still willing to talk, particularly on other issues.  It is regrettable that the current talks have fallen on this issue.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation is being watched closely.  Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating is hanging in the balance.  When we are in this House and in the Lower Chamber, we tend to be very parochial.  It would do none of us any harm to open our eyes and widen our horizons for the sake of the generations to come.  Just because we are already on the ladder does not mean we should pull up that ladder after us.</P>
        <P>I commend the Taoiseach and the others who worked hard for the past week to secure a solution.  That solution is not yet achieved but they continue to work it out.  It is stiff and cheap of the Opposition to seek to score political points particularly when it is not offering any alternatives.</P>

	<P>I sincerely hope the Leader will be amenable to our concerns and will not oblige us to oppose the Order of Business.  Will he propose an amendment to the <Col N="553"/>Order of Business as already announced by him?  I agree with my colleagues on this side of the House who have spoken before me.  I also liked what Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, O&rsquo;Malley and Hanafin had to say.  Will the Leader propose to adjourn the House to allow us to attend the D&aacute;il Chamber for the announcement that is to be made at 4 p.m.?  Later in the afternoon, whenever a Minister is available, I ask that the Leader allow a debate on the details of that announcement.</P>
        <P>My colleagues and I have said repeatedly in this House that, like Members opposite, we are absolutely dedicated to a balanced and fair package.  We accept the need for reform.  We are all in this together, and we all have a vested interest in the future of our country.  This announcement is of vital concern to our economy, as is the proposed recapitalisation package for the banks.  We cannot afford drift in this regard or we may face disaster.  Until the banking issue is resolved, there will be not be the confidence necessary to ensure we can return the economy to growth in the future.</P>
        <P>There must be an equitable package.  We on this side of the House are concerned by some of the information that has been leaked, but we do not know the accuracy of that information.  I appeal to the Leader to allow for a brief adjournment, to be followed by a ministerial briefing and debate.</P>
        <P>I now raise another issue of vital national importance.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that and undertake to be brief.  Reports this morning indicate that Eircom has a proposal to close down 129 telephone boxes in County Kerry.  People living in coastal and mountain communities are dependent on these facilities.  On a national basis, Eircom proposes to remove 2,151 telephone boxes.  In the Black Valley and other locations throughout the State, there is no mobile telephone coverage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should submit this issue for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>These facilities are vital to hill walkers and pony trekkers in those isolated communities.  We have only until 16 March to make representations.  I hope the Government will not allow this to happen as the tourist season approaches.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like other Senators, I acknowledge and welcome the constructive contributions in this House on the current economic situation.  We are facing the most difficult economic challenges any of us have seen in our lifetime.  I am not sure whether we will emerge unscathed.  I am not sure whether other countries, including the United States, which is the largest economy in the world, will be able to cope with these challenges.  As a country with a small population and a great export dependency, we will rely on some degree of global recovery in order for our economy to be refloated.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, there is a vital need for national consensus in order that decisions taken are measured, fair and supported wholeheartedly by everybody.  I was asked to do an interview this morning on local radio during which I set out what I believe should happen.  As I have been saying for some time, there must be significant reductions in pay, particularly in the public sector.  A reduction in numbers is needed and we will be affected in a range of other areas.  I was surprised when some working class people took the trouble to telephone me to say that needed to be said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is not palatable and no one involved in politics wants to promote such thoughts but if we fail to do it and fail to act together, the consequences for the next generation will be extraordinarily bad.  We have challenges in banking and in fiscal policy and we had best not <Col N="554"/>lose sight of the competitiveness loss which needs to be addressed.  I hope we will all recognise it is in our interests to support the package of measures we will hear rolled out today, as unpalatable as it may be, and look upon it as only the second of probably five or six instalments that will be made in the next two to three years to try to redress the extremely difficult and challenging position we are in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call that we reject the Order of Business in its proposed form.  I join in the appeal to the Leader to reconsider at this stage the proposal that we debate this issue to show the relevance of this House to the public and to ourselves.  We are talking about a crisis and of a whole policy position having come unstuck over a number of months.  We are now back to the drawing board.  We on this side of the House will be constructive as always, but this issue merits debating.  We have made specific proposals but the entire issue merits debating and there should be a reporting procedure to the Seanad.  It would be very bad for the dual chamber concept if we do not achieve that before this evening.<b></b> I appeal to the Leader to provide for that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In the light of the current situation, will the Leader arrange as a matter of urgency for a day-long debate on the creation of jobs in the green energy sector?  We should have had an incentivised national insulation programme in place long before now that would assist the construction industry.  In conjunction with that, we should have energy assessors working throughout the country.  Co-operative wind farms should be set up by farmers throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can raise that in such a debate if the Leader agrees to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of co-operative wind farms, similar to the introduction of the creamery system in the past, should be a pillar of the debate on this area.  There should be a move from transport being powered by oil to it being powered by alternative sources such as electricity and gas.</P>
        <P>In the context of such a debate that would address the opportunity to create green energy jobs, will the Leader provide for consideration of the schools building programme and the use of alternative energy in our schools?  It is long past time that such a schools building programme was in place.  This area presents a great opportunity for job creation.  That opportunity has not been grasped and if it is not, we will simply muddle along for months.  A day should be designated for such a debate and even if it involves an extra sitting on a Friday, what of it, given that this matter is critical.  I appeal to the Leader to show the relevance of this House and to grasp the opportunity to address this matter.</P>

	<P>It is welcome we in this House have suddenly and belatedly developed a sense of urgency about the economy, especially those on the Government side who for so long &mdash; this is a political Chamber where it is perfectly justifiable to make political points &mdash; fiddled around in talks that have come to nothing, brought us in to discuss matters in a vacuum and now suddenly realise we are in a crisis.  The reason for this is because so much political capital on all political sides has been&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone in the Chamber has a mobile phone switched on.  I do not know who it is, but it should not be switched on.  I have warned Members about that previously.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="555"/>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not mine, as I do not have one.  A great deal of political capital has been sunk into Government by the permission of someone else.  When one does not get the permission, one does not know what to do.  I do not say that as someone who is critical of social partnership.  What happened last night has been an incredible shock to the Government because it presumed, as did everyone else, that a deal was done last week and all that was going on was the usual window dressing.  Now we have a situation where the Government is bankrupt of ideas and it will actually have to govern.  It may be a blessing in disguise, but it is typical of the Government that it has done this and not merely on social partnership.</P>
        <P>Government by negotiation is going on somewhere else.  Somewhere in Dublin today, apparently, the banks and the Department of Finance are negotiating a deal to put &euro;8 billion into the banks.  Why the hell are they negotiating this?  I cannot understand it.  The Government has become so used to asking permission from somebody to govern that it asked permission of the unions to govern the finances of the economy and then it asked the banks for permission to give them &euro;8 billion.  What is going on?  Why do they not just say to them that they are getting this money on the following conditions?</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is an extraordinary situation.  I do not apologise for making political points because this Government is somehow paralysed.  It is constantly taking the cowardly course and refusing to take unpopular or, sometimes, popular decisions on its own.  I ask the Government to start governing, accept the mandate the people gave it nearly two years ago and get on with it for the sake of the country.</P>
        <P>Senators Feeney and Norris quite rightly referred to international eyes looking at us.  They said our credit rating is in danger and the cost of borrowing is rocketing.  That is a well recognised danger and they are right.  It is costing us millions every day because nobody has confidence in this Government.  That is the situation.  Let us look at the real scenario that faces us.  If this goes on it will not be a matter of paying too much money, or of paying millions more every day.  Nobody will lend to us.  That is what will happen next.  If the Government does not face that scenario it will be a real disaster.  We will not be able to write the necessary cheques.</P>

	<P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; struck the right tone in that regard.  I disagree with Senator Ross&rsquo;s assertion that the Government is apologising for giving money to the banks.  Senator Ross knows, as I do, that one cannot run an economy without an efficient and well-capitalised banking system.  The Government has stabilised the banking system, which was not credible some months ago.  We all saw how fragile it was, not only here but worldwide.  I do not agree at all with Senator Ross&rsquo;s approach.  He is anti-banking and he comes from a background&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Before Christmas, we put forward the document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.  Part of that document concerns the energy rating of houses and energy efficiency within houses.  I got that motion passed within the parliamentary party before Christmas.  It is now a question of putting some money behind the proposal.  There is potential for substantial job creation in that area, with the possibility of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs.  It is vitally important.  We heard an architect talking this morning on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;.  From the Government&rsquo;s point of view this could be a self-financing project.</P>
        <P>I welcome Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal today and we should seriously consider going into the D&aacute;il to listen to what the Taoiseach has to say at 4 p.m.  A reasonable approach would be to suspend the Seanad at 4 p.m. and have a serious debate on the economy.

	<P>I will finish by saying it is important we examine where the economy can create jobs.  Although there is a downturn in certain sectors, there are areas where we can inflate and rejuvenate the economy.  We should examine that.  Some 25,000 to 30,000 jobs equate to three, four or five Dells.  It is important we examine where we can create jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I raised the underfunding and insolvency of some private pension funds, with particular reference to Waterford Crystal.  Little did I know the receiver would go in a couple of days afterwards, close the doors and sack 600 people without any prior consultation with the workers or their union.  Negotiations are going on with two companies, Clarion and KPS, about purchasing the company.  I hope one of them will purchase the company.  Whichever one does, it is essential that crystal manufacturing will be maintained <Col N="557"/>in Waterford and that the visitor centre, which attracts more than 300,000 tourists per year into Waterford and the region, will be maintained.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Businesses, and the tourism industry in particular, will suffer severely if anything happens to that visitor centre.  The resolution to that cannot be found until the pensions situation is rectified, and it must be rectified.  Yesterday I spoke to a man who had worked in the company and paid his contributions for 44 years, and has been told he will not get a penny of a pension.  That is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That would not happen in a banana republic.  Something will have to be done.  There will have to be some inquiry to find out what went wrong with those pension funds and how it can be rectified.  Anybody working and paying into a pension fund for so long is entitled to some pension.  That should not be tolerated.  The national pension fund is being raided to bail out the banks and we cannot leave people like that man, and many more of them in that situation, without a penny after paying their contributions.  That is unjust and cannot be tolerated in this country.  I call for an inquiry into the matter.</P>
        <P>I also call for a jobs task force for Waterford.  Not alone did we have last week&rsquo;s situation with Waterford Crystal, at Bausch &amp; Lomb 1,400 people will work three weeks in every four and will take August off at their own expense, an effective cut of more than 25% in their wages.  We have had jobs haemorrhaging from Waterford in the past six or eight months.  That region and city needs and demands support from the Government.  We expect the Government will give support and I call for that jobs task force to be established and for the situation regarding pensions at Waterford Crystal to be dealt with now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the issue Senator Cummins raised.  Workers who have worked at Waterford Crystal for many years and paid into a pension scheme over a long number of years find themselves with no pension provision.  Last week I asked the Leader that we examine the whole area of defined benefit pensions across the country because there will be other companies in a similar position to Waterford Crystal.  The Leader said he would consider having a debate this week.  I ask him to have that discussion at the earliest possible opportunity.  There is more than ample opportunity to have it this week and it would be fitting to do so.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns of Senator Cummins.  It is shocking that the workers in Waterford Crystal have been forced into the situation they are now in.  They are trying to work voluntarily to keep the kilns lit, so to speak, in the premises so that the factory can be sustained into the future.  They have taken some action in this regard.  Today they were in the Dublin offices of Deloitte &amp; Touche, which is the receiver for the company, seeking some clarification on the current position.</P>
        <P>It strikes me that a number of leading business people believe there is a future for Waterford Crystal.  They are prepared to take on that task and we should be trying to encourage that so we can maintain as many jobs as possible in that business.</P>
        <P>I share the sentiments of Senator Fitzgerald and others and, in particular, Senator Ross, on social partnership.  I am a bit shocked myself at the sense of disbelief from the Government benches about the collapse of the social partnership talks last night.  There has always been a strong possibility that agreement would not be reached and that the Government would need to have some sort of fallback position.  I presume we are to be told that position at 4 p.m. <Col N="558"/>today.  It is striking that we have been left in a vacuum over recent months.  That is the point the Opposition is trying to get across.  I welcome the sense from most speakers on the Government side in the House today that they are at least listening to what the Opposition has to say.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross was treading on thin ice with some of his comments, as he could have been accused by some Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers of treason or talking the country down.  I say this based on the remarks some of them made last week when my party leader made a number of pronouncements in Brussels, which were sadly true.  The financial community across the world is looking at Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

We are paying penal rates of interest in international markets because we have had a distinct lack of leadership for the past 18 months.  It seems it is only now that the gravity of the situation is dawning on the Government.</P>
        <P>I urge the Leader, even if we have to extend the business of the House this evening, to have a discussion on what the Government is proposing at 4 p.m. in the other House.  If we are to be relevant we should do this.  I said last week that the original idea of the Seanad was a form of social partnership, with the vocational panels representing the various interests of the community.  We should use the forum of this House to have this debate today.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;an all-day sitting next Thursday to discuss the economy, the recapitalisation of the banks, which Senator Ross mentioned and which is urgently needed, and, as has been mentioned by some Senators, the credit rating of the country, Ireland plc.  I will allow as much time on Thursday as leaders require of me for Senators on all sides of the House to make their views known with the Minister present.  I am putting the record straight on this.</P>
        <P>I listened attentively this morning, as did all Senators, to those representing the various walks of life at the social partnership talks.  I do not want to mention anyone who is not in the House, but I have the utmost respect for David Begg.  The people of Ireland have his trust 100%.  This morning it was stated that for a reduction in wages of about &euro;10 per week, which is about three pints of Guinness &mdash; I would not know because I do not drink&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Maybe two in some places.  We are talking about a reduction of &euro;10 a week.  This was a serious problem at the talks for the lower paid in the public service.  They will benefit from their pensions to the extent of 40/80 of their salaries, which is 50%, and it is index linked for the rest of their lives.  It is only very young people, I understand &mdash; a small percentage &mdash; who are affected by this proposal.  Everyone in the country wants corrective measures taken today.  Everyone in the responsible media has been pontificating on this over recent months.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach now has a fair idea of the extent to which certain activities were going on in the banking sector over many years &mdash; indeed, it seems now, even more than many years.  Now that everything has come to light and the Government has its directors in place in the various banks, the fight back can start.  The corrective measures needed will now be put in place, and I hope this day, the feast day of St. Blaise, will be remembered as the day on which we began our comeback on behalf of the future generations of Ireland.  It is in that regard that I am <Col N="560"/>making the proposal to the House that next Thursday, all day and late into the evening if required&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I offer my congratulations, on behalf of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and all Senators, including the Cathaoirleach, to the Gaelic Athletic Association on its 125th anniversary.  I had the pleasure of attending the celebrations in Croke Park, and how proud I was to be an Irish person and a member of an organisation that has done so much over that length of time, through voluntary contributions, to bring together everyone on the island.  It really was a credit to the association.  On the matter of the sports capital grant allocation, I also offer my congratulations to Rory McIlroy, who is an example to every young person in the world, on his outstanding achievements in Dubai on Sunday.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris called for a debate on the research which was published yesterday regarding mental health among young gay people.  I have no difficulty in allowing this to take place.</P>
        <P>The Senator also spoke about the Yeats house in Sligo.  I will convey his views to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  &ldquo;Ben Bulben of Sligo majestic you stand to welcome me back from my travels&rdquo; &mdash; what a contribution Yeats has made.  He is respected throughout the world.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about his and other Members&rsquo; strongly held views on the church&rsquo;s teaching and the contribution of the church.  I join him in those remarks and will convey his views to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast sought an urgent debate on the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s current proposals and plans for maternity services.  I have no difficulty with arranging for a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I will convey Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s views on the matter he raised regarding Eircom telephone boxes for the people in Kerry.  Perhaps the Senator should speak to his leader about using Fine Gael&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time to discuss that issue.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and Senator Butler called for a debate on the positive steps that can be taken for job creation in the context of green issues.  Senator Butler has outlined a lengthy <Col N="561"/>proposal to the House for the creation of between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs.  It would not cost the State anything but it could gain a great deal from it.  I congratulate the Senator.  I heard the proposal aired on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; show this morning.  It shows that a good proposal from a Member of the Oireachtas that is put before their parliamentary party and particularly before the Houses can be very meaningful.  Senator Butler&rsquo;s proposal has great merit and deserves congratulations.  I hope the Government takes it on board and makes it a reality.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins and Senator John Paul Phelan outlined the dreadful plight of the Waterford Crystal workers.  I doubt that any other Irish company, aside from perhaps Baileys and Guinness, has made such an impact by becoming a world renowned brand.  In many of the prestigious events in the sporting world, for example, the trophy awarded is generally by Waterford Crystal.</P>
        <P>If someone pays their contributions over a lifetime, it is immoral if they are not entitled to have those contributions honoured.  I will certainly allocate as much time as necessary next week to have this issue and the plight of the people who paid their pension contributions discussed.  The workers have been paying these contributions over generations.  As Senator Cummins said, one of the workers has been paying his contributions for more than 40 years and has been told that he might not be able to enjoy the benefits of those contributions.  That is not good enough.  I will consult the Senator after the Order of Business to arrange how we can make this debate happen next week.</P>

    <Title>Gas (Amendment) Bill 2008: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Gas (Amendment) Bill for the consideration of the House.  The Bill proposes to increase the statutory borrowing limit of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  The enactment of this Bill will give Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann the legal ability to access funds to develop the strategic direction set out in its five-year corporate plan up to 2012 and beyond.  The Bill proposes to amend section 23 of the Gas Act 1976 which provides for borrowings by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann for capital purposes.  There were no amendments to the provisions of the Bill on Report and Final Stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Since its establishment in 1976, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has played a vital part in the growth of the economy through the development of a gas network that runs to almost 12,500 km of pipeline serving more than 600,000 customers.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has transformed the gas network in the past ten years through the construction of the pipeline to the west, which stretches from Dublin to Galway and down to Limerick; the South-North pipeline from Dublin to Belfast, providing security of supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland as well as supplying towns en route; the Mayo-Galway pipeline, which has facilitated the delivery of natural gas to several towns along the route in both Galway and Mayo, and which will facilitate the transportation of Corrib gas to the Irish market in due course; the north-west pipeline from Belfast to Derry, also supplying towns along the route; and the second gas interconnector with Scotland, which has secured the supply of gas to Ireland since its completion in 2002.</P>
        <P>These projects have provided for the delivery of gas to towns in the midlands and west, including along the Mayo-Galway pipeline which was constructed to facilitate the delivery of Corrib gas to the market.  They have also provided security of supply of natural gas to Ireland through the second interconnector and, through the South-North pipeline, security of supply to the island as a whole, including Northern Ireland.  All these have contributed greatly to the development of the economy over the past ten years.</P>
        <P>The Members of the House will be aware that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has a statutory mandate to provide a system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not intend to interrupt the Minister of State unnecessarily, could we have a copy of his script, if possible?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for not distributing it earlier.  We will make it available and if it needs to be autographed or anything else, we will facilitate that as well.</P>
        <P>The Members of the House will be aware that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has a statutory mandate to provide a system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.  Unfortunately, the requirement to deliver a network on an economic basis means that some areas miss out on the benefits of natural gas as the construction of the necessary infrastructure does not meet the economic criteria set out.  However, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has developed the network extensively since its establishment in 1976 and now 18 counties in Ireland and four in Northern Ireland are connected to the natural gas network.</P>
        <P>Members will be aware that the procedures for determining whether towns or locations can be connected to the network were changed in agreement with the Commission for Energy Regulation in such a way that instead of towns being evaluated individually, they would be taken in groups or clusters.  This resulted in several towns being connected that would not have qualified under the previous method.  Eleven towns along the Mayo-Galway pipeline were <Col N="563"/>earmarked for connection to the natural gas network in phase one of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s new towns analysis under this connections policy.  Six of these have been connected and the remaining five will be completed this year.  Phase two confirmed that six more towns will be connected.  Cashel was connected in 2008 and the remaining five phase two towns will be completed this year.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has almost completed phase three of its new towns analysis as part of its connections policy to establish whether it is feasible to extend the gas network further.  I understand the publication of this report is imminent.  However, I reiterate that the locations under examination must meet the economic criteria before the network can be extended to these areas.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s gross borrowing is expected to reach the existing statutory borrowing limit of &euro;1.7 billion this year.  The existing debt is made up mainly of long-term facilities put in place to fund the large gas transmission projects, to which I referred, that were completed over the past ten years.  The expansion of the gas network in recent years from 8,200 km in 2000 to its current 12,500 km has also been funded by long-term debt matching the expected life of the infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The operation and development of the gas network in the next five years includes adding another 1,500 km of pipeline to the network; the connection of 150,000 new customers; replacement of the remaining cast-iron network with polyethylene pipes; and investment in new systems and technology to provide improved customer service.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will continue to meet its emergency response standards and pipeline safety standards.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann also intends entering the domestic retail electricity market this year.  With its existing customer service operations, billing systems and mechanisms related to its retail gas business, savings can be made in this area when providing a retail electricity service, thus providing added value to both Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and its customers.</P>
        <P>Members of the House will be aware that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is also in the process of constructing a 445 MW combined-cycle gas turbine electricity generating plant at Whitegate, Cork.  The board&rsquo;s plan is to develop a portfolio of electricity generating plant, including renewable generation and flexible power plants, to support renewable power generation.  This access to its own supply of electricity will ensure a stable, vertically integrated business model, which will ensure, in turn, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s long-term competitive commitment to the electricity retail market.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned to Members of the D&aacute;il when the Bill was introduced, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has an ambitious capital investment programme of up to &euro;2 billion over the coming five years with a view to becoming a competitive dual-fuel supplier in the Irish market.  The enactment of this legislation to increase the statutory borrowing limit to &euro;3 billion is an integral part of this process.  This development is in line with the Government&rsquo;s energy policy framework document, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, which specifically provides for the sustainable development of State energy companies.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s commercial direction will provide competition and environmental sustainability, which are key pillars of the policy framework.</P>
        <P>The development of business interests outside its traditional core business of natural gas transportation and supply does not impact negatively on the price of gas to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann customers.  The company&rsquo;s gas business is regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation which allows Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann a regulated rate of return on its transportation business.  It can only recover costs on investments approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  In setting the rate of return, the CER applies the cost and level of borrowing of an <Col N="564"/>efficiently operated and financed company with comparable systematic risks to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  Therefore, the board is incentivised to borrow funds as efficiently as possible.</P>
        <P>The security of gas supplies was to the fore recently when difficulties between Russia and Ukraine emerged following last Christmas.  I assure Members that Ireland is not experiencing any impact on gas supply arising from that situation.  Ireland&rsquo;s demand for gas is met almost entirely by imports from the United Kingdom.  Irish imports account for approximately 5% of the UK gas market.  The vast bulk of UK gas demand is met by indigenous North Sea production and imports from Norway.  The UK is also interconnected with continental Europe and receives some gas from Russia.  However, this accounts for less than 2% of the gas in the UK system.  On this basis, the recent Russia and Ukraine situation did not impact adversely on Ireland.  However, the situation clearly underlines the strategic importance of diversifying our sources of gas supply.  In this regard, the Corrib gas field, which could meet 60% of our annual demand for gas for approximately five years, is very significant.</P>
        <P>The part Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has played in the development of the economy since 1976 has been significant.  The robust gas supply network developed by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, including connection to the UK grid through the interconnectors, has guaranteed security of supply in the long term.  Given that 60% of our electricity is generated by gas, the secure supply of natural gas has provided the necessary assurance to prospective competitors in the electricity generating sector that investment in electricity generation in Ireland is an attractive business proposition.  In this context, the development of the gas network, while not physically reaching all areas, has benefitted all areas of the State through its support of the electricity market.  In the process, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has contributed &euro;686 million in dividends to the Exchequer since its foundation, including &euro;28 million paid in December last year.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has increased turnover from &euro;496 million to &euro;1.2 billion.  Profits have increased from &euro;70 million to &euro;142 million.  Net assets have increased from &euro;672 million to &euro;1.3 billion, placing the utility on a sound financial footing.  This success has allowed Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to develop its network continually, making a vital contribution to the national economy and providing excellent service to its customer base.  It is in a strong position to meet the challenges it faces in terms of environmental sustainability and competition while ensuring a safe and secure supply of natural gas.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that an increase in Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s statutory borrowing limit does not give it permission to raise its borrowing to his level.  Each project put forward by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will require the approval of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The board is obliged to act in its best interests and no proposals will be supported that would put the long-term sustainable future of the utility at any unnecessary risk.  Ongoing borrowing levels will be monitored and will be subject to full commercial criteria, such as ability to repay and protection of the balance sheet.  Clearly, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann plays a pivotal role in our economy.  I ask the Members of the House to support the proposed increase in Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s statutory borrowing limit to &euro;3 billion.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom an tAire St&aacute;it a fh&aacute;ilti&uacute; go dt&iacute; an Teach.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as ucht an l&eacute;iri&uacute; ag thug s&eacute; d&uacute;inn ar an t-&aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  The objective today is to amend section 23 of the Gas Act 1976 and to increase the statutory borrowing limit of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  This would allow Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to develop and work on what is a very fine corporate plan up to 2014.  In the interests of the country, my party will support the legislation, as we did in the D&aacute;il, on the premise that flexibility should be allowed Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in this area.</P><Col N="565"/>
        <P>It is worthy of note that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has 600,000 customers nationally at present.  It has made very good use of moneys and resources to date and it is a very successful company.  An interesting by-product of the current credit squeeze is its assistance to players such as Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, which can afford to purchase major wind farms, as it has done recently.</P>
        <P>The strengthening of the hand of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in this regard is a by-product of our current position.  I am impressed by the legislation&rsquo;s mandatory provision to the effect that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann would not be given <i>carte blanche</i> and the Minister still will have control on expenditure.  I refer to both the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Finance in this regard.  Such a provision is both worthy and necessary and it is worth making the point on Second Stage that in the past 11 years, a culture has existed that featured excessive lack of control and a lack of minding the pennies.  In the current climate and for the next year, everyone at a domestic level will be obliged to manage money in a different fashion.  Similarly, the country will be obliged to so do and a different culture must pervade.  Moreover, one must hope that such a culture will extend itself for longer than in the past and that it will endure for a long time in the interests of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to make a point to the Minister of State that I also made on the Order of Business in this House some weeks ago and which then received general acceptance as being an important issue.  Last summer, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was awarded a price increase of 20% that was predicated on the fact that at the time, crude oil cost &euro;145 per barrel.  At present, however, oil costs less than &euro;50 per barrel or somewhat less.  While the price fluctuates, it now is approximately one third of what it then was.  The Minister of State should take seriously the suggestion I am about to make.  It should have happened long ago and had such a measure been taken in advance of last night&rsquo;s negotiations with the social partners, we may have had a different outcome.  At a minimum, there should be a 10% reduction in the current prices of gas and electricity.  The regulator stated in respect of the ESB that it had a six-month supply of oil in backlog at an expensive price and for that reason, an instant decrease in its prices could not take place.  If it is the case that the ESB had a six-month backlog of the expensive oil, presumably it also had a backlog in supply of cheaper oil at the outset of the crisis.  Consequently, there is no justification for failing to reduce energy costs.  Great energy poverty exists among our social welfare recipients and high energy costs constitute a significant barrier to successful industry.  One of the major employers in my own locality, Wellman International of Mullagh, County Cavan, recently cited its energy costs as being its greatest disincentive.  Moreover, many companies that have closed down have cited the significance of high energy costs.  My point is that gas prices should be reduced immediately.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is a commercial success and while I do not wish such success to stop, consumers should not fail to benefit from both that success and the pain they may have accepted in the past.  I make this point to the Minister of State not in a flippant or time-filling way but in a serious manner.  He should respond to this point and should take this to be a serious proposition.</P>
        <P>The Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, assured me on the Order of Business a few weeks ago that he intended to bring this matter to higher echelons and similarly, I ask the Minister of State to act on it.  At a minimum, there should be a decrease of 10% to 20% in gas prices.  There should be a reduction in both ESB and gas prices of a dramatic nature and were such measures presented to the social partners, they might look on other propositions in a different fashion.  This matter is both urgent and serious and it is a shame it has not happened to date.  The public is becoming angry in this regard and it should not be the case that high energy prices are dislocating jobs.  This matter must be tackled head-on.</P>
        <P>I will mention in passing a point that is not relevant to today&rsquo;s debate.  The issue of price control must be grappled with to a much greater extent.  It also constitutes a huge element in the cross-Border trade and while I recognise the VAT dimension, price control must be central. <Col N="566"/> Why can superstores in one part of an island sell at radically different prices to superstores in another part?  This issue must be investigated.</P>
        <P>The proposed new borrowing limits, which Fine Gael supports, will allow Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to increase its involvement in the renewable energy area.  This is an excellent development in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol obligations and its future in respect of energy supplies, sustainability, security etc.  The Minister of State should encourage Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to opt to purchase and develop wind farms.  It is important that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann should become an aggressive competitor to the ESB.  This will be necessary for consumer pricing, the quality of supply etc.  Obviously, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann requires the proposed capital, flexibility and upper borrowing limits in order that it can compete against the ESB.  It is important to ensure that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s gas supply becomes accessible to as many local communities as possible.  The Minister of State referred to this and I agree.  This policy should be continued and there should be constant monitoring to ensure continual significant investment in extending pipelines and access.  While I note 18 counties have complete coverage and 600,000 customers now are supplied, it is important to acknowledge that some areas of the country are without a gas supply.</P>
        <P>Energy security is a highly important issue in that at present, Ireland has available to it six days&rsquo; supply of gas.  Members should recall the dispute between Russia and Ukraine and the former&rsquo;s recent treatment of the latter.  The Minister of State correctly identified that this dispute did not have an impact in an Irish context and it is helpful to the House that he did so.  However, at the same time, this should ring alarm bells and is of concern as it brings into focus the question of security of supply.  Consequently, it is important that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann proposes to invest capital expenditure in the creation of greater storage facilities for gas and wind energy, as well as for the development of renewables.  I understand its corporate plan proposed expenditure on renewables and storage facilities of &euro;15 million, &euro;80 million and &euro;194 million last year, in 2009 and 2010, respectively.  This development is crucial and the Minister of State should continually impress on Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann that it should continue such capital expenditure on those priorities, as outlined in its corporate plan.</P>
        <P>It is important to continue to exploit Ireland&rsquo;s offshore gas natural resources.  However, it should be brought ashore in a much more sensitive fashion and in a much more co-operative and interactive manner with local communities.  Although ultimately decisions must be made, the manner in which the bringing onshore of gas from the Corrib gas field has evolved has not been satisfactory and we should try to correct this in future developments.  However, it is critical to bring onshore offshore gas in a manner which is acceptable to local populations.</P>
        <P>I believe it will be extraordinarily important to examine Ireland&rsquo;s transportation sector to remove its over-reliance on oil, from the perspectives of emissions, the ultimate cost of Kyoto Protocol fines and general security and sustainability.  We should consider sources of energy arising from renewables and other sources and the commercial availability and widespread use of electrically-powered cars.  All Members will wish to acknowledge &mdash; it would be wrong to do otherwise &mdash; the huge contribution made by my D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Coveney, to this debate on electric cars and their development.  At present, he is preparing a paper on the subject for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  People should make use of electric cars and gas-powered cars and there should be a diversification of the transport sector, as well as a removal of our dependence on oil.</P>
        <P>We should consider broadly renewable technologies and wave energy.  While there has been recent investment in wave energy technology and its development, that must be ongoing.  I certainly support the amendment and believe it is necessary to give an important company with a good track record, such as Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, the flexibility and room to expand.  I believe <Col N="567"/>it must expand much further into renewables.  While the company is moving in that direction, it must do so to a greater extent.  It must establish more storage facilities and compete strongly against the ESB in supplying electricity.  It must also bring offshore gas fields onshore.</P>
        <P>The objectives are important and, by and large, are set out in the corporate plan of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  It is important for the House to have a democratic input and to monitor the development of the commercial companies in question.  For a while, we let the power of the Houses of the Oireachtas slip to a detrimental degree.  Current events might make us assert the role of the Oireachtas more and involve it more.  We should be proactive in promoting and encouraging renewables and sustainability.  The country has a significant opportunity in that regard and, from a patriotic perspective, I support the legislation.</P>
        <P>There should be good competition with the ESB in terms of consumer prices.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply on energy costs with great interest.  Instant and radical reductions in energy prices are necessary.  If they are not made, we could hardly tell ordinary, hard-pressed people about wage restraints and other sacrifices.  It would be appalling were we not to take this golden opportunity to provide them with cheaper energy.  A statement from the Minister of State would be welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In aonacht le mo chara ar an taobh eile den Teach, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, at&aacute; anseo inniu chun an Bhille gairid t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;.  Aonta&iacute;m le m&oacute;r&aacute;n den m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Reilly san &oacute;r&aacute;id a thug s&eacute;.</P>
        <P>While the Bill is short, it is none the less important and is intended to increase the borrowing provision of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  The Minister of State outlined what developments were yielded by the 2002 increase in permitted borrowings.  It is important that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann be able to fund its capital programme and provide necessary infrastructure in the interests of our energy objectives.  That Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is expected to reach its borrowing limit of &euro;1.7 billion in 2009 is interesting.</P>
        <P>Interest rates during this recession are exceptionally low, possibly as little as 0% in the United States of America.  I am waiting to see whether one will be paid deposit interest on borrowings.  Were that day to arrive, we might all be at the bank to find out what we could borrow.  Many commentators believe that deflation will occur in many western economies this year, which would impose its own challenges.  Now is probably a good time to consider increasing borrowings and to stress test their costs.  A number of economists have forecasted that, when we get through the recession in one, two, three or four years&rsquo; time, hyperinflation will be a risk.  Apparently, it is a feature of downturns.  This downturn, which appears to be deep, could result in hyperinflation.  If so, the House can rest assured that interest rates will pursue it to get it under control.</P>
        <P>It is important we learn the lessons of the past decade, a time when we might not have foreseen a rainy day and borrowed and invested accordingly.  When interest rates are low, we should ensure we do not go to the other extreme and fail to plan for when the repayments will be in excess of this year and next year&rsquo;s levels.</P>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, it is welcome that the Minister will, as a shareholder, maintain control over investments on a case by case basis.  This element is especially important.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has been a success.  Not only is it involved in the gas market, it is also involved in electricity generation.  While many claim it has done so to compete within the energy field, I am sceptical whenever I see State companies competing because they often do not provide the extent of competition found in the private sector.  We must be mindful of this issue.</P>
        <P>Other companies are entering the market in my area.  For example, Endesa has purchased some generating stations.  I hope it has done so to generate electricity rather than to incinerate, <Col N="568"/>which is not the way the country should go.  Perhaps one incinerator might be required, but a proliferation would lead to our losing control and remaining on the second last step of the ladder of the waste disposal hierarchy.  We should be considering the top end, namely, prevention in the first instance and minimising, recycling and reusing.  While we are heading in that direction, the thrust of incineration will be to undermine our attempts because incinerators will need to be provided with waste.</P>
        <P>I welcome the investment in transportation and the pipe network.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly that there has been much inflation in energy prices.  According to the regulator and others, it is linked with the international price of gas.  However, we can make the necessary economies.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  None of the regulators who has appeared before it has given me the sense that competition, price control and value for money for the consumer are a major feature of his or her thinking.  This deficiency must be strongly tackled.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate in the past week on the cost of public service pensions.  As I have stated previously, they will be unsustainable regardless of any increase in contributions.  A number of Senators referred to the defined benefit scheme at Waterford Crystal.  Many defined benefit schemes in the private sector are in serious difficulty because of the significant global drop in stock markets and investments.  I do not know how people could have been insulated other than to have their pension funds on deposit, which might not have been acceptable during the past decade.  We are also losing sight of defined contribution schemes.  People put their money into funds and were not guaranteed returns, but have seen their funds depleted because of the stock markets.</P>
        <P>Why am I saying this in a debate on Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann?  I do so because it still has golden parachutes.  If one leaves Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, one gets multiples of one&rsquo;s salary and a 50% pension until reaching the age of 65 years and getting the proper pension.  This situation is not sustainable.  While it is a profitable company, is it right that, in 2009, we are repeating the mistakes we made in many semi-State companies?  We must be consistent across the public and private sectors.  There is no reason workers in one industry should be featherbedded against workers in another industry who may be often more productive.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State outlined the benefits derived from the last borrowing which increased from &euro;700 million to &euro;1.7 billion, saying that the second gas interconnector from Dublin to Galway and Limerick, the north west pipeline from Belfast to Derry, the south-north pipeline from Dublin to Belfast and the Mayo-Galway pipeline were all an essential part of the investment programme.  That came to a bill of &euro;1.41 billion.  It is also good that the company&rsquo;s profit after tax in 2006 was &euro;142 million.  I am not sure what percentage return on investment that represents but it is a sizeable sum of money.  I also note the dividends paid to the Exchequer.  The Minister of State cited the cumulative dividend for that year as &euro;28 million at December 2008.  The Exchequer will welcome these dividends as the fiscal position becomes more serious.</P>
        <P>When business is profitable, whether in private, semi-State or State organisations, it is easy to let costs slide.  We must ensure, particularly in companies that do not have real competition, that the efficiencies and cost-effectiveness are primed and subject to constant attention and that executives and those working within the companies are measured by their performance in that area and in the development of the company.</P>
        <P>It is good to see that the gas network has grown from 112,000 to 600,000 but I am disappointed to note that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has re-partitioned the country.  It was unfortunately partitioned in 1922 but now we have lost eight counties.  Wexford, Kerry, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Tyrone and Fermanagh are not connected to the natural gas pipeline. <Col N="569"/> That puts those counties at a disadvantage industrially and commercially from the point of view of attracting industry into their areas.  I would like to see that tackled.</P>
        <P>I am more familiar with my own county where the gas comes to our front door, in Arklow, but does not come into Wexford, and to the back door in Waterford but does not come into New Ross.  If I may be parochial, I would like that to be examined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State spoke about the need for security of gas supplies and mentioned the difficulties between Russia and Ukraine.  We are dependent on Britain, the old enemy.  It is important, given the industrial unrest in Britain, that we try to ensure we have other sources of supply so that we are not caught in a political argument between two countries, such as happened in Russia and Ukraine, or by industrial relations difficulties, such as are occurring in Britain, or  by conflict.  Security of supply is essential and is a priority with the Minister who I hope will address it.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill and the increased borrowings and hope that some of the borrowings will be used to provide a pipeline to Wexford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome and support this enabling Bill which is designed to increase the borrowings of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  We are suffering the effects of the recession with job losses and contraction of business activity and many are struggling.  The investment to which the Bill will give rise and which the Government is overseeing and safeguarding is extremely important.  We rely heavily on fossil fuels and energy security arises in the case of gas.  While reliance on gas has increased, we do not have sufficient domestic reserves and gas and energy prices have skyrocketed.  Many are struggling to pay bills.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service must be one of the growth businesses in this climate.  </P>
        <P>The cost of fuel has been a dominant topic of debate in this and the other House.  Petrol prices have gone through the roof and come down again, which is welcome, but electricity and gas prices have increased significantly and we need transparency on those.  We have a high dependency on fossil fuel.  Electricity prices for industrial and commercial customers in the second half of 2007 were between 3% and 52% respectively above the EU average.  That must be examined.</P>
        <P>It is important that we proceed with this initiative in order to create jobs.  I am happy to support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is simply intended to allow the borrowing capacity for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to increase from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  There is an onus on the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas to allow all State agencies, particularly those in the semi-State sector, to perform to the best of their abilities.  There is obvious concern in increasing a credit capacity at a time when as a nation we are finding it difficult to borrow additional resources.  The market for borrowing money is becoming limited and the cost of borrowing is increasing.  The work of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in reorganising itself as a general energy company must be recognised.  It is to our advantage to have competing interests, not only in respect of the fuel types or energy sources offered but also in offering consumers a choice.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is well on the way to achieving this.  I hope the result will be better services and lower prices for the consumer.  The Electricity Supply Board will need to examine this process.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a consequence of the competition directive on energy activity but we can no longer take energy for granted.  We are reaching a point at which there is no certainty about the world&rsquo;s economy or access to traditional energy sources.  In the past month we have seen that much of the natural gas coming into Europe comes from Russia through Ukraine and political difficulties there resulted in the supply being cut off, albeit temporarily.  That part of the infrastructure, however, remains at risk.</P><Col N="570"/>
        <P>We fortunately had the foresight to examine how we access our outside sources of natural gas, for example, in pipelines through the United Kingdom that originate in Norway.  We can also be sure that fossil fuels are at their peak.  They will not exist for use by the generations of the next 40 to 50 years.  It has been said that the price difficulties caused by our regulation system need to be examined.  There is no doubt there is a mismatch between the ability to achieve the supply at source of the fossil fuel products and what the consumer is being charged, particularly commercial consumers.  That needs to be recognised in some way.  The ongoing talks about how we reorganise have recognised that, and I suspect there will be some short-term relief, either from the Government or from the Minister working with the regulator, to bring about price savings.  It will be a short-term relief, because eventually gas and petrol prices will rise again.  Even if the short-term relief cannot be provided, at a time when the economy needs a kick start, nobody would deny that this relief would be a worthwhile outcome.</P>
        <P>The sense of the Bill is about recognising the energy market.  As it remodels itself, I would like to see Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann continuing its work, relying less on natural gas as its main product, but trying to source gas from whatever Irish sources exist.  The gas supply off Kinsale is coming to an end.  We will eventually see some gas coming from the Corrib field, and there are hopes of some gas in the Porcupine Basin, but these sources will run out.  All agencies involved in the energy sector, be they commercial or semi-State, will have to bite the bullet on renewable energy.  These are companies that have considerable resources, including their own property portfolios.  These offer an opportunity to invest in an area that needs greater investment.</P>
        <P>In spite of the general feeling that there is a need to pare back on public expenditure, additional public expenditure of at least &euro;150 million has been just announced in the other House for insulation for housing and public buildings such as schools.  I hope that sum will be increased to cover insulation for local authority housing as well.</P>
        <P>Energy companies have a responsibility to sell as much of their product as possible and maximise their profits, but also to make sure the resources they are selling are sustainable in the future.  As Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann remodels itself, and as the Houses give it the sanction to allow it carry out the necessary investment, I hope that a core principle of its work and the work of the ESB will not only be to work together to achieve energy security for this country, but also to work together to make sure that energy, as it is produced, is used as it is needed.  If we operate to those principles, we will have an environmental benefit and an economic benefit for generations to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Power, to the House and I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  My maiden speech in this House in 1993 was about the gas interconnector in Dundalk.  At that time, I said I hoped the gas supply would be extended to the west and to County Mayo.  I have seen where that has nearly come to fruition.  The pipeline has been laid in most of Mayo, but there is no gas yet.  I hope the Corrib gas situation will be resolved.  I wish the forum taking part in negotiations the best of luck in that respect.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh made the point that there are eight counties without gas.  It is true to say that counties without gas will be at a disadvantage in the future.  I welcome the development of a gas supply in Mayo, but it would not be in place were it not for the fact that the gas find off the west coast means there must be a pipeline linking Mayo with the north-east pipeline.</P>
        <P>The statistics given by the Minister of State are interesting.  I did not know that as much as 60% of our electricity was generated by gas.  Around 5% of our gas comes from the UK, which is significant, and I notice that only 2% of the UK gas market is supplied by Ukraine or Russia. <Col N="571"/> The problems with the pipeline were not a significant factor for the UK, but it highlights the amount of gas produced in Britain, and what it means to its economy now that it is in a downturn.  The British can generate millions and millions of pounds in revenue from these natural resources, which they can use to stimulate their economy.  We do not have that wealth, which is one of our problems.  We have gas, but we are not getting any royalties from it.  We do not have any oil.  While the perception in the past few years was that we are very wealthy country, we do not have any real wealth in oil, gas, diamonds or gold.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech highlights the significance of gas to this country.  We have all seen how prices in petrol and diesel rocketed in the past couple of years, and are now back down again.  While the energy regulator has granted price increases to the energy suppliers, we need to bring down the price of electricity.  A number of producers in industry are dependent on gas and electricity for exports, and they are under severe pressure.  Our householders are under pressure as well.  Their budgets are being cut, and the Taoiseach has just announced the cuts that will take place in the next few months.  We need to get our prices in order.  We need to get our competitiveness back and we need to examine gas and electricity prices.</P>
        <P>This Bill is basically about increasing borrowing for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, and Fine Gael welcomes that.  The company needs funds, it needs to plan for the future and it is only right that it has the borrowings it needs.  It has a huge infrastructure right across the country, and it supplies very small towns.  Will there be a facility to connect villages that are near connected towns?  There are people who are interested in availing of this possibility.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill, and I give it my full support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I will not discuss it in great detail.  We all know what it is about.  I have a script, but I do not intend to rely on it.  I will speak about a matter that affects customers in a real way.  It has been raised by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and others.  I refer to the cost of energy, particularly gas.  Last week, I spoke to a lady who had just received a monthly gas bill of &euro;475 in respect of her three-bedroom house.  When I looked at my own bill, I noted that it was similar.  Senator Burke mentioned the horrendous effect of such costs on people on a tight budget.  If three people are sharing a house, a gas bill of &euro;100 a week represents a fair amount of money for them.</P>
        <P>If one asks business people what is crippling them, the first thing they will refer to is the cost of energy.  It is a particular difficulty for people in the restaurant and hotel sectors.  Energy costs are helping to put people out of business.  We need to examine that.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said when he was talking about gas, the ESB needs to have an aggressive competitor.  There is no doubt about that.  We cannot talk about this issue forever.  We have to do something about it if we are to help households.  The woman who showed me her gas bill told me she knows many elderly people who are afraid to turn on gas heating in case they will be landed with a huge bill.</P>
        <P>Some Senators spoke about the topical issues of home insulation and energy conservation.  Many private companies are available to test the energy efficiency of houses or other establishments.  They determine whether energy is escaping and, if so, where it is escaping.  I understand that the fee for that service is approximately &euro;240 or &euro;250.  Many people, particularly elderly people, are not in a position to pay such a fee.  Something should be done to subsidise it.  Perhaps people in certain categories, who cannot afford energy efficiency testing, should be entitled to free testing.  If the cost of testing the energy efficiency of houses is deterring people from getting it done, they will not get a start at all.  There is no doubt it is a good idea.  It will create jobs, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly has said.</P><Col N="572"/>
        <P>The need to consider alternative sources of energy, which has been raised by Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and O&rsquo;Toole, is a hobby horse of mine.  This country has many resources.  In my home county of Cavan, mills used to be driven by water.  The millraces are still in place.  There is no reason such ideas cannot be re-examined and moved forward.  The day will come when we will have to seriously consider alternative energy.  It is obvious that we will be less dependent on oil as the years go by.</P>
        <P>People often ask me why decreases in the price of oil are often accompanied by increases in ESB and gas prices.  Although I have asked Ministers and people in various quarters why that is the case, I have yet to get a straight answer.  When I am asked why ESB and gas costs are increasing when the price of oil is dropping, I am not able to give a satisfactory answer.  I will leave it at that.  I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to say a few words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the contributions of Members of the House.  They have all supported the provisions of the Bill.  Senators raised a number of matters that were also raised during the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill, including issues pertaining to security of supply, costs, competitiveness and the extension of the gas network.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke spoke about the exclusion from the gas network of certain villages that are on the periphery of towns that are served by the network.  It is clear that people in some areas would like to be connected to the network.  I remind him that no locality will be served by the network if it does not make economic sense.  Following a change that was made to the relevant system of evaluation, towns are no longer judged individually.  Centres of population can now be considered in groups or clusters.  This gives them a better chance of being included, obviously.  A number of towns have been already successful in this regard.</P>
        <P>I was also asked about the possible extension of the network.  I remind the House that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is obliged to consider economic criteria when it is examining whether it is feasible to extend the gas network to a particular location.  I assure the Senators who have raised the matter that we have made some changes to the process.  I hope we will continue to see the extension of the network and the subsequent connection of more and more homes to it.</P>
        <P>The issue of security of supply was mentioned during the course of the debate.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is developing long-term strategic plans for the licensing of the Kinsale field as a storage facility.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is working with the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to examine options for increased gas storage on an all-island basis.  The Members who spoke about security of supply highlighted the recent difficulties between Russia and Ukraine.  The dispute in question, which was widely covered in the newspapers, reiterated the importance of security of supply.  It is important for us to develop the Corrib gas field and to bring those supplies ashore as quickly as possible.  We are making every effort to ensure that happens.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is working with the European Union to deliver fully integrated regional gas markets in northern Europe and to provide for the diversification of supply.  The storage of liquefied natural gas is an important element of security of gas supply strategies around the world.  The development by Shannon LNG of a liquefied natural gas terminal near Tarbert, which is on the Shannon Estuary, is another important element of the development of the market in the context of security of supply.  When the Corrib field is in full production, it will significantly reduce our reliance on imports during its lifespan.  It is estimated that it will meet 60% of annual demand and 40% of peak demand for approximately six years, until supply is expected to start to decline.  It is thought that significant potential exists for further substantial oil and gas finds in Irish waters. <Col N="573"/> One of the Department&rsquo;s key priorities is to encourage further exploration activity in the Irish offshore zone.</P>
        <P>Statistics on Ireland&rsquo;s energy imports underline the imperative need to reduce this country&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels.  The Government is committed to delivering on ambitious targets for the accelerated development of renewable energy, which will progressively and sustainably reduce our dependence on imported oil and gas.  Installed wind-powered electricity generation capacity has now reached 950 MW and is set to reach more than 1,000 MW by the end of this year.  As wind power penetration increases, we are on target to provide 15% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2010.  This figure is set to increase to 40% by 2020, assuming there is a consistent build rate of the necessary infrastructure.  While we have set ambitious targets, we have shown in recent years that we have the capacity to meet such targets.  There is a willingness to do so.</P>
        <P>Last Friday, I had the pleasure of meeting a number of people who are involved in the industry.  They are making a valuable contribution to the renewable energy sector, which is one of this country&rsquo;s real success stories.  At a time when many sectors of this country&rsquo;s economy are experiencing serious difficulties and are concerned about the future, the renewable energy sector can look to the future with great confidence.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources looks forward to working with those involved in that sector to achieve our important goals.</P>
        <P>The goals and objectives of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann are in line with Government policy.  It is crucial that there is competitiveness in the various sectors of the energy industry.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann provides competition in the gas and electricity retail sectors while ensuring that the natural gas transportation network, which is a strategic national infrastructure asset, is developed and maintained to the highest specifications in terms of safety and cost.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann ensures that it is operated as efficiently as possible by the independent transportation system operator, Gaslink.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann maintains the network to ensure the long-term security of the supply of natural gas in Ireland.  The proposed increase in the statutory borrowing limit of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will give the board the financial ability to continue the impressive growth of the organisation.  It will also allow Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to continue to make a considerable return to the State as shareholder, not only through dividend payments but also through increased shareholder value.  A strong State-owned gas network will provide comfort to potential investors looking to the State.  The guarantee of supply of natural gas has been instrumental in recent years to the decision by various players to invest in electricity generation in Ireland.  The continued strong performance of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will contribute towards the presentation of the State as an attractive location for investment.  We recognise the competition that exists from other countries and that we must make ourselves as attractive as possible to those who are willing to invest here and create much needed employment.</P>
        <P>I note Members&rsquo; concerns regarding gas prices.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is granted a rate of return by the Commission for Energy Regulation that allows it to recover its costs plus a small margin for future development of the network.  Any approved gas prices are based on the optimal company standard applied by the regulator.  Under its establishing legislation, and according to competition rules, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is obliged to operate a system that is economical.  It cannot, therefore, operate at a loss, as this would undermine other suppliers, existing or potential, in the open competitive gas supply market.  Decisions on Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann prices are a matter for the regulator.  It must also purchase gas in advance, which is why decreases in wholesale gas prices are not immediately reflected in domestic prices.  The request for a substantial price increase last summer was not granted, with the regulator opting instead to review the matter towards the end of the year.  This was a wise decision, as proved by the subsequent decrease in wholesale prices.</P><Col N="574"/>

    <Title>Report on European Union Scrutiny: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This report on European Scrutiny, No. 21, Provision of Food Information to Consumers, which is led by the Department of Health and Children, is effectively a review of the entire area of food labelling legislation.  Its aim is to modernise and improve European Union food labelling rules, so that consumers have the essential information, presented in a legible and understandable manner, that they need to make informed purchasing choices.  I welcome those aspects of the proposals which extend the information available to consumers, who are entitled to full information on the food they purchase.</P>
        <P>My Department has a particular interest in the issues of country of origin labelling and substantial transformation &mdash; Members will be familiar with the latter from previous debates -<b> </b>which come within the remit of this proposal.  In 2007, my Department submitted to the European Commission draft national legislation that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultrymeat, sheepmeat and food products containing more than 70% of these meats.  In the past year, the Department has been in extensive communication with the Commission with a view to justifying and pressing the case for this proposed legislation.</P>
        <P>However, the Commission adopted a negative opinion in regard to our proposal on the grounds that it was not consistent with the European Union labelling directive.  The Commission&rsquo;s main contention is that only harmonised rules with Union-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.  This negative opinion was formally adopted at a meeting of the European Union Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in December 2008.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As part of the process of examining this proposal, my Department, together with the Department of Health and Children, has sought the use of compulsory country of origin labelling for all meats.  The proposal states that where the country of origin, as displayed on the label, is different from the country of birth, rearing or slaughter, each country must be displayed on the label.  At present, compulsory origin labelling applies only to beef and some poultry products.  However, we have received little or no support for this view from other member states other than Italy.  The latter has been single-minded in its approach and has subsequently got into trouble.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, has been in discussion recently with his British counterpart as there appears to be indications of a change in the United Kingdom position on origin labelling.</P>
        <P>The issue of substantial transformation is closely linked to the country of origin issue.  Substantial transformation is a concept used in the customs area to determine the origin of goods for the application of taxes and duties.  Origin is determined as the last place where a significant process was performed on the goods.  This has allowed some operators to carry out relatively simple processes such as adding breadcrumbs to chicken and declaring the finished product as originating in the member state where the last process took place.  This can mislead consumers <Col N="575"/>as to the true origin of raw materials.  Compulsory country of origin labelling would give full information to consumers.  Ireland will, therefore, continue to seek to have compulsory origin labelling included in the new labelling regulations.  We are also seeking a clearer definition of the term &ldquo;substantial transformation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the other issues that form part of this proposed legislation.  As I said at the outset, the Department of Health and Children, being the lead Department, has been representing Ireland&rsquo;s views on these matters.  However, I will advise Members of Ireland&rsquo;s position on the other issues involved.  The national scheme proposal allows for the development of national schemes aimed at ensuring the application of additional forms and presentation of nutritional declarations.  Ireland shares the concerns of a significant number of other member states with regard to these schemes.  Our justification for this position is that the provision for such schemes may undermine the proposal&rsquo;s objectives of consistency and harmonisation.  It is also possible that the schemes will create a barrier to intra-Union trade, with different member states having different information requirements.  The extent of our export dependency makes this a serious consideration.  Our view is that the provision for such schemes will increase the burden on business as it may be necessary for food business operators to produce different labels for different markets.  In addition, the existence of several different schemes may confuse the consumer, making it somewhat counterproductive.</P>
        <P>While Ireland welcomes the proposal on allergen labelling, we have indicated our support for suggestions from other member states that the allergen &ldquo;be written in characters that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the text by the font colour or style&rdquo;.  It is important to ensure that allergen information, which may be essential to certain consumers, is highlighted in such a way as to ensure it is not overlooked.</P>
        <P>In regard to alcohol labelling, Ireland considers that all alcohol products should be treated equally.  It is important to ensure that the proposal does not result in any anti-competitive outcomes.  Ireland also believes that consideration should be given to bringing alcohol products into the scope of the legislation.  Our reasoning for this is that the report of the Irish strategic task force on alcohol  in 2004 recommended that the consumer information on labels of alcohol products should contain information on the calorie content and the ingredients of the product.</P>
        <P>A Commission informal discussion paper on the EU strategy on alcohol, prepared in March 2006, recommends that information be provided to consumers on ingredients and caloric value of alcoholic beverages.  Ireland considers that consumers of alcohol products should be as well-informed regarding nutrients, ingredients etc. as consumers of any other product.</P>
        <P>In regard to mandatory nutrition labelling, Ireland supports the retention of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on the use of &ldquo;per portion&rdquo; expression as an alternative to the &ldquo;per 100 ml/100g&rdquo; expression in certain cases.  With such an expression, Ireland considers that the number of portions per package must be specified and that standard definitions of portion sizes should be developed where required.  Our rationale for this support is that there is substantial Irish consumer support for the use of &ldquo;per portion&rdquo; expression.  Many consumers find &ldquo;per portion&rdquo; expression easier to comprehend.  For single portion products or for products containing multiple portions, for example, chewing gum, the &ldquo;per portion&rdquo; expression is more meaningful.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not support the proposal for a minimum font size of 3 mm for display of mandatory particulars.  Ireland suggests that other aids to legibility, such as contrasting background, be explored.  Account has been taken of Ireland&rsquo;s position and those of other member states and the latest working group meeting on 26 January included a suggestion of a minimum font size of 1.2 mm.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P>Ireland shares the concerns of some other member states regarding possible flaws in the calculation of reference intakes.  It agrees that EFSA should play a role in developing correct reference intakes.  Our justification for this position is that incorrect inputs will lead to the consumer being misled.</P>
        <P>In regard to significant amounts, this part of the proposal deals with the voluntary nutritional declarations and the definition of the phrase &ldquo;significant amounts&rdquo;.  Ireland believes that a lower &ldquo;significant amount&rdquo;, possibly 10%, should be stipulated for foods and beverages with low contents of dried matter, for example, milk, fruits and vegetables.  Our reasoning for this point of view is that the existing value of 15% of the recommended dairy amount does not consider some natural sources of nutrients.  For example, the calcium content of cow&rsquo;s milk is 14.7%.  In addition, recent evidence in Ireland suggests that fortification of foods, aimed at reaching the 15% mark, may lead to excessive intakes of certain micronutrients, for example, folic acid.</P>
        <P>For foods with large water content, the comparison with other foods is inconsistent.  Ireland believes that as well as the energy value, fats, saturates, carbohydrates with specific reference to sugars and salt, the amounts of trans fats, fibre, folic acid, calcium, iron and vitamin D<b> </b>should be included in the mandatory nutrition declaration.  We believe that the inclusion of these additional nutrients will help to provide a more complete picture of the composition of the foodstuff.  Specifically, trans fats should be included as they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and may be used as a substitute for saturated fats, thus misleading the consumer.  Fibre should be included as surveys indicate there is an inadequate intake of this nutrient across Europe.  Folic acid should be included as it is critical for a healthy pregnancy.  Calcium, iron and vitamin D should be included as there is an inadequate intake of these micronutrients across Europe.</P>
        <P>I understand that small industries will be provided with an extension to the implementation time for this proposal when it is adopted.  An Oireachtas joint committee has sought an exemption to some of the proposals for artisan producers.  The Department of Health and Children has indicated that further analysis is needed on this issue before a final position can be taken by Ireland.  However it pointed out that it would be difficult to justify a case for this sector on the basis of health grounds.</P>
        <P>In regard to the traffic light system of labelling, I also understand that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland will conduct a consumer review, mainly targeted at the traffic light system of labelling as against the use of guideline daily amounts, GDAs, and it hopes to commence this early this year.  Discussions on these proposals are still ongoing among working groups in Brussels.</P>
        <P>I hope I have outlined the main points of the proposal and I look forward to hearing Members&rsquo; responses to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  He has a deep personal interest in this proposal and in the area of food production and food quality.  It is opportune to have this discussion in the Seanad in light of the recent crisis in the pork industry.  Apropos same, the Minister of State&rsquo;s role in dealing with the difficulties was much appreciated by everybody involved in the food sector.  He took a personal interest in the matter.  </P>
        <P>Arising from that crisis and the enormous burden that will now have to be placed on the Irish taxpayer, it makes this debate more relevant and imposes on us the obligation to ensure we bring this type of policy to fruition and, in so far as possible, make substantial progress on <Col N="577"/>the country of origin labelling issue.  I recognise, as the Minister of State said, that the matter is basically in the hands of the Department of Health and Children but, in regard to food production and food labelling, the argument could be made that the role of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be stronger.  I would prefer if the case was being led by the Minister of State and his Department rather than by the Minister for Health and Children and her Department.  It would bring a greater degree of relevance to our efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>I recognise what the Minister of State said about the efforts that have been made since 2007 to progress the country of origin labelling issue. He, his officials and our representatives in Brussels have been attempting to make progress on addressing it.  However, we must note, with disappointment, the lack of progress made on the matter and ask him and his colleagues to redouble their efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>On the European stage, the Irish agricultural industry has always traded on the quality of our product.  The Taoiseach outlined in the other House this afternoon certain responses to the economic crisis.  We all recognise that jobs are being lost and that our economy is under huge pressure.  We must ensure that native industries such as agriculture, which have always plugged the gap, remain very much centre stage in terms of keeping people in employment and job creation down the line.  One of the big problems faced by Irish agriculture, from production and profit perspectives, has been the substantial increase in recent years of imported foodstuffs of a questionable nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have won the debate in relation to food quality and everybody now rightly demands the highest quality of food produced in the most hygienic fashion possible.  However, on the other side of the equation, unfortunately, food imports of dubious quality from outside the Union into member states of the Union, including Ireland, are seriously threatening the place of top quality Irish food on the supermarket shelves of Europe.  The Minister of State mentioned the bizarre concept of substantial transformation in that respect, which must be addressed.  As the Minister of State said, there is no justification for a producer, by putting breadcrumbs on an Irish chicken product, being able to have it relabelled as Irish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>If it was Irish, we would be happy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State understands the point I am making concerning foreign chicken products being rebranded as Irish.  The consumer is being fooled and Irish producers are being shortchanged and their future livelihoods are being damaged.  The Minister of State and his colleagues must redouble their efforts in addressing this issue.  I appreciate that Europe has been rejecting our efforts.  I find it difficult to understand how there can be any block on the efforts made by the Minister of State and his colleagues to have clear country of origin labelling introduced in the European Union where, apparently, food quality is at the top of the agenda.  During the pig meat crisis, which will cost up to &euro;200 million or more, we saw how labelling in the pork sector, although it complies with current regulations, simply does not work to the same extent as labelling in the beef sector.  If a better type of identification system or labelling had been in place in the pork sector, most of the Irish pork industry would have been unaffected by the crisis last December.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is probably aware, because his ministerial colleagues were present at the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that one of the strong issues that ran through all seven or eight meetings convened was that we must look at the labelling and identification issue from a pig producer&rsquo;s perspective.  One hopes that such action, if put in place, will ensure the December 2008 crisis will not be repeated.</P><Col N="578"/>
        <P Just="Left">Concerning food labelling, I urge the Minister of State to strengthen our argument at EU level for country of origin labelling.  I know I am pressing an open door on this issue.  The European and Irish consumer would then know exactly where food is being produced.  It is unforgivable that such a scheme is not in place.  It is extremely disappointing that our EU colleagues are not acceding to our requests.  I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department, rather than the Department of Health and Children, will take charge of this debate in so far as it can.  From 2007 until now there have been many European Council meetings.  Many opportunities may have been lost.  We must redouble our efforts in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also mentioned nutritional labelling.  This issue is centre stage as far as the average Irish citizen is concerned.  Ten, 15 or 20 years ago, people did not concern themselves with the nutritional side of things as much as perhaps they should have.  That situation has been reversed and now most people are very much aware of the importance of nutrition and of the different nutritional values of various foodstuffs.  That is why it is important we press for nutritional labelling, of a kind that is clear, transparent and, most important, understandable.  The Minister of State referred to labels that overflow with information to such an extent that people cannot understand the information that should be their due.  Documents before us from the joint committee also refer to this.  I hope we can have straightforward, realistic and accurate nutritional labelling on all foodstuffs in order that our consumers understand exactly what is in the product.  People are much more concerned today than heretofore about diet and lifestyle.  Nutrition plays a significant role in that equation.  As legislators, we have a duty to ensure foodstuffs, especially Irish foodstuffs, of which we are so proud, have a clear labelling system that allows the consumer to know what he or she is consuming, and the nutritional benefit of same.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred briefly to small producers.  Wearing his hat of responsibility for food, he has taken an interest in the organic sector, food markets and small markets.  I am sure many of the people he meets on his trips to the different parts of Ireland may be concerned that some of these proposals might impinge too strongly on them.  It is commonplace in Ireland that we look for regulations but not that they be applied to us.  We all want regulations on labelling, country of origin and nutrition but then we see sectors where this may not seem to be applicable or suitable.  I know the position of Europe on this issue but am cognisant that many small producers who produce in limited numbers play a very positive role in developing Irish food and markets for Irish food.  They create a certain brand image for Irish food.  Their individual businesses may be small but, collectively, they are part of a very fine jigsaw of Irish food production.  We must try to be as flexible as we can to ensure administrative challenges or difficulties placed on these small producers are not too severe a burden.  It is a question of trying to strike the right balance.  With the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency background and his personal interest in this area, I am sure he will work to ensure that balance will be struck.</P>
        <P>This debate, following as it does the report of the joint committee, is worthwhile.  It shows how decisions made in Europe can be discussed in the Oireachtas.  One hopes we can bring some small degree of influence to bear.  My concluding plea to the Minister of State is to ask him to work seriously on the issue of food and country of origin labelling in order that Irish food, undoubtedly the best food in the world, can be stamped with the Irish flag.  Any consumer, whether in Dublin or Dubai, when he or she sees the Irish brand on the food product, will then know it is a genuinely produced piece of Irish food worthy of the name of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  In welcoming the Minister of State to the House, I commend him personally, his Department and the Department of Health and Children, in so far as it is responsible for food safety, on the work they are doing to ensure <Col N="579"/>the quality of food the consumer gets in Ireland is first class.  I take a leaf from Senator Bradford&rsquo;s book.  He mentioned that it might be a useful exercise to examine whether we should have the duplication of agencies which deal with this matter.  I, too, would feel more reassured if the agrifood sector were to deal with all aspects of our food promotion and ensure health standards.  Clearly, it is in the interests of farmers, producers and the Department that everything should be first class in that respect.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed to learn from the Minister of State that other European countries do not share our view on the importance of having clear labelling, especially relating to country of origin.  It is a compliment to us, as a food producing nation, that we have the confidence to ask for clear labelling of country of origin.  We are proud of what we have achieved over recent decades in building the image of Ireland as a producer of high quality foods.  Perhaps some of our European counterparts are not quite so proud and may have something to fear from such labelling.  Am I reading too much into it?</P>
        <P>The question of labelling is very important to the consumer from the point of view of health.  Thanks be to God we have left behind the stage where there was a shortage of food in this country.  Nobody should be hungry now in Ireland.  It is the quality of the food and how healthy it is that concern us now.  Labelling will clearly assist the housewife, the purchaser and the consumer in that regard.  It is also very important for the economy of the country because we must continue to build on the image of Ireland we have created before the world.  It is a considerable participatory element of our total economy and our well-being.  We are going through difficult times today.  How lucky we are to have such a high profile in the food sector.  It is even important in terms of tourism.  Many people who come to Ireland think about our green food image as well as about our green scenery.  They look forward to eating natural, uncontaminated Irish products.</P>
        <P>The recent pig meat scare obviously gave a new focus to the matter.  People were shocked to find that one of the most staple foods in Ireland, whether as the Sunday morning fry or as Pat Shortt&rsquo;s breakfast roll, was suspect and under a cloud.  Our bacon is central to our diet.  I commend the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, on the way in which they dealt with that situation.  They were upfront with no going behind closed doors.  The way it was dealt with was one of the major success stories of this Government and I commend the Minister of State on it.</P>
        <P>Modern consumers are becoming more demanding and they are correct and entitled to this.  When they purchase something they want to know the primary ingredients and any additional ones.  They want to know the nutritional content, including the fat and salt levels and whether there are added vitamins and minerals.  The day is gone when one ordered one&rsquo;s vegetables and other food from the local grocer, took what one got and never thought about it unless it repeated on one in some way.  Now one must be satisfied before one purchases.</P>
        <P>The question of the country of origin is central to this proposed new regulation.  Apart from our economy, it is helpful to a consumer to know from what country food emanates.  Knowing where it comes from will help consumers make informed judgements on what is in the package.  We all probably have preconceived notions and images of other countries but we are entitled to these.  If I am concerned, for instance, about hygiene levels in food production, certain countries might appeal to me more than others.  One could be aware of how animals are treated in other nations, humanely or otherwise, and that would inform my decision on whether I would purchase a product from there.  Consumers can also take into account the carbon footprint involved in such manufacture.  We are all different in our priorities but the country of origin is useful information.</P><Col N="580"/>
        <P>Irish farmers have nothing to fear from labelling.  The other nations, which seem to be reluctant to come on board with this regulation, obviously have something to fear or hide.  We have all seen spurious Irish products which may have one Irish ingredient, or the final Irish ingredient, enabling the other 90% that is sourced outside to be labelled as Irish, and the Minister of State referred to this.  These products are often packed in misleading packages with the Ring of Kerry or the Cliffs of Moher on the front.  For all we know they could come from Brazil.  Some of the multinationals are guilty of this.  It is clear to people and is well known that much of the bacon sold here as Irish may have been sliced, vacuum packed or frozen in Ireland but is not Irish bacon.  There was real irony during the pig meat crisis when some of these operators, which had been very anxious to claim Irish status for their product, were very anxious, when Irish pig meat came under a cloud, to tell us their product was not Irish, only packed in Ireland, and therefore safe to eat.  One cannot have it both ways.  In the selling business, point of sale is very important and the Irish handle is a major plus there.  We must commend the various State agencies such as Bord Bia, the National Dairy Council, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and all which were involved in that down through the years.</P>
        <P>As Senator Bradford said, the Minister of State has been very involved and at the front of promoting the country markets and small artisan producers, and this has been a great success.  However some people cheat there also.  Will this proposed regulation prevent a person calling a product organic when it is anything but?  Will it stop the person who comes into a small town with so-called &ldquo;home produced&rdquo; vegetables or fruit when they are anything but?  It is impossible to police small operations, and we do not want to police them but support and promote them because they play a major role in Ireland&rsquo;s food image.  However I would like to know whether we can use this regulation to do that.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has outlined his views on font size and such matters.  I have no intention of going into such detail, except to say common sense is always very important and we must be flexible.  The standard must be met but it is very difficult for a small producer to compete on labelling with the multinationals which produce thousands of times the output.  In his speech the Minister of State mentioned giving more time to small producers to up the ante and prepare themselves, and I support that.</P>
        <P>If one buys a product in Lidl or Aldi there will be some English on the packet but there will also be three to six other languages.  It is almost impossible to read it and one needs to make a study of it.  Should the language of the country in which the product is sold, whether English or Irish, not be more prominent on the packaging than, for example, German, in the case of those products?  Can we extend this to support restaurateurs who clearly identify the source of their meats?  Could this regulation be used there?</P>
        <P>Last weekend I was in a restaurant, the Horseshoe Bar, in my town of Listowel.  I had a fine steak and asked the proprietor how&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not advertising properties in Listowel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach will always be welcome there.  I told the proprietor that was a great steak and asked him where it came from.  He said his brother reared it, his other brother killed it, and he gave me the abattoir number, and he sells it.  That is fantastic.  A few restaurants in Dublin do something similar and I wonder if we can promote that.  How would one label a pint of draught beer?  Is that possible and do we want to examine it?  I commend the Minister of State.  This is very important.  This is a good discussion to have because all this fine talk in Europe is often a grey area but we out in our country are teasing <Col N="581"/>out some of its parameters.  I commend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on its work.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus roimh an de&aacute;-obair at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l aige leis an post nua at&aacute; aige mar Minister of State with responsibility for food.  T&aacute;im an-sh&aacute;sta seans a bheith agam c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; mar gheall air.  Maidir leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in, this week I spoke to my lamb producer and he is allowing one of the lambs to grow into mutton, as I have said here many times before.  That will be killed by his brother and delivered to me exactly like that.  I make this point because I was the only person in Leinster House who opposed aspects of the Abattoirs Act.  I said it would destroy local butcher&rsquo;s shops, and it did.  They are coming back again, but it sickens me to walk into a butcher&rsquo;s shop and see a butcher taking meat out a plastic wrapping, something we never saw before 1991.  It has made traceability even more impossible because before that one always bought one&rsquo;s meat locally, it grew on the grass locally and one went only to butchers who could provide that.  Recently I was in a Chinese restaurant in Portumna and was delighted to see on every page of the menu that all the meat was locally sourced, with names of the suppliers available at the desk.  That is very important.</P>
        <P>I have real difficulty with the Minister of State&rsquo;s argumentation on the question of national schemes of labelling.  There is a tiny town in the middle of England, just off the A1 near Grantham.  It would have been in the constituency of the former Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.  It would not be any bigger than Dingle.</P>

	<P>It is called Melton Mowbray, which is famous the world over for pork pies.  Melton Mowbray pork pies are like Dover sole or Dublin Bay prawns.  It is a brand.  However, pork pies were being made and sold by Tesco and by all the big distributors as Melton Mowbray pork pies, even though they never saw Melton Mowbray.  The people of this small town got together and took a case to Europe.  They made the case that the pie was special because it was made without a frame &mdash; it stood on its own two feet, if Senators know what I mean &mdash; and contained various ingredients.  They won the case in Europe and now the Melton Mowbray name can be used only by agreement with them.  The Minister of State can check it out.</P>
        <P>This weekend I was in a restaurant and I had a bottle of Italian wine.  On the label, rather than the <i>appellation d&rsquo;origine contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e</i>, as one gets in France, or the <i>denominazione di origine controllata</i>, as is used in Italy, there was a new classification.  I wrote it down, and I am sorry I did not bring it with me as I had forgotten we were to have this debate today.  It was labelled as a wine typical of a particular region.  I have been following developments in Italy over the last number of years, and this is a new idea which is quite different from other classifications.  Why do I say that?  I mentioned Dover sole and Dublin Bay prawns a while ago, and I might add Limerick ham to that.  They are three examples of brands that have been lost to a particular area.  Limerick ham has nothing to do with Limerick, Dublin Bay prawns have nothing whatever to do with Dublin Bay any more, and Dover sole has now been redefined as any sole more than 16 oz. in weight.  We should try to get back Limerick ham and Dublin Bay prawns, along with foods such as drisheen and other black puddings from various areas of Ireland, the Kerry mutton pie, and queenie scallops, which I have never seen anywhere except around the Irish Sea.  These are foods we should be protecting, but it is not happening.</P><Col N="582"/>

        <P>This week &mdash; I ask the Minister of State to contradict me if I am wrong, but I am almost certain of this &mdash; country-of-origin labelling legislation came into operation in the USA.  It was introduced on Tuesday of this week or last week.  Why was this done?  To hear the argument, one could have been listening to an Irish farmer or to somebody from the IFA.  The argument is that a particular food could have been raised in South America, but somebody washes it in the USA and it is then branded as having come from the USA.  One of the big closures last month, after Waterford Crystal and Dell, was a turkey factory in Monaghan.  This was painted as another victim of the recession.  However, it was no victim of the recession but a victim of the lack of country-of-origin labelling.  It was put to the sword by cheaper imported meat.  This is exactly the problem with Brazilian meat.  The difficulty is that these pieces of turkey or other meat are coming from countries where food safety legislation does not match our own, water quality is not up to our standards, labour standards are unacceptable from the point of view of Irish agreements, pesticides are not controlled, and growth promoters are still being used.  We should be doing something about this.  If the Minister of State did nothing else, he should foster a sense of pride in our own food.  We should be able to say that something came from Listowel or Balbriggan or Castlebar or anywhere else and it is ours.  People locally should get together to do that.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a butcher in the midlands last year about this &mdash; in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s constituency, although not in his town.  His butcher&rsquo;s shop was adjoining a well-known hotel.  I asked him whether he got much business from the hotel.  I asked the question casually, but he was on his guard because he recognised me and he was wondering whether I was setting him up to send in the taxman.  It turned out he was doing fine business with the hotel, because he had the best meat.  However, it then transpired that the food officers, probably from the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department, discovered he was supplying the hotel and clamped down.  Why?  It was very simple and logical, but totally daft.  He was selling it to the hotel, and the hotel was selling it on to you and me when we came in as customers, which made him a wholesaler.  Thus, he no longer had to comply with the regulations pertaining to retail sales &mdash; which I agree with &mdash; but with the regulations for wholesalers.  This point was raised by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan earlier.  He had to comply with the regulations applying to big wholesalers, even though all he was doing was supplying the hotel next door.</P>
        <P>I asked the same man a question about abattoirs.  He has an abattoir of his own because his brother is a butcher somewhere else.  He tried to get the four or five butchers in the town to agree to build an abattoir, and he got the support of two local vets.  However, they could not get agreement as they did not trust each other.  That has probably already happened in Kerry, but it happens everywhere apparently.  Consequently, they are still bringing the products into town.</P>
        <P>I could go on at length about this.  I do not think it should happen.  I wrote to the Department a year ago, and I am not sure whether the position has changed.  The question of whether a person is a wholesaler or a retailer is determined by us, not by Europe.  It is determined on the basis of the amount sold in the course of a month or a year.  Our threshold is so low that my man supplying the hotel immediately qualified as a wholesaler.  Up in Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s <Col N="583"/>constituency, along the Border, hotels can be supplied not by the butcher next door, who would have the same problem, but by a butcher over the Border, because he is not considered a wholesaler under UK legislation, which has a higher threshold.</P>
        <P>I can see the Cathaoirleach getting edgy and looking down at me.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed the Minister of State did not say something about those appalling stamps called &ldquo;best before&rdquo;.  They should be banned.  They are an absolute disgrace.  They cause war in my house, because somebody sees that the best before date on a product is two days ago or a month ago and they throw it out because they think it has something to do with health.  We need to be told that the best before date is an invention of the manufacturers.  The &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date is a different thing, which indicates that a product would be dangerous to use after a certain date.  I would prefer to hear only if a product would be dangerous if used after a certain date.  Best before dates are a marketing ploy which result in much wastage of food and money.  Food is dumped out of supermarkets and taken off shelves unnecessarily on a Friday or Saturday evening.  The only people who gain are some charitable organisations that hand out food.</P>
        <P>I must finish here even though I have a lot more to say.  We offer the Minister every support in anything he does to support local foodstuffs and producers as well as local development and processing.  He should give these high-profile support and ensure we can all participate.  I would certainly travel to any place in this country to help any group in this regard.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am delighted to be here as it is my first time to speak while the Minister is in the House.</P>
        <P>The aim of this proposal is to modernise and improve EU food legislation rules so that consumers have all the vital information they need to make an informed choice when they are buying.  It also attempts to ensure that all consumers have similar information across all the EU member states.</P>
        <P>We must update two directives in labelling legislation: Directive 2000/13/EC, which deals with general labelling, for example, lists of ingredients and use-by date, and Directive 90/496/EEC, which deals with nutrition labelling on food.  At present, nutrition labelling is usually optional.  The issue of food labelling is very complicated.  There are conflicting demands and views from different interest groups.  To implement these changes in Ireland, it will be necessary to add this new regulation into Irish law by way of statutory instrument.</P>
        <P>Consumer rights have risen in importance.  Labelling can allow food manufacturers to pass on to consumers essential information about products, such as use-by dates and safety warnings.  This clearly serves the interests of both manufacturers and consumers.  Manufacturers of good quality foods can display the benefits of their products when compared to those of their competitors.  However, it is clear that consumers must also exercise personal responsibility.  They will need proper information about what they eat and drink and this proposal will help them in that regard.  I support the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, and wish him well.  He is doing an excellent job with his portfolio.  I am from the era when, if we worked in the sugar fields and got hungry, we lit a fire and cooked the rashers and sausages on the spade or the fork.  When we went to the bog to cut turf, we also lit a fire to boil water for tea.  When we went to football or hurling matches, we brought bottles of tea with us.  In some cases people put the bottles in socks to bring them to the match.  If a biscuit or a sweet fell on the floor, one picked it up and ate it.  If one did not, somebody else would.</P><Col N="584"/>
        <P>Now, we are in the era of boil-in-the-bag and the microwave.  Sadly, due to the stringent controls imposed on restaurants, in many cases those establishments have also reverted to boil-in-the-bag and the microwave.  As I said in the debate on this matter in the scrutiny committee, I support food labelling.  I believe we should consider introducing labelling which states when a product is non-European.  When people travel to other countries and look at the labels on food, the country of origin will be stated on the label.  I agree with country-of-origin labelling.  However, some European countries are outside the EU but the consumer might not realise it.  If, throughout the EU, there was labelling for products from outside the EU, people would be more conscious of the EU product label.  It would be more obvious that it was an EU product than if a product was labelled as being from, for example, Poland, Lithuania or Greece.  This is an important issue.</P>
        <P>The stringent controls on some labelling are daft.  The Minister mentioned measurements in his speech.  The measurement terms with which I grew up were a cup, a spoon or a teaspoon.  Now, measurements are given in kilograms, calories and so forth.  It is a matter of educating the public on the type of measurement used.  If one can make the portion size uniform throughout Europe, rather than having different portion sizes for countries such as Ireland or Spain, it would be a welcome development.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned some interesting aspects of food labelling with regard to local issues.  There is a disadvantage for small producers.  I am in the restaurant business and it is difficult to use produce from local producers.  If, for example, the kitchen is not an adequate size, in many cases one cannot use fresh potatoes because of soil cross contamination.  One cannot use potatoes produced a mile up the road which are brought into the restaurant with the clay still on them and washed due to cross contamination but one can use potatoes that contain preservatives and additives but which only last two or three days after one opens the bag.  That is a disadvantage for local producers.  The same is true for producers of cabbage, carrots and so forth.</P>
        <P>This is an obstacle for some restaurants who wish to use local produce.  For some reason, the health board insists that the premises is not adequate because due to insufficient space, not enough sinks or some other reason there could be a problem with cross contamination.  I always thought soil would not damage anybody but it appears there are problems of cross contamination due to whatever micro-organisms are in the soil.  This issue should be examined.  Every help should be given to small producers.  Their produce should be used, whether that is in local markets in the town or in the local restaurants and bars.  It should be available to the local shopkeeper who wishes to sell those products.  How one goes about labelling the produce is another issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister outlined his position on food labelling.  It is a complicated issue, when one considers the nutritional values and so forth.  It is particularly complicated for a local, small producer if he must comply with the nutrient value requirements for the produce.  I wish the Minister well with this.  He means well and undoubtedly there is significant support for labelling.  However, as Senator Bradford said, we recently had a problem in the pork and bacon industry, despite the controls in place, including the stringent controls on restaurants, supermarkets and other outlets.  Logs had to be kept by restaurants, lorry drivers and wholesalers.  The whole thing fell apart at the finish.  Nobody knew where the controls were, and it all fell down.</P>
      
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well with regard to the Bill.  I agree with labelling.  The more information available to the public, the better informed they will be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to discuss this final proposal of the European Parliament and Council on the provision of food information to consumers.  Food is becoming an increasingly political issue.  As elected representatives, we are all aware of the kind of issues with which we have had to deal in recent years in regard to contamination scares, food labelling, genetic modification of food, which is becoming an increasingly political issue, organic food versus intensively produced food, locally produced food versus food which has travelled long distances, allergies that are clearly diet-related and animal welfare &mdash; the list goes on.  The Green Party has been always very strong on issues of food safety and security and we are very familiar with and concerned about these issues.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, whose brief includes responsibility for horticulture and food, on his activities in terms of raising awareness generally about those issues of food safety and food security which are increasingly of concern to ordinary consumers.  The Minister of State was even slightly subversive, if I could use that term, in his activities last year when he used the international year of the potato as an opportunity to send a potato-growing pack to every primary school to encourage young people to become interested in the origins of our food, food growing and food production.  There will be many spin-off benefits from this.  I hope we see these activities extended to post primary schools because many of our young people could do with a re-education, if one likes, on the importance of food and all the issues that surround its production.</P>
        <P>With regard to this final proposal of the European Parliament and Council on the provision of food information to consumers, the EU is obviously responding to the demand of consumers for more and better information on food labels and for clear, simple, comprehensive, standardised and authoritative information.  The EU&rsquo;s recent White Paper, &ldquo;A Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight, and Obesity related health issues&rdquo;, also stressed the need for consumers to have access to clear, consistent and evidence-based information.  The original labelling information we saw emerging from the EU, and the main political will that motivated it, was to provide rules for the labelling of foods as a tool for the free circulation of foods in the Community.  However, over time, the protection of consumers&rsquo; rights has emerged as a very specific objective of the European Community.</P>
        <P>The objectives of this final draft of the regulation are to modernise, simplify and clarify the current food labelling scene within the European Union.  Towards this end, the Commission launched an open consultation over the Internet from 13 March to 16 June 2006.  It received 175 responses, many of these from industries, but the specific issues which were highlighted in the consultation on the general issue of food labelling were as follows.  First, consumers find it difficult to read and understand food labels; second, there are a number of foods from which information on allergens is missing; third, country of origin labelling is a very problematic area, but one in which individual member states want to see the EU responding in a more robust way; and, finally, the legal limbo that concerns ingredient listing of alcohol beverages.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of nutrition labelling.  It was believed by the European Commission that the inclusion of nutrition information was an important source of information for the consumer, and this was reflected in the submissions received during the consultation process.  However, there was a difference of opinion among consumers, some requiring or preferring a comprehensive overview of the nutrient content of food while others had concerns regarding only the specific nutrient that was of concern to them.  However, many consumers and public health and non-governmental organisations wanted mandatory, full-nutrition labelling that was easy to understand.</P><Col N="586"/>
        <P>On the other hand, industry is obviously concerned by what it considers the possibly prescriptive nature of food labelling legislation and the effect it would have on the design of packaging.  It has been lobbying, therefore, for a more flexible, voluntary approach.  Member states, while aware of the need to reduce barriers in the Internal Market, which would be facilitated by a more harmonised approach to food labelling, are increasing pressure for increased flexibility at a national level, in particular where innovative nutrition labelling systems are being used.</P>
        <P>The proposal we are discussing in this debate seeks to update and modernise two main food labelling directives, Directive 2000/13/EC and Directive 90/496/EEC.  The issue of consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union has been considered by the Commission in regard to this proposal, and it believes it to be in line with the Commission&rsquo;s Better Regulation policy, the overall Lisbon strategy and the EU&rsquo;s sustainable development strategy.  The emphasis in the regulation, we are told, is on simplifying the regulatory process so as to reduce the administrative burden and to improve the competitiveness of the European food industry, while at the same time, and very importantly, ensuring the safety of food, maintaining a high level of public health protection and taking global aspects into consideration.</P>
        <P>When the proposal was being considered, a number of basic alternative approaches were considered by the Commission.  It considered the possibility of no intervention in the current EU legislative arrangements for food labelling.  It felt this would maintain the current situation of scattered legislation and possible negative effects.  For example, it was argued that current food labelling rules are piecemeal and confusing and that the proposal might place unjustified burdens on the food business because of outdated, redundant or unclear requirements.  In addition, it was felt that labelling has been rather ineffective to date in communicating to consumers and to adapting to changing markets and consumers&rsquo; legitimate demands.</P>
        <P>The issue of improving the situation through national legislation was considered but it was felt that different national rules would impede the Internal Market.  It was seen to have a possibility of distorting fair competition and increasing the administrative burden for industry, and being inconsistent in approach and, therefore, inconsistent in the content and availability of information, which would create confusion for consumers.</P>
        <P>On the specific features of the proposal, some are to be welcomed, although I would share some of the concerns referred to by the Minister of State in his opening address, particularly in regard to country of origin provisions.  It is to be welcomed that the legibility of the information provided on the labelling is to be improved, with a minimum print size for mandatory information being introduced.  In addition, the information on allergenic ingredients would be available for non-prepacked foods which are sold through retail and catering outlets.</P>
        <P>In regard to the issue of country of origin or place of provenance of the food, what we see in this proposal is that the legislation remains largely the same, which is disappointing because, in other words, such labelling is voluntary.  There is a proviso that if the failure to give such information might mislead the consumer, then the labelling becomes mandatory.  However, both the mandatory or voluntary indication of the country of origin or the place of provenance of the food as a marketing tool under this regulation should not deceive the consumer and will be based on the harmonised criteria.  Criteria have been also introduced for the declaration of country of origin or place of provenance of multi-ingredient products, the labelling of which has become more complex, and the country of origin or place of provenance of meat other than beef and veal, which is welcome.  The proposal also clarifies the conditions under which member states may adopt national rules on origin labelling.</P>
        <P>The rules on nutrition labelling have been recast, which is another positive element of the proposal.  The proposal makes nutrition labelling mandatory in the principal field of vision of <Col N="587"/>a food label.  A new aspect of the proposal on nutrition labelling is the mandatory declaration for energy, fat, saturates and carbohydrates, with specific reference to sugars and salts expressed as amounts per 100g, 100 ml, or per portion, in the principal field of vision, that is, on the front of the pack.  Nutrients from a defined list may be declared voluntarily.  In selecting the mandatory elements, account has been taken of research indicating that consumers can be somewhat overwhelmed by excessive information and the scientific advice concerning the nutrients bearing a relationship to the development of obesity and non-communicable diseases.  At the same time, the mandatory elements of the proposal try to avoid an excessive burden on food businesses, especially small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>I welcome the overall thrust of the proposal.  However, the measures dealing with mandatory country of origin labelling are disappointing.  Recently, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, at which Senator Paddy Burke and I were present, the Green Paper on agriculture products within the European Union was discussed.  The possibility of developing an EU food quality symbol was also discussed.  The Green Party and I could support this proposal if it were properly made.  Consumers are often overwhelmed by the presence of too much information on food labels.  However, a quality symbol can often act as shorthand and can provide reassurance to consumers that a certain food product meets a wide range of criteria.  We should support an EU-wide food quality symbol.  I support the general thrust of the regulation and look forward to the response of the Minister of State.</P>

I readily agree with the opening remarks of my fellow county man, Senator Paddy Burke.  He referred to what people in County Mayo were obliged to do in the bogs and the hay field.

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to hear it.  One aspect of the debate, to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole alluded, was the matter of small abattoirs and the ways they operated throughout the years.  They did much good work and still do, but the local authorities and the Department keep raising the bar and have nearly put them out of business.  It was very common in my part of the country to have three, four or five butchers in each town.  The butchers bought lambs and nice little heifers off the local farmers, killed them and presented them well.  We should remember that there was no salmonella nor any talk of it in those days.  Meat was advertised as fresh lamb or beef and it certainly was fresh because it was probably only hanging for a couple of days.  This was especially the case before the fair.  A good kill would have taken place because sales would be good on fair day.  Meat was purchased, put on the carrier of the bike and brought home.  It might have taken four or five hours to get to the homestead.</P>
        <P>I believe there is much to be said for the way in which meat was cooked.  At that time most food was boiled, which was a significant factor.  There were none of the modern bugs of which we hear at present.</P>
        <P>It has not been mentioned previously but I welcome the reference to farmers&rsquo; markets.  They do tremendous work in allowing the local producer to present his or her wares in local towns.  I realise the Minister of State is very much in favour of the concept of farmers&rsquo; markets for small producers.  I believe that where the markets are successful, inspectors should not be sent to regulate them excessively and put small producers out of business.  There have been many reports in this regard.</P><Col N="588"/>
        <P>The aim of the proposal is to modernise and improve EU food labelling rules.  It will allow consumers to have, in a legible and understandable manner, the essential information they need to make informed purchasing choices.  It attempts to ensure some uniformity in the presentation of this information throughout the 27 EU member states.  The report highlighted the issue of country of origin and a problem has arisen in this regard in recent years.  The problem involves meat or fish which have not been farm slaughtered or entirely prepared in Ireland but which can be labelled as Irish.  Understandably, people wish to buy Irish beef and expect the meat in the supermarket to hail from Ireland if the label indicates as much.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland produced a report in 2004 which was made public in 2006.  It uncovered many cases of foreign produce, such as pork, beef and salmon, being mis-labelled as Irish.  Several issues raised in the previous food safety authority report have improved greatly since its publication.  However, in a recent survey the authority selected at random 20 Irish honey products sourced from various manufacturers and retail outlets throughout the country.  Five were found to be non-Irish, four of which were labelled as Irish, and one of which bore a misleading label of origin.  This is terrible for the small producers of honey throughout the country who do a very good job and a great deal of work in producing a quality product to sell to consumers.  These are the genuine producers.  The statistic emerging from the report was startling.  I hope the statistics will be examined, that the people involved will be brought to heel, and that we can ensure anything bought which has an Irish label is of Irish origin.</P>
        <P>There is a tremendous market for honey at present.  It is advertised as good for people&rsquo;s health and people now put honey into many mixes, which differs from what was done some years ago.  The report also highlighted that mandatory country of origin information is required when its absence is likely to mislead.  However, a report carried out for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food consumer liaison panel indicated that 69% of consumers want specific country of origin information for all meat.  I wholly agree with this report.  In a country which produces so much fine beef, pork and chicken, it should be possible to guarantee that all Irish meat products of high quality are so labelled.</P>
        <P>When one considers that we must export 85% of our produce, it is imperative that our people are guaranteed that what they purchase is of Irish origin.  Some butchers still personally buy heifers or lambs and display in their shops the herd number, the name of the beast&rsquo;s owner and that the product is local.  This is to be welcomed and I believe Irish consumers are returning to such small butchers, instead of following the more recent practice of shopping in the major multiples.  While I hate mentioning any particular organisation by name, I saw packages of beef from Tesco recently on which it was noted that it had been purchased from a farm in County Offaly.  It also stocked some chicken that had been purchased from a farmer in County Roscommon.  Together with housewives and consumers, I welcome such developments, of which there should be far more.  In conclusion, I welcome the proposed measures and again thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the measure before the House today because I have raised this issue a number of times.  I am unsure whether anyone has addressed the second side of the labelling issue as most Members have stuck to the issue of food labelling.  I must take a contrary view to that expressed by Senator Burke to the effect he did not necessarily wish to know what food contained from a calorific point of view and so on, as I believe it to be central to a debate in this regard.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest sports taking place in Ireland at present is that of fad dieting.  A range of options can be pursued whereby some people eat only carbohydrates while others do not <Col N="589"/>eat them, some people partake only of celery soup, others try to score points from Weight Watchers or other variations on this theme.  All such options are easy when labelling is present but are extremely difficult when it is not.  If only for the convenience of those who are trying to participate in the sport of dieting, I welcome this move towards labelling that is more concise and precise than has been the case in the recent past.</P>
        <P>This proposal also pertains to a real problem, namely, obesity levels in Ireland.  Such levels have spurred many people, as obviously has the post-Christmas period as well, to consider what they eat and to try to get healthy options.  I am highly conscious that, for example, in some locations a healthy option sandwich used to be available that permitted one to know how many calories and how much salt, sugar and so on it contained.  For some reason, they now have disappeared from some outlets.  I challenge both the food and drink industries to develop more products.  I challenge restaurants, cafes and school cafes in particular to consider labelling what they produce and to be highly conscientious about providing at least one healthy option on their menus.  While one is not obliged to choose such an option, unless it is present one cannot do so.  Those people who, like me, constantly battle to do the best they can, need such options. I could make many points about lambs and the support provided by the French to their farmers in this regard.  For example, if one scans the label before one buying the product in France, it will display the picture of the farmer that produced the lamb or whatever.  More should be done to support farmers in Ireland.  The word I get back from sheep farmers is that there is a central buyer in Dublin and the product then goes back out to be processed.  Consequently, the support arising from being able to deal with the local butcher is no longer as strong as it once was.  This point has been already addressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  The pork crisis was a scandal in that although some companies were selling what they called Irish product, they were not doing so at all.  Use of terms such as &ldquo;packed in Ireland&rdquo; is not good enough and the proposed measure will address such issues.</P>
        <P>I wish to use the few minutes that remain to me to raise another aspect of this issue, which I have raised regularly in the Seanad.  I refer to the other side of the fad diet.  Everyone can look at and choose food and the major retailers in particular are very good at providing information on what our food contains.  However, the point that annoys me is that those involved in the drinks industry are not very good at providing information on what is in our drink.  For example, were I to go out for the night intending to drink wine, unless I had done my research I would not know whether one brand had more calories than another or whether white wine was worse than red.  This measure, which encompasses both food and drink, should enable me to make more informed decisions.</P>
        <P>In this context, I challenge the industry to come up with more ideas and, although I do not like mentioning particular brands, I must do so in order that Members get the idea.  In the case of Bulmers Light, the word &ldquo;light&rdquo; pertains to being light on calories.  However, in the case of Coors Light or Miller Lite, it pertains to being light on alcohol.  One must then ask what message consumers get because were they to glance rapidly at something, they would not know whether it was light in calories or in alcohol.  I would never think of this, unless I was in the mode I am in at present.  Alcohol industry producers, such as Guinness, should seek to create alternative lower calorie drinks and should market them as such.  In the case of soft<?oasys _jy ?>drinks, everyone knows whether a product is light, which in this case usually means light on calories.</P>
        <P>It is highly important for people to know what is in their food and drink and that the labelling is sufficiently substantial in every case to enable people to be sure of a product&rsquo;s contents.  While I do not know whether this measure will affect the cigarette industry, its products are consumables.  When I was a Member of the other House, I was a convener on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which carried out much research in respect of the tobacco industry. <Col N="590"/> Were people to realise what the average packet of cigarettes contained in respect of the number of carcinogens, the types of poisons and so on, they would not be as addicted to them.  The scare they would get from learning the packet&rsquo;s contents probably would overcome the strongly addictive substances contained therein.</P>
        <P>I advocate the idea of labelling, which would be to Ireland&rsquo;s advantage.  People here continually state that we have both grass-based animals and the best of everything.  I believe we can withstand the challenge of being tested in this regard.  People will buy the best product, which we believe we have, over the cheapest product if there is a difference in the quality.  The French were highly annoyed that we were selling our animals cheaply into France.  Because the product was good quality and Irish, French producers were being challenged.  From my perspective, if good quality Irish product is available, which is real and not merely packaged as being Irish, and if we can point to those who produced it, consumers will vote with their knives and forks.  I reiterate my other point, which is that restaurants and others involved in the food and drink industry should rise to the challenge of supplying the existing market for low-calorie healthy options.  Were I to market anything, it would be that which was marketed here tonight.</P>

	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to say a few words on this issue.  It is a most welcome development and I thank the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny for the publication of its report on the European Union proposal for a regulation on the provision of food information to consumers.  In the general interest of all consumers across the European Union, a regulation to modernise and improve EU food labelling rules would be highly welcome.  The issue of food labelling is highly complex, as there are varying and often conflicting demands and views from different interest groups.  There also is an increasing number of policy areas at EU level in which it is considered that labelling may have a role to play to help achieve their goals.</P>
        <P>This report examines a proposal from the European Commission which, if agreed, would change the EU food labelling rules that govern food-related information provided to consumers.  From the consumer&rsquo;s point of view, consumers may be interested in getting additional information which, while it may not be regarded as essential from a safety point of view, may be important to the consumer because of other concerns, such as health, concerns with regard to the sustainability of the production of the product and animal welfare concerns.  As with operators in the food industry, it must be remembered that there is no single profile of a consumer.  Rather, there are multiple consumers.</P>

	<P>I am delighted that the Minister has attended to take my Adjournment matter, which requests him to work with his Northern counterparts, the GAA and the northern federation for sport to develop a sport for peace concept.  I will give a prelude.  A football for peace project is ongoing in Israel and Palestine.  On the back of this, County Donegal and the rest of Ulster have run a football for peace programme, marketed on the same soccer concept.  It will be funded by the International Fund for Ireland for three years.  Catholic, Protestant, male, female, Northern and Southern children join mixed teams and play one another.  It is not a matter of a Catholic Northerner beating a Protestant Southerner.</P>
        <P>Last week, I became the vice president of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Sub-Committee on Youth and Sport.  One of my first works is to have the Turkish and Greek Cypriots join us for a weekend at some point.  When I contacted the Palestinian and Israeli ambassadors, they expressed interest in moving the soccer for peace concept forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a GAA function on Saturday night, someone told me that soccer for peace is not what should be considered in the Irish context.  I decided that I would put it to the Minister as a possible project.  This year sees 125 years of the GAA.  Given the history involved, namely, who was allowed to play and who would not have played anyway, I want to drive the idea of children who would normally play rugby playing with children who would normally play Gaelic football, be they female or male.  I want a project in which those who play hurling will play with those who naturally play hockey.  While the peace process has moved on at a political level with the Assembly in Stormont, it is difficult to get people to embrace one another because of the segregated nature of sport in the North.  This affects other aspects of life too, such as where one lives, what school one attends, where one shops, etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 125th anniversary of the GAA is as good a time as any to explore sport for peace.  This will probably be more challenging than soccer for peace because that is almost a worldwide phenomenon in which everybody has the same rules and the same understanding of those rules.  A project involving different sports might involve each having to learn the other&rsquo;s rules to play rugby one day and Gaelic football the next, or hockey one day and hurling the next, or having mixed rules.  It might sound far-fetched but more progress is achieved when people work together in sport and the arts.  This will be particularly true if we target the children most affected by the troubles.  I recently completed a report on how one teaches history in areas of recent conflict and one of the points found in research in the North is that some children are badly affected by conflict while others are not affected.  We should target those closest to the daily trauma and the peace walls and get them to know and put a face on the &ldquo;other&rdquo;.  As David Irvine once said in my presence, it does not matter whether one is Catholic or Protestant when one is at the 19th hole of the Malone golf club.  I am concerned that attempts to date have been political and do not catch the next generation and show them that there are no horns or tails on the other side.  Soccer for all continues, but the greater challenge is to get the GAA to meet rugby or hockey players and take down barriers.  While I understand the financial constraints, I float the idea because the 125th anniversary of the GAA might be the time to encourage an embrace rather than segregation in sport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for the opportunity to address the issues involved.</P><Col N="592"/>
        <P>It is widely accepted that the benefits of sport have far-reaching positive consequences for society as a whole.  Sport can transform lives, transcend borders and nationalities, bring people together, raise aspirations and build long and enduring friendships.  Apart from the obvious health benefits associated with sporting participation, it can be one of the most effective antidotes to many of the social ills and attitudes that exist today.  Values such as tolerance, self-discipline, team spirit and strength of character are demanded, practised and promoted.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that sport should be considered on an all-island basis and I am happy to say that there is already close North-South co-operation in this area.  The Irish Sports Council and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland have an excellent ongoing working relationship and engage in several joint initiatives, such as the code of ethics and good practice for children&rsquo;s sport and the biennial all-island sports development conference.  Many of the recognised national governing bodies of sport, including the GAA, also operate on an all-island basis.  A high level all-island planning group, which includes the chairperson and chief executive of each council, meets regularly to ensure consistency of policy and practice in sports development.  There is co-operation on such issues as research, development of high performance sport and anti-doping measures.  The group ensures that there is no duplication of effort in planning and support for governing bodies of sport and individual athletes.  The most recent meeting was held in Dublin in December 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national coaching and training centre has evolved into Coaching Ireland with an all-island remit and a clear focus to lead the development of coaching in Ireland.  The coaching strategy for Ireland, which was launched in 2008, was developed in partnership with the Irish Sports Council and Sport Northern Ireland.  The strategy was developed following an extensive consultation process with coaches, athletes, national governing bodies of sport and other relevant agencies.  I fully support the constructive and positive level of co-operation which exists between the Irish Sports Council and Sport Northern Ireland as well as the all-island national governing bodies, in their efforts to promote and develop the various sports throughout the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The North-South unit in my Department actively pursues opportunities to facilitate, strengthen and enhance North-South co-operation across the three sectors under my remit as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  The unit also monitors progress on specific initiatives or priority actions for North-South co-operation in the sectors in question.  In considering any such initiatives, the overriding principle has been that they should offer clear and tangible benefits, North and South.  The unit attends the various North-South co-ordinators&rsquo; meetings as convened by the Department of Foreign Affairs and also liaises closely with the North-South Ministerial Council on relevant areas of interest.  I attended a North-South Ministerial Council Plenary Meeting in Derry last month at which there was a wide-ranging discussion on areas of practical North-South co-operation.  Several meetings have also taken place in the past year between officials of my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to discuss sporting issues of mutual interest.</P>
        <P>I am very committed to pursuing continued North-South co-operation in the area of sport.  Sport has a unique place in our society and the potential benefits of sport merit such co-operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I value the Minister&rsquo;s answer but it emphasised North-South co-operation rather than sport for all.  Will the Minister go back to the agencies and explore the concept of tasting the other, non-traditional sport?  Everyone is happy in his or her little clique and will work within that clique, whether North-South or South-North, but the problem is to get them to move from their traditional comfortable base to the sport they would not usually <Col N="593"/>try.  These cliques are usually religion specific or divided by religious majorities.  The Minister says there must be a North-South value but it is possible to get to know the &ldquo;other&rdquo; through sport.  While we deal with ensuring that the rules are all together and that we have the same ethical codes, there is another challenge that has not been addressed yet and I would like to think that the Minister would examine that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, to the House.  I am glad he is here and thank him for coming in on such a bad night.</P>
        <P>Last week he announced that he would not provide sports capital grants in 2009.  This will affect many sporting and local community groups.  It is bad news not just for sports funding but for the building of sustainable communities.  Like many Senators, I am involved in my local GAA club and community organisation and know that the news has serious implications.  Last night in many meeting rooms of GAA clubs, soccer clubs, community and voluntary organisations across the country there was devastation at this news.  It may well have been flagged that Government was going to announce a freeze on the funding of the sports capital programme but animated discussions have taken place in many sporting groups.  I bet the Minister&rsquo;s office and the Department in Killarney have been inundated with calls from people asking where they should go now to help fund clubs and improve facilities.</P>
        <P>I am the first to accept that since its inception the sports capital programme has done great work across the country.  In some cases it was used wrongly and the Minister in question gave his own constituency preferential treatment and some clubs were left behind.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator need not worry.  I have been chairman of my own club for six years and secretary before that and know well the workings of the sports capital programme.  We were lucky to have Jim Collins in my club.  He knew the system backwards and could liaise with the Department in latter years because it was a tedious process and one needed people like him to do that.  It was a tedious process, and people like Jim Collins were needed to do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are now at a situation where the development of facilities has stopped.  In a November debate in the D&aacute;il, the Minister stated that money from the national lottery did not come to him, but rather to him via the Exchequer.  However, many clubs that obtained funding for their development projects had to put a sign up stating their projects were partly funded by the sports capital programme and the national lottery.  Writing in the <i>Evening Echo</i>, Dave Hannigan wrote that, &ldquo;It would be easy to summarise that this was an inevitable consequence of the ridiculously harsh economic climate.&rdquo;  He may be right, but why are we doing this now?  Why are we penalising voluntary sporting groups?  This is about the provision of facilities and the funding of sport, and the use of national lottery money.  Do we have to give a percentage of the earnings from the lottery to the sports capital programme and to the funding of sport?  When the national lottery was created, I believe the point of it was to provide funding for sport.</P>
        <P>The money that we provide for the development of sports facilities and community facilities during these difficult times would help many small builders to employ skilled labourers and others.  The lack of money on one level can help kick-start a local economy by providing jobs.  We have now told the people we have no money, so sport must suffer.  We should continue to provide funding for sport, especially for the development of community organisations.  Such development is important to create sustainable, meaningful communities.</P><Col N="594"/>
        <P>Senator Keaveney pointed out that sport binds people together.  It casts aside political, religious and other differences.  Sport is being killed as a consequence of last week&rsquo;s decision.  Clubs were promised by Deputies and Senators.  Can we guarantee those clubs that in 2010 they can come back and apply for funding if they begin their projects?  Under the current system, clubs cannot start until they get permission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a ministerial reply to a D&aacute;il question last November, it was claimed there were moneys outstanding from allocations between 2000 and 2008.  Will those moneys be paid out?  Can clubs that have not claimed for those moneys still receive them?  What plan do we have to assist clubs that need to upgrade or even build new facilities?  Are we redefining the purposes of the national lottery?  I would rather that the lottery funded sports facilities than sponsor &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; on TV3.  I mean that, even though I watch &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; on and off.  It is much better that we fund sport.  I heard the Minister on the radio this week when he congratulated Rory McIlroy on his great golfing victory.  We need to put our heads together and continue to fund sports facilities.  If we do not, we will go back to the era of poor facilities, something which our young people do not deserve.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  It is important that we have Cabinet members in here for matters on the Adjournment.  We need more Ministers like that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his comments.  Senators know that I always try to come into this House for my own debates.  I have come in on many occasions to deal with matters on the Adjournment concerning my Department, because I have great respect for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the benefits associated with sporting activities, the Government regards expenditure on sport as important for the social and economic development of the country.  These benefits arise in a wide range of areas including health and well being, social and cultural development, education, personal development, tourism and the economy.  The sports capital programme, which is part funded from the proceeds of the national lottery, is the primary means of granting Government support for the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It was a misunderstanding that the proceeds of the lottery go directly to my Department.  It goes to the Exchequer, and like any other Minister, I bid for the various programmes funded through my Department.</P>
        <P>Under the sports capital programme, my Department provides funding to voluntary sporting and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  More than 7,400 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocation in that time to more than &euro;725 million.  In 2008, more than &euro;50 million was allocated towards 685 separate sports facility and equipment projects.  The programme has significantly improved the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  The facilities funded range from the smallest clubs to national sports centres.  The aims and objectives of the programme are to foster an integrated and planned approach to the development of sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country; to assist voluntary and community organisations to develop high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and to encourage the multi-purpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
        <P>The programme has supported the provision or improvement of landmark national and regional stadia such as Thomond Park, home to European rugby champions, Munster, and Semple Stadium, the home of hurling for many.  These facilities provide a platform for our <Col N="595"/>most talented athletes to perform, which in turn inspires new generations of young people to aspire to match the sporting prowess of their heroes.  They are also an important support to our tourism industry as they draw visitors from around Britain, Europe and further afield, who come to Ireland to follow their teams in action.</P>
        <P>Each Member of the Oireachtas will be aware of the many benefits that derive from the programme in his or her locality.  They have no doubt witnessed the value of the programme in assisting local clubs in meeting the sporting needs of their areas.  In recent years, the programme has targeted clubs in areas of social disadvantage.  By doing this, the Government is supporting the provision of facilities where there may be little prospect of such facilities being provided by the communities acting alone.  These facilities provide an opportunity for participation in sport which leads to healthier lifestyles and a reduced likelihood of younger people drifting into anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is prudent, however, to pause and take stock on occasion, regardless of the merits of a programme.  It is essential to review areas of expenditure to determine whether schemes represent the optimal use of the resources available.  Accordingly, no decision has yet been made about the timing of further rounds of the programme.  My Department is currently finalising a five-year strategic plan to inform the future development of necessary sporting facilities throughout the country.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the requirement for sports facilities so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport, at either amateur or elite level.  The strategy is also examining the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact in the relevant areas.</P>
        <P>In the interim, it is business as usual for those that have been allocated grants under previous rounds of the programme, and there is obviously no question of rowing back on allocations already made.  The current position remains that &euro;56 million has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s vote in the 2009 Estimates to cover payments to be made from the C1 subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>When answering questions in the D&aacute;il last week, I felt I did not reveal anything new.  This position has been clear since the Estimates were published late last year.  I made my position clear at that time.  While we are in difficult times, we must recognise that more than 1,000 projects will be undertaken this year across the country.  The activity level under the sports capital programme this year will be as high as it always has been.  As I have said, no decision has been taken on when the programme will renew itself.  I am taking this opportunity to make sure that sporting facilities are fairly balanced in each region of the country.  I want to ensure there is a good base of facilities across each region.  That will inform our more strategic approach over the next five years, when we are deciding how to use the sports capital programme to continue to benefit all parts of the country.  As more than 7,500 projects have been already funded under the programme, it is fair to say it has been a huge success.  We have spent significant resources.  We need to consider what precisely we should be doing for the next five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I would like to comment on two issues.  I accept what the Minister has said about the need to review expenditure.  What funding mechanism will be put in place to assist clubs now?  The Minister did not respond to my remarks about clubs that have already started projects.  Can such clubs make applications at a later date?</P>
        <P>Second, there seems to be complete confusion about where national lottery money goes.  That needs to be clarified.  I am not clear on it.  Where does the national lottery money go?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="596"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to the Senator&rsquo;s two points.  Under the programme that is in place, projects have to receive approval before work can commence on them.  A substantial number of projects have been approved.  As they progress, invoices will be submitted and moneys will be paid in the normal way.  There has been no change in policy to allow construction to start on projects that have not been approved, in the expectation that funds will be provided thereafter.</P>

	<P>Any club that has proceeded with a project on the basis of a promise from somebody should know that, legally, that is impossible to do.  It is simply not possible.  The Comptroller and Auditor General examines these proposals.  The process that is in place in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is totally transparent.  Proper procedures are in place to deal with a range of areas.</P>
        <P>It always has been the case, under successive Governments, that the proceeds of the national lottery are sent to the central Exchequer.  That is not a new position &mdash; it has been the case since the inception of the lottery many years ago.  A proportion of the money that is allocated to sporting organisations can legitimately be said to come from funds directly associated with the national lottery.  It does not go from the national lottery to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism &mdash; it goes to the central Exchequer.  That has been always the case.</P>
