      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>My first duty today is a sad one.  I must announce to the House the death of our esteemed colleague, Senator Tony Kett.  His sudden and untimely death has shocked and saddened everyone.  Tony had been a Member of this House since 1997.  As a nominee of the Central Remedial Clinic, he successfully contested three Seanad elections on the Administrative Panel.  He entered politics formally in 1988 as a member of the then Dublin Corporation.  He worked for many years as an administrator in the Central Remedial Clinic.  His expertise and knowledge of issues relating to disability and education were greatly valued by his colleagues in the Seanad.  He made a huge contribution to Irish political life and the Houses of the Oireachtas in his role as a Senator.  During my terms as Assistant Whip and as Whip, Tony was totally reliable.  He was always there when he was needed, as the voting records of the Seanad will show.  Tony Kett was a good humoured, committed, sincere, low key and happy person.  He retained his sense of humour even during his long battle with ill-health.  The things that were important to Tony &mdash; his family, his commitment to public service, his work in the Central Remedial Clinic, politics, sport and his friends &mdash; were clear to see at this morning&rsquo;s funeral ceremony.  He will be sadly missed by his many friends in the Oireachtas.  His passing leaves a void that will be very hard to fill.  I extend my sincere sympathy to his family, particularly his wife, Noreen, his son, Jason, and his daughters, Jenifer and Joanne, on their sad loss.</P>

	<P>It was with much sadness and regret that we learned of the death of our dear friend and colleague, Senator Tony Kett, last Sunday.  Tony, who had been ill for a <Col N="2"/>short time, was a dedicated public servant.  While he never looked for any kind of recognition, he was undoubtedly deserving of it.  At local and national level, he gave long and dedicated service to his community, his county, his country and his party, Fianna F&aacute;il, which he served for over 40 years.  During Tony Kett&rsquo;s political career, he garnered many friends and admirers from all sides of the political spectrum.  His sad passing has been deeply felt by many people.</P>
        <P>Tony Kett was born in Ballinasloe, County Galway.  He was a long-standing member of the party.  He displayed astute political wisdom over the years.  He used his remarkable organisational skills to help his lifelong friend, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to establish the Dublin Central constituency organisation as one of the country&rsquo;s most effective political campaign units.  He will long be remembered as a brilliant political strategist and as an effective Senator and public representative.  He first entered public politics in 1988, when he was co-opted onto the then Dublin Corporation.  In 1997, he was elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the Administrative Panel.  He was re-elected at each subsequent Seanad election.  During his time in public office, Tony demonstrated considerable ability.  He was particularly committed to addressing the issues that affect the most disadvantaged sectors of our society.  He had a deep interest in and knowledge of disability issues and education policies.  That was his passion.  When he spoke in this House about matters like special needs education, Senators knew he was speaking from the heart.</P>
        <P>As the Cathaoirleach said, Tony Kett worked for many years as an administrator in the Central Remedial Clinic.  His practical experience and expertise in that area were greatly valued by many people.  Despite his illness and his declining health, he continued to work for those causes.  He attended the sittings of Seanad &Eacute;ireann right up until the Easter break.  He was a man of great courtesy and dignity.  To my knowledge, he never uttered a nasty word or comment about anyone, which is why he genuinely got on so well with so many people.  Tony Kett was a good and decent man.  On behalf of the House, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and on my own behalf, I wish to convey our sincere sympathy to Tony&rsquo;s wife, Noreen, his son, Jason, his daughters, Joanne and Jenifer, his daughter-in-law, Zoe, his granddaughter, Isabelle, his brothers, Eric and Shay, his sisters, Ann, Rose and Pat, his extended family and his many friends.  Go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael group in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I wish to pay tribute to the late Senator Tony Kett, who sadly passed away following a lengthy illness, which he fought with dignity and courage to the end.  To see a life cut so short is truly saddening and I know my colleagues will agree Tony was a most amiable and personable colleague in the House.  His election to the House on three consecutive occasions to the Administrative Panel speaks volumes about his popularity within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the high esteem in which he was held by his colleagues here.</P>
        <P>While hailing from Ballinasloe, County Galway, Senator Kett made a real and lasting impression on political campaigns in Dublin.  Having worked with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on all of his election campaigns, he replaced him on Dublin City Council and went on to be elected to the council in the 1999 local elections.  There is no doubt he played a major role in creating the formidable Fianna F&aacute;il campaign machine in Dublin Central.  As the Cathaoirleach said, he gave 40 years of service to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>
        <P>I also wish to acknowledge his huge contribution to the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, the work he did there and his interest in disability and special needs issues over the years.  I admired and respected the dedication and commitment he showed to the House.  Even when extremely ill, he turned up in the House to cast his vote and go about his business.  That dedication must be respected and acknowledged by every one of us.</P>

        <P>To his wife, Noreen, his son, Jason, his two daughters, Joanne and Jenifer, the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad and the wider Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I extend my sincere condolences on the loss of man described as a &ldquo;decent and hard working public representative&rdquo;.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>It is always a sad day when the Tricolour flies at half mast over Leinster House to signal the death of a sitting Member.  On this occasion, our expressions of sympathy are to the family of Senator Tony Kett who served in the House for ten years.  On behalf of the Independent Senators, I would like to be associated with the comments made by the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and the leader of the Opposition.  We recognise the public service he delivered during this political life and outside it.</P>
        <P>In my dealings with him long before he was elected, I always found him to be somebody who took a special interest in my previous work in education and particularly in special needs.  He was always open to suggestions and he always listened and tried to create an input when it was needed.  He brought a great passion for special education, children with special needs and the disadvantaged to his contribution to the House.  We will have occasion on another day to pay a more substantial tribute to him but I would like on behalf of the Independent Senators to express our condolences to his party and his colleagues and, in particular, to his wife, Noreen, his son, Jason and his daughters, Joanne and Jenifer.  May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I join others in conveying our deepest sympathy to the family of Senator Tony Kett, the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and the members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who served with him in the House over many years.  It is a sad day, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, when we mark the passing of one of our colleagues.  It was plain for all to see this morning at Senator Kett&rsquo;s funeral the widespread affection and admiration in which he was held by both his political family and the wider community.  I am very conscious of the huge contribution he made to the CRC and of his work in that area, which was most impressive.  It stands as a huge legacy of the man.</P>
        <P>I did not know Tony particularly well because I have been in this House for only a year and a half.  I can, however, attest to the fact that he was most friendly and courteous to someone with whom he had no particular reason to be friendly.  He always had a smile and a greeting for me and my colleagues and I will remember him for that.</P>
        <P>He bore his illness with considerable dignity and fortitude.  One could see that in his presence here as he continued to carry out his public duty as he had been used to do.  I convey the sympathy of the Labour Party group to the family and political colleagues of Senator Kett.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Green Party &mdash; An Comhaontas Glas I offer sincere sympathy to the family of Senator Tony Kett, his wife Noreen, his son and two daughters, and to his colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il group.  I note also his loss to the House.  Like Senator Alex White, as a Member of this Seanad only and given the nature of Senator Kett&rsquo;s illness in recent months, my meetings with him were infrequent and all too brief.  I was struck, however, by the cordiality he extended to every Member of the House and which I was privileged to receive.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s funeral service was very moving because it marked the nature of the man and the sum of his life, including a particularly cogent contribution from the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Our words of sympathy here will pale into insignificance when compared with Tony Kett&rsquo;s life which has been marked today and which others will mark.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>On another day there will be an opportunity for all Members to speak, but I call Senator Ann Ormonde because for the past 12 years she shared an office with Senator Kett.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand here today with a heavy heart.  I express my sincere sympathy first to Noreen and the family.  I shared an office with Tony for more than 12 years so not alone was he a colleague, he was also a great friend.  He was a man I trusted implicitly.  Whenever I had a problem I would go to him knowing that with sincerity he would give me the right answers.  In all my years in the office I never found that his advice was wrong.  That indicates how understanding and political he was and how he understood the political side of any situation.</P>
        <P>Tony had a great personality.  He was a great teaser, full of banter and laughs.  I recall being with him at many social gatherings when at the end of the evening Tony, who was a beautiful singer, would give his rendition of &ldquo;The Town I Loved So Well&rdquo;.  All those gathered would gravitate towards Tony who became a leader in his own right.  Everybody enjoyed his company.  He had a great rapport with people.</P>
        <P>He was also well-liked in Leinster House by all our colleagues and by the Deputies.  In the past year everybody was anxious to help him, and Senator Diarmuid Wilson and the Opposition Whips helped to facilitate him in any way they could.  He often spoke of that to me because he wanted to be in here at all costs and often struggled against himself to be here because he felt he might be putting pressure on the Whips at certain times.</P>
        <P>I must also point out that he was a great family man.  He was nature&rsquo;s gentleman.  He spoke so kindly and fondly of his wife, Noreen, and about the successes and achievements of his three children.  He gave me a running commentary about them daily.  He was very proud of them, particularly of the arrival in the past year of his granddaughter and first grandchild, Isabelle.  Every time he came into the office he would give me a blow by blow account of what his little granddaughter had done.  She was not saying any words, but she nearly was because he was putting every little idea into her head.  It was a pleasure to listen to him speak about her.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention Kathleen Redmond, his secretary.  She did a great deal for him.  She found nothing too hard when it came to doing something for Tony.  That is the epitome of the man.</P>
        <P>I want to make one further point.  While he was a member of the Dublin Central team and a great friend of the Taoiseach, Tony Kett was his own man.  That is why he was held in such regard by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
        <P>My thoughts are with his family at this time.  He has left lovely memories which we will all treasure.  I will miss him terribly.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>
