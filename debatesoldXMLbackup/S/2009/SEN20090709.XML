	<P>I have received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify his intentions regarding the provision of a new school building at Ballinkillen national school, County Carlow.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to halt cutbacks in the hours and services for home help recipients in County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The need for the Minister for the Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report on the measures undertaken and progress made by the Garda to locate almost 400 children who are missing from the care of the HSE; to indicate how many, if any, additional children have gone missing from the care of the HSE since 2006; and to comment on the effectiveness of the protocol that is now in place, as set out in response to my Adjournment matter of 16 June last.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an update on the number of inspections of privately rented accommodation carried out by local authorities; the amount of revenue raised from the fines issued and the success he has had in implementing new standards in the privately rented sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline Government policy on respite care services in Cherry Orchard Hospital, Dublin, in light of recent cutbacks which have seen this service extremely curtailed and disrupted.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and have selected the matters raised by Senators John Paul Phelan, Doherty and Corrigan, to be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Defamation Bill 2006 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1; No. 3, the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009 &mdash; all Stages, with Second Stage to start not before 2.30 p.m., spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes, all other Senators for ten minutes and Senators may share time by agreement of the House; and No. 4, motion re statement for information of voters on the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009, to be taken in conjunction with No. 3.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Our economy will continue to change over the summer and the effects of the difficulties will become more apparent, for example in the health and education sectors.  By the time we come back in September, Monaghan General Hospital will have closed, in effect, as an acute hospital.  The effects of increased class sizes in schools throughout this country will start to be evident.  The headlines in today&rsquo;s newspapers reflect the effects of the wanton violence of criminals in all parts of society.  There is an opportunity for the Seanad to contribute to the debate on how our society and economy are changing, but it needs to be structured properly.  We should be more proactive as regards what we do and make ourselves more relevant.  It is time to start planning in this regard so that we may be more effective on our return in September and see the effects of all of these changes.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader that when the Seanad resumes in September and Members request him to make inquiries on various issues to particular Ministers or Departments, a structure is put in place which provides for an official written reply to his or her query to be issued to each Senator, as opposed to the Leader just giving his opinion on it at the end of the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On Seanad business, perhaps the Leader might raise this issue with the Government Chief Whip.  Half our business today and much of it throughout the week has been the recommital on Report Stage of Seanad Bills that have been changed by the D&aacute;il.  There is nothing wrong with that, but on many occasions the changes made in the D&aacute;il relate to an issue that has already been raised in the Seanad, where a Minister will have acknowledged it needs to be dealt with, agreed to reflect on it and then changed it in the D&aacute;il instead of on Report Stage in the Seanad.  This means we are duplicating the business unnecessarily and I ask the Leader to look at this.</P>
        <P>Departments should be told that if an issue is raised on Committee Stage, the structure is to deal with that on Report Stage, not to say it will be dealt with in the other House and brought back to the Seanad again, where the entire procedure has to be replicated.</P>
        <P>An unseemly row has broken out between the head of the HSE and the Archbishop of Dublin on Crumlin hospital.  We often hear that doctors differ and patients die, but this is akin to the third secret of Fatima as regards who is telling the truth in relation to what is going on in Crumlin.  I am completely confused by it.  Parents with children in that hospital do not know the explanation.  Professor Drumm is telling us that there is no need for surgery theatres to be cut back, while at the same time Archbishop Martin, who is chairman of the Crumlin hospital board, is saying this is the only choice.  Another member of the board says the board has nothing to with such matters which are executive decisions.  We need to know the truth of the matter and we also need to be informed concerning certain governance issues there.  If State <Col N="995"/>money is being given to a hospital, there is no point in the HSE whinging afterwards as regards how the money has been spent.  It should know beforehand how it is going to be spent.  The business or work plan for the year should be approved before money is handed over.  This row would not arise if proper governance structures were in place.  From a political viewpoint we are dealing with a situation where the Department has handed over discretion for spending money to the HSE, the HSE has passed that discretion to the hospital board and taxpayers and politicians do not know how or why the money is being spent.  We need concrete knowledge and information about this.  It is fine that hospitals are autonomous and how they spend their money is their decision, but where taxpayers&rsquo; money is involved we need to know it is approved by our system.  There is a breakdown in communications and the approval system and it is an unacceptable way of doing business.</P>

	<P>Today the G8 countries are meeting in L&rsquo;Aquila in Italy.  Last week Archbishop Tutu and former President Mary Robinson wrote to the leaders asking them to set up a global fund for education.  At the weekend the Pope also wrote to them, speaking about education and calling it an indispensable condition for the working of democracy.  The Pope asked the G8 countries to reaffirm their commitment to development aid, something that was picked up by Sir Bob Geldof, who edited a special edition of <i>La Stampa</i>, the Italian newspaper at the weekend.  He called on Prime Minister Berlusconi to explain himself for Italy&rsquo;s failure to match its commitments.  Mr. Berlusconi said he was sorry, accepted that Italy had not met its commitments and reaffirmed that it would, within the next three years.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to extend an invitation to Sir Bob Geldof to make a case in the Seanad as to why Ireland should reaffirm its commitment to meet its targets for development aid by 2012.</P>
        <P>Yesterday we heard that the report of an bord snip nua is back from the printers and ready to be discussed by Ministers.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, from the Leader&rsquo;s constituency, made a very strong and compelling case as to why that report should be released and published as soon as possible.  I agree with her and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;-believe we need to see this report.  We have many calls from all sides of the House for parties to engage in meaningful discussions about these proposals and we need to see them.  If we do not see them we all know what will happen.  This Government leaks worse than a national aquatic centre.  Some journalists are going to receive off the record briefings, while others, who do not, will pretend they have.  This will lead to uncertainty, businesses will retrench and not make decisions on investment, which will mean more job losses.  We need to see the publication of this report.  I ask the Leader to row in behind his constituency colleague&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Easy on now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Over a number of weeks many Senators have expressed their concern as regards the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  In recent days we have had first-hand accounts of how serious that situation is.  Young people in particular are suffering because of lack of medicines and there is no food or proper housing.  It is quite clear, based on the responses coming from Israeli sources that there will be no breakthrough in the immediate future.</P><Col N="996"/>
        <P>If would be a pity to embark on the summer recess before making our position clear, particularly on the humanitarian situation.  I ask the Leader to consider the possibility of an all-party motion so that we may call for a generous response to ensure that what is happening and the suffering being inflicted stops.  It is right for this House to take such an initiative.  I believe it would be welcomed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, because he has been so good, strong and focused on this issue, as acknowledged by many commentators.  The Leader might consider a discussion in the Seanad to bring about an all-party motion, because I believe that would be a great help.  As well as that, we must keep this issue at the top of the agenda.  There is always a danger that it might be sidelined by other issues.  If that happens, it will mean that we just help to prolong the suffering of innocent people.  In this day and age, particularly where there is so much international co-operation, that is not acceptable any more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an issue I again want to raise, which the Leader has not addressed.  It was ultimately a question for the Minister for Finance, namely, the appointment last September of Arthur Cox solicitors as advisers to the Minister and Department of Finance as regards the bank guarantee scheme.  This was done without tender and there was a certain urgency, which was the justification provided by the Minister at the time.  Now they are being retained in that capacity to advise on NAMA.</P>
        <P>I also pointed out in the House that they are legal advisers to Bank of Ireland and they were recently appointed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, in relation to NAMA.  There are conflicts of interest here.  There are, at least, five or six major law firms in this city that have the same capacity as Arthur Cox.  This is the type of Fianna F&aacute;il cronyism which has destroyed the economy.  There are issues here of compliance with EU public procurement rules, but conflict of interest and cronyism appears to be the crucial issue.  This same legal firm is advising developers.  Developers are moving their business to Arthur Cox because they believe they have the inside track on NAMA.  This is a very unsatisfactory situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Finance is coming to the House tomorrow.  I ask the Leader to address this very important question to him, as it smacks of the type of Fianna F&aacute;il cronyism that has brought the economy to the perilous state it is in today.</P>

	<P>There will be more on this.  This is not finished.  It is a very serious allegation.  It is not a question of cronyism but of quality of service to the State.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for a discussion before the end of our term here on the developments in agriculture?  The Minister made widespread announcements last night, some on investment in farming.  I am very concerned about the termination of the applications for REPS 4 at close of business, 5.30 p.m. today.  It has major implications for those on REPS 3 who are finishing in 2010 and could have changed to REPS 4 last May but were advised otherwise by many in this and the other House.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned about this situation.  It has major implications, including on the second Lisbon treaty referendum on 2 October.  Such moves that affect European payments directly to farmers have a major impact.  We have spent &euro;3 billion since 1994 on REPS.  It has been a very beneficial investment in rural Ireland.  It has made a significant difference and has given employment to people in rural Ireland since 1994.  I appreciate the constraints under which the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, is working and he is doing a very good job, from an agricultural constituency, in a Government that is not totally agriculturally oriented &mdash; I am not referring to the Fianna F&aacute;il side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Senator Leyden inform the House what the last Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto said about that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister, Deputy Smith, to come into the House and outline the situation so we can have a debate on this matter before the end of the term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to inquire into why the Department of Transport has not revoked any haulage licence over the past two years, despite the fact that 14,000 infringements have been drawn to its attention by the British and Irish policing bodies.  The British say they have drawn attention to 8,000 offences in the past year and no licence has been revoked.  The offences to which I refer are breaches of driving hours, driving overloaded vehicles and failing road-worthiness tests.  Apparently the Irish Road Haulage Association is concerned because when it spoke to the Department of Transport, it said it had not revoked any licences because it believes there is a constitutional problem about doing so.  If that is so, it is in the hands of the Minister to do something about it.</P>
        <P>If road haulage vehicles are being driven in breach of legislation and creating offences in Britain and Ireland, it makes a mockery of our legislation.  It makes a mockery in that the British drew to our attention 8,000 offences and we did nothing about it, and, apparently, we <Col N="998"/>have no plans to do anything about it in the immediate future.  I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister for Transport this situation and to please return with an answer on whether something is being done about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In calling for a debate on gangland crime, today we got the best example in our newspapers of the need for the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>If this Bill had been enacted some years ago more lives might have been saved.  I understand that those who defend civil liberties would have anxieties and there are questions, but in extraordinary times one must take extraordinary measures.  The introduction of this Bill has terrorised those criminal gangs.  It is hard to credit how they perceive themselves.  Perhaps they see themselves as some modern day OK Corrall-type, Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday figures, but they are despised by the people, they are feared by their neighbours and they are company with which no decent people would want to be seen.  What we are doing will serve the State well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no solid debate in the House on the impact of the reintroduction of third level fees.  This will seriously affect students, parents who will have to pay, the third level sector and the future of our country.  Yesterday, outside the gates of Leinster House, the Union of Students in Ireland, which brought out this pack, asked me to personally give it to the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, because he has refused to engage with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators may not display documents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to give this pack to the Minister on my behalf and especially to ask him to engage with the Union of Students in Ireland because the students are the key stakeholders &mdash; they are adults.  We need to have a debate on this matter, but I do not know that we will have it before the summer recess.  This must be prioritised for our first week back in September.</P>
        <P>It is unforgivable on a number of fronts that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is again not engaging with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  The first point is the loss of jobs in the pharmacy industry.  The Minister seeks 34% income cuts from pharmacies.  If the 1,100 pharmacies pull out by 1 August it will mean a loss of 5,000 of the 16,000 jobs in the pharmacy industry.  This is not the way to go at this time.  It will risk patient safety.  If we must return to central dispensing it will threaten drug dispensing.  Drugs not properly dispensed are poisons.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, to engage immediately with the pharmaceutical industry.  She failed last time.  Maybe she is a little vindictive on this, but this is not the way to go.  We need to be more conciliatory in our approach and listen to those who can come up with the cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Healy Eames on that.  The Leader gave us a pledge last week that the Minister, Deputy Harney, would come in here before the end of the session.  It was not a water-tight pledge because we do not get those in this House, but it was an aspiration that she would come in, and I ask that she do so before next Wednesday.  She is away this week, but it is important that is done.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to address the issue of Arthur Cox, which was raised by Senator Regan, with whom I agree.  The first victim of this will be Senator Regan because I doubt he will ever be briefed by Arthur Cox again after what he said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>There should be no interruption across the floor, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Regan put his finger on a problem.  It is not necessarily specific to these solicitors, but the House might address it at some stage.  On the same type of issue, I am astonished at the number of times PricewaterhouseCoopers comes up in the banking issue.  It is banker to the Bank of Ireland.  It received an audit fee of &euro;15 million from the Bank of Ireland a couple of years ago, which is a phenomenal leverage to have on a bank.  It is being appointed to various consultancy briefs by the Government, particularly looking into the banks here.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is obvious that all these legal and accountancy firms are deeply conflicted on the issue of banking here.  The defence is that we are a small country and only very few accountancy and solicitors firms have the calibre, clout, ability and resources to investigate or to serve on an issue of this sort.  The solution may be as follows.  I do not believe in Chinese walls so it is not fair to say they separate their structures.  I do not believe that ever happens in Ireland or elsewhere.  We ought to look to companies, firms and service providers that are independent.  We ought to look to those with no axe to grind.  We ought to look to people and companies outside the State who are truly independent if we want this to be done.  Otherwise as Senator Regan implies, these people will be proven at some stage in the future to have conflicts.  Then there will be question marks over not just the banks but also those sent in as independent arbiters.  They will be questioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This issue was raised yesterday by Senators Donohoe, Hanafin, Callely and Glynn, and I raised it on 23 June.  It is the constant refusal by our banks to give support in credit terms to business, especially small indigenous business.  Every time the issue is raised the Leader&rsquo;s response is that we will invite the Minister to the House to discuss it.  Again yesterday that was the response he gave to our four colleagues who raised the issue.  Invariably the Minister who comes is the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who disappointingly is becoming increasingly glib and dismissive of the issue.  His response the last time was to say that a review is being carried out of bank lending practice and the results will be available soon.</P>
        <P>While that review is going on we are losing almost 2,000 jobs a day.  Given that his family is heavily involved in business, the Leader must surely know that this is a major issue.  I spoke to a businessperson last week who is heavily indebted to one particular bank.  He is a developer.  He sought to start a business in one of his developments and planned employing 25 people.  He received 320 applications for those 25 jobs.  When he went back to the bank, which was screaming for a cash flow from him, with his business proposal, it refused him the credit to begin the business.</P>
        <P>The taxpayers have given a major transfusion to our banking system and yet the very life-giving blood that business needs is not forthcoming.  It is a major issue that does not seem to be addressed in any serious way in this House.  As Senator Twomey said earlier, this is the forum in which we could find out exactly what is happening within our banking system. <Col N="1000"/> Appointing directors to these banks is not the solution.  Their sole fiduciary duty is to the entity &mdash; the bank &mdash; and not to Irish business or the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in asking for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the pharmacy issue.  I am once again in receipt of very detailed e-mails quoting facts and figures from pharmacies, principally small pharmacies throughout the country.  I have no sympathy for the international chains.  The Minister is partly responsible, through legislation, for introducing a two-tier system in pharmacy as well as in medicine.  What about the pharmacies in rural areas and in working class suburbs?  The countryside is already largely deprived of post offices, buses and pubs.  Now the chemists may fizzle out.  We need to review the issue.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill will come to this House next week, which will be absolutely useless because no amendments will be taken.  In the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders by the Invincibles at the end of the 19th century, an attempt was made in Britain to introduce just such a law and the Lord Chief Justice, Baron Pallas, said that any attempt to impose upon the duty of trying crime without juries would impair confidence in justice.</P>
        <P>I listened to the news this morning.  In a case in Limerick, Gary Campion has just been sentenced.  This was adduced as evidence to show why this Bill is necessary.  It is completely the reverse.  Mr. Campion was rightly convicted by a jury in Limerick.  We are talking about getting rid of juries.  This is a fundamental strike at human rights.  We really need to discuss it properly.  Everyone is opposed to this kind of criminal warfare.  Those involved are a real blot on society and people rightly despise them.  They hold people up to terror, but we must use a surgical approach to them.  There is no point in using hysteria as a cloak for diminishing human rights.  Let us have a proper debate and not have all these irrelevancies.</P>

	<P>I strongly support Senator Cannon&rsquo;s remarks.  I m sure that, like me, Members of this House are approached every day by business people complaining about the banks.  The banks are not discharging their responsibility.  It is as simple as that.  We, as parliamentarians, cannot stand idly by and watch this happen.  The lifeblood of this country in terms of commercial activity is ebbing away before us and we need to do something about it.  If we need to come back into this House and stay until 8.20 a.m., as we did when we were giving the banks a shot in the arm, that is what we will do if we need to reverse what we did.  Someone must be accountable, not for what is happening but for what is not happening, which is that the business people who create jobs and give employment are not getting the support of the banking system.  It is as simple as that.  There is no point in coming in here, hiding our light under a bushel and pretending it is not happening because it is happening.  The banks have no regard to their responsibilities, which they are not discharging.  If we need to sit on another day, which could be Monday or Sunday, it does not matter.  Let us do it and discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to establish what we are going to do about it because something must be done.  What is taking place is an absolute disgrace.</P>

	<P>Some very useful suggestions have been made this morning, first by Senator Twomey about written answers to questions, a matter on which I have campaigned in the past and in which I know every Senator is interested.  We should have a facility in Parliament whereby Senators can receive written answers to questions put to Ministers.  In the absence of that, I fully endorse what Senator Twomey has said.  Perhaps when we come back in the autumn, the Leader through his parliamentary assistant and by reference to the Official Report can have these matters properly processed, reviewed and dealt with.  It would be of great assistance to every Member of this House.</P><Col N="1001"/>
        <P>I am sure the Leader is very much aware of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s very useful suggestion.  Ministers often say they will amend a Bill in the other House when it could be done on Report Stage in this House.</P>
        <P>I agree with what has been said that nothing is happening with banking following recapitalisation.  The banks are waiting for NAMA.  We will need to discuss that matter further with Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about pharmacies, which are vital to our towns.  They are small operators who are being squeezed.  We know what is going on with the discounts.  What he said about the big operators is quite right.  I have no time for them either.  However, we all have a vested interest in protecting the streets of our towns.  The pharmacy is vital in all those locations and we need to do something about that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I echo the words of Senator Coghlan and again call on the Leader to ensure we have a debate on the pharmacy issue with the Minister for Health and Children next week.  I believe he has already promised this and I would like him to confirm it.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s call for an all-party motion to be adopted in this House on the need for humanitarian relief to get through to the beleaguered people of Gaza who have been suffering so badly since their bombardment by Israel earlier this year.  Yesterday, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I along with others had the privilege of meeting Derek Graham, one of the people from the Free Gaza Movement who was detained by the Israeli authorities when the ship on which he and Mair&eacute;ad Corrigan Maguire were travelling was detained.  That ship was trying to bring humanitarian supplies through to Gaza.  Derek Graham&rsquo;s account of the dreadful conditions in which people are living in Gaza made chilling hearing.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I promised him that we would do our best to try to ensure adoption of an all-party motion condemning the actions of Israel and Egypt in blocking humanitarian relief getting through to Gaza.  I urge the Leader to arrange for the adoption of such a motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a day that we will debate the blasphemy laws, it is nice to be able to agree for once, which I rarely do, with a Catholic priest, Fr. Willie Russell, who I note from an article on the front page of <i>The Irish Times,</i> is the local parish priest in Rathkeale in County Limerick.  He has been rather critical of people there who appear to be paying homage to or worshipping a tree stump which they believe depicts an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the fact that statistics show there has been an increase in the number of people smoking, that lung cancer is the biggest killer in Ireland, with 1,600 people dying from it each year and that 7,000 people are dying in Ireland each year from smoking-related illnesses, I welcome that the tobacco control legislation will be before the <Col N="1002"/>House next week.  It is a response to issues in this regard that were raised on the Order of Business on many occasions.  I draw the attention of the Leader to the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s concern that the penalties that will apply to minors for such offences will be diluted.  We should be <i>au fait</i> with the fact that minors have to be enticed to smoke to replace the 15 or 20 people who die every day in Ireland from smoking-related illnesses to ensure the smoking industry continues.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce stronger penalties for those who are caught importing contraband cigarettes.  Whatever about dealing with the retailers who are legitimately selling cigarettes to people over the age of 18, and they should be deterred from selling to those under 18 in the strongest possible manner, contraband cigarettes are being imported and very light penalties apply.  A recent television programme showed that a person who had imported approximately 200,000 contraband cigarettes was fined in the region of &euro;26 and the maximum penalty imposed on any of the offenders was &euro;200.  The penalties must fit the crime.  If we are serious about not only addressing cancer but also gangland crime, we must to tackle the illegal importation of cigarettes and alcohol.  I would like to think that early in the new Seanad year &mdash; I was going to say academic year &mdash; we would address the issue of alcohol abuse.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues who called for debates on two issues.  Senators Cannon and Coghlan raised an issue that was discussed on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business regarding the behaviour of banks.  We will be discussing this matter in the context of the legislation on National Assets Management Agency in September, but in response to what Senator Glynn said, I emphasise that the Parliament cannot afford to stand idly by but the Government did stand idly by when the agreement was made to recapitalise the banks.  If the Government had been aware of the dangers facing the small business sector, it would have agreed a stronger plan with those banks to ensure credit would flow during the period when they received &euro;6 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the pharmacy issue.  I seek clarification on two points in that respect.  The first is a statement by the Minister that the cost of supplying &euro;1 billion worth of drugs in Ireland is &euro;640 million.  Therefore, two thirds of the cost of supplying those drugs is absorbed in profit margins and the administrative costs of the various people involved.  That is an extraordinary figure.  We need clarification of that figure.  More to the point, the Government needs to clarify how it managed to get us into this situation, if it is true that the supply of drugs to people costs such a large amount of money.</P>
        <P>I have heard representatives of the pharmacy union spell out the cuts they are willing to impose, but I treat that with some scepticism.  I have rarely found turkeys who are willing to vote for Christmas, people who are willing to put in place their own cuts.  I want to hear a response from the Minister for Health and Children on the IPU&rsquo;s proposals.  If it is willing to come forward with proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I had the opportunity to meet the Sudanese Ambassador yesterday and good progress is being made, but our thoughts are with Sharon today and hopefully in the hours that follow we will have good news.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to clarify a matter in regard to the pharmacy issue.  We are a number of days away from a protest action being taken by pharmacists and we understand the Department of Health and Children and the HSE have a contingency plan for the supply of drugs.  I do not know what that plan is in my area.  I have not been given any briefing on it.  If any person contacts me about it, I cannot tell him or her anything about it.  I have been talking about the HSE for some time and now I am prepared to say publicly I have no faith in it to deliver any plan, service or contingency plan.  Many people do not understand the pharmacy issue.</P>

	<P>For those of us who understand the pharmacy issue, some arrangements are in place, which are the bedrock and foundation of the cost of medication in Ireland.  People should get a handle on that.  Dispensing costs are a different issue.  The two positions being put forward are contrary.  The IPU&rsquo;s position does not equate to the position being put forward by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  Equally, the position being put in regard to pharmacists going on strike and the HSE providing a contingency service cannot be sustained.  I ask the Leader to arrange a briefing for us on this matter without further delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support what Senator Hannigan had to say about the cuts in overseas development aid.  This is a topic to which we have returned on a number of occasions and to which we will need to return again.  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, urged the UN high level conference to recommit to the world&rsquo;s poor and stressed that between <Col N="1004"/>200,000 and 400,000 more children would die needlessly as a result of poverty in the current economic crisis.  However, it seems that the moral authority with which Irish Ministers can say such things is greatly lessened in circumstances where we have executed such swingeing cuts to our overseas aid budget.  I only hope that despite our economic crisis, there will continue to be an effort on the part of the Irish authorities to ensure we have the moral authority to make these statements on the international stage by undoing some of the damage we have done to our overseas aid budget.  It is worth noting that the number of people on the brink of starvation has reached a record high of 1.02 billion, one sixth of the world&rsquo;s population, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation.  This is a critical issue, regardless of the severity of our own financial crisis.</P>
        <P>I welcome what Senator Callely had to say and the article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> reporting from Reuters that the Goal volunteers Sharon Commins and Hilda Kuwuki are reported to be in good health and that they are likely to be released shortly.  Let us all hope that is so.  This must be a terribly stressful time for their families and loved ones and all those involved in trying to ensure their safe release are to be commended and supported in their efforts.</P>
        <P>I listened with care to what Senators Regan and Ross had to say about Arthur Cox.  I accept the credentials of both Senators and I understand that there is a need for transparent dealing and clear structures that prevent conflicts of interest.  Nonetheless, if I were a solicitor in a reputable legal firm I would not like it to be presumed that simply because my firm acted for more than one client there would automatically be corruption.  We need to believe in the possibility of professional integrity while also insisting on the fact that good fences will make good neighbours and good internal structures will ensure that one is not just depending on professional integrity but that one has the structures to prevent wrongdoing.</P>
        <P>I would imagine that there is more likely to be a danger of corruption in matters relating to finance and accountancy than legal advice because legal advisers will, I hope, generally advise their clients to the best of their ability while decisions will be taken elsewhere.</P>

Thankfully, <Col N="1005"/>the number of Bills being initiated in the House are on the increase.  When I first became a Member of this House years ago we were lucky if one or two Bills were initiated in the House in an entire year.

        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; proposed an all-party motion on humanitarian issues and the poor people of Gaza.  That was supported by Senator Bacik.  I fully support it too.  I urge group leaders to meet with me after the Order of Business this morning to put that process in place and to try to agree a motion and have it on the Order Paper before next Wednesday.  We will do anything we can to support those people in their plight.  I thank colleagues who have raised the matter on the Order of Business day after day for their serious interest and concern about the serious humanitarian challenges and difficulties being experienced by the people of Gaza.</P>
        <P>On the issues raised by Senators Regan, Leyden and Ross, the Minister will be in the House tomorrow and, as I indicated yesterday, their concerns should be taken directly to him.  He is an eminent lawyer also.  The Senators can bring those matters to his attention and have them teased out.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden brought to the attention of the House the challenges regarding developments in agriculture and the Minister&rsquo;s announcement last night on the deadline of 5.30 p.m. this evening for applications for REPS 4.  That is a serious challenge to the agricultural community.  I will bring the views of the Senator to the attention of the Minister later today.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn outlined to the House the challenges facing licensees in the haulage business.  He suggested that the legislation in this area may have to be amended.  The Minister for Transport will be present in the House when we discuss a Bill next Tuesday at 11.45 a.m.  Perhaps the Senator can bring the matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin and Norris referred to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill that will come before us for our consideration.  The Bill will be in the House all afternoon next Tuesday.  The Taoiseach will address the House next Tuesday on Northern Ireland from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.  At 3 p.m. the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in the House, all evening and all night, for that Bill which has come about urgently due to the serious challenge that faces society.  Every colleague in this House wants to see something done about crime and the challenges we face.  We look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s presence in the House on Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday evening.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames, Ross, Norris, Coghlan, Bacik, Donohoe and Callely all raised the issue of pharmacists.  They called on me again to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to update us on that issue.  I made that request but as Members are aware the Minister is out of the country this week.  I will endeavour to have the matter discussed next week before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames also raised third level education.  She asked that the Minister would come to the House to debate the matter.  I have no difficulty with that.  I have already acceded to having a debate on education at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senators Cannon, Glynn, Coghlan and Donohoe spoke of the challenges facing small and medium-sized family businesses and the failure of the banks to support them.  The availability of credit to these businesses, which is their lifeline, has been minimised &mdash; I am being generous &mdash; by the banks.  I ask colleagues to raise this issue with the Minister for Finance when in the House tomorrow.  This is possibly the most important issue before us prior to the recess.  We must ensure something is done in this regard.</P>
        <P>The banks have been recapitalised to the tune of &euro;6 billion by way of support from Government with the agreement of Members of both Houses.  I call on the banks supported by the taxpayer to continue to make available credit during the next three or four months to small <Col N="1007"/>and medium sized businesses.  I accept that the banks not covered by the guarantee are under no obligation to do so.  However, those Irish banks that have done well down through the years, for whom the past ten or 12 years have been good in terms of their shareholders, should play their part and support those who have been the backbone of our economy in the interest of the retention of 750 to 800 jobs in small and medium sized family businesses.  We are hearing at constituency level that the banks are not supporting people who have good credit ratings and have always met their obligations.  These people should be given priority in this their hour of need.  I support the call made by the four Senators mentioned and I call on them to raise this issue tomorrow with the Minister for Finance when he is in this House.  No time limit has been set in respect of the debate tomorrow to allow colleagues to tease out and make known their views.</P>
        <P>I will pass on Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s views to the Minister in regard to the illegal importation of cigarettes and alcohol.  While this is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if there is a need to update or amend our legislation to increase penalties in this area we should do so.  On the issue raised yesterday by Senator Callely, I passed on our support to the family of Sharon Commins who has, unfortunately, been kidnapped.  We hope and pray that this matter will be successfully concluded as early as possible.  I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Department officials well in their deliberations in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Hannigan and Mullen asked about overseas aid.  While I agree in the main with what they have said, I believe we have been exemplary as a small nation in terms of our contribution to overseas aid.  We are the sixth largest contributor per head of population in the world, which says a great deal about our commitment as a small nation to the Third World.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 103 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il and this is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.  Also, there are two amendments in the names of Senators Regan and Cummins to pages 26 and 27 of the Bill.  The Minister will explain by way of five groupings the 31 amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  Senators make speak once on each grouping.  With the <Col N="1008"/>agreement of the House, I propose to deal with Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendments under group 5 to which they are related.  Is that agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill was recently passed by the D&aacute;il.  It would be helpful if in respect of future amendments from the D&aacute;il Senators could be circulated with a background note setting out the reasons for the amendments and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A list of the amendments has been circulated.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I am making the point that it would be helpful if we could in future be given an information note in regard to the amendments.  Often, reading the D&aacute;il debate does not clarify the purpose of amendments.  I am merely suggesting that &mdash; I know the Clerk does not agree with this &mdash; it would be helpful if in future we were given a background note explaining the reasons for the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will set out the background to each amendment now.  Is it agreed that Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendments will be taken with group 5?  Agreed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il and the two amendments tabled by Senators Regan and Cummins.  I call on the Minister to speak on the subject matter of the amendments in group 1.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 31 amendments were proposed and accepted during Committee and Report Stages of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, including 30 Government amendments and one amendment from the Labour Party.  It was possible to incorporate the spirit of a number of amendments proposed by the Opposition.</P>
        <P>On group 1, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 concern the saver provisions and the insertion of a new review mechanism.  Amendment No. 1 deletes the original section 3(2) of the Bill dealing with the operation of law immediately before commencement of the Act and substitutes new text which provides improved clarity in the matter.  I have been advised it is important to ensure that current case law in regard to specific legal terms used in the Bill such as &ldquo;publication&rdquo;, would be carried forward.  The saver now proposed in section 3(2) seeks to achieve this.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 inserts a new section into the Bill to provide for a review mechanism to facilitate the assessment of the operation of the legislation.  A review will take place not later than five years after the enactment of the Bill.  Subsection 5(2) takes account of a proposal from Fine Gael that the review be completed within a particular timeframe.  The amendment will ensure that the review of the Act should be completed within one year of the commencement of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no observations but I support the review of the legislation so I agree with these amendments.</P>

	<P>Are we speaking on Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we are discussing the subject matter of the amendments in group 1 that were made in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1009"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments because it is important that there should be a review and if there is no timescale, it could go into limbo.  In light of the considerable debate, particularly when the Bill was before the House in its previous incarnation and a number of us on both sides tried to sabotage elements of it because we were concerned about the effect its operation would have on libel law and citizens&rsquo; rights, it is important that there should be a review within a specified time to ascertain if our fears were justified and to take into account case law.</P>
        <P>There was a celebrated case in recent times where an unfortunate man was murdered in a Dublin suburb and the newspapers got hold of a story, describing him as being trussed up like a pig, suggesting it was some kind of bizarre sexual experimentation.  The fact he was gay was bandied about the papers to the intense distress of his family.  No proper apology or recompense was made by certain sections of the press that published this to the distress of the family.  There is nothing in the law that gives the families in these circumstances any right to secure real retribution.  This sort of case should be reviewed when the law is being looked at again.</P>
        <P>It is very important, particularly when we are making significant changes, that we monitor implementation of legislation and its consequences so we can improve the legislation in the light of experience.  To hold the review within one year is a very good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a long debate on this Bill on a couple of occasions, first when it was aborted with the 2007 general election and then subsequently when it was reintroduced by the current Government.  Concerns were expressed in this regard and it is imperative that the review takes place within the five years.  It should happen as cases evolve.</P>
        <P>I was appalled, but not surprised, at the reaction of the newspaper group involved in the Leech case.  Instead of issuing an apology in the face of the severe findings of the jury in the case, it looked for changes in the defamation legislation so people could be deliberately defamed.  It was a disgrace and it brought home to me the need for the privacy legislation that was initially promised in tandem with this Bill.  It would be useful if the Minister would outline to the House when he intends to bring the privacy Bill before the Oireachtas.  The response of the newspaper in that regard did not meet the requirements and spirit of the debate we had on all sides.</P>
        <P>Within the last day there were significant breaches of privacy revealed in the neighbouring island by one of its major newspapers.  It breached the law by bugging people&rsquo;s telephones, including that of the Deputy Prime Minister.  We cannot allow the media to go unfettered.</P>
        <P>Much was made of the Press Council of Ireland by the industry itself.  Many of us argued strongly against this self-regulatory body with very few effective powers.  It is significant that the press council to date has had some of its findings disputed by some of the major newspapers.  That shows that self-regulation does not work.  I was critical at the time of its establishment that the Press Council is nominated and paid for by the industry.  It is absolutely compromised so privacy legislation is essential to protect people&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>I have great sympathy with the Dwyer family whose son was killed in Bolivia.  Through the intervention of Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, a number of us met the family.  To hear their tale of the intrusion of the press even before they were aware their son had been killed and subsequent to their becoming aware of it is appalling.  We must regulate this area to ensure people&rsquo;s privacy is protected.  Freedom of speech must be protected but the concoction of stories to support headlines is not good enough.</P>
        <P>We depend on editors in the newspaper industry to apply standards.  In many of the articles we see, the most defamatory comments are within the headline, while the article often bears no relation to it.  It is set to attract attention and sell newspapers.  That level of irresponsibility <Col N="1010"/>applies within an industry that is under pressure at present.  There is, however, a need for privacy legislation, particularly following the Leech case and the response to it, which displayed an arrogance and a total lack of respect for compliance with defamation regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see these amendments being made.  I would like to see a review within the next few years, particularly of areas such as defamation of the dead.  There are many cases where dead people have been defamed.  The family that has been left behind must cope with this and must deal with the often scurrilous articles in the media.  We could revisit that area when the Minister re-examines it within the next five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for my confusion earlier, I thought we were dealing with the Seanad Report Stage amendments first.</P>
        <P>I welcome amendments Nos. 1 and 2 made by the D&aacute;il providing for a review of the Act.  Given the level of controversy about the content of the Bill, particularly the insertion of amendments Nos. 29 and 30 that cover the offence of blasphemy, it is important if that offence is to be provided for &mdash; something I will oppose &mdash; that the legislation should be reviewed.  There is no need to insert those provisions into the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have the opportunity to debate them but I would like to say how bad an idea I think they are, particularly in light of the Supreme Court decision in the Corway case.  At the very least, a review is important.</P>
        <P>I also take on board the comments of other Senators about the need to review other aspects of the Bill, particularly the unjust operation in the past of the rule about the defamation of the dead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The review is to happen &ldquo;not later than&rdquo; five years, so it could take place after five months.  This is an area of law that evolves on a daily basis.  One of the reasons for the delay in passing this legislation since its publication is that things have changed not just on this island but also across the water.  Many judgments handed down in the UK have implications for our law.  I hazard a guess that we will be coming to review this legislation sooner than the time limit of five years.  A Fine Gael amendment specified that the review be completed in three months but we felt that was too short a period because of the requirement for consultation, thus, it is up to one year.</P>
        <P>The issue of defamation of a deceased person has been subject to much examination by me, my officials and others.  We have considered whether such provisions exist in other jurisdictions that have similar defamation laws to ours and we have not come across anything that would help us in that regard.  Section 39 allows for the survival of causes of action on death, but that obviously does not take care of the situation raised by Senators Norris and Walsh.  As I said in the D&aacute;il, this is a subject that needs to be revisited.</P>
        <P>Senators may recall that my immediate predecessor suggested that the Privacy Bill 2006, which is on the Order Paper in this House, be left aside for a period to allow the Press Council to become established.  At the launch of the annual report of the Press Council and the Office of the Press Ombudsman I indicated that I would progress that issue and spoke of the necessity of a period of consultation with the wider public.  There was consultation with the various interests on the Privacy Bill but I am always suspicious of such consultation; there should also be consultation with the wider community, particularly in an area such as this in which the wider public are not really interested until they or people in their families are affected.  To a <Col N="1011"/>certain extent there is a silent majority who would have a view, I have no doubt, if they were put in particular circumstances, as happened to the family in Clontarf mentioned by Senator Norris.  They feel helpless and that there is nowhere for them to go.  In that context we will commence the wider consultation process on the issue of privacy and then return to the Bill.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of defaming deceased people with the chairperson of the Press Council and the Office of the Press Ombudsman.  In the code of practice of the Press Council, principles Nos. 4 and 5 are of particular relevance.  Principle No. 4 sets out the standards to be met in respect of the right to protect one&rsquo;s good name, while Principle No. 5 sets out the standards for respecting the privacy of individuals.  Paragraph 5.3 sets out the standards to be adhered to with regard to situations of grief or shock and the respect to be afforded to grieving families.  My information is that the press ombudsman and Press Council are taking a proactive stance to ensure the print media adhere to those standards.  That will give some comfort to families such as those mentioned by Senators Walsh and Norris.  It is an issue we can return to, particularly in the context of a review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second group of amendments deals with verifying affidavits and the abolition of certain offences and covers amendments Nos. 3 to 11, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>These are drafting amendments, based on advice from the Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.  They propose to delete sections 7(1)(<i>b</i>) and 7(2)(<i>b</i>), which refer to the provision of further information by plaintiffs or defendants under sworn affidavits.  I am advised that retention of the provisions would require the addition of a detailed definition as to what constitutes further information.  The deletion of the references in question does not materially affect the provision of information between plaintiffs and defendants.  The text is also being amended on a technical basis to ensure correct reference is made to assertions or allegations.  Amendment No. 11 is a new section which abolishes any defence that might be pleaded in a libel or slander action under the common law immediately before the commencement of Part 2 of the Bill.  The amendment is consequential on amendment No. 1, which was referred to earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The third group of amendments deals with the abolition of certain offences, absolute and qualified privilege, apology and fair and reasonable publication, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 12 to 22, inclusive, and No. 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 15 are drafting amendments to correct the required reference to section 1 in sections 15 and 16.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are linked: amendment No. 13 provides absolute privilege for statements made in the course of proceedings during an arbitral tribunal where the statement is connected with those proceedings, while amendment No. 14 is a technical amendment consequential on amendment No. 13.  Amendment No. 16. is also technical and the effect is mainly to provide for two separate subsections making the text clearer.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 17, section 17(1) originally expanded the number of situations in which the defence of qualified privilege would fail.  However, following consultation with the Attorney General on the legal issues involved, I am advised it would be prudent to amend section 17(1) so as not to alter the existing law.  The revised position now reflects the existing position in law.  It makes loss of defence of qualified privilege solely dependent on proving that the defendant acted in malice.  Amendment No. 18 is a Labour Party amendment to section 22, which was accepted on Report Stage &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly, it was also a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment &mdash; and which is intended to encourage the making of an early <Col N="1012"/>apology.  This matter was debated at some length in this House during the debate on this section.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Amendment No. 19 provides for a new section in section 24 concerning fair and reasonable publication of a matter of public interest.  Subsection (4)(<i>a</i>) provided that the defendant be required to believe in the truth of the statement at the time of publication though it subsequently transpired to be false.  It was brought to my attention that this could hinder the reporting of stories which contain a number of conflicting opinions and that it appeared to conflict with the provisions of subsection (2)(1), which allowed for the extent to which the statement drew a distinction between suspicions, allegations and facts.  Having consulted further with the Office of the Attorney General on the matter, I came to the view that the provision in subsection (4) could add an additional bar to the Reynolds test developed originally by the UK courts.  The effect could be to make the defence of reasonable publication more difficult to prove.  Subsection (4) is now deleted.  The amendments essentially restate subsection (1) while relocating to it certain elements of subsection (4).  Amendments No. 22 is consequential on amendment No. 19, providing for the deletion of the former subsection (4).</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 20 is a drafting amendment regarding standards adhered to by members and non-members of the Press Council.  Section 24(2)(<i>f</i>) now applies to members of the Press Council, while the new paragraph 24(2)(<i>g</i>) applies to non-members.  Amendment No. 21 seeks to improve the drafting of subsection (2)(1) so that it refers clearly to attempts made and means used by the defendant to verify assertions and allegations made by the plaintiff in his or her statement.  Amendment No. 31 inserts a new paragraph in Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Bill to provide for qualified privilege with regard to defamation actions where the statement is required by statute to be made available for public inspection or publication.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a mixed bag and I welcome some of the amendments.  Amendment No. 18, as the Minister said, is intended to facilitate an early apology, because apologies are more effective the closer they are to the commission of the offence by publication.  However, the Minister knows well I am not a fan of the defence of fair and reasonable publication.  Much material appears in the press which is very dubious and the idea that it is published in good faith is questionable.  There is quite a lot of bad faith around and I am not convinced these amendments address it or the questions of public interest and benefit.</P>
        <P>This morning it was revealed by <i>The Guardian</i> that agents of Mr. Rupert Murdoch &mdash; that cancer on the face of the media &mdash; have managed to corrupt the British process almost entirely.  It has been drawn to the attention of the courts that agents of Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s news empire suborned third parties and paid them illegally to hack into e-mail systems and eavesdrop on telephone conversations, and did so in the interest of publishing scandalous material about people in the public eye.  It was done in the case of Mr. Prescott.  Apparently his private arrangements were displayed in public to the distress of him and his family.</P>
        <P>I am not certain there is any public interest in that at all.  Yet, as a result of that the case never really came to a conclusion.  I understand Mr. Murdoch and his agents bought the people off for millions of pounds.  Therefore, there was no ultimate judgment and the police collaborated in the suppression from the public of the commission of criminal offences by major newspapers in Britain and the invasion and violation of peoples&rsquo; privacy.  That is a very serious matter.</P>
        <P>Despite what the Minister said, I retain my reservations about the idea of fair and reasonable publication.  I do not like it and it is something we imported via the UK from the United States <Col N="1013"/>of America.  It is a matter I hope the Minister will review.  I understand there is no possibility of a vote on this issue, so once more I want to put my reservations on the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will regret the new defence of fair and reasonable publication, the introduction of which he is presiding over, and will also regret the strengthening of that defence, which is imported in his D&aacute;il amendment to the Bill.  The Minister has the reputation of being quite critical of the media and its abuse of its privilege and the position of trust it enjoys in our country.  That is understood, rightly or wrongly, to be part of the context for putting the Defamation Bill back on the agenda.</P>
        <P>When the defence of fair and reasonable publication was discussed in the Seanad on Committee and Report Stages, I shared Senator Norris&rsquo;s concerns about it.  At that time, I noted the Minster&rsquo;s predecessor, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said he was essentially philosophically opposed to the defence of fair and reasonable publication.  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said at the time that the defence of fair and reasonable publication, even though he was philosophically opposed to it, had to be introduced because it was the direction the courts were taking in their jurisprudence.  I understood it was the job of the Oireachtas to determine, subject to the provisions of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, what position the courts should take when dealing with certain matters by defining precisely what the law is and should be.</P>
        <P>If I was a citizen of Burma perhaps I would take a different view, but we live in a free society where the media enjoys a largely unfettered role in its analysis of and commentary on public affairs.  It is a role we have often seen abused.  The only agenda being served by the introduction of a defence of fair and reasonable publication is the agenda of those who do not ultimately respect fairness or prioritise sensationalism, the need to sell newspapers and the promotion of a culture of controversy above fairness.</P>
        <P>It is bad policy to provide that where a person defames another, he or she should enjoy a defence of fair and reasonable publication.  A defence of mistake, as well as all the other provisions contained in the Bill, might apply but not a defence of fair and reasonable publication, especially given the step the Minister has taken, that is, the elimination of the proviso concerning belief or otherwise in the truth of the statement.  It amounts to providing that a person may be in doubt as to the truth of what he or she is publishing because there are conflicting opinions, as the Minister has said, but he or she will go ahead with publication none the less.</P>
        <P>I respect the Minister and his views as reported in the media and agree with a lot of them.  However, he does a disservice to the cause of good journalism by including in this Bill a defence of fair and reasonable publication.  His predecessor said he was philosophically opposed to such a provision and I am not misquoting him.  The Minister should have gone one step further and eliminated it when he had the opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This new defence was discussed in great depth in the Seanad when the Bill was initiated.  I have not tabled an amendment or mentioned my opposition to the provision at this time, but I reiterate a point I made during the first debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  The jurisprudence in this area changed in the United Kingdom as a result of two cases, that is, Reynolds and Jameel.  They were very particular cases.  In the Jameel case the decision was spilt.  We are basing this defence on UK jurisprudence when the jurisprudence in Irish courts has not yet been decided.</P>
        <P>It is an error to legislate at this juncture on this area when matters are still before the Irish Supreme Court, and it would have been preferable to leave it to the courts to refine the law in this area rather than to legislate for a defence that is of a rather crude formulation.  We will <Col N="1014"/>have to see how it is interpreted by the courts, but it will give rise to a lot of litigation and will create many problems, not least for parliamentarians.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure these amendments do anything to safeguard the public from irresponsible journalism.  There are, as Senator Mullen said, many good journalists and it would be wrong to taint everyone with the same brush, as is the case for all professions.  However, there are irresponsible elements within the media who seem to be able to function unfettered.  Our duty is to ensure they cannot do so because the damage done to people&rsquo;s reputations and the psychological damage done may be enormous.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 17 states: &ldquo;In a defamation action, the defence of qualified privilege shall fail if, in relation to the publication of the statement in respect of which the action was brought, the plaintiff proves that the defendant acted with malice.&rdquo;  It is not always easy to do this.  In light of this requirement, when a defendant is found to have acted with malice the penalties are probably insufficient.  In such circumstances, not only should the plaintiff receive ordinary damages, but exemplary damages should also be awarded, as occurs in other cases.  While the matter is to be examined in the review, I ask the Minister to consider, in light of experience, beefing up this provision.</P>
        <P>I was shocked by the response of a newspaper group to a hammering it received in the High Court.  Its response to the decision was not what one would wish from a responsible newspaper organisation or publication in respect of how it proposes to adhere to the law.  It appeared to decide it would operate to its rules and change the law to meet its rules.  This appears to be what we have done in the legislation by allowing newspapers to establish a press council.  Given that press nominates the council&rsquo;s members, it will be far from independent.</P>
        <P>I am not sure whether Senator Norris agreed with an argument I made previously in the House on the matter of sanctions.  One of the sanctions which applies under the licensing laws is that a premises can be closed for up to seven days.  Senators have argued that in extreme circumstances in which a defendant is found to have acted demonstrably with malice and clear intent to damage someone, a sanction of closure of publication for a period should be available.  I ask that this option be considered in the review.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the amendment to the previous section 24 and seek clarity from the Minister.  Amendment No. 19 appears to remove the obligation on the defendant to prove that he or she believed at the time of publication that a statement was true.  I understand this requirement has been removed which effectively means that a plaintiff will be unable to mount a case on that basis and a statement which the author knew to be untrue at the time of publication may be published.  The Minister has argued that reports may contain a number of conflicting opinions and the obligation in the previous section 24 could interfere with the ability to publish such reports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Newspaper articles are now practically free of reporting and even main articles contain a great deal of opinion.  One must go back to older editions of newspapers to see reporting. While one knows what one will get when one reads the opinion section of a newspaper, frequently news reports are used to mask opinion and prejudice.</P>
        <P>I have concerns about the implications of amendment No. 19 for the reputations of individuals.  I am particularly concerned that the removal of the obligation in question creates a weakness in the system which will make it difficult for those who have been defamed to secure redress.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their remarks.  All those in public life, not only politicians, will have some difficulty with a defence of fair and reasonable publication.  If any <Col N="1015"/>Bill was to feature on my Christmas card list, the Bill before us is not it.  Before my appointment to this Department I looked long and hard at section 24, now section 26, on the defence of fair and reasonable publication.  It is not correct that the provisions on this matter have been driven solely by court decisions in the United Kingdom.  They were driven by the Reynolds case of, I believe, 1999.  The Reynolds test has been adopted by the Irish courts in a number of cases.  For instance, it was cited in the Leech <i>v</i>. Independent Newspapers case in June 2007.  In his decision in that case, Mr. Justice Charlton was of the opinion that a fair and reasonable type defence existed in Ireland for the media.  He drew heavily on the Jameel judgment.  The defence did not feature in the jury&rsquo;s consideration of the case. </P>
        <P>The purpose of section 26 was to impose parameters on what has developed here and abroad regarding a defence of fair and reasonable publication.  It is better that the Oireachtas, taking into account the development of the law in this area, endeavour to sculpture the law in a way that suits what we believe the people we represent desire.  That is the reason that, on balance, it is better to have this defence on a statutory basis rather than leaving it up to the courts to state the law in this area.</P>
        <P>On the question raised regarding the removal of the obligation on the defendant to prove he or she believed in the truth of a statement at the time of publication, it was brought to our attention that it could be argued that this requirement could hinder the reportage of stories which contain a number of conflicting opinions.  It also appeared to conflict with the provision in subsection (2) which allowed for consideration to be given to the extent to which the statement drew a distinction between suspicions, allegations and facts.</P>
        <P>We must accept that if an investigative reporter or other member of the media is carrying out an investigation, he or she may produce a number of conflicting opinions as to what took place in a particular incident.  To impose a requirement that the author believe in the truth of such opinions, even though they may be conflicting, is not logical.  It was, therefore, correct to delete the requirement while retaining the other significant requirements under various headings in section 24, now section 26.  As Senators will note, under this section, the court will consider relevant a series of factors set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>j</i>), inclusive.  A significant number of hurdles must be overcome by anyone pleading this defence.  For example, subsection (1) requires that a statement must be shown to have been published in good faith and in the course of discussion of a subject of public interest, the discussion of which was for the public benefit.  It will be a matter for the court to decide on these matters.  The strong view impressed upon me is that this is not an easy defence to claim and a significant number of hurdles must be overcome before a defendant can claim it.  We have achieved the right balance in this regard.</P>
        <P>Through a previous amendment, I endeavoured to ensure there was some restriction on the ability of the media to lodge when they are claiming this particular defence.  I had in mind that if the defendant wished to plead this defence, he or she would not be able to lodge at the same time.  In other words, they would not get a double whammy against a plaintiff.  It is the case that, under the rules of the superior courts, a judge already has the power to make a decision regarding costs.  It does not necessarily have to follow the event.  I was going to raise that to a statutory level, in other words, I was going to confirm what was already in the rules of the superior courts.  However, it was impressed upon me, both inside and outside the House, that this might be seen as another imposition.  I relented therefore and withdrew the amendment.  As I say, however, all these things are constantly evolving.  The law on defamation and privacy is literally evolving on a daily basis.  We only have to see what is the subject of significant speculation in the UK today concerning alleged abuses.  Thankfully, and I think it is to their credit, the media here have not been as intrusive into the lives of public figures as the UK media.  In a contracting market where there are more players than heretofore, people are <Col N="1016"/>scrambling around for stories and to a certain extent standards may drop.  However, the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman have worked well to date and should be given a fair wind.</P>
        <P>Most of us would have suspicions about self-regulatory bodies, not least in my own profession for many years.  I am always suspicious of self-regulatory bodies as would most people in public life.  We would rather have independent regulation, not least of our own existing profession, but we are where we are.  The legislation sets the parameters within which the Oireachtas wishes to see a self-appointed Press Council and Press Ombudsman operate.  In fairness, they should be allowed to proceed because, despite what was said earlier, they have shown an independence of mind.  We have seen recent reports that there are some difficulties.  There will be disputes, naturally, as media organs will not be happy with the judgments that have been handed down by the Press Council from time to time.</P>

	<P>I call the Minister on group 4 &mdash; clarity orders and dismissals for want of prosecution &mdash; which is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 23 to 27, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 23 to 26 support amendments tabled by the Labour Party on Committee Stage regarding the jurisdiction of courts in dealing with applications for declaratory orders under section 26.  The Labour Party had proposed to widen the jurisdiction to both District and Circuit Courts in addition to the High Court.  Fine Gael supported this proposal.  Of course, the District Court has no jurisdiction in defamation.  Having consulted with the Attorney General, the Parliamentary Counsel and the Courts Service, I am now proposing to have a declaratory order application process dealt with exclusively by the Circuit Court, rather than the High Court.  This approach should provide a much more cost-effective and swift procedure.  Thus amendments Nos. 23, 25 and 26 provide the necessary arrangements for the new approach.</P>
        <P>In examining the issues raised concerning section 26, I had the opportunity to reconsider the reference to &ldquo;false&rdquo; in section 26(1).  Having consulted with the Office of the Attorney General, there was a concern that this reference might somehow be interpreted as requiring the applicant of a declaratory order to prove that the statement concerned was false.  Such a situation would, of course, reverse the presumption of falsity approach taken in this Bill and make this new remedy less attractive.  Thus for the avoidance of doubt, amendment No. 24 provides for a new subsection (3) to ensure the intended purpose, that is, that the applicant does not have to prove the falsity of the statement.</P>
        <P>As regards amendment No. 27, section 31, as passed by the Seanad, provided that subject to provisions in the rules of the court, where a plaintiff does not do anything required of him or her within one year, a defendant may apply upon notice of dismissal of the action for defamation.  However, current rules of court 122, rule 11, impose no such positive obligation on the plaintiff and allow for up to two years&rsquo; grace period.  Having consulted further with the Office of the Attorney General, I proposed the deletion of the provision on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The effect of that is that the rules of court will continue to apply.</P>

	<P>The amendment makes perfect sense in terms of bringing into play the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, rather than the High Court.  It was the subject of debate here on Second Stage.

That amendment is particularly welcome. </P>

	<P>Group 5 concerns the abolition of certain common law offences &mdash; blasphemy and libel &mdash; and the seizure of copies of blasphemous statements, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 28 refines the text of amendment No. 34 to use the more correct term &ldquo;defamatory libel&rdquo;, rather than the previous &ldquo;criminal libel&rdquo;, which is more of a catch-all phrase for various types of libel.  This change has been advised by the Offices of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 29 provides for a new section to modernise the current law in section 13 of the Defamation Act 1961 in regard to providing sanctions for the constitutional offence of blasphemous libel.  Senators should note that, despite what one might read in the papers, the Bill introduces no new statutory offence of criminal and defamatory libel.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator mean even in the paper of record?  Senators may recall that this House agreed the deletion from the Bill of a provision regarding the publication of gravely harmful statements, which were in the Bill as originally published.  The decision of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to delete that provision was widely acclaimed.  He did, however, indicate clearly both on Committee Stage in the Seanad, on 11 December 2007, and on Report Stage, on 11 March 2008, that we had to address the issue of an appropriate legislative response on blasphemous libel in regard to offences contained in Article 40.6.1&deg; of the Constitution.  I would not disagree that the optimal approach, and certainly one which I would find most preferable, would be to abolish the offence of blasphemous libel.</P>

My immediate predecessor as Minister indicated here in the Seanad on two occasions that we must address the appropriate legislative provision of blasphemous libel in regard to offences contained in the relevant article of the Constitution.  It is stated in plain English and one could not get any plainer than this.  Article 40.6.1&deg; states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It cannot be any plainer.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because of the Corway case.  It is being incorrectly alleged that neither of my predecessors felt there was a need for this.  A member of the Labour Party was <Col N="1018"/>on a programme and said something that was a complete untruth, and he knew it.  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said on 11 March 2008:</P>
        <P LI="1">If we repeal, in full, the provisions of the 1961 Act in reforming the defamation laws, we create a gap unless some provision is made for constitutional offences.  We must also be mindful of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Corway <i>v. </i> Independent Newspapers in 1999, where the Supreme Court indicated a need to address the law on blasphemy.  At this stage, I would suggest our duty is to ensure that there is no gap created in the case of these offences, which are recognised by the Constitution. [Indeed, they are the only criminal offences recognised in the Constitution.]  I reiterated this very clear position on Second Stage during the debate in the D&aacute;il on 8 May 2008.  My predecessor as Minister and I clearly signalled that a new legislative proposal regarding blasphemous libel would have to be made at some stage on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P LI="1">The deletion of Article 46.1.1&deg; was recommended by the constitutional review group in 1996, and more recently in July 2008 by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in its report entitled &ldquo;Article 46.1.1 &mdash; Freedom of Expression&rdquo;, which dealt, <i>inter alia</i>, with blasphemy.  Deletion was also recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its report in 1991, but they also recommended a number of other matters.  However, the committee saw no need for a constitutional amendment in the short term, but rather that we might avail of any appropriate opportunity in the future.</P>

	<P>We have done nothing for ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer that.  In the Bill, we are repealing the Defamation Act 1961.  The continuation of the current provision at section 13 of that Act is not a desirable option.  Section 13 provides for both monetary and prison sanctions in regard to blasphemous or obscene libel, offences which were presumed to exist at common law.  However, the decision of the Supreme Court in the 1999 case of Corway <i>v </i>. Independent Newspapers &mdash; the only blasphemy case brought since the Constitution came into effect &mdash; held that the common law offence of blasphemous libel did not survive the adoption of the Constitution.  That decision created an anomaly in regard to the obligation in respect of the Constitutional provision.  Therefore, to continue with and complete the reform of our defamation legislation, I must respect the advice of successive Attorneys General that there is a constitutional obligation and imperative on me not to leave a legal void following a repeal of section 13 of the 1961 Act.  It is not just me as Minister; the Oireachtas is not entitled under the Constitution to leave that legal void.</P>
        <P>While some may regard the constitutional provision as redundant, as the joint committee did, the legal advice available to me from the Attorney General indicates that the committee&rsquo;s report did not change the legal position.  Until the Constitution is amended, it is necessary that a sanction be provided in regard to blasphemous libel.  There is no current, credible alternative to this position. Amendment No. 30 has the effect of retaining in section 36 of the Bill the power to seize copies of blasphemous statements.  The title has been changed and some textual amendments have been made, so that we are now dealing with the seizure of blasphemous material that may be ordered by the court on foot of a successful prosecution.</P>
        <P>We have three options on this.  We can have a referendum and change this.  We can pass a section dealing with blasphemous libel in order to comply with the Constitution, or we could just drop this Bill altogether.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Great.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That was an option.  Some people have suggested that we could repeal the entire Act and leave section 13, which contains the existing offence of blasphemous libel.  However, we cannot do that because of the Corway case.  The Corway judgment stated that there was a need to address this issue, and it stated that we effectively had to come back to address the existing offence of blasphemous libel.  We cannot repeal the entire Act and leave section 13 in place.  Even if we could leave section 13 in place, it would leave in place the possibility of imprisonment for blasphemous libel.  It would leave the possibility that a private citizen could bring a prosecution for blasphemous libel.  Our amendment takes out the threat of imprisonment, so there will only be a fine that is being reduced from &euro;100,000 to &euro;25,000.  Some people have suggested that we should reduce that further.  I would like to do that, but then the offence will be brought into the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, and I think we would all prefer if it was dealt with in the High Court.</P>

	<P>We are ensuring that only the DPP will take a prosecution, and not a private citizen.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we cannot ignore the Constitution.  The Constitution is specific that this is an offence punishable in accordance with the law.  We are the legislators and we must provide that law.  If we decide to leave it to some future stage, we will be in dereliction of our duty as legislators under the Constitution.  I have heard what the Joint Committee on the Constitution has had to say.  I appreciate that it has received legal advice.  It has suggested, on the basis of the legal advice it has received, that we should look into the hearts of the people who drafted the Constitution.  That is the effect of what the committee is saying.  We do not have that luxury, however.  We cannot look into the hearts of &Eacute;amon de Valera and those who helped him to draft the Constitution.  Whether we like it or not, we have to legislate on the basis of what the Constitution says in black and white.</P>
        <P>There is nothing we can do about the failure of the Oireachtas to do anything between 1937 and 1961.  The Members of the Oireachtas of that era obviously decided, as the Joint Committee on the Constitution did some time back, that a referendum on the matter should be postponed until another day.  As I said in the D&aacute;il, our legislators decided to flunk it between 1937 and 1961.  When the Defamation Bill 1961 was eventually introduced, the Government obviously operated on the basis of the same advice we are being given today, which is that if one is to legislate for all aspects of defamation, under the Constitution one must provide for an offence of blasphemous libel.  The crime of blasphemy has been included in our laws, in accordance with the Constitution, since 1961.  Severe doubts about the definitions used in those laws were raised in the Corway case.  Nothing has been done since then.  I am advised that we cannot pass this legislation without addressing that issue.  We cannot let it go until another day.  In the absence of a referendum in the immediate future, we will have to agree this legislation.  It is as simple as that.  While Senators may criticise that approach, they cannot deny that we are constitutionally obliged to provide for an offence of blasphemy in our laws.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1021"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is right on some of the points he has made, but he is fundamentally wrong on the principle and in his analysis of what could be done to deal with the problem he has identified.  The manner in which he has dealt with this issue makes a nonsense of the legislation before the House.  He mentioned that the matter was not dealt with between the agreeing of the 1937 Constitution and the introduction of the Defamation Act 1961.  There is a time to let sleeping dogs lie.  If the Minister had done so in this case, we would not have to waste our time on this issue.</P>
        <P>I would like to deal with the principle that is at stake.  The 1937 Constitution has been quite considerably modified to make it more suitable for a more modern Ireland, as an EU member state.  It is far removed, in many respects, from the 1937 version.  Various issues, such as the special position of the Catholic Church, the claim on Northern Ireland and divorce, have been dealt with.  I suppose the current version of the Constitution reflects the type of constitution that was envisaged by Dr. Garret FitzGerald when he launched his constitutional crusade.  The measure the Minister proposes to introduce is more than a step back in time &mdash; it is a giant leap back in time.  The legislation before the House, properly interpreted, makes the humour of Tommy Tiernan, &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Life of Brian&rdquo; a criminal offence.  The reality is that the 1961 offence and the 1937 constitutional provision have fallen into <i>desuetude</i>, to use a legal term.  Therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s approach is fundamentally flawed.</P>
        <P>The Minister has referred to the various bodies that have suggested this offence should be removed from the Constitution.  The Law Reform Commission made such a recommendation in 1991, as did the Constitutional Review Group and the Joint Committee on the Constitution, of which I am a member, in 2008.  The Minister has argued that the joint committee did not say the provision in question should be removed now, but I remind him that it recommended in its report that it should be removed, essentially, when the next pragmatic opportunity arises.  Such opportunities present themselves from time to time.  This technical constitutional provision, which is antiquated and anachronistic, could be dealt with on 2 October when the people vote in the second Lisbon treaty referendum.  It is absolutely clear that the members of the Oireachtas committee intended for this provision to be removed from the Constitution.  The problem that arose in the case of Corway <i>v.</i> Independent Newspapers, which has been mentioned by the Minister, was that the offence in question had not been defined.  The court pointed out that it was a matter for the Oireachtas, rather than the courts, to define the offence.  That is the issue.</P>
        <P>This offence was abolished in the United Kingdom following the 2007 case of Green <i>v</i>. City of Westminster.  The claim of blasphemy in that case, which concerned a screening of &ldquo;Jerry Springer: The Opera&rdquo;, was rejected.  It is worth quoting what the former UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Baroness Andrews, said in 2008 when she was introducing an amendment to the UK Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill to abolish this offence.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Government are of the view that it is now time that Parliament came to a settled conclusion on this matter for two key reasons.  First, the law has fallen into disuse and therefore runs the risk of bringing the law as a whole into disrepute.  Secondly, we now have new legislation to protect individuals on the grounds of religion and belief.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That issue also arises in the context of this debate.  I suggest that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is bringing this country&rsquo;s law into disrepute.  By his own admission, he has designed this legislation to ensure no prosecution will succeed.  While it is clearly intended that no prosecution will ever be brought, he has suggested that there is an obligation to legislate in this specific way to adhere to a constitutional imperative and obligation on the Oireachtas.  It is a nonsense from the beginning.</P><Col N="1022"/>
        <P>At my request, in May of this year the Oireachtas Library and Research Service prepared a research paper on blasphemy laws in other EU member states.  The paper is largely based on a survey of blasphemy laws that was prepared for the Council of Europe when it was producing a report.  I refer to the work of the European Commission for Democracy through Law, which is better known as the Venice commission, when it examined member states&rsquo; legislative provisions dealing with freedom of expression, blasphemy laws and hate speech for the Council of Europe.  The survey found that national legislation tends to deal in large measure with freedom to practise religion, statements that might incite hatred or disturb the peace, and discrimination against people on the grounds of religion.  In Belgium, it is illegal to desecrate religious objects or interfere with religious observance.  There is no offence of blasphemy in France.  Article 166 of the German penal code provides that anyone who publicly insults, by acts or published words, the contents or beliefs of a religion in a manner likely to disturb the peace, may be punished by up to three years imprisonment or a fine.  Under the Polish penal code offending religious feelings through public calumny of objects or places of worship is outlawed.  In Portugal whoever publicly offends another person or mocks him or her on account of religious beliefs commits a criminal offence.  The Spanish penal code has similar provisions as regards whoever publicly mocks doctrines or beliefs.</P>
        <P>Then we come to the United Nations and what is current practice and thinking on the whole issue of defamation of religions, as very much highlighted in the Danish cartoons case.  The report from the Oireachtas Library says that the non-binding resolutions condemning defamation of religion have been adopted by the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council.  A report dated 2 September 2008 by a special rapporteur of the UN&rsquo;s Human Rights Council strongly recommends:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]hat the Human Rights Council encourage a shift away from the sociological concept of the defamation of religion towards the legal norm of non-incitement to national, racial or religious hatred, on the basis of the legal provisions laid down in international human rights instruments, in particular articles 18 to 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Prejudice.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is very helpful because the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in that international forum, follows the line I have just outlined and takes a totally different approach from that reflected in the legislation before us.  When he was dealing with this issue at the United Nations he stated in a response to a question raised in the D&aacute;il on the matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">We believe that the concept of the defamation of religion is not consistent with the promotion and protection of human rights [Presumably, because it interferes with freedom of speech].  It can be used to justify arbitrary limitations on, or the denial of, freedom of expression.  Indeed, Ireland considers that freedom of expression is a key and inherent element in the manifestation of freedom of thought and conscience and as such is complementary to freedom of religion or belief.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He pointed out that Ireland supported a UN resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination, based on religion and belief.</P>
        <P>The Holy See, at a United Nations meeting in Geneva, pledged its support for the International Covenant on Civil, Cultural and Political Rights as the best protection for religious freedom and as an alternative to prohibiting the defamation of religions.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 May 2009 stated:</P><Col N="1023"/>
        <P LI="1">At a meeting of the Human Rights Council on All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination last September, Msgr Silvano Marie Tomasi, the Holy See&rsquo;s permanent observer at the UN, said: &ldquo;This delegation ... fully supports the reaffirmation, by the Human Rights Council, of the right to freedom of religion, conscience, belief and religious practice ... It concurs also with the advice of the special rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, offered to this council, to refocus its reflection away from the vague sociological concept of &lsquo;defamation of religions&rsquo; to the juridical norm of non-incitement to national, racial or religious hatred, and to the rights well summed up in the International Covenant on Civil, Cultural and Political Rights.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the thinking internationally and those are the views of the Holy See.  We now recognise that Article 40 of the Constitution provides that the publication of blasphemous matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with the law.  It is true, as the Minister has said, that in the Defamation Act 1961 it is set down as an offence.  How do we deal with that?  The Minister has said there is no alternative to this legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We can check the record, but the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues are agreeing with me.  He has put forward legislation and indicated that this is the only way it can be dealt with.  The alternative is to have a referendum on the matter and he does not propose to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Or to drop the Bill altogether.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>In a situation where the Minister says there is a constitutional obligation, not just on him but on the Oireachtas, to legislate, then it is not an option to do nothing.  He says this is the only realistic approach to take on this.  He says there is no alternative.  We can look at that alternative because the whole sense and purpose of the issue of blasphemy and the way it is interpreted in other member states of the European Union, in the United Nations and in international law is to the effect that it is the issue of offending, discrimination and incitement to hatred on religious grounds or otherwise.  The Corway case provided that what is required is to define the offence.  The Minister will say there are limitations on how an offence may be defined.  At the same time he purports to frame provisions in a Bill, and I shall just refer to the Minister&rsquo;s exact statement on this in the D&aacute;il, lest I be contradicted.  He said the legislation had been drafted and he believed the record showed it was virtually impossible to get a successful prosecution for blasphemy out of it.  That is what the Minister purports to do here.  It is a nonsense.</P><Col N="1024"/>
        <P>However, there is an obligation and it is in the Constitution.  If we are not going to have a referendum on the matter, which I believe would be the pragmatic thing to do at the first available opportunity, then we just have to define the nature of the offence of blasphemy.  We have latitude in doing that, and it may be done in a manner which reflects modern thinking, the thinking of other member states and the United Nations as well as the thinking which now reflects at least customary international law.  We have the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial Religious or National Hatred Act.  The Minister has said there is no alternative to the manner in which he can do this.  Could we not deal with the definition of the offence in that Act?  Hatred is defined in that Act as hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere, on account of, <i>inter alia</i>, their religion.  It seems to me that would suffice to define the offence of blasphemy and resolve the issues of defining the offence and complying with the constitutional obligation to have it as an offence.  In defining it in that manner, we do not have to create an offence which is a complete nonsense in present day terms.  On top of that it is highly dangerous because in its formulation it raises a host of issues.  Apart from the definition of the offence, we are now defining religion.  We will have litigation about what constitutes a religion.  It:</P>
        <P LI="1">does not include an organisation or cult&mdash;&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the principal object of which is the making of profit, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) that employs oppressive psychological manipulation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) of its followers, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) for the purpose of gaining new followers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Where are we going with this?  It is opening a vista of litigation and confrontation on issues pertaining to religion which we do not want to contemplate.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is an easier alternative.  It is a reflection of the manner in which the Minister adopts an approach and doggedly pursues it, entertaining no alternative, variation or nuanced thinking on how problems can be resolved in the legislative field.  Lateral thinking such as this, defining blasphemy in a way that reflects in essence the purpose today of dealing with such issues, that it is essentially offending people and is a form of discrimination, disturbing the peace and unsettling people by offending followers of a particular religion or segments of the community, allows us to deal with this in a pragmatic, professional and progressive manner.</P>
        <P>We live in a multi-religion society.  We know the issues and sensitivities regarding the Danish cartoons and the Muslim religion.  This raises all these issues again.  We have grown out of and changed our Constitution regarding the preference given to the Christian and Roman Catholic religion.  To reintroduce this type of provision is such a step backwards.  For the Minister to tell this House there is no alternative to doing it this way is incorrect, a bad political decision and is legally flawed.  I have suggested an alternative approach.  On that basis I have submitted an amendment to delete these provisions from the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator&rsquo;s amendment to delete the Minister&rsquo;s amendments and express my very strong opposition to them.  I will first respond to a couple of technical points the Minister made.  He said he envisages no prosecution would be taken without the DPP&rsquo;s approval.  I am surprised there is no provision in the proposed new sections that no prosecution may take place without the DPP&rsquo;s consent.  I was going to raise this.  The Minister will be well aware of the formula used, for example, in the offence of marital rape and a <Col N="1025"/>number of other offences where some sort of public policy issue is at stake.  That would have been a sensible insertion into this section.</P>
        <P>During the Minister&rsquo;s speech I made a point of order on his comment that he envisages that this offence would be tried in the High Court.  I presume he means the High Court in its criminal jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court.  I expressed surprise at that, not because I am necessarily in opposition to that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may have the Minister&rsquo;s attention, I wanted to ask again about the jurisdiction of the court dealing with the proposed offence.  The Minister said he envisaged it would be the High Court, that would be the Central Criminal Court, and that he did not envisage it would be in the Circuit Court, if I heard him correctly.  The stipulation that the fine would not exceed &euro;25,000 is not enough to confer jurisdiction on the High Court because the Circuit Court has jurisdiction to impose unlimited fines in criminal matters.  It would require some express provision to ensure these trials would proceed in the Central Criminal Court, as was provided for when rape trials were moved to the Central Criminal Court following the Rape (Amendment) Act 1990.  I wanted to clarify that with the Minister.</P>
        <P>I want to address the substance of these provisions and express my strong opposition to the statutory definition of the offence of blasphemy.  I do not say the Minister is creating a new offence of blasphemy.  I accept he seeks to insert a statutory definition of a common law offence that is also stated in the Constitution.  Looking at the Corway judgment I do not accept that it is necessary to pass this legislation to give statutory definition of this sort.  The Corway judgment was given almost exactly ten years ago, on 30 July 1999, by the Supreme Court.  To suggest there is any urgency or imperative about doing this now rings somewhat hollow when there has been a ten-year lapse.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Donal Barrington for the court, in the critical passage in his judgment, said, &ldquo;In this state of the law and in the absence of any legislative definition of the constitutional offence <Col N="1026"/>of blasphemy, it is impossible to say of what the offence of blasphemy consists&rdquo;.  He went on to say, &ldquo;In the absence of legislation and in the present uncertain state of the law the court could not see its way to authorising the institution of a criminal prosecution for blasphemy against the respondents&rdquo;.  The effect of the judgment is to make the offence unworkable.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Barrington did not find section 13 of the Defamation Act repugnant to the Constitution so there was no imperative to enact a new definition, as the Minister has suggested, just because we are reforming the Defamation Act.  The court simply said it was too vague for the court to be able to authorise the institution of a prosecution.  The subtext is interesting because the court clearly suggested the crime of blasphemy is outdated.  In the previous page of his judgment Mr. Justice Barrington said, &ldquo;It would appear that the Legislature has not adverted to the problem of adapting the common law crime of blasphemy to the circumstances of a modern State which embraces citizens of many different religions and which guarantees freedom of conscience and a free profession and practice of religion&rdquo;.  The court was suggesting the Legislature should adapt the common law crime of blasphemy which, as we know, has changed many times over the years.</P>
        <P>To suggest there is only one possible way of defining blasphemy is wrong.  The original definition of blasphemy related only to the Christian religion and any challenge to the fundamentals of Christianity was blasphemy.  That changed over the years as different clerics were prosecuted for challenging tenets of other branches of Christianity.  The definition has changed.  As Senator Regan said, the most appropriate way to adapt the offence of blasphemy to today&rsquo;s world, if we accept that some sort of statutory definition might be required, would be to amend the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act.  That amendment should have been inserted here instead of the amendments proposed by the Minister in the new sections 35 and 36.  That would have been a far more appropriate approach and I would be grateful if he would outline why that approach was not taken.  Clearly the <i>status quo</i> could have been preserved in some other manner given that it has been preserved for the past ten years.  The Minister has said that the section 13 offence could not have been repealed at this point.  The Government could have given a commitment to amend the Constitution to remove the reference to the crime of blasphemy if not at the time of holding the referendum on the Lisbon treaty at some future date.  That is in line with all recommendations of previous groups, in particular the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>I am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s comment &mdash; I hope I am not misquoting him &mdash; that the most optimal approach would be to abolish the offence of blasphemy by removing it from the Constitution.  However, what he has done here is the worst of all possible worlds.  He proposes to include a new definition of blasphemy based very much on the old law on blasphemy, in which there has not been a successful prosecution for more than 150 years.  He proposed to base the definition on the 19th century understanding of blasphemy without seeking to adapt it as the Supreme Court has suggested to the circumstances of a modern state.  Perhaps I will await the Minister&rsquo;s attention again.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister is doing is the worst of all possible worlds.  He is basing the new statutory definition on the old understanding of blasphemy from the 19th century, and including within the definition words and phrases that remain so vague as to render the new offence effectively unenforceable.  Indeed I believe the Minister has said his intention is to make it virtually impossible to get a successful prosecution.  It seems this stated intention undermines the entire point of introducing a new definition.  While it is clearly welcome that no prison sentence is imposed, the fine is ludicrously high.  We have not yet mentioned the proposed section 36.  The powers of the Garda of entry by reasonable force if necessary and the seizure of copies of statements, etc., and the fine make it a draconian offence.  However, it is still so vague in the terms used as to make it very difficult to see how any prosecutions could ensue and yet the danger is that they will ensue.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that persons who publish &ldquo;matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion&rdquo; may be prosecuted for blasphemy.  The concept of &ldquo;matter that is grossly abusive or insulting&rdquo; is extremely subjective and very vague.  The Bill provides that it must thereby cause &ldquo;outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion&rdquo;.  However, with the proliferation of the Internet we know how quickly substantial numbers of people might be offended and feel grossly abused or insulted.</P>

	<P>Anyone who has any regard for the history of censorship in Ireland will recognise a long history of repression in the name of religion.  For a long time institutions such as the Magdalene laundries symbolised the sexual repression of women in particular in the name of religion and in the name of the domination in this society by the Catholic Church in particular.  Anyone with regard for that would be very wary of the creation of a new statutory definition for an offence that seems to give this sort of elevated position to adherence to a religion to persons who may feel grossly abused or insulted in all sorts of ways in all sorts of satirical and political commentary and publications.  That is the real concern.  The Minister may have in effect said he does not want this to be a workable offence, but the reality is that by <Col N="1029"/>creating a statutory definition he is making an offence that will potentially be used against people.  We will see a great deal of Garda time wasted if nothing else because cranks will come forward making complaints that they feel grossly abused or insulted by satirical matters.</P>
        <P>I am very grateful to a new organisation, Atheist Ireland, which has made various comments about the legislation and has rightly criticised it as being both silly and dangerous in effectively reviving a medieval crime in a modern pluralist republic.  It is quite right in that.  When one considers the history of the blasphemy offence, that is what we are doing.  We are changing the <i>status quo</i> of an unworkable offence.  All the expert groups recognise it should be removed from the Constitution.  We are actually making it more workable by placing a statutory definition in a modern law without considering ways to adapt it, particularly through the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act in a way that would be much more appropriate to the needs of a modern pluralist state.  The law will become absurd in practice.  We will see groups rightly seeking to challenge the definitions etc.  A great deal of time will be wasted in seeking to enforce it.</P>
        <P>The writers of &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo; and others have come out against it.  Various people have pointed out different absurdities in it.  This morning I suggested that Fr. Willie Russell from Rathkeale, County Limerick, who criticised those in his parish who appeared to be worshipping a tree because it took on the appearance, in their eyes, of the Blessed Virgin Mary, could be open to a charge of blasphemy because he said one cannot worship a tree.  He was very critical &mdash; and perhaps insulting &mdash; of those who believe one could worship a tree.  I urge the Minister at this late stage to accept Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment and to delete these provisions which are silly and dangerous.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The offence of blasphemy is archaic.  It is borne out of a jurisprudence which saw the development of events in an era where church and State were seen as a single entity.  It is an offence that should be made obsolete and has been made so in other jurisdictions.  It cannot be confused with the right of people to believe and to have that right respected.  The difficulty in continuing to legislate in regard to an offence of blasphemy is that it is open to all sorts of reinterpretations and may be used for purposes that might not be the reasons for which those with strong religious beliefs would wish to see such an offence enshrined in legislation.</P>
        <P>The concept of blasphemy was brilliantly satirised by Monty Python in the film &ldquo;Life of Brian&rdquo; where a Pharisee was unintentionally stoned to death for repeatedly, although unwittingly, saying the word &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo;.  Much of the debate on this issue is a political equivalent of repeatedly saying the word &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo;.  It is something we need to get out of our political system as soon possible.</P>
        <P>I accept this Bill is a development of something that is included Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and that subsequently will be included in legislation.  The advice of the Attorney General is that because of the amending of the 1961 Act, it is necessary to have a clear offence in this legislation as regards the current provision in the Constitution.  Therefore, such provision is necessary in this legislation, although ultimately and in the short term the question of having such provision in the Constitution must be addressed.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, of which Senator Regan is also a member, I accepted the committee&rsquo;s findings in this respect.  The Minister pointed out that in the short term the committee recommended that the change does not occur, but in the medium and long term its members are of one mind that it must occur.  It is also the view of <Col N="1030"/>the committee that legislation of any form in regard to this offence cannot work.  It would be inoperable.  Not only did we see that in regard to how the offence has been defined in this jurisdiction and how it has been subsequently brought before our courts, but Senator Regan has quoted the City of Westminster case in England, and other legal advice given to the Oireachtas committee included how other blasphemy laws, for instance those in Austria, have not been seen to work.  On that ground, we need to examine how we address this issue in the medium term.</P>
        <P>The original amendment, which more strongly defined the offence and offered no defence on any grounds, was not an amendment I could or would support.  The subsequent amendment that outlines grounds of literary, artistic, scientific, political or academic defence makes a nonsense of the offence but it is an offence that is a nonsense.  I am prepared to accept that particular amendment nullifies the existence of blasphemy even though it is codified in our system.</P>
        <P>To move forward from here, we need to address the wider issue.  This measure is nothing but a legalistic repair job in regard to a short term political expedient.  We need to examine the wider constitutional issue.</P>

	<P>Members can take that whatever way they like.  Ultimately, while I accept the reasons this is being done in this way, the effect of it will be that we will codify an offence that most people do not believe in on grounds that people will not be able to bring actions and even if they were able to do so, it is unlikely there would be prosecutions on foot of such actions.  That makes a nonsense of our process of defining laws.  I will be supporting the amendments.  I will also be supporting the Bill, but I put down a clear marker that for me and my party this is not an issue that we can avoid and it must be dealt with in the medium term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Boyle, I believe this is progressive legislation, but I do not accept that the way in which it has been proposed to deal with it is the correct way forward.  I would like to know the motivation for introducing it now.  It is more than ten years since it was first called for.  The Minister mentioned that he has received many representations from people who are against the proposal.  Has he received many representations from individuals who are in favour of it?  If so, I would be delighted to know what is their reasoning in respect of it.  I am not talking about organisations or court judgments, but individuals who are calling for the Minister to proceed with the legislation in the manner in which he is doing so.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Bacik that there are problems in regard to the definition of blasphemy.  The phrase &ldquo;grossly abusive&rdquo; is cited in the legislation.  How do we define what is grossly abusive?  That is not clearly set out .  Another phase included in it is that of a substantial number of people being outraged, but what number constitutes a substantial number?  Is it 20 people? <Col N="1031"/> If there are 20 people in the Gallery, that is a substantial number.  Is a substantial number 100 or 1,000 people?  We need that clarified.</P>
        <P>In regard to the defence against prosecution, if a defendant can prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic values, that would constitute a defence, but who is a reasonable person?  What is reasonable to one person is clearly not reasonable to another.  There are too many woolly phrases in the legislation and that is a cause for concern.  A consequence of that is that people will challenge this legislation.  They will go to court.  They will put themselves in a position that they can be brought to court.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Minister has received a letter on this issue because it was sent to him by<?oasys _jy ?>Mr. Jonathan Pierson and copied to me.  The Minister will probably have this in his in tray.  Mr. Pierson wrote, &ldquo;It would not surprise me to find a considerable number of citizens putting their names to a blasphemous statement the day that this Bill is enacted to show that such a provision in our legislation is nothing but a farce&rdquo;.  He concludes, &ldquo;I know that I would be one of the first to sign such a statement&rdquo;.  If this legislation is enacted, we will have a mess on our hands.  We will end up going to the courts on a ridiculous journey because we all know that this legislation is not needed.  The Minister would agree that the best way forward is a constitutional amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister made a point about not wanting to go into O&rsquo;Hanlon Park to try to win the referendum on the Lisbon treaty at the same time as trying to win a constitutional amendment on this issue.  I can see his point.  I am not convinced that there is need for us to rush to have a constitutional amendment on this issue this year.  If such a referendum is not held at the time of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, a constitutional amendment on children might be held.  We will debate the Bill on the Lisbon treaty referendum this afternoon and it will be 28th amendment of the Constitution in the past 70 or 80 years.  A referendum is held every two and half to three years.  If there is not a referendum on this issue at the time of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, it is likely a referendum will be held in the next two or three years.  The Presidential election will be held in 2011.  There will be plenty of occasions within the next three years when we could put a constitutional amendment on this issue to the people without going to the expense of having a referendum purely on this issue.  I caution the Minister in this respect.  We have waited long enough for this and we can afford to wait two or three years because there will be other opportunities shortly where a referendum on this issue could be put to the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will wait to give the Minister a chance to hear my pearls of wisdom.  Creidim go bhfuil bot&uacute;n d&eacute;anta ag an Aire.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tar &eacute;is cosanta a thabhairt do chreideamh nach raibh siad ag si&uacute;l leis ach theip air an chosaint at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th orthu a chur isteach sa leas&uacute; at&aacute; s&eacute; ag cur leis an reachta&iacute;ocht.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made a mistake in extending to religions a protection of sorts that they never sought but in doing so he has denied them a protection that they would need.  I will explain what I mean.  I would not have ever felt it was necessary to bring forward this section in the legislation, but I have been and am persuaded by the Minister&rsquo;s essential argument which is that there is a gap, that the Constitution provides for the offence of blasphemy and that the Minister is giving expression to that in circumstances where in the Corway case it was held that there was no definition in law to give effect to that.  The Minister has filled the vacuum.  He has probably done so pretty cleverly and sensibly by largely restricting the circumstances in which a person could be prosecuted for blasphemy.  I note what the Minister has said.  For example, by requiring that the conviction would take place on indictment he seals off the possibility that vexatious or excessively cranky litigants might seek to invoke that section against people they believe to have uttered a blasphemous matter.</P><Col N="1032"/>
        <P>I also accept that by introducing the issue of intentionality, the Minister has established a high threshold for a prosecution to meet.  In defining what blasphemy is the Minister has redefined it dramatically from anything that it could ever have been interpreted to mean previously.  I find very persuasive comments that have been made in the past, possibly by Senator Norris and others, on the difficulty of defining what is offensive to God.  One man&rsquo;s meat is another man&rsquo;s poison and I suspect the same may be true for deities.  Clearly, if blasphemy were to be understood as giving offence to God it would be completely unworkable in modern legislation.  First, because people of different faiths and religions have different concepts about the ultimate questions of life, its meaning and the origin and destiny of human existence and, second, because of the major importance in any civilised society of freedom of conscience.  It is on the issues that are most dear to us, what we believe about the origin and destiny of our lives and the purpose of our existence, that people must have maximum freedom of expression.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For those two reasons it seems to me that it would be inappropriate to have any crime of blasphemy, were that to mean a person could be prosecuted for saying something that was offensive to God in that traditional understanding of what blasphemy means.  Let us examine what the Minister has done.  In effect, he has given a definition to blasphemy that largely works.  Whether it is necessary or desirable are separate questions.  To some degree it is desirable, on balance, provided that it is something that requires a very high threshold for prosecution and that it would only ever be used sparingly.  Perhaps the most common answer to what is the role of law is that of a teacher, where the law seeks to educate and bring about certain kinds of <?oasys _dc18- ?>behaviour by what it provides theoretically rather than for what might be prosecuted in practice.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">What I mean by that is that the Minister has provided that a person would be guilty of blasphemy were he or she to publish or utter a matter that is grossly abusive.  There is a high threshold to be met in that the matter must be grossly abusive or insulting in matters held sacred by any religion.  That is good because it is inclusive.  The Minister does not seek to give preference to any established religious view and he also takes care in a later part of the proposed section to exclude forms or expressions of religion that in the views of most reasonable people would be undesirable, namely, a profit-making enterprise or religions or cults that are engaged in oppressive psychological manipulation.  The Minister has been careful and he deserves credit for that.  He has required that the matter must be grossly abusive or insulting and there is that inclusivity to put it in layperson&rsquo;s terms that the matter has to relate to matters held sacred by any &ldquo;respectable religion&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The further requirement is that a matter must cause outrage among a substantial number of adherents.  The significant point is that the Minister has created the requirement of intentionality; that the person must intend to be grossly abusive in matters held sacred by a religion and in so being causes outrage.  There has to be that degree of intention, which it seems to me would be very difficult to prove.  For that reason I disagree strongly with Senator Bacik who suggested that in the context of there not having been a prosecution for blasphemy in more than 100 years, this would somehow open the door, both because of the fact that the Minister requires the prosecution to be brought on indictment, which takes the private prosecution possibility out of the equation, and that he further creates the high threshold of that intention to cause outrage in matters held sacred by any religion by a substantial number of adherents.  That is a clever approach.  It is sensible and it respects the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I note that the Minister has been at pains to express his own strong intellectual and political detachment from any notion that some kind of prosecution for blasphemy might ever be desirable.  Whether he is right or wrong about that is another matter, but he rightly expressed the fact that there is a provision for this measure in the Constitution and that it should somehow be expressed in legislation.  I agree with that.</P><Col N="1033"/>
        <P>The Minister is correct to not submit the matter to the people in a referendum on the question of whether there ought to be an offence of blasphemy under the Constitution.  There are two reasons for that.  The example of O&rsquo;Hanlon Park has to do with one of them.  It would be a bad idea if one were to present a blasphemy amendment together with the amendment on the Lisbon treaty.  The late Pope Pius IX, who was famously known as Pio Nono, was possibly well capable of putting people into prison for blasphemy, despite his sanctity, being a 19th century pope.  &ldquo;No, no&rdquo; might be the exact response one would get were one to submit two such amendments to the people in a referendum.  Whether I am right or wrong in that is academic.</P>
        <P>There is a second reason the Minister is correct in not seeking to propose the deletion of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.  It is that in some limited way it makes sense to have the offence of blasphemy.  The reason is that we have no problem with legislation that protects people from the utterances of others.  For example, as has been said we have it in the incitement to hatred legislation.  There are other examples as well.  Perhaps the example of incitement to hatred gives us the best insight into how in a modern context it is sometimes necessary and desirable to have some limitations on freedom of speech because of the harm that can be done to others.  That can apply in some situations to blasphemy, where a person intends to cause outrage among a substantial number of people in matters that they hold sacred.  It is possible to conceive of that being damaging to the social order and offensive to the common good.</P>
        <P>Given that it is a criminal legislative provision that could only be invoked in the most narrow and restrictive of circumstances, as the Minister has drafted and proposed it, there is no harm in its being in existence because it might act as an educator in terms of how we should treat others in society, and how we should treat the deeply held beliefs of other people.  Whether we are religious believers ourselves is not the point.  The point is how we should treat others.  I strongly subscribe to freedom of speech but I also strongly subscribe to the notion that freedom of speech itself can be subject to limitations in certain circumstances in order to protect a higher good.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note what the European Convention on Human Rights has to say.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.  This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Clearly, the freedom of expression is understood primarily in a political sense; the freedom to hold opinions, to receive and impart information and ideas.  Ideas in this regard perhaps connotes that which goes beyond the political and the serious and contemplates protection for comic or satirical ideas.  We all agree that in general terms there must be freedom of the expression of such ideas, be they serious or not.</P>
        <P>The second part of Article 10 deals with limitations.  It states that the exercise of these freedoms, as it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation of the rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for the maintenance of the authority and impartiality of the Judiciary.  The rights of others is included as providing the context for a possible limitation on freedom of expression.  This is where I believe there is justification for a limited provision for the offence of blasphemy <Col N="1034"/>which could in certain very limited circumstances be prosecuted.  However, this must be done in a manner that protects people&rsquo;s need to express themselves fully in matters of deep importance to them or of great relevance to the common good.  For this reason, I want to focus in particular on subsection (3).</P>
        <P>Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) creates a very high threshold to be reached in that it provides that a person must intend by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned to cause outrage.  The Minister, for some reason, continues to believe there may be a problem in this area.  In my initial consideration of the matter, I felt the Minister had set a high threshold in that a person would have to intend to cause outrage in which circumstances prosecution might be appropriate.  Why then did the Minister feel it necessary to create a further bulwark against prosecution?  It appears from subsection (3) that regardless of the intention to cause outrage, one shall not be liable to proceedings for an offence under this subsection if one can prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates.</P>
        <P>There are three possible reasons the Minister believed it necessary to add that subsection: to placate public opinion led, interestingly, by the media on this issue, which is fair enough and does not mean in itself that this is not a desirable addition, and to protect people even where they intend by the publication or utterance of the matter to cause outrage.  Perhaps the Minister&rsquo;s reason for doing this is that sometimes the intent of an expression of a genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic view is to give offence in terms of provoking debate on an issue which is held to be important.  Perhaps, however, there is another reason for this.  Perhaps the Minister is taking the traditional legal view that a person shall be deemed to intend the natural and probable consequences of their actions.  In other words, if he or she did not intend to offend the Muslim community in what was said about the prophet Mohammed, the fact that he or she knew the Muslim community might take offence and that a substantial number of people would be outraged in a matter sacred to them would comply with the requirement for intentionality.  Perhaps that is the reason for the inclusion of subsection (3).  While I agree with the inclusion of that subsection, I believe the Minister has made a mistake and I ask that he accept an amendment in that regard.  I seek the guidance of the Cathaoirleach on this matter.  I note it is open to me to propose a verbal amendment on Fifth Stage.</P>
        <P>For whatever reason the Minister has deemed it necessary to buttress the requirement of intentionality with further protection where people can show that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic value in the matter which is alleged to be blasphemous.  Unaccountably, however, the Minister has omitted the possibility that a reasonable person would find genuine religious value in the matter to which the offence relates.  Here lies the great irony: in legislation which is designed to offer some protection to people of whatever faith, the Minister has included a bulwark against that protection to every category imaginable except the person of faith, despite the fact that it is most likely to be in matters of religion, through utterances of people of religion, including ministers or officials of religion, that the offence might be given.  Let us take for example the Reverend Ian Paisley, who I am sure would have no problem saying the Catholic doctrine of the real presence is nonsense on stilts.  While that may not be the most sympathetic example, given Reverend Paisley&rsquo;s particular personality, there is no protection for him in this legislation although there should be.  If the Minister is offering protection to Mr. Richard Dawkins who in his artistic work of literary merit knocks the socks off the belief of papists, Muslims, Buddhists or anybody else who holds some class deity in high esteem, he should then extend the same protection to a minister of religion.  It is in debates between religions that controversy is most likely to arise.</P><Col N="1035"/>
        <P Just="Left">What I find hard to understand is this.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, established a forum for dialogue between the State and religious and ethical bodies, including non-confessional bodies such as the Humanist Association.  It appears that there is no evidence of dialogue here.  There is no evidence that the sensitivities of religious people, who might want to express religious views that may cause offence to others, are in any way considered here.  The legislation as it stands exemplifies in a classic way the anti-religious dimension that forms part of aggressive secularism which often arises in our society, namely, that there is to be protection for every group except those with faith.  That is intolerance, not tolerance, and it must be addressed.  The Minister is sending out the message that all sorts of groups may enjoy protection against prosecution for blasphemy &mdash; ironically the section introducing that is supposed to in some way offer protection to communities of faith &mdash; but the people who are excluded from that protection are communities of faith.  Sin bot&uacute;n a Aire.  N&iacute;l aon fhocal eile d&oacute;, sin bot&uacute;n.</P>
        <P>There has been much criticism of the Minister, some of it perhaps unfair, for being firm in terms of not accepting amendments and there has been some criticism of the Minister which I must confess is fair in terms of the amount of legislation rushed through this House in recent days resulting in our not having an opportunity to give it the scrutiny it deserves, thus vindicating our role as the Seanad.  However, I understand there are times when legislation must be enacted quickly.  For the Government to act with credibility in that regard it needs to be able to own up to a mistake when it makes one.  A mistake has been made here, a mistake that will cause offence to people of faith of different religions and denominations.  The Minister has correctly provided that a reasonable person would have to show that he or she could find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic value in the matter alleged to have caused offence.  The reasonable person does not have to believe in the concept, he just must see genuine merit in it.  I could say I did not like a particular episode of &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo; but it has genuine artistic value.</P>
        <P>The problem is that there are religious concepts and matters of controversy between religions where one cannot claim the necessary protection &mdash; I say this as someone who worked for five and a half years as press officer for the Catholic diocese of Dublin so I know a little about what I am saying &mdash; because one does not come under the heading of having literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic merit.</P>
        <P>The Minister is rightly tabling these amendments to allay fears that this anti-blasphemy legislation would be used in a way that would be oppressive of the free expression of ideas.  I applaud him for that.  An American writer described anti-Catholicism as the last acceptable prejudice but we are not talking about that here because this applies not only to Catholics.  We must not make the mistake of thinking that the only people who are not entitled to protection in society are people with religious views.  That is what will happen when we extend a protection for free speech for people who produce material or express ideas in which a person might find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic merit while excluding the possibility of there being a religious value.</P>
        <P>A person does not have to share a view to see it could have religious value.  If I want to cause a debate as a religious commentator or polemicist and I say that what the prophet Mohammed said in the Koran is not conducive to the common good because it could be read in a violent way, I need protection in the expression of that view although it is not a political view.  If I say that the Koran leads people away from God, that is a religious view, it is not political, scientific, academic or literary but the protection is still deserved.</P>
        <P>The Danish cartoons controversy offers an example of the sorts of problems this section will bring about if it is left unamended.  During that controversy the assertion was made that some <Col N="1036"/>sections of Islam regard it as blasphemy to depict the prophet Mohammed.  If that view was to enjoy the protection of the law it would be excessive.  Imagine a history teacher who produces a book illustrating the history of religions and just as he might try to illustrate Jesus Christ, he might try to illustrate Mohammed, in a respectful way but depicting him nonetheless.  Mohammed belongs to all of us if he is a historical figure.  He is part of the human heritage and, as such, a person producing a history book for children is entitled to depict him and must enjoy the protection of the law in so doing.</P>
        <P>Suppose it is not an academic publication, suppose it is for Sunday school.  In those circumstances that person might not enjoy protection because he can foresee the depiction of the prophet will cause offence and therefore he may be held to intend it.  The Minister must protect the person who wants to express a view that is purely religious, uttered in good faith, not desiring in an aggressive way to be offensive but intending to be offensive in that he understands that the natural and probable consequences of his action in expressing the idea is that it will give offence.  Given that the Minister requires a section to give further strength to the limitation entailed in subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), if he is a reasonable man, he must extend this protection to ministers of religion if he is going to give it to other sections of society.  Otherwise the Minister will also be guilty of aggressive secularism.</P>

        <P>This is a matter of the freedom of speech.  One of the principal motivators of artists over the years has been <i>pour &eacute;pater les bourgeois</i>, to shock the middle classes.  That is a very worthy aim.  On introducing the amendment referred to by Senator Mullen, I completely oppose that, not that I am an atheist or a militantly aggressive secularist but because I am very familiar with God.  He is a nice old Jewish gentleman with a long, white beard.  I frequently converse with him and I find our conversations extraordinarily interesting.  In view of his extreme age, however, I would be concerned that he might be the victim of friendly fire if there was an outbreak of bible throwing between different religious sects.

	<P>The Minister spoke about the urgent necessity for fixing this because there had been a case some time ago on blasphemy that was rather unusual and unlikely to be repeated.  I do not believe the judges in that case directed the Oireachtas to make the changes the Minister is talking about.  Even if they did, it is clear from a study of the record that this and many other Ministers have blithely ignored clear instructions from the High Court and the Supreme Court that legislation ought to be looked at and introduced to fill <i>lacunae</i> in the law.  If I am correct, the X case is a glaring example of that but it is a hot potato and they do not want to touch it so they retreated into this notion of blasphemy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is such a thing as blasphemy, as I said on the Order of Business.  Blasphemy was outlined by Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Brien, when he talked about the treatment he suffered in an institution where he was beaten and raped and the next day the host was placed in his mouth by the same men.  That seems to be something that is blasphemous, being in defiance of the decency of God and man.  In terms of literature, <i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce, which was banned, would certainly be considered blasphemous under the terms we have been discussing in the House today.  It contains prayers such as &ldquo;Kidney of Bloom, pray for us&rdquo; and the entire first section is a black Mass in its form.  That would certainly raise some difficulties in terms of the reprinting of Joyce.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Some of this material is very offensive.  I am not referring to <i>Ulysses</i> but to the kind of thing that occurred in Wexford some months ago &mdash; which I spoke out against in the House and on the radio &mdash; in which, for purposes of promotion, a disco owner organised the whipping of a partly clad male figure around the disco to the accompaniment of disco music in a reproduction of the Crucifixion.  That is deeply offensive and utterly childish and disgusting.  On that occasion, public opinion provided the appropriate corrective.  That was partly because of comments made in this House, on the radio and by people in the local authority.  There is a self-correction mechanism.  I am not defending that kind of behaviour, which I think is abhorrent and repellent, but the correct mechanism for dealing with it is the process of public disapproval which can be expressed.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s heart appears not to be in it.  He has said, as I mentioned on the Order of Business the other day, that this law was deliberately framed so that it could not be used.  That <Col N="1038"/>unquestionably brings the law into disrepute and is the wrong approach.  However, I understand it has a long tradition in the Minister&rsquo;s party.  It smacks of the Haughey idea of an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  I remember saying at that time that the notion of an Irish solution demeaned the Irish people and held them up to ridicule and contempt.</P>
        <P>I have been quite close to a blasphemy prosecution.  In the 1970s a newspaper with which I had some involvement, <i>Gay News</i>, was successfully prosecuted by Mary Whitehouse on foot of a poem by Professor James Kirkup about the Crucifixion.  When I first read the poem myself I found it extremely shocking because it suggested that there was an erotic sexual focus between the figure of Christ on the cross and the Roman legionaries who were guarding him.  It certainly caught my attention and disturbed me, but that was what it was intended to do.  Nowadays in theology there is considerable discussion on profound issues of the relationship between the erotic and the spiritual and Kirkup&rsquo;s poem would be seen in that context.  It was only a short poem on one page of a newspaper that took up about 20 pages, which was a lifeline for many people here because it contained interesting and useful news about legal advances, social events and so on.  The issue was banned in England and we had great difficulty as a result.  We had some discussions with the police because after that several editions were impounded, although only one edition had been banned, and the case was eventually appealed.  Thus, the issue is not entirely a dead letter.</P>
        <P>There is a long tradition of opposition to this form of censorship, which is dangerous in terms of both religious thought and literary experiment.  The Earl of Chesterfield, in 1749, in the preface to a pamphlet which reproduced his speech in the House of Lords against the proposed Licensing Act which introduced the requirement for stage performances in the UK to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain, wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">As we trace the genius of a nation by their taste in poetry and music, so by their encouragement of these we may judge of their rise or fall; good authors have never been wanting in happy climes.  Barbarism begins her reign by banishing the Muses. Those who have ears to hear, let them hear!</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am grateful to Fintan O&rsquo;Toole of <i>The Irish Times</i> for drawing my attention and that of other members of the public to the fact that it is almost exactly 100 years since the celebrated controversy about a play called &ldquo;The Shewing-up of Blanco Posnet&rdquo; by the late George Bernard Shaw.  Shaw wrote the play deliberately and fomented a controversy precisely to focus the public&rsquo;s attention on the issue of censorship, especially as it related to blasphemy.  It was refused a licence for performance by the British censor, which was exactly what Shaw wanted.  He managed to provoke a parliamentary select committee of inquiry into the matter at which he said, when summoned to appear before it: &ldquo;I think that the danger of crippling thought, the danger of obstructing the formation of the public mind by specially suppressing such representations is far greater than any real danger there is from such representations.&rdquo;  He continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am not an ordinary playwright in general practice.  I am a specialist in immoral and heretical plays.  My reputation has been gained by my persistent struggle to force the public to reconsider its morals.  In particular, I regard much current morality as to economic and sexual relations as disastrously wrong; and I regard certain doctrines of the Christian religion as understood in England today with abhorrence.  I write plays with the deliberate object of converting the nation to my opinions in these matters.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In Britain the play was suppressed.  Shaw brought the project to Ireland and submitted it to the Abbey Theatre.  Yeats and Lady Gregory took it up with alacrity and the play opened in August 1909, almost 100 years ago.</P>

        <P>The only complaint from the audience about Shaw&rsquo;s play, when shown in the Abbey Theatre, was that it was not half hot enough.  No one was actually offended.</P>
        <P>There was an interesting piece in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> a while ago whose headline was &ldquo;Sinister blasphemy law would play into the hands of religious nut cases&rdquo;.  It continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">If Jesus were in Ireland today, under the new law, wouldn&rsquo;t he be one of its first victims, held in Portlaoise, perhaps, while lawyers debated whether he should be deported to Israel, or the Palestinian Authority, or tried here?  Muslims might find their mosques under close inspection, too.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The question raised, which the Minister has not answered, was that of a concrete example of the kind of blasphemy intended to be cured by this law.  My colleague, Senator Mullen, provided a couple of examples, which I challenged.  The Minister was not present at the time and he might like to be aware of this.  I will paraphrase one example and I am sure Senator Mullen will correct me if I am incorrect.  He thought there should be a law dealing with somebody who outrageously stood outside a mosque and said something along the lines of the Holocaust being a good thing.  That is roughly what was said.  The other example he gave was obnoxious treatment of the Host at the Eucharist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not give either of those examples, but they appear persuasive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They were the ones I remember him giving.  Perhaps it was, as I suspected, a malign fantasy as a result of my eating cheese.  I made the point at that stage that both of those were dealt with by other laws, for example, those pertaining to conduct likely to provoke a breach of the peace, public disorder or similar.  Thus, they are already covered.</P>
        <P>In other jurisdictions, of course, blasphemy is much more of a live concept.  Quite recently the Pakistani Supreme Court upheld a judgment that only death was the appropriate punishment for blasphemy.  The journalist Sayed Pervis Kambaksh received such a sentence last year.  He distributed a pamphlet commenting in a critical way on the status of women within Islam.  In Sudan a British teacher who was in charge of a school allowed a child to call a teddy bear Mohammed.  She got into severe trouble and had to be recused by diplomatic intervention.  This is where blasphemy can lead if we are not careful.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen and others raised, at some length and very interestingly, the question of freedom of speech and I wish to talk about it while my secretary is answering her telephone.</P>

	<P>I thought it was Violet, but it is actually Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>The preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Article 19 of it considers freedom of expression as a cornerstone right and something that enables all the other rights to be articulated, protected and exercised, and that the full enjoyment of the right of freedom of expression is to the enjoyment of those rights, but does provide for restrictions.</P>
        <P>The restrictions are provided to protect the rights of others and public order, in so far as is necessary for a democratic society.  This is the point Senator Mullen made.  However, there is a three part test, a point Senator Mullen did not put on the record.  For the test to be legitimate, all three parts must be satisfied.  A restriction must pursue the legitimate aim it claims to pursue.  Therefore, there is no point in writing a pornographically blasphemous novel simply to aggravate people and then pretending it is a work of art.  The restriction must also be imposed in a democratic framework by Parliament or pursuant to powers granted by it.  The last provision is where a test could be applied to this Bill, and by which it would fail.  The restriction must be necessary in a democratic society, and the term &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; must be taken quite literally and means the restriction must not be merely useful or reasonable.  The Minister suggested the re-introduction of the offence of blasphemy is useful.  From his point of view politically it may well be.  However, he has certainly demonstrated that it is unnecessary, and for that reason it fails the test of the fundamental document guaranteeing freedom of rights.</P>
        <P>There is an obligation with regard to blasphemy laws on all member states and the United Nations to take measures to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language and religion.  There is no denial that certain forms of expression can threaten the dignity of targeted individuals and create an environment in which the enjoyment of equality is not possible, which introduced the notion of hate crimes and so on.  There is no effective hate crime legislation in this country.  I have tried, on several occasions, to initiate it and have never been able to.  It might as well not exist and is a dead letter.</P>
        <P>Article 19 recognises that reasonable restrictions on freedom of expression may be necessary to prevent advocacy of hatred but are not required to introduce legislation on blasphemy.  Several established democracies still have blasphemy provisions on their statute books, but they are rarely, if ever, used.  I understand the United Kingdom has recently reversed its legislation.  There have only been two prosecutions since 1932 in the UK, one of which I have dealt with already.  Norway had its last case in 1936 and Denmark in 1938.  Other countries, including Sweden, Spain and the UK, have repealed their blasphemy laws.  In the United States, which is frequently used as a persuasive precedent in legal cases in Ireland, the Supreme Court steadfastly strikes down any legislation prohibiting blasphemy for fear that even well-meaning censors would be tempted to favour one religion over another, and because it was not the business of government to suppress real or imagined attacks on particular religious doctrines.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, there is absolutely no evidence that the right to freedom of religion is, under international standards, better served or religious ideas protected through blasphemy laws.  Under international human rights law freedom of religion, for instance, is not about respecting a religion, but about respecting peoples&rsquo; right to practice.  The practice and not the religion is protected.  I agree with that.  Do offensive statements threaten the ability of adherents to <Col N="1041"/>religion to exercise and express their own beliefs?  I do not think so.  I do not think it is appropriate to introduce legislation merely to protect the sensitivities of people who might be offended.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to communication from Atheists Ireland.  I welcome the presence in the Gallery of the prophet Michael Nugent.  I am in receipt of correspondence from him in which he makes a number of very serious points about the problematic behaviour indicated in the Bill regarding outrage and not the expression of a different belief, which is wrong.  He makes the point that we should not be incentivising outrage and encouraging people to be outraged, because people will take the slightest hint.  Look at Princess Diana&rsquo;s funeral, where people who had no inkling of her human reality were gushing tears.</P>

	<P>One can act as a catalyst for all kinds of odd emotions.</P>
        <P>In 2005, Greek courts found a book of cartoons to be blasphemous and issued a European arrest warrant for the Austrian cartoonist who drew them.  This point is important because the court issued an international warrant which could only be effected where there is a parallel offence.  We are creating a parallel offence in this country.  We might be initiating a situation where Irish citizens will be exposed to risk from other courts, which is highly dangerous.</P>
        <P>The prophet Michael Nugent is the author of an entirely new religion and expects it to be protected from blasphemy.  I regret the absence of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, because he would be very pleased to learn he is at the centre of this new devotion.  It is called the &ldquo;Church of Dermotology&rdquo; and it believes ice-cream wafers are literally the body of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and will issue fatwas against cartoonists who publish cartoons of him.  It is a development which is to be very much welcomed.</P>
        <P>I have a comment of some substance on the precise wording of amendment No. 29.  It reduces the fine to &euro;25,000, which shows a certain degree of nervousness on the part of the Minister.  The amendment refers to matter that is grossly abusive or insulting to things held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage.  Subsection(4) refers to the idea of religion and gives a partial definition of it.  In this section religion does not include an organisation or cult, the principle object of which is to make a profit.  That covers just about every religion.  I am a church-going member of the Church of Ireland, but it is an undeniable fact that churches make profits and it gets worse the closer one gets to the United States of America.</P>
        <P>Another point on subsection (4) is that an organisation that employs oppressive psychological manipulation of its followers or for the purpose of gaining new followers is not described as a religion.  I would be very concerned about this if I were a member of the majority church.  I am not unsympathetic towards it but I am not keen on some of its leaders.</P>

	<P>Is it related to the amendments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to show where this could lead.  I am a great admirer of Fr. Brian D&rsquo;Arcy.  He has done enormously important work as a broadcaster and writer and has held out a lifeline to people whose lives have been fractured by personal circumstances of one kind or another.  He is also a man I genuinely admire intensely.  Fr. D&rsquo;Arcy has the courage of his convictions and, in a gentlemanly way, challenged the senior authorities of his own church, including on television, which is extremely courageous.  While I do not wish to embroil him in further controversy, he has published a book which I have been reading because I am interviewing him on Monday.</P>
        <P>In the book, <i>A Different Journey</i>, Fr. D&rsquo;Arcy describes his formation in a monastery near Enniskillen as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">There wasn&rsquo;t much formal education involved, except perhaps in spiritual practices: how to meditate, be silent and repeat endless rosaries.  We memorised the monk&rsquo;s alphabet, which had quotes like, &ldquo;I am a worm and no man&rdquo;.  It was about killing your self-esteem, even though most of us hadn&rsquo;t much of it to kill...</P>
        <P LI="1">Each of us had five whips about four inches long of this tightly knitted twine with a rope handle long enough to make sure you could beat your backside.  After night prayers, three times a week, we went to our rooms and whipped ourselves on the bum for as long as it took to say five Our Fathers, five Hail Marys and five Glorias.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There was, Father D&rsquo;Arcy writes, hardly any spirituality taught and most of the practices were designed to encourage blind obedience rather than an interior life of genuine holiness.  He also describes a notorious case of a novice master telling a novice from a farming background to plant cabbages upside down.  While the novice knew it was wrong, he did as he was told out of blind obedience.  &ldquo;Humiliations like that destroyed good young men&rdquo;, Fr. D&rsquo;Arcy adds.</P>
        <P>I do not refer to these passages to be provocative, nor do I wish to insult the Roman Catholic Church.  The test of the greatness of the church is that a good and decent man such as Fr. D&rsquo;Arcy survived these silly, dangerous practices and still does extremely good work.  The definition of a cult provided in the legislation exactly coincides with the witness of a continuing priest of the Roman Catholic religion.  This is the area into which the Minister is foolishly straying.  It is for this reason that I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment to delete the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than repeat comments made by previous speakers, I propose examining where the proposal on blasphemy sits within the law, what is its intent and where it came from.  I gently correct the Minister on the matter of where the offence of blasphemy stands in the Constitution.  While the offence is referred to in the Constitution, it existed before the Constitution was drawn up, yet no one considered it necessary to define it.  Were the offence to be removed from the Constitution, blasphemy would remain a common law offence and further legislation would be required to remove it as a common law offence.</P>
        <P>This morning, I cited the words of the Archbishop of Dublin and yesterday I quoted the Pope of Rome.  The Minister of State will take great pleasure in learning that I propose to quote the founder of his great party, Fianna F&aacute;il.  Paul O&rsquo;Higgins, in an article entitled &ldquo;Blasphemy in Irish Law&rdquo;, states that de Valera was of the view that no new offence had been created by Article 46.1 of the Constitution and that the provision simply referred to the common law offence.  Removing the offence from the Constitution does not, therefore, remove the common law offence of blasphemy.</P><Col N="1043"/>
        <P>In light of these facts, why is the Minister going to such great lengths in this matter?  <i>Murdoch&rsquo;s Dictionary of Irish Law</i> states that it is impossible to say of what the offence of blasphemy consists.  It also makes the point that the offence could be defined in legislation.</P>
        <P>It is illogical to conclude that a constitutional imperative arises in this matter or that constitutional imperatives are something which bring Governments to attention.  Imperatives in the Constitution are regularly ignored.  The example which comes to mind is the requirement under the Constitution to define minimum standards of education.  This refers to the basis of the education system, the rights of parents to educate, the requirements of the law etc.  This requirement has been ignored and I understand we have not concluded the business arising from the X case which gave rise to certain requirements.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Even if defining the offence of blasphemy were a constitutional imperative, and I do not accept that is the case, it would not constitute a sufficient reason to support the Minister&rsquo;s logic.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on the crime of libel.  The report stated there is no place for the offence of blasphemous libel in a society which respects free speech and recommended that the reference to blasphemy be deleted from the Constitution.  It is interesting to note how selective are the views that have been assembled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A significant point arises to the extent that society must organise itself in an orderly fashion and ensure tolerance does not reach a level that tolerates abuse.  How do we order society in such a way as to ensure religious beliefs are respected and people do not go too far in abusing people?  A number of steps can be taken to achieve this, the most obvious of which is to seek recourse to the Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.  The burden of proof in that legislation relies strongly on intent, which I note also features in this section.  Those who were present for debates in the House in 1989 on the Incitement to Hatred Act will recall that the purpose of the legislation was precisely to cover circumstances in which people seek to create hatred against particular groups, including religious groups.  This is, therefore, an easy offence to deal with.</P>
        <P>A second option is to use the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which makes it an offence in a public place to distribute or display any writing, sign or other representation which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene, with intent to provoke a breach of the peace.  Given that extant legislation addresses the issue of blasphemy, it is that on which we should focus.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to the Supreme Court decision in Corway <i>v</i>. Independent Newspapers.  It is clear from this judgment that in the absence of the intention to blaspheme, a prosecution cannot be sustained or proven.  The question of intent is all over the place and inserting it in the legislation does not add anything new to the general body of legislation.  In that sense, the Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 and Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 would be much more appropriate vehicles to address this issue than defamation legislation.</P>
        <P>I am not certain how the measure on blasphemy will work in practice and to be fair to the Minister and his Department the burden of proof in the section makes its application virtually impossible.  I cannot envisage a court finding a case of blasphemy on the basis of this legislation, which is another good reason for removing the section.  The worst type of law is that which cannot be implemented.  Given the burden of proof required and the inclusion of a wide-ranging defence of literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic value, the legislation will be virtually impossible to implement.  I completely support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s argument in that regard.   The first time I came face to face with this was in 1977 when I organised a private <Col N="1044"/>weekend conference in Belfast which brought together people of different religious and political views.  I asked them to speak freely about how they saw each other.  I remember Unionists speaking out strongly about how they perceived the Catholic church in dealing with issues such as the Real Presence and the Eucharist, in language which most Catholics would find offensive.  It was not intended to offend, it was simply their understanding.  It gave me a greater understanding about how pluralism needs to be developed.  It shows how people with wrong beliefs can get themselves into areas of blasphemy and it is only one small step to include intent.  This is more likely to arise in a religious discussion or argument than in any other case.</P>
        <P>I also do not understand how one could make a judgment on what has literary value, which has a high bar in itself.  Books are published every day of the week that have no literary value whatever.  In addition, articles are published that have no literary value and are not artistic, political, scientific or academic.  That is not an exclusive list.  Another phrase should be inserted to widen it out.  Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point is absolutely correct, that it is more likely to arise in the context of religion with people of different beliefs and faiths in opposition to each other.  It needs to be changed in that regard as well, but preferably omitted.  In fairness, the quotation from Senator Regan, which I had not heard before, about the Vatican legate speaking at the UN about where this sits in a modern society, allowing for free speech and demanding tolerance, captures exactly what Members on this bench have been saying.  This is how society finds its own levels and it does not require legislation to do that.</P>
        <P>In his summing up, perhaps the Minister will explain how the question of outrage among a substantial number of adherents would work.  For example, somebody who feels a sense of outrage because of something that has been published or some other imagery, may bring the matter to the attention of the Gerda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I presume the first thing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must establish is that there is a substantial number of adherents.  Probably the first thing that would happen is that the person making the complaint would try to gather as many adherents together who had never seen it before.  The complainant would then show it to them thereby extending it beyond wherever it had been before, in order to prove his or her point that there are a substantial number of adherents to the religion who supported the same viewpoint.  I think that is nonsensical.  It is bound to happen and there is no way of stopping it.  In terms of how we use the time of State services, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the courts, this is ridiculous.  There is enough legislation to deal with these issues and that is the way we should be looking at it.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a republic and Tone&rsquo;s republicanism was founded on the tenet of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter.  In modern terms, that translates as a pluralist society where there is space for everybody to engage.  In his definition, Newman pointed to tolerance as being the first quality of an educated person.  If we put all those things together, we are really talking about a societal matter.  We must order and deal with the issues of concern.  If we want to ensure that people are not abused in this respect, we should deal with it through incitement to hatred legislation, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, or the common law offence as it currently stands.  Judges should be allowed to decide these matters in court.  There is no need for all these provisions.  Much has been said about the matter and I do not want to take up any more time except to say that Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment captures it quite well.  We should eliminate this offence.  If it is to stay in any way, Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment should be considered.  However, I think we should get rid of it, move on and order our society in a different way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has had the opportunity of getting some relief from the drudgery of debate for the past 90 minutes.  Unfortunately, the rest of us have had to suffer it here.  It is interesting that a topic such as this has taken up so much time and focus.  The <Col N="1045"/>Minister suggested he had three options for dealing with the issue: dropping the Bill, legislating or holding a referendum.  I am sorry he did not take the first option.  I am sure that if he were here, Senator Norris would agree for other reasons, that would be a good choice.  </P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s last point was an interesting one, that it should have been dealt with under the Incitement to Hatred Acts.  Senator Bacik made a similar point in her submission.  Blasphemy seems different, however, because incitement to hatred legislation deals with racism, including inciting people against minorities.  I am not sure that legislation is relevant or applicable in this instance.  It is interesting to hear some of the points being made by Members of the House who are barristers.  We must accept that it is a constitutional matter.  One Senator said that we should let sleeping dogs lie.  Senators Regan and Bacik said that the &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo; television series could be blasphemous.  If the content of &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo;, which is a very humorous programme, is considered grossly abusive or insulting to religious matters that are held sacred and if the purpose of the programme is to cause outrage to believers, it is certainly news to me.  That would not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
        <P>I thought Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s contribution was more focused than others.  In discussing this matter, we are dealing with respect and tolerance, which should underline anything we do or say.  I will come back shortly to what Senator Mullen said because he put the matter in focus.  Perhaps respect is lacking in society.  It is only when one visits other jurisdictions, such as Asian countries, that one sees there is a real necessity for tolerance and respect in all sorts of ways, because of the density of population.  In that regard, one can recognise some of the thrust of our society which is probably not to our benefit.  I do not have a fundamental difficulty with the Oireachtas legislating in this area.  We legislate in many areas.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the Wexford disco issue and public opinion had the effect of causing that change.  It might well be that the outrage in public opinion it engendered meant it was going to be a commercial failure, but I do not think it caused any change in the mindset of people who were prepared to adopt that approach which was offensive to people who believe.  On the other hand, they saw it as being commercially advantageous.  Let me compare it to the advertisement by Paddy Power, which showed a picture of the Last Supper.  I think that kind of thing is unnecessary and gratuitously offensive to people.  I am not saying it was designed to insult people.  It was designed to exploit and create controversy which engenders the advertising benefits the company is seeking.  I do not think that should be allowed in society and it does not matter what religion it offends.</P>
        <P>The Danish cartoons have been referred to in the House.  There are those who will argue that freedom of expression is valuable in society, and this is a fundamental principle in democracy.  However, that this Bill is before us at all means it is not unfettered.  Society does not regard it as being unfettered and uncontrolled and we in the Oireachtas do not regard it so either.  In fact, those who work in the newspapers have themselves acknowledged it is not uncontrolled.  Therefore, it comes back to a balanced view as to how we regulate it.  I do not see anything unbalanced in the Bill.  Liberals may well disagree with this.</P>
        <P>Some people claimed that section 36(3) makes the thing meaningless, but I do not think so.  We all remember the controversy about Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s book when there were many objections to it and his life was threatened as a consequence.  There must be scope for artistic, scientific and even religious contrary views against some doctrines religions hold dearly.  Senator Mullen strongly made this point but I do not think that necessarily means everything is fair game.  When we speak about the Defamation Act, we may feel people&rsquo;s reputations are secondary to freedom of speech.  They are not.  People have these important rights.</P>
        <P>Atheists can be very critical and abusive of religion.  I do not find that trait in agnostics, who are trying to discover the truth.  They do not believe but they are seeking the truth.  They are <Col N="1046"/>not dismissive of others&rsquo; views, even if they do not agree with those views.  It comes back to respect and tolerance, which should permeate society.  We should promote that within our laws and where it is not taking place, we should certainly oppose it.</P>
        <P>Even though he was interrupted by some of his own colleagues, Senator Mullen put his finger on it.  There are pseudo-liberals, some of whom are in this House, who pursue an aggressive secularism.  There is no doubt about that, and it is obvious to anyone who follows public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I certainly make no apologies for it.  I make the comparison with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s contribution on Tone republicanism.  I regard myself as a republican and the essence of that is tolerance for other viewpoints.  That should be injected into the debate.  I do not think anyone will be a victim of this Bill.  It will be difficult to prosecute.  It does not interfere with the freedom of speech but it does provide that those who are grossly abusive or insulting on matters held sacred by a religion and cause outrage among a substantial number of the people when their intention was to cause such outrage will be guilty of an offensive.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I do not see any reason anyone should embark on that course of action.  That does not deprive people of the ability to put forward their points of view in a reasoned, measured way which are contrary to the views of people who have faith or whatever else.  That is as it should be.</P>
        <P>I find Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment quite persuasive.  I do not necessarily have any objection to an offence of blasphemy and I can see why it was put in our Constitution.  I do not agree with the modernists who feel we have gone past the 1937 Constitution.  It has been held in the courts on many occasions as supporting the underlying principles of human rights.  In the debates we had in this House on the European Convention on Human Rights, it was clearly stated by the Minister and by many of the contributors that our Constitution had most of those human rights covered.  There should be a defence to section 36(3) and I think the amendment is a good one.  I can obviously see why genuine literary, artistic, scientific and academic values <Col N="1047"/>are matters that can be used in the defence.  I find it difficult to see why there would be a political element to that.  However, if these are being put in, the compelling argument made by Senator Mullen about religious values is equally important.  Our Constitution protects religious expression.  Its inclusion here would certainly be compatible with that.  The corollary of that would be that its exclusion might be unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>I am not making any apology for this particular Bill.  I notice that some of my colleagues mention that a referendum should be a priority.  If that is the case, the people will decide.  I am not quite as sure as some of them that they will get the answer they are looking for from the public, but it is their right to seek that.  If this is a priority in the midst of the most serious recession we have had since the Great Depression, then our priorities might not be in the right order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State for this very interesting debate.  He has been here for most of it and I have found it fascinating.  I am certainly not a lawyer, and I am not rising with any confidence that I can handle many of the items that have been discussed.  I listened very carefully to the Minister and I do not think he would have introduced this particular topic if he did not feel there was a need for it.  The fact that the burden of proof has existed since the 1937 Constitution and that there has not been any prosecution seems a little bit strange.  The Minister is introducing this on the belief that there is a need for it and I think he has covered the areas that would express concern.  The fact that somebody &ldquo;intends, by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned, to cause...outrage&rdquo; means that intention is crucial to this.  However, I have a concern about a second aspect of it, to which Senator Mullen also referred.  I would like to formally second the verbal amendment that was proposed by Senator Mullen to try to rectify this problem.  I do not think those who have supported the amendment have seconded it.  Senator Mullen wants to add the word &ldquo;religious&rdquo; to section 36(3) of the Bill, which reads: &ldquo;It shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the defendant to prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates.&rdquo;  It seems that the Bill needs to provide for the religious value of the matter to which the offence relates.  It seems that freedom of religious expression, which is protected by the Constitution, should enjoy as much protection as freedom of literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic expression.  If we do not meet the real need to provide such protection, we will be saying we do not regard freedom of religious expression as having the same validity as the other freedoms I mentioned.  The manner in which the burden of proof is set out makes it highly unlikely that a prosecution will be secured.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris mentioned a nightclub in Wexford that had proposed to make a scandalous and mocking use of the crucifixion as part of its efforts to attract attention.  While public opinion and market forces forced the nightclub in question to close, that is not good enough.  Some weapon should be available to the Minister and the State to contain or restrict such blasphemous abuses.  I am one of the few people in this country who has ended up in the Supreme Court on the basis of Article 44 of the Constitution, which protects freedom of religion.  Almost 40 years ago, I won a freedom of religion case on the basis that discrimination should be avoided in line with Article 44 of the Constitution.  While I am not confident that I know a huge amount about the legality of our previous blasphemy laws, I have learned a lot today.  I support the amendment the Minister made to the Bill and I urge him to accept Senator Mullen&rsquo;s verbal amendment.  If we are to recognise &ldquo;literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic&rdquo; forms of expression, it is important that we recognise &ldquo;religious&rdquo; forms of expression too.  On that basis, I urge the Minister to improve the legislation and ensure it is sound by accepting Senator Mullen&rsquo;s verbal amendment.</P>

	<P>When someone said that I would be out soon, I did not believe it for a minute as I knew this issue would attract lengthy discussion.  The ability of the legal profession to engage in literary gymnastics when an issue is put before it never ceases to amaze me.  I listened intently to Senator Regan and, whether we like it, he made his case.  He acknowledged that we are obliged under the Constitution to provide for a criminal offence of blasphemy.  There is no getting away from that.  He tried to claim that I said there was no alternative, even though I made it clear that there are two alternatives &mdash; to hold a referendum on the matter or to drop the Bill altogether and leave this lacuna in our law.  It was made clear in the judgment in the Corway case that blasphemy should be defined by the Legislature, rather than by the courts.  That is why we are taking the first opportunity available to us to provide for such a definition.  The Office of the Attorney General has given me strong advice to the effect that a defamation Bill that purports to repeal section 13 of the 1961 Act, which provides for the criminal offence of blasphemy, cannot be passed without saying something about this issue.  The only alternative is to provide for an immediate referendum on the matter.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that those who are calling for a referendum might not get the result they want.  I am as good as the next person at understanding what is being said by grassroots people throughout the country.  Those who called for a referendum on this issue to be tacked on to the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, or to be held separately, should bear in mind that the political party that called for God to be taken out of the Constitution is no longer in existence.  Where are the members of that party today?</P>

	<P>We should be a little careful when we call for a referendum, in case we do not get the result we want.  When I proposed an amendment in the D&aacute;il to include in the Bill the section that is being discussed by this House now, the Labour Party tried to amend it.  It was clear that the Labour Party, in tabling its amendments, had been advised that an offence of blasphemy needed to be provided for.  Deputy Rabbitte ultimately spoke against his own amendments, which was ludicrous.  I accept that Senator Bacik has not tabled any amendments today.  The argument made in the D&aacute;il by her colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, was inconsistent with his efforts to amend what is now section 36 of the Bill, which deals with the publication or utterance of blasphemous matter.  His two amendments sought to reduce the fine provided for in that section and to provide, in effect, for the measures contained in the expanded section 36(3), which was included at a later stage.  By tabling those amendments, the Labour Party acknowledged that an offence of blasphemy had to be provided for in this legislation.  Ultimately, Deputy Rabbitte chose not to speak in favour of his amendments.  He chose to go with Fine Gael because he saw what way the wind was blowing.  It is typical of Opposition Members to speak out of both sides of their mouths in such a manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, it does not change the hard fact that the Constitution, whether we like it, requires that blasphemy be an offence.  It cannot be put any plainer than &ldquo;the publication or utterance of blasphemous....matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law&rdquo;.  If we choose to ignore the Constitution, or to take an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach to it, we will be abdicating our responsibility as legislators.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would like to refer to an argument that has been made previously.  It has not been made in this House today, although I thought it would be.  God forbid that abortion should be brought into the debate.  A recent editorial in the paper of record suggested that I was insisting on complying with the Constitution in respect of blasphemy, even though the Oireachtas is happy not to comply with the Constitution in relation to the right to life.  I will not go into the very good and valid reason for that distinction.  There is a definite answer to that accusation made by the newspaper.  In the X case, neither the Supreme Court nor Mr. Justice McCarthy suggested that legislation was an essential ingredient in the protection of the constitutional right to life of the unborn, or the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
      
        <P>However, opposite to that in the Corway case, the Supreme Court said that legislation was essential to give effect to the constitutional requirement of making blasphemy an offence.  The main reason for that is that Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution provides a clear rule of law, authorising the courts, as organs of the State, to defend the constitutional rights guaranteed by that article in relation to the life of the unborn.  In effect, the Constitution protects the right to life of the unborn, free-standing of any legislation.  Therefore, those who raise that canard are wrong.</P>
        <P>On the point raised by Senator Mullen, that is not allowable, but he makes a reasonable point in that regard.  Nonetheless, it would be unworkable.  If we were to amend that, we would have to look at other possible qualifications and areas where we might have to give expression to it.  Ultimately, this comes back to the requirement of <i>mens rea</i>, as he rightly said.  It is possible that somebody may say something blasphemous without being necessarily aware of the teachings of a particular religion or certain aspects of it.  Everything goes to the core of what the Senator describes as the &ldquo;new&rdquo; inclusion of an intent, the <i>mens rea</i>, which was not in the previous offence.  If we were to open this up, it would have to be done for other issues to be included as a possible offence.</P>

	<P>On freedom of expression or any statement that might be made, while the courts have discretion and could narrowly interpret subsection (3), it is quite possible they could include what the Senator is suggesting, specifically, under the heading of academic value.  It is possible for a court, taking a reasonable interpretation of subsection (3), to address the point the Senator is making on the inclusion of religion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>We are trying to comply with the constitutional requirement in relation to the article on blasphemy and the requirement that it is to be punishable in accordance with the law.  We are not having a constitutional referendum for the reason Senator Walsh referred to, namely, we have other priorities as a Government and as a Parliament.  We should stick to those priorities and deal with this as much as possible.</P>
        <P>In the D&aacute;il we listened to the Opposition, which put forward reasonable amendments, despite the play-acting of the Labour Party in particular and, indeed, Fine Gael.  I have no doubt Fine Gael got strong advice from its legal advisers, but it chose to ignore it, to the effect that there had to be an offence.  Fine Gael decided to oppose the section, knowing well that any lawyer worth his or her salt would say that under the Constitution there is an absolute requirement to have this.  That is the situation unless we change the Constitution.</P>
        <P>We phrased and framed the new section 35, putting in a new definition of &ldquo;blasphemous matter&rdquo; along the lines proposed by the Law Reform Commission in its report.  We included the term &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; as proposed by the Law Reform Commission so as not to widen the scope of the offence.  We inserted a requirement for <i>mens rea</i> as regards intent.  We wanted to avoid criminalising a person who might not know that the matter in question is insulting because he or she is not aware of a particular religion.  There is no definition of religion.  Again, in consideration of some of the points raised by Senator Mullen, that is to be left open to the court, which I believe will take a wide interpretation, particular on the issue of subsection (3).</P>
        <P>We are taking out the imprisonment aspect.  People say we should have left it alone, but we do not have that option because of the Corway case.  However, if we were to leave it alone, it would mean someone could be put in prison for blasphemy for up to seven years.  I am taking that out so there will be no provision for imprisonment under the legislation; there will be only a monetary sanction.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised the issue of the &euro;25,000 &mdash; it was originally &euro;100,000.  This was to show that if there was to be a prosecution it should be in relation to a substantial rather than a relatively minor offence.  As always, the jurisdiction on indictment is commenced in the Circuit Court and obviously there would be a right to appeal to the High Court ultimately.  The reason we reduced the figure from &euro;100,000 to &euro;25,000 was to assuage some of the criticism that a fine of &euro;100,000 was too large.  The fine imposed was up to &euro;100,000, it was at the discretion of the court.  Reducing it to &euro;25,000 still gives a signal to the effect that a prosecution is not to be taken unless a very serious offence is involved.</P>

        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">Again, I can put it no further.  Probably most of us accept that having the offence of blasphemy is anathema to the type of society we have today.  That reminds me of the linguistic gymnastics I mentioned.  Senator Regan suggested, and Senator Bacik agrees, that we should deal with this in the incitement to hatred legislation.  Although there may be a cross-over between blasphemy and incitement to hatred, they are two different things.  I believe the Senator is really stretching the English language in saying that something which is blasphemous is not necessarily incitement to hatred.  I cannot see how this could be addressed in this manner.  It could be suggested that the amendment I tabled is an Irish solution to an Irish problem, admittedly, but at least it acknowledges what is in the Constitution and the requirement to have an offence.  To try and hive it off into incitement to hatred legislation, however, would not do justice to our job as legislators.  We would be just codding the people were we to try to include this under incitement to hatred legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank all the Senators for their strongly held views on this issue.  I hazard a guess to the effect that, whether in the form of referendum or otherwise, we may not necessarily come back to this issue for some considerable time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I find the response of the Minister unconvincing.  He referred to my presentation on outlining the position on this whole issue of blasphemy in other EU member states, the United Nations and the Holy See, and how it is generally interpreted and applied as being offensive to the followers of a particular religion, giving rise to civil unrest or other implications.  That is the modern progressive approach to the whole issue of blasphemy.</P>
        <P>The Minister, instead of looking outward, has looked backwards.  I have acknowledged that if he feels it essential &mdash; nobody denies it is in the Constitution &mdash; Fine Gael&rsquo;s position is that this is not the way to deal with it; that is why the sections are opposed.  The Law Reform Commission report of 1991 concluded that the offence of blasphemy had no place in a society which respects free speech, and recommended that the reference in the Constitution be deleted as part of any extensive revision of anachronistic or anomalous constitutional provisions.  Perhaps I could draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to what I am saying.  That is Fine Gael&rsquo;s position.  This should be taken out of the Constitution.  We should not run away from the issue when it has been identified by all the relevant bodies.</P>
        <P>If, however, we take the position that it must be established in legislation, based on the modern view of blasphemy and language which is offensive to followers of a particular religion, the progressive and modern approach to deal with that is through the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act.  It is a neat fit.  Taking the Minister&rsquo;s premise, and as determined by the High Court in the Corway case, it is for the Oireachtas to define the offence of blasphemy.  To define it in these terms resolves the issue.</P>
        <P>If the Minister says we are not to have a referendum to act on the problem, to suggest the only option is the one the Minister has outlined in the Bill is incorrect.  There is a more neat fit.  I would have suggested in a verbal amendment to meet the Minister on this that the offence provided for at section 2 of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 constitutes the offence of the publication of blasphemous matter as provided for in Article 40.6.1&deg; of Bunreacht na n&Eacute;ireann.  That would ensure that if we are not removing the provision of the blasphemous offence in the Constitution, that would fulfil any obligation which might rest with the Oireachtas to rectify this situation and implement that provision of the Constitution pending its deletion.</P>
        <P>That is the appropriate way to deal with it.  The explanation given by the Minister and the issues and problems which arise from the manner in which this is being dealt with in the legislation &mdash; where we are defining religion and providing for all sorts of provisions on Garda intervention, and where the Minister has acknowledged he has designed this so it will never <Col N="1052"/>happen &mdash; is not fulfilling the Minister&rsquo;s obligations under the Constitution to draft legislation of that order.  On that basis I will press this amendment.</P>

	<P>Pursuant to Standing Order 128, I want to propose a verbal amendment without notice, as I am entitled to do.</P>
        <P>The amendment is pursuant to the matter discussed earlier in the presence of the Minister, that section 35 be amended, that in section 35(3), after the word &ldquo;scientific,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or academic&rdquo; be replaced with the words &ldquo;academic, religious or other&rdquo; so that the defence to proceedings provided for in subsection (3) shall now read, &ldquo;It shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the defendant to prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, academic, religious or other value in the matter to which the offence relates.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>Senator Mullen already proposed this amendment for Report Stage and I ruled it was too late to table it because Report Stage had already commenced.  The proposal the Senator is now making was discussed in detail on Report Stage, in the debate on the two amendments tabled by Senators Regan and Cummins.  I am ruling that the proposal is not in order as a verbal amendment.  Standing Order 128, which relates to Fifth Stage, cannot be used <Col N="1055"/>as a guise for resubmitting an amendment that I ruled was too late for Report Stage.  The question is: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>On a point of order, the fact is that it was not previously submitted.  It was out of the discussion on the amendments that the necessity of the change emerged.  I proposed a variation of this to the Minister which would take cognisance of the suggestion he makes that we have an obligation to make some provision for the offence of blasphemy, that is, to define that defence in the context of the legislation on incitement to hatred.  My proposal was that the offence provided for under section 2 of the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial Religious or National Hatred Act 1989 constituted the offence of blasphemy.  I wished to move a verbal amendment to that effect.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, returning to the House?  I understand it is customary.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1058"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>He may.  I do not know.  I will allow spokespersons and the Minister to speak on what is in the Bill.  I ask Members to respect the House.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This aspect of the Defamation Bill, namely, blasphemy was not in the Bill that was initiated in this House.  We never had the opportunity to debate and discuss the matter until today.  It was tabled as an amendment to the Bill as passed by the Seanad by the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  The debate in the D&aacute;il was guillotined, so there was no debate on this matter in the D&aacute;il.  As we are rushing the Bill and the Minister is choosing to rush legislation in this fashion, we have a situation today where we had a lengthy debate on the matter and identified alternative approaches which would make for better legislation, but because of the rush the Minister is not inclined to entertain the amendments tabled today.  The blasphemy aspect of the Bill is a backwards step in legislation on the issue of defamation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not allowing Second Stage speeches.  I want comments on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It damages the credibility of the entire Bill and the reform intended in it regarding defamation.  I regret the method by which the Minister has dealt with this matter and the rushed manner in which he has pushed it through this House.  The Seanad can contribute significantly to the refinement of legislation, whether instigated here or in the D&aacute;il and that has been demonstrated today.  The closeness of the vote might reflect the outrage at the formulation, method and provisions on blasphemy the Minister has brought to this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Regan said, it is most unfortunate that we had to vote against this Bill.  I speak for Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others when I say we welcomed much of what was in the Bill and recognised it represents a genuine attempt to reform the law on defamation.</P>
        <P>However, the Minister scuppered the general support for the Bill with an ill-judged and unnecessary amendment which was brought in, as Senator Regan said, at very short notice, was subject to a guillotine in the D&aacute;il and with which I fundamentally disagree.  This amendment, which gave a statutory definition for the offence of blasphemy, was a most backward and regressive step which was not required by the Supreme Court in the Corway decision.  Reading the Corway judgment again, it does not require legislation to be passed providing for a statutory definition of blasphemy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may not make a Second Stage speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Supreme Court did not strike down section 13 of the 1961 Act, nor was there any pressing urgency.  Further, no prosecutions for blasphemy had been initiated which could not be sustained.</P>
        <P>As I indicated, I disagree with the Minister on whether it was necessary to insert a statutory definition of blasphemy.  It is unfortunate this has been done.  If the interpretation had been agreed, an alternative approach was available, namely, Senator Regan&rsquo;s excellent verbal amendment to insert instead a proviso that the offence of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, given that the Bill has been guillotined, the Senator should be allowed to make final submissions. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is incorrect.  The Bill was not guillotined. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1059"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude.  An alternative proffered by Senators on this side was not countenanced by the Minister.  The real alternative, however, is to change the Constitution to remove reference to the outdated offence of blasphemy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot claim the Bill was guillotined.  Those who listened to this afternoon&rsquo;s debate will have noted that Senators adopted a pedantic approach and took the scenic route to finalising the legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House, albeit not necessarily for bringing this legislation before the Seanad.  I find the blasphemy section the least offensive part of the Bill.  I remain concerned about the imbalance between citizens who are defamed and those who defame them, namely, the media with their power and financial resources.  We have not struck the right balance and I hope the Privacy Bill will restore the necessary balance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the courteous and interesting way with which he dealt with the Bill.  I do not agree with him on the legislation and, unlike my colleague, Senator Bacik, I objected to many of its principal clauses.  I urged my case but the Minister did not accept it.  I found his interventions illuminating and interesting, particularly the story he told yesterday about a couple and the fact that he attached a clause&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In any case, the Minister is always interesting.  My only regret is that due to the frailties of the flesh, which I have just demonstrated in another sense, I was deprived of his presence during the discussion of the Bill.  I will continue to be an adherent of the cult of which he is at the centre. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not altogether sure I wish to speak because in doing so I may raise another hare.  I thank Senators for their contributions.  As Senator Walsh noted, we took a circuitous and scenic route around the Bill on which everyone had an opportunity to speak.  As such, it is not correct to claim it was guillotined.</P>
        <P>We have been dealing with this legislation since 2006.  It was ventilated and, some would argue, delayed in the Seanad which took a long time deliberating on it.  To be fair, however, the deliberations of the Seanad proved helpful in the D&aacute;il because much of the teasing out of the legislation had been done at great length in this House.</P>
        <P>I cannot abide hypocrisy.  It is the case, and I say this advisedly, that the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is inviting a response. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was subjected to criticism from Senator Regan but I can give it as much as the next fellow.  The Labour Party tabled amendments in the D&aacute;il and then spoke and voted against them and in favour of another amendment.  Today, a similar approach has been taken, albeit by the Fine Gael Party, in that Senator Regan tabled an amendment but then sought to have another amendment passed when his initial amendment was not successful.  In effect, he accepted the principle of my argument that there is a requirement under the Constitution to have blasphemy made an offence punishable in accordance with the law.  We may not like it but, as I indicated, linguistic gymnastics will not get around this statement, which is one of the starkest in the Constitution. </P><Col N="1060"/>
        <P>I have no doubt that this matter will be subject to review by the Oireachtas, probably in the not too distant future.  We need to examine the issue of balance raised by Senator Walsh.  The Privacy Bill, which is on the Order Paper, will probably afford the D&aacute;il and Seanad an opportunity to address the issue of privacy.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Bill will finally be passed today.  As I stated earlier, it is not legislation I would have liked on my Christmas card list.  We should now proceed to pass it into law, at which point I hope the President will sign it.</P>
        <P>One genuine benefit of this legislation to ordinary people is that it enables apologies to be made without admission of liability.  In my experience as a solicitor, litigants are much happier to receive an apology within a week of an offending article being published.  In many cases, the media outlet in question would also prefer to issue an apology but its lawyers argue that an apology constitutes an admission of liability.  The legislation will allow a media organ or an individual who is a defendant to make an apology without admission of liability.  This is probably the most important advance in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have been the Minister to have this legislation passed.  I hope we will not have to use the review mechanism often.  As I indicated, however, the legislation provides for a review by the Oireachtas within not more than five years.  The review could be done earlier.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed groupings.  Senators may speak only once on each group.   The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the presence of Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness and other members of the Law Reform Commission whom I thank for the work they carried out in the preparation of this Bill.  I also thank the commission&rsquo;s staff. </P>
        <P>The principal amendment in Part 1 is amendment No. 12, which provides in the new text of section 5(3) for the making of regulations during a five-year period following commencement to remove any difficulty encountered in bringing a provision of the Act into effect.  This may be done only on condition, first, that any modification is in conformity with the purposes, principles and spirit of the Act and, second, that a draft of any such regulations shall be laid <Col N="1061"/>before both Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the amendments to Part 2, amendments Nos. 14 to 22, inclusive, is to improve the presentation and clarify the meaning of the relevant provisions.</P>
        <P>Section 21 provides for the &ldquo;over-reaching&rdquo; of equitable interests in land, for example, where a person is part-owner by virtue of having contributed to the purchase or renovation of a house but is not registered as legal owner, in order that the purchaser obtains clean title.  Arising from the discussions that have taken place, there were concerns that section 21 may go too far in over-reaching the equitable interests of a person who is in actual occupation of the land.  While subsection (4) provides for registration of an equitable interest in the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds, thereby preventing any over-reaching of that interest, section 72 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 provides that actual occupation is a burden affecting the land regardless of whether it is registered.  It is intended, therefore, to retain the provision in section 72 of the 1964 Act.  This will mean that the equitable interest of a person in actual occupation will not be over-reached even if that interest has not been registered in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  The existing practice whereby an intending purchaser must make inquiries as to who is in actual occupation of the land or to whom rent is paid will therefore be retained.  Amendments Nos. 23 and 25, together with Amendment No. 141, achieve the desired result.</P>
        <P>The amendments to Part 8, which deals with contracts and conveyances, relate to the root of title, formalities for deeds and words of limitation.  The Bill as passed by the Seanad reduces the period in respect of which a purchaser may require proof of the root of title under the Vendor and Purchaser Act 1874 from 40 years to 20 years.   The purpose of amendments Nos. 44, 45 and 46, which have the agreement of the Law Society, is to reduce that root of title period further to 15 years.  These changes will help to simplify further and streamline conveyancing formalities.  The amendments to the provisions on formalities for deeds are intended to clarify those provisions.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 47 and 49 provide that a deed executed under section 62 has effect as if it were a document executed under seal.</P>
        <P>Section 65 will abolish words of limitation in the case of unregistered land.  This is already the case for registered land under section 123 of the Registration of Title Act 1964.  Amendment No. 50 makes it clear that a conveyance of unregistered land, with or without words of limitation, passes the grantor&rsquo;s entire estate or interest unless a contrary intention is apparent in the conveyance.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 arise from comments made by the conveyancing committee of the Law Society.  The purpose of the amendments is to hive off subsections (5) to (7) of section 65 into a separate new section and to clarify and improve the presentation.</P>
        <P>Regarding Part 11, the main amendment of substance is amendment No. 98.  This is a technical amendment which proposes to remedy a shortcoming which has come to light in section 25 of the Registration of Title Act 1964.</P>
        <P>The amendments to Schedule 1 provide for the amendment of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 and further amendments to the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the amendments to Schedule 2 take account of provisions in the Statute Law Revision Act 2007, including the discovery of more obsolete statutes which can now be repealed.</P>

	<P>I have no objections to these amendments.  In fact, I have no objections to the Bill which is an extraordinary piece of work.  Anyone who has studied law or has <Col N="1062"/>had any dealings with property will know the complications of this area.  The Bill is a monumental piece of work when one sees the list of statutes which are either being amended or repealed.  The scope of the work is quite extraordinary.  One can gather that from the manner in which it is drafted.  Given that there have been quite a number but not so extensive a number of amendments in the D&aacute;il, I hesitate to delve into them now as it might only complicate this very technical area.  This good Bill has been well drafted.  I congratulate the Law Reform Commission on the extraordinary work it has done in preparing the ground for the Bill before us.  Although I wanted to make those general remarks, I have no objections to these amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is legislation we cannot be accused of guillotining and rushing through the House.  It was initiated in the Seanad on 7 June 2006 when I was a Member of the Lower House, so it has taken a long time.  I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach was deeply involved in the legislation at that stage.  I concur with my colleague, Senator Regan, that it is excellent legislation.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Law Reform Commission on its excellent work not only in this area but in many other areas as well.  I always study the reports of the commission whose staff must be congratulated on their consistency in dealing with complex matters.  Sometimes the Oireachtas can be accused of not reacting quickly enough to some of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  By and large, however, they are well appreciated by Members of the Oireachtas, including members of the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This great legislation is both reformative and informative.  I congratulate the Minister on eventually bringing the Bill to its rightful conclusion.  For a change, three years plus for legislation going through the Oireachtas is a counterbalance to the accusations we sometimes hear that we are rushing measures through the House by guillotining debate.  This Bill has had a lengthy debate in both Houses and in Committee.  I commend the Bill and thank the Minister and his officials for the excellent work that went into drafting it.</P>

	<P>Yes.  The second group of amendments, Nos. 28 and 29, insert a new Part 5 which makes specific statutory provision for the first time in Irish law for the variation of trusts.  The enactment of such a provision was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in two reports entitled The Rule against Perpetuities and Cognate Rules, and The Variation of Trusts.  In both reports, the commission recommended that the abolition of the rules in question, which are being repealed in section 16, be accompanied by the enactment of statutory provisions to permit the variation of trusts.  That is the purpose of this new Part.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The third group of amendments relates to Part 7 of the Bill dealing with appurtenant rights, that is, rights that permit one landowner to do something on a neigh<Col N="1063"/>bour&rsquo;s land, or entitle that landowner to prevent the neighbour from doing something on that neighbour&rsquo;s land.</P>
        <P>The amendments to section 33 arise from discussions on the acquisition of easements by means of the doctrine of lost modern grant.  Following a review of the relevant provisions, an element of flexibility currently available under lost modern grant is re-introduced.</P>
        <P>The proposed new subsection (3) to be inserted in section 33 by amendment No. 33 provides that where the relevant user period was not immediately before the commencement of the action to establish the existence of the easement, the court may none the less make an order declaring the existence of the easement if it is satisfied that it is just and equitable in all circumstances of the case.  This will permit the court to have regard to factors such as long use of the easement, even if that use has been discontinued prior to commencement of the action.  The purpose of amendment No. 34 is to clarify the provision relating to incapacity.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 38 makes it clear that the adjoining owner may apply to the court for an order requiring that any damage be made good if the building owner fails to do so within a reasonable time.  Alternatively, if the building owner fails to reimburse the costs and expenses of doing so within a reasonable period, the adjoining owner may recover the costs and expenses as a simple contract debt.  This provision received some discussion in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40<b> </b>substitute revised text for sections 46 and 47, which deal with the enforceability of freehold covenants.  Amendment No. 41<b> </b>makes it clear that a person may apply for a court order in respect of freehold covenants which were entered into before, as well as after, the commencement of the legislation.  The purpose of the new section 42(4), to be inserted by amendment No. 43,<b> </b>is to provide that any orders made by the court under this section to discharge or modify a freehold covenant are registered in the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds, as appropriate.  This will ensure that any intending purchasers of the land will be aware of changes made under such an order to covenants affecting the land.</P>
        <P>The fourth group of amendments relates to Part 9, dealing with mortgages, and Part 10, dealing with judgment mortgages. The effect of the changes to section 86(2) in amendment No. 59<b> </b>is that any attempt to mortgage land by any method other than a charge by deed shall not create a legal mortgage.  The advantage of this approach is that it will greatly simplify the law by requiring a charge by deed for all legal mortgages of land.  An exception to this rule is made in the new section 86(3) for transactions under a statutory provision.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 62 provides a new text for section 89 which deals with restrictions on consolidation.  Regarding amendment No. 63, concerns were expressed to my Department that the original scope of section 91 was too broad and might have unintended consequences.  The intention behind this section is to put into statutory form the right of a borrower, not a lender, who may be facing financial difficulty to seek a court order to sell the mortgaged property to reduce his debts or to prevent them from mounting further.  The text has been redrafted to make this clearer.  In addition, a new section 89(4) has been added which will mean that except in the case of a housing loan mortgage, this section will take effect subject to the mortgage.  These changes address the concerns which had been raised about the original text of this section.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the amendments to Chapter 3 is to strengthen protection for borrowers with a housing loan mortgage.  Under current law, the rights of borrowers are subject to the express terms of the mortgage.  If a mortgage deed contains express provisions with enhanced powers for the lending institution, protection for the borrower is reduced and the impact of statutory protections is weakened.</P>
        <P>The revised text of the section on powers and rights generally, as amended by amendment No. 64,<b> </b>makes it clear that the statutory powers and rights of lending institutions set out in <Col N="1064"/>Chapter 3 of Part 9 will apply in full to housing loan mortgages, irrespective of any other powers and rights included in the mortgage by the lending institution.  In other cases, such as commercial developments where very large sums may be involved, it will remain possible to include express provisions which override the statutory provisions.  It is usual in such cases to have professional support and advisers to ensure that the mortgage deed fully reflects the intentions of the parties.  Amendment<b> </b>No. 67, which deletes subsections (3) to (6) of section 94, and amendments Nos. 72 and 73, which replace the text of section 97 and insert a new section 98, respectively, contain related changes.</P>
        <P>The most significant change here is the new provision in amendment No. 72, which provides that the power of sale will in future be subject to obtaining a court order.  It is a rather curious anomaly of current law that a court order is required to obtain possession of property with a view to selling it, but the power to sell can be exercised without such an order.  In practice, a lending institution will find it very difficult to sell residential dwellings without vacant possession and this means that a court order for possession is generally sought in advance of sale.  I am also including a provision in section 97 requiring that consent be given within the seven day period prior to the taking of possession or within the seven day period prior to exercise of the power of sale, as the case may be.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 67 deletes subsections (3) to (6) of section 94, which give the court a wide margin of discretion to adjourn proceedings where a lending institution is seeking an order for possession of mortgaged property.  These subsections reappear in the new section 98.  In that section, the scope of these subsections is extended to cases in which the lending institution is seeking an order for the sale of the property.  The new section 98 gives the courts discretion to adjourn proceedings, or to attach conditions to any order it may make, where an order for possession is sought under section 94 or an order for sale under section 97.</P>
        <P>I have been concerned for some time that certain lending institutions appear to be commencing proceedings for the repossession of dwellings on a routine basis in the High Court rather than the Circuit Court, and that this is deterring the borrowers in question from defending the proceedings and benefiting from the margin of discretion which the courts have in such proceedings.  I have particular experience from my constituency about this.  This practice has been condemned by the Master of the High Court.  Before he said anything in public, I had asked my officials to look at this issue as I am aware of a number of cases involving people who should not have been given a loan and were refused by the main banks, but who went to what are known as sub-prime lenders.  The sub-prime lenders gave them the money and the people ultimately defaulted on their payment for relatively small amounts of money, and ended up with a High Court summons.  That is grossly unfair, so I asked my officials to bring in an amendment making it a requirement that proceedings for repossession by lending institutions have to be commenced in the Circuit Court, rather than in either court.  Several High Court judges also expressed their dismay in cases where borrowers do not make an appearance and enter a defence.</P>
        <P>People from outside Dublin are reluctant not to respond to a High Court summons.  Bringing them before the Circuit Court is a bit closer to home and might cause some embarrassment to them, but to be fair to the media and to the county registrars and the judges who operate this in the Circuit Court, there is an understanding that these are difficult cases and little publicity is given to them.  I urge that this continue.</P>
        <P>In future, it will be obligatory for lending institutions to commence repossession proceedings in the case of housing loan mortgages in the Circuit Court rather than the High Court.  Proceedings for repossession other than those relating to housing loan mortgages may continue to be taken <i>ab initio</i> in the High Court.  This change will encourage borrowers who are experienc<Col N="1065"/>ing genuine difficulties in keeping up with their mortgage repayments to enter an appearance and benefit from the margin of discretion and flexibility which the courts exercise in this area.  The purpose of all these amendments is to strengthen consumer protection.</P>
        <P>The existing text section 104(1), dealing with the appointment of a receiver, refers back to provisions in section 97(1) and this has caused some confusion. <b> </b>Amendment No. 78 drops the cross-reference to section 97.  Amendment No. 84<b> </b>rearranges the contents of subsections (1) and (2) of section 110 to clarify their meaning.</P>
        <P>Part 10 of the Bill, dealing with judgment mortgages, replaces with substantial modification the provisions of the Judgment Mortgage (Ireland) Acts 1850 and 1858.  Senator Norris spoke yesterday about the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill.  I gave an example where I registered a judgment mortgage when I was in practice, and he was delighted with the interesting aspect of that.  A creditor who has obtained a judgment against another person will have to apply to the Property Registration Authority to register a judgment mortgage against that person&rsquo;s estate or interest in land.</P>
        <P>It is intended to drop section 112 which had provided for an update of section 4 of the 1850 Act.  On further reflection, this provision is no longer required and the 1850 Act is repealed in its entirety in Schedule 2.  To avoid any misunderstanding, the revised text of section 113(1), inserted by amendment<b> </b>No. 88, makes it clear that a creditor who has obtained a judgment against another person has to apply to the Property Registration Authority to register a judgment mortgage against that person&rsquo;s estate or interest in land.  The existing wording could be misinterpreted to mean that the registration could be affected without application to the authority.  Amendment No. 89, which replaces the existing text of section 114, incorporates a cross-reference to section 29 of the Bill into section 114(1) of the Bill.  This will alert a judgment mortgagee to the fact that the application must be made under section 29 rather than section 114 in the case of co-owned land.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The fifth group of amendments inserts a new part into the Bill to make provision for the registration of a <i>lis pendens</i>.  It updates and streamlines several provisions which are contained in statutes dating back to the 19th century and facilitates the repeal of those provisions.  The existing section 121 of the Bill makes provision for the protection of purchasers where registration of a <i>lis pendens</i> has not taken place.  It has become apparent since the Bill was published that the general law in this area is confusing and needs to be codified.  Codification has an added advantage of facilitating the repeal of various provisions in statutes dating back to 1844, 1867 and 1871.  The new section 117 contains the relevant definitions.</P>
        <P>Section 118 makes provision for keeping the register, which is already maintained in the central office of the High Court.  Under section 118(4), a <i>lis pendens</i> already registered under the 1844 Act and not vacated when this legislation comes into force will continue to have effect as if the 1844 Act had not been repealed.  It will be deemed to form part of the register to be maintained under section 118(1).  This will avoid the Courts Service having to re-enter it in a new register.  Section 119 allows for the cancellation of an entry in the register, while sections 120 and 121 permit the court to vacate an order under certain conditions.  Section 122 contains the provision which is currently in section 121.</P>
        <P>The sixth group of amendments deals with miscellaneous matters.  Senators will be aware of the difficulties being encountered in the retail sector as a result of the current economic circumstances.  The practice of including upward-only rent review clauses in commercial leases, which has become commonplace, has not arisen from any legislative requirement.  Parties have always been free to agree that more neutral review clauses should be included in their leases.  Even where upward-only review clauses are provided for, the parties can agree that a flexible <Col N="1066"/>approach should be taken to the amount of rent payable and the way it should be paid.  The advice of the Office of the Attorney General suggests it would be problematic, if not impossible, to interfere in a wholesale way with existing lease agreements.  In consequence, the amendment that was introduced deals with rent review clauses only in the context of future leases.  Accordingly, leases entered into prior to the commencement of section 131, or indeed, agreements for such leases, will not be subject to the new regime.  By virtue of that regime, future rent review clauses will be subject to the construction that the rent payable on review may be fixed at an amount which is less than, greater than or the same as the amount payable immediately prior to the date on which the rent falls to be reviewed.  This applies even if such a clause were to be couched in terms of upward-only movement.  Amendment No. 105 to section 122 addresses the concerns raised in the Seanad about the abolition of a sheriff&rsquo;s powers to seize a tenancy.  The Irish sheriffs association has expressed concerns about the proposal to abolish the seizure power.  These concerns are shared by the Revenue Commissioners.  When officials from my Department met representatives of the sheriffs association and the Revenue Commissioners to discuss the situation, it emerged that the seizure power is still used in the case of business tenancies where the objective is not to sell the leasehold itself but to occupy the premises for the purposes of selling the stock.  This means they do not have to move the stock to other premises for a salvage sale.  Amendment No. 105, therefore, proposes to retain the seizure power in the case of business tenancies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the explanations he has given.  I have no difficulty with any aspect of this Bill.  I would like to comment on an issue I came across, in a legal context, some time ago.  In her 2006 judgment in the case of Irwin <i>v.</i> Deasy, Ms Justice Laffoy said that one of the problems with co-ownership is that if one of the co-owners is in debt, a judgment mortgage cannot be enforced.  She identified as a lacuna in the law the fact that in the case of registered land, the courts do not have the jurisdiction to order sale in lieu of partition.  This is one example of the kind of intricate problems that can arise in this sector.  I understand it is rectified in Part 7 of this Act, which deals with co-ownership.</P>
        <P>The first Government of the Free State decided, in its constitution, to continue all existing statutes, whatever their origin.  This Bill contains an extraordinary list of old statutes, many of which predate this State, that are being repealed in whole or in part.  It is extraordinary that so much of our legislation predates the foundation of the State.  It would come as a surprise to many people that the statutes in question are still in existence.  As a result of this Bill, law students will be relieved of any requirement to scan the statutes in question.  It is noteworthy that the Statute De Donis Conditionalibus 1285 and the Statute Quia Emptores 1290 will be completely gone.  It seems that part of the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634 and the Statute of Frauds 1695 will still be with us, as we are not repealing them in full.  We will have to live with some of these older statutes for some time.  I compliment the Law Reform Commission and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on their extraordinary work in drafting this Bill.  I do not intend to make any further amendments, suggestions or observations at this stage.  I thank the Minister for presenting this excellent legislation, which has been debated at length by both Houses and by the Oireachtas committees, to the House today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Minister speak earlier about the issue of sub-prime mortgages.  I understand some people in his constituency who could not get loans from the standard mortgage lenders had to seek loans from sub-prime mortgage lenders.  It is clear, as ordinary borrowers reap the whirlwind of the dodgy lending of some such institutions, that the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab at the end of the day.  Repossessions have more than doubled in the past year, which is costing the State money in terms of court time and social <Col N="1067"/>welfare payments.  Like borrowers, lenders have responsibilities.  The doubling in the rate of repossession over the past year means that borrowers are paying a disproportionately higher price than lenders.  Sub-prime mortgage lenders, in particular, are rushing to the High Court at the earliest stage to get repossession orders.  When repossessions are granted, the State often has to step in and provide alternative accommodation.  In effect, the taxpayer is paying for the irresponsible actions of the lenders in the first place.</P>
        <P>We have repeatedly called for action to be taken to help people who get into difficulty with their mortgages to make good their debts.  The measures contained in the Bill before the House do not really represent a solution to the problems I have mentioned.  Having said that, the legislation is welcome on a number of grounds.  Lenders will now have to begin home repossession cases in the Circuit Court, rather than the High Court.  I ask the Minister to comment on whether procedures will change to reflect the change to the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>The Minister also spoke about rent reviews.  What is his best guesstimate for when this legislation will be enacted?  Will that happen within a number of months or weeks?  People want to avail of this potential means of reducing their outgoings.  We would be grateful if the Minister could clarify when he expects that to be in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing to prevent people who are currently entered into leases from entering into reviews with a view to reducing their rents.  We are trying to send a signal, albeit in relation to future leases.  I know the Labour Party has published a Bill.  We looked at it and to be honest it was endeavouring to meddle in the area of freely entered into leases and agreements, heretofore made.  Given that we are dealing with commercial property in this respect, it is inconceivable that these leases heretofore would have been entered into without legal advice.  Apart from the legal difficulties of intervening in a freely entered into contract, by legislation, it is fraught with all types of difficulties.  In the context of the upward-only rent reviews for the future, I wanted to, in effect, send a strong signal.  This has not yet commenced.  We accepted an amendment in the D&aacute;il to include agreements for leases, recognising that these have the same effect as leases.  Substantial representations were made to us and we recognise that. </P>
        <P>I also recognise that this to a certain extent, may very well discommode some of the transactions that are in planning, but there is no agreement.  Life in the commercial property sector is difficult enough as it is, so I indicated in the D&aacute;il that I would commence this part of the legislation at a time when we believe it is appropriate to bring them on.  I have done this with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, in so far as I was willing to listen to representations made to me to the effect that it could be done better than by statute.  If we find that from now on there is a reasonably level playing field and that new leases facilitate the ability to review rent downwards as well as upwards, then I would hesitate to bring this part of the legislation into operation.  To a certain extent this is something that will be kept under review and we shall consult with the various interests involved.</P>
        <P>As regards the case referred to by Senator Regan, from 2006, this is taken care of in Part 6, section 28(3) dealing with co-ownership.  The court order provision is in section 29.  We repealed section 2 of the Statute of Frauds in so far as this relates to contracts for sale or other dispositions of estates or interests in land.  In effect, we have repealed the Statute of Frauds in so far as it relates to land or interests in land.  Obviously we did not repeal it, in this legislation at least, as regards other types of property.  However, I acknowledge what the Senator says.  Given all these Acts we are now repealing, it will be a pleasure for law students for years to come that they do not have to wade through this multiplicity of legislation.  Hopefully, law students of the future will remember us lovingly because we have made the whole area of land law somewhat easier to study.</P>

	<P>I thank everyone concerned, my officials in particular, whom I forgot to thank as regards the Defamation Bill.  They have laboured long and I want to put on record my thanks for the work they did on that legislation.  Equally, I am thankful for the work the officials behind me did in relation to this Bill. </P>
        <P>I want to thank the Law Reform Commission.  A number of people attached to the commission are in the public Gallery, including Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness.  I thank them for the immense work they did on this Bill.  I will not add further to the comments I made earlier, but this is very good legislation which will stand the test of time.

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to acknowledge the work that has gone into this legislation.  Quite a number of amendments were taken on board.  The issue just mentioned by the Minister as regards the rent reviews is very contentious and has wide implications, but I believe what is included in the Bill is very appropriate.  It is extraordinary legislation because it deals with so many statutes and complex issues.  The combination of the Law Reform Commission and the hard work done in this House, particularly the drafting by the officials, add up to a superb body of work.  I compliment all concerned. </P>

Perhaps we are giving today&rsquo;s law students too much of a soft option in that they do not have to do so much research.  I should be worried lest they get lazy, because they will not have to put in the effort we had to in our day.  Having said that, I sincerely welcome the Bill and thank all those involved, including the Law Reform Commission.  It is mind boggling to consider that some of the statutes repealed here are 1,000 years old. </P>

        <P>In respecting the will of the people, the Government has also had regard to the desire of other member states, our European partners, to see the Lisbon treaty enter into force.  The desire to implement the reforms provided for in the Lisbon treaty has been sharpened by developments such as the global economic crisis, the disruption of gas supplies to a number of European countries last winter and the invasion of Georgia.  Those events have served to bring home the importance of having a coherent and well-run European Union that can help us cope with this economic downturn, protect jobs and work together to rebuild prosperity.</P>
        <P>Over the last 12 months, the Government has worked hard to find a way forward for Ireland in Europe which would give us what we wanted and could be accepted by all 27 member states.  Following a period of internal consultation in which the Oireachtas Sub-committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union played a significant role, the Government began a process of consultation with the other member states aimed at identifying a solution that would deal with Ireland&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>After intensive contacts and negotiations at the European Council in December 2008 the EU Heads of State and Government unanimously agreed &ldquo;that provided the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, a decision will be taken, in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, to the effect that the Commission shall continue to include one national of each member state&rdquo;.  On 19 June, the 27 Heads of State and Government repeated this firm, unambiguous commitment.  This means the Commissioner issue is settled.  Backing Lisbon will mean retaining our Commissioner indefinitely.  Claims that this arrangement is somehow time-limited are entirely bogus.</P>
        <P>This is a considerable win for Ireland as some member states favoured a smaller Commission.  Yet they were willing to accommodate Ireland on this point, because they accepted that his had been a real issue during our referendum campaign last year.  Following further intensive discussions with the member states, last month&rsquo;s European Council agreed a package of legally binding guarantees that respond comprehensively to the concerns of the Irish people.  Ireland&rsquo;s legally binding guarantees are in the form of a decision of the Heads of State and Government.  The European Council further agreed that the contents of this decision will be incorporated in a protocol to be attached to the EU treaties after the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  This will happen at the time of the next EU accession treaty.</P>
        <P>Our legal guarantees state that the protections in the Irish Constitution on the right to life, education and the family are not in any way affected by the Lisbon treaty; Ireland retains control of our tax rates; and Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected by the treaty.  The Council also adopted a substantive solemn declaration on workers&rsquo; rights and social policy.  The solemn declaration is designed to deal with the confusion that exists about the impact of the Lisbon treaty on workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
        <P>This treaty represents a real advance for workers&rsquo; rights.  This is because of the treaty&rsquo;s new horizontal social clause, which was originally inserted at Ireland&rsquo;s behest, and because the <Col N="1070"/>treaty gives legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU which contains important provisions relevant to the rights of workers.  The decision of the Heads of State and Government on the legal guarantees constitutes an international agreement.  EU leaders have accepted that these guarantees are legally binding and that they will take effect on the date when the Lisbon treaty enters into force.</P>
        <P>If there is a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 2 October, both the Lisbon treaty and the decision containing our legal guarantees will be registered with the United Nations under Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations.  Article 102 provides that all international agreements to which UN member states are party should be registered with the UN Secretariat after their entry into force.  The Heads of State and Government also agreed that the legal guarantees will be set out in a protocol to the EU treaties at the time of the conclusion of the next accession treaty.  As a protocol, the legal guarantees will form part of the fundamental law of the Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is of the view that we should put the Lisbon treaty, and the package of measures provided for in the proposed constitutional amendment, to the people again for their approval.  The fact that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will enable us to retain our Commissioner and secure a solemn declaration on workers&rsquo; rights and watertight legal guarantees on three key issues, means that the Lisbon treaty will be a different proposition for Ireland this year.  All the main concerns raised last year have been dealt with and the way is clear for a serious debate on the merits of the Lisbon treaty and Ireland&rsquo;s future in Europe.  The onus is on every Member of this House who believes in our European future to take this treaty to the people and to explain its importance for Ireland.  Our future in Europe depends on being able to join with our 26 EU partners in ratifying this treaty.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House is relatively short, containing only two sections.  Section 2 of the Bill provides the citation of the proposed amendment and the Title of the Bill itself.  The substance of the Bill is contained in section 1 which proposes that Articles 29.4.3&deg; to 29.4.11&deg; of the Constitution be amended and I am happy to explain to the House how we propose to do so.</P>
        <P>Article 29 of the Constitution covers Ireland&rsquo;s international relations and the provisions I have just mentioned deal with our membership of the EU.  It is more than 35 years since Ireland joined the European Union.  Over that period the Union has been at the centre of our engagement with our fellow EU members and with the rest of the world.  The Lisbon treaty sets out for the first time a clear and succinct statement of the Union&rsquo;s values.  The Union&rsquo;s values are our values.</P>
        <P>The new provisions of Article 29.4 set out in a streamlined and more user-friendly form how our engagement with the EU is to be governed.  It is proposed that part of subsection 29.4.3&deg; dealing with the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the Single European Act be deleted since the references are redundant.  The other subsections dealing with our membership of the EU, subsections 29.4.4&deg; to 29.4.11&deg;, will be replaced with new subsections 29.4.4&deg; to 29.4.9&deg;, which are set out in a Schedule to the Bill.  Part 1 of the Schedule contains these new texts in the Irish language and Part 2 contains the text in English.</P>
        <P>A proposed new subsection 29.4.4&deg; would contain a short statement of our commitment to the Union &ldquo;within which the member states...work together to promote peace, shared values and the well-being of their peoples&rdquo;.  This reflects our highly positive experience of membership going back to 1973.  It is in keeping with the values set out in Article 29.1, which affirms Ireland&rsquo;s devotion to peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality.</P><Col N="1071"/>
        <P>The proposed new subsection 29.4.5&deg; provides that the State may ratify the Lisbon treaty and be a member of the Union established by that treaty.  Since the treaty establishes a new Union with legal personality, it is proposed that the current subsections 29.4.4&deg;, 29.4.5&deg; and 29.4.7&deg; providing for the ratification of the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice be deleted as they will be made redundant by the Lisbon treaty.  The proposed new subsection 29.4.5&deg; would take effect after a successful referendum whereas the rest of the amendments provided for in the Bill would have effect only when and if the treaty enters into force, following its ratification by all 27 member states.</P>
        <P>The proposed new subsection 29.4.6&deg; ensures legal compatibility between the Lisbon treaty and the Constitution.  It carries forward constitutional cover for laws, Acts and measures &ldquo;necessitated&rdquo; by the obligations of our EU membership.  This provision is not new.  It is as old as our EU membership.  Every time we ratify a European treaty &mdash; the Single European Act, Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and now Lisbon &mdash; we make the same point.  Every time, the same claim is made that, suddenly, EU law will be superior to Irish law and the treaty will put the Irish Constitution out of business.  Each time, the opponents have been wrong and they are wrong again this time.</P>
        <P>The idea of primacy reflects a general principle of international law, recognised since 1937 by Article 29.3 of the Constitution of Ireland.  This provides that states must comply with international legal obligations freely undertaken by them in the exercise of their sovereignty.  The practical effect of the principle of primacy is that it offers certainty and clarity regarding the relationship between the Union&rsquo;s laws and those of the member states.  It applies only in those specific areas where the member states have conferred powers on the Union.</P>
        <P>This principle of conferral is an important feature of the Lisbon treaty.  It makes it clear that the Union does not have any powers of its own.  Its powers derive from sovereign decisions by the member states to give the Union certain powers.  These powers are carefully set out in the European Union treaties.  This is why European Union treaties tend to be somewhat complex.  They need to regulate relations between 27 sovereign states and their unique partnership within the Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me make it absolutely clear that the Constitution of Ireland will continue to be the basic legal document of the State and will continue to determine, in the final instance, the precise relationship between Irish and European Union law.  The ultimate <i>locus</i> of sovereignty will continue to reside with the member states rather than the Union.</P>
        <P>The proposed new subsection 7&deg; replaces the current subsections 6&deg; and 8&deg;.  It allows the State to exercise certain options and discretions provided for in the European Union treaties.  These include special arrangements Ireland has negotiated with respect to the area of justice and home affairs.  The Government may only exercise these options and discretions after obtaining the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>These arrangements provide for the participation of Ireland and the UK on a case-by-case basis in the following policy areas: general provisions for co-operation in the area of freedom, security and justice; policies on border checks, asylum and immigration; judicial co-operation in civil matters; judicial co-operation in criminal matters; and police co-operation.</P>
        <P>We made a declaration at the Intergovernmental Conference in 2007 that makes clear our intention to participate to the maximum extent possible in the relevant proposals in these areas.  Furthermore, we have made a commitment that we review our opt-out within three years.  Ending the opt-out, in whole or in part, is one of the options covered in the proposed new subsection 7&deg;.</P>
        <P>The options and discretions also include the possibility of participating in a process known as &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo;.  Enhanced co-operation allows a group of nine or more member <Col N="1072"/>states to choose to co-operate on a specific matter in areas in which the Union has non-exclusive competence.  Enhanced co-operation cannot expand the Union&rsquo;s competence.</P>
        <P>The proposed new subsection 8&deg; relates to the so-called passerelle clause under which the European Council can decide on a unanimous basis to extend the scope of qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers or to extend the scope of co-decision arrangements between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The mechanism may be applied in the following areas: the adoption of qualified majority voting or co-decision, subject to a right of veto by each national parliament; the common foreign and security policy, but not decisions having military or defence implications; judicial co-operation in regard to family law, in respect of which Ireland has an opt-out clause with the right to opt in on a case-by-case basis; social policy; fiscal measures relating to the environment; the adoption of the multi-annual financial framework; and within the ambit of an enhanced co-operation process.</P>
        <P>The subsection also gives specific cover for certain measures taken in the area of freedom, security and justice.  These are the extension of the scope of judicial co-operation on aspects of criminal procedure with a cross-border dimension, the identification of other areas of serious crime with a cross-border dimension, and the establishment of a European public prosecutor or the expansion of the EPP&rsquo;s role.</P>
        <P>Areas relating to freedom, security and justice covered in subsection 7&deg; are mentioned again in subsection 8&deg;.  This is being done to retain control by the Houses of the Oireachtas over these measures, if we should decide at some point to end our opt-out in the area of freedom, security and justice.  The treaty will give the national parliaments of the member states a direct input for the first time into European Union legislation.  These new provisions are contained in two additional protocols, one on the role of national parliaments and the other on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.</P>
        <P>Under the protocol on the role of national parliaments, all Commission Green and White Papers, the Commission&rsquo;s annual legislative programme and all draft legislation will be sent directly to national parliaments.  This requirement for direct and simultaneous transmission is intended to give national parliaments more time to consider Commission proposals.  The same procedure will apply to the annual report of the European Court of Auditors.</P>
        <P>The agendas for and outcomes of meetings of the Council of Ministers must also go directly to national parliaments.  Except in cases of urgency, at least eight weeks must elapse between the forwarding to national parliaments of draft EU legislation and its being placed on a Council agenda for decision.  In addition, the treaty provides that national parliaments must have at least six months&rsquo; notice of any intention on the part of the European Council to use the provisions of the treaty relating to voting in the Council of Ministers and extension of the co-decision procedure between the Council and the European Parliament.  Unanimity is also required in the European Council for any such move.  Any national parliament can veto such a move.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, under the terms of the new subsection 8&deg; of this amendment, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be required to change the voting rules in the Council.  This means that, under the treaty, Ireland has a double veto, exercisable by either the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Protocol on the Application of the Principles of Subsidiarity and Proportionality further develops the role of national parliaments regarding the implementation of these important principles.  The principle of subsidiarity is designed to ensure that the European Union takes action only when this is necessary and appropriate.</P>
        <P>Within eight weeks of the transmission to it of a draft legislative Act, any national parliament, or any chamber of a parliament, may send to all European Union institutions a &ldquo;reasoned <Col N="1073"/>opinion&rdquo; stating why it considers that the draft does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  Account must be taken of these reasoned opinions.  If, within eight weeks, at least one third of national parliaments, or chambers of national parliaments, issue such reasoned opinions, the draft proposal must be reviewed.  It may thereafter be maintained, amended or withdrawn.  In the case of proposals in the areas of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation, the threshold is one quarter.  This so-called &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; system is a major development which will bring national parliaments directly into the EU decision-making process.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the particular sensitivity of freedom, security and justice matters, the Lisbon treaty contains a number of specific provisions associating national parliaments more closely with the Union&rsquo;s activities in this area.</P>
        <P>The various provisions I have just mentioned will expand very significantly the role of the Oireachtas in European Union affairs.  In order to meet these responsibilities and reforms, it is essential that every Minister appears before the Oireachtas committee relevant to his or her portfolio prior to and after Council meetings to brief Members.  That is an important change that needs to be made.</P>
        <P>I am aware of proposals from Fine Gael and the Labour Party on scrutiny and how directives are transposed in Ireland.  I look forward to further discussions in the Oireachtas in the months ahead on the arrangements for discharging these new responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The proposed new subsection 9&deg; repeats the prohibition on Irish participation in any European Union common defence.  This provision was originally inserted in the Constitution at the second referendum on the Treaty of Nice.  A change in Ireland&rsquo;s position can come about only if the people decide so in a referendum.  As I have already explained to the House, the Government has now secured an additional legal guarantee which makes clear that the Lisbon treaty &ldquo;does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality&rdquo;.  The same guarantee makes clear that the treaty &ldquo;does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment would delete Article 29.4.11&deg;, which allows the State to ratify the agreement relating to Community patents.  This agreement never came into force.</P>
        <P>The text of this constitutional amendment is relatively accessible.  It is available on our website <i>www.lisbontreaty.ie</i> together with the texts of the treaties and our White Paper which tries to explain as clearly as possible the provisions of the treaty and Ireland&rsquo;s legal guarantees.  We have a duty to inform voters of the treaty&rsquo;s contents and implications.  We will spare no effort over the coming months in helping voters make their own assessment of the Lisbon treaty and the important legal guarantees that now accompany it.</P>
        <P>I hope the electorate will go beyond the detail and look at the big picture.  Who can dispute the enormous positive influence that membership of the European Union has had on our country?  Our farming community has benefited to the tune of &euro;41 billion from the Common Agricultural Policy.  A further &euro;20 billion has come to Ireland in structural funding.  European Union membership has helped transform our country.  We would not be what we are today without our tradition of active and constructive European engagement.  This is something we need to continue.  IBEC put it well yesterday when it said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The last year has taught us that our future success is inextricably linked to the ambitions and interests of our partners in Europe, and to the success of Europe in the wider world.  The Lisbon treaty streamlines decision-making, gives Europe a stronger voice on the world stage and gives European citizens a greater say.  It is a good deal for Ireland, and a good deal for Europe.</P><Col N="1074"/>
        <P FLI="0">Looking back at our experience, we can safely say that the European Union has been faithful to the commitment it shares with the member states to work together to promote peace, shared values and the well-being of their peoples.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty is the culmination of almost ten years of discussion about institutional issues.  These issues are important.  Europe needs a properly functioning Union if it is to cope with the challenges of the future.  Now that we have 27 member states, we need to make adjustments in the way the Union operates.  Getting the balance right means making sure the Union can deliver better for us in the years ahead.  I look forward to the day when we can turn away from debates about European Union structures and concentrate on its actions.  There is much to be done in dealing with the economic and financial crisis, with the challenges of climate change and with the risks we face in the area of energy security.</P>
        <P>Europe said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to us last month.  Our European partners met all of our concerns with understanding.  They agreed to accommodate us by agreeing to the retention of a commissioner and by giving us a series of legal guarantees.  They showed themselves to be true partners, truly committed to Europe in which the needs of all member states are catered for and our interests reconciled.  I hope that, when the time comes, our people will decide to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Lisbon and to Europe.   A positive outcome on 2 October will be vital for Ireland and for our future within the Europe Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate, which has occupied much of the psyche of the Irish nation in the recent months.  Today is not the day to focus on the past campaign, but I have no doubt that theses and many studies will be done on the dynamics of that campaign and what exactly happened.  There is quite a story to be told about it, about the dynamics and funding of it and the scaremongering that took place.  There is much to examine in the months and years ahead.  However, now is the time to focus on the future and it is extremely important that we do so.  If and when the Lisbon treaty is passed, we should speak about the areas that can be positively influenced by its passage, the progress that can be achieved on climate change and on tackling crime.  Crime knows no borders.  Therefore, we must act together within Europe.  That would be made possible and feasible with the greater efficiencies that would be achieved with that the passing of the Lisbon treaty in terms of members states working better together.  </P>
        <P>On the area of foreign policy, it would not mean that we would agree on everything but on those areas where we do agree and where it is in the interest of the world that Europe speaks with one voice, we would now have one strong voice.  That is an important consideration.  We know Irish people&rsquo;s interest in development issues.  Our Army personnel participate on peace-keeping duties and  have built up a great reputation for the work they do over many years.  We know the wonderful work that is being done all over the world.  That, too, can be done even more effectively and efficiently when this treaty is passed.</P>
        <P>We know the problems we face in energy security.  When the Lisbon treaty is passed, energy security can also be dealt with more effectively, and the list goes on.  At a time when unemployment is rising and our country is in such a crisis, there is no doubt that if we work more effectively as a Union, we would be in a better position to deal economically with the economic threats we currently face.  The passing of the treaty would mean that it would be better for individuals because they would have more opportunity to work and to regain employment, as more initiatives would be introduced at European level.  Looking to the future rather than to the past, these are the kinds of areas that will be strengthened as we work together on this treaty.  Fine Gael is committed to ensuring this treaty is passed.  We believe it is in the interests of this country, our individual citizens, our unemployed and the world.</P><Col N="1075"/>
        <P Just="Left">I have heard people who would argue against the treaty say that nothing has changed, but everything has changed.  We are in a different situation.  Life has moved on.  The Minister outlined a series of changes which mean that the package is different.  There is a different context now and the world is a different place.  The economics of the world are different.  The position Ireland finds itself in regard to the understanding of the treaty is different because there are many explanations.  There are new protocols and new agreements.  The Government has worked with the other member states and got a response.  We will have a Commissioner, the loss of our Commissioner being one of the key issues that featured on the posters of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side of the campaign.  That position has changed and I could go on.  There are many things that are different.  We are in a new situation with new understandings, carefully garnered from work with the other countries and carefully put into place, as the Minister outlined.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Europe said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to us last month.  Our European partners met all of our concerns with understanding.  They agreed to accommodate us by agreeing to the retention of a commissioner and by giving us a series of legal guarantees.  They showed themselves to be true partners.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a changed situation and it is one that we have an obligation to impart to the Irish people.</P>
        <P>It is important during the course of this debate that we get the tone of the debate right.  Much scaremongering took place on one side of the campaign on the last occasion.  It is equally important that there is not scaremongering of those of us who want to see a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on this occasion.  The people have a right to hear what is being negotiated, to hear about the new declarations and protocols and to understand them.  They have a right to make up their mind whether they will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We cannot take for granted that there will be a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on this occasion.  The tone of the debate and the information that will be given to the people will be extremely important in terms of how they vote.  The course of the campaign will be important.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to give attention to the proposals we suggested, for example, on directives.  I would not underestimate the concerns people throughout the country have about many micro issues relating to the implementation of directives.  That needs to be given more attention.  Many interest groups have valid and serious concerns about the way Ireland implements directives.  There is a belief that we do it differently from other countries.  We must examine these concerns, provide reassurances and do the work on that area.  That is important.</P>
        <P>It is essential that every Cabinet Minister should appear before an Oireachtas committee prior to and post Council meetings.  Ever since I was chairperson of the National Women&rsquo;s Council many years ago, I believed that there was a huge democratic deficit in terms of Council meetings and reporting back to the Oireachtas system.  That, in turn, means that people are not well informed.  We are not making the seamless linkage, which there should be, between Europe and the Irish citizen.  That is one of the reasons we failed to secure a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for the Lisbon treaty on the last occasion.  People felt there was a democratic deficit and disengagement.  This is an ideal opportunity to work constructively on these issues to change the ways we have dealt with Europe, to bring in new procedures and to give the feedback to the people, which will let them see what work is being done in Europe.  All my experience of working with European institutions, with the non-governmental sector at a European level and working on issues such as equality and poverty has been completely positive.  Many of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the last occasion said that they were pro Europe but they did not like X, Y or Z aspects of the treaty.  I genuinely believe that many of those issues have been dealt with by the work that has been done during the past number of months.</P><Col N="1076"/>
        <P>We face an economic crisis and how people vote on this occasion will shape our relationship with the European Union for years to come.  We should not risk damaging that relationship by voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There is no doubt about that.  If people genuinely believe that the treaty is bad for Ireland, let them prove it.  Where is the evidence and what are the reasons for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  People should put that information on the table so we can discuss it.  The treaty is good for this country, our fellow member states and the world.  One cannot say often enough that Europe has brought peace and prosperity to its member states.  It has also spread those values around the world wherever it can and it has reached out to developing countries.  All that becomes more possible with the passage of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Some say that it is undemocratic to reopen the debate and to have a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, but that is nonsense.  Our constitutional law is based on the principle that issues can be reopened at any stage.  If the people have changed their minds they have the right to express that.  Equally, they have the right to not change their minds.  That is democracy.  We voted twice on proportional representation, divorce, the Nice referendum, abortion and many other issues.  That is what democracy is about.  There is nothing wrong with putting an issue to the people again.  The notion that it is undemocratic to ask people to express their views again is nonsensical.</P>
        <P>There was a great deal of misinformation during the previous referendum campaign on the Lisbon treaty.  We must accept that communication by the pro-treaty side was not good.  We did not communicate the facts clearly enough about the treaty and we did not deal with the concerns that existed.  When the people did not understand, they did not vote in support of the treaty.  I met many women in particular who were concerned about conscription.  Right or wrong, that was their belief.  As the Minister outlined, that concern has been dealt with in detail.  Likewise, the guarantees on workers&rsquo; rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights are reassuring in their support for so many rights.  Again, that has to be sold in order to be understood and much work has to be done on it.</P>
        <P>Conscription is a matter for each member state as it involves the army of each state.  Most states do not have conscription and many of those which do are abandoning it.  There is absolutely no possibility whatsoever of conscription being introduced into this country on foot of the treaty&rsquo;s acceptance.  How can Europe introduce something it does not have the power to introduce, and conscript people into an army that does not exist?</P>
        <P>This is our chance to shape the future for ourselves and the millions of people who are in the Union.  The question is whether we are fearful of change or whether we embrace it, and through embracing it help to shape it.  There are many areas that we can influence for the better and many critical world issues on which we as part of Europe can have a stronger voice.</P>
        <P>There is much evidence that people are positive about Europe and that the European experience for this country has been positive.  We should not let the fear that was created by some groups that trade in misinformation damage the real story about Europe.  The referendum should be a campaign of truth, based not on myths about what is supposed to be in the Lisbon treaty but a true discussion by all of us about what is contained in the treaty.</P>
        <P>We need to send out the message clearly that the Lisbon treaty does not present a danger to this country and that Europe is not a threat because that is how it was perceived during the previous referendum campaign.  That is far from the truth.  The Lisbon treaty is about shaping Europe&rsquo;s and this country&rsquo;s future.  It is about defining our role in the 21st century as a proud nation and as a shaper of the future of the European Union to which we have contributed.  This referendum will shape or destroy the work, hopes and dreams of millions of others in the Union.  We want to do the right thing.</P><Col N="1077"/>
        <P>The context, package, understanding and economic situation are all different.  I look forward to the campaign, which will be different from the previous campaign.  However, there is a job of work to be done and we cannot be complacent.  We cannot take things for granted.  We must genuinely engage with people in the coming months.  I have heard people say that the way to get the Government out of office is to defeat the Lisbon treaty.  It would be a dreadful mistake to sacrifice this country&rsquo;s leadership role in Europe and our future prosperity and development by taking that approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is most welcome.  I wish him well in spearheading this campaign for the referendum, which will be held on 2 October.  Today&rsquo;s debate on the Lisbon treaty is the result of months of work by the Government and some of the most senior officials in the country to ensure the concerns of Irish people about Europe are addressed.  We have had ample opportunities to understand the reasons the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty failed.</P>
        <P>There have been tireless negotiations involving Ireland and its European partners to deal with the issues<b> </b>which arose during the previous referendum campaign.  My colleagues, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, spearheaded an all-out effort by the Government and our diplomats<b> </b>to ensure we received the most robust guarantees<b>.</b>  What has been achieved is significant.  I place on the record of the House my congratulations not only to the Minister and the Taoiseach but to all those who worked behind the scenes to ensure we achieved an acceptable package for Ireland.</P>
        <P>One of the concerns was that we would lose a Commissioner.  We have secured our Commissioner.  We will stay in control of our tax policy.  Irish neutrality will be unaffected.  We will remain in control of sensitive social issues.  Workers&rsquo; rights will be protected in this country and throughout Europe.  Part of that package will include the protection of the right to life, family and education, which will become legally binding once the treaty comes into effect.</P>
        <P>It is important that we communicate<b> </b>and engage with the public.  I welcome recent initiatives by the Government to ensure that people can easily access information about the treaty, the guarantees and European Union policy.  I am delighted to hear the Minister has launched two websites, <i>www.eumatters.ie</i> and <i>www.lisbontreaty.ie</i>, and it is important that they are up and running.  The first site explains the workings of the European Union.  It is important that the language we use is free from the jargon and bureaucracy that cut us off from Europe during the campaign on the previous referendum.  However, while the sites exist on the Internet we should remember that not everyone has a computer.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also hear that the Minister has launched an information postcard that will be sent to every house in the country.  I look forward to seeing that.  It should be the first step in opening people&rsquo;s minds to the discussion.  The postcard can be seen as the launch of the debate.  I also look forward to the distribution of the White Paper on the Lisbon treaty in libraries and other locations throughout the country.  I have only scanned through it.  We should encourage people to put it on their shelves.  The debate has begun and people should be discussing the treaty around the lunch table and the dinner table.  We should immediately begin to knock on doors.  The debate starts today and the Minister has asked us to get on with things from here.</P>
      
        <P>I have scanned the Lisbon treaty and the White Paper which deal with a whole range of issues, including how Union membership has affected Ireland, the legal guarantees, community values, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and fundamental rights, issues I would not want to have to discuss in detail with the public.  Of particular importance is, I believe, how the EU maintains its links with citizens.  There has been a perception heretofore that Europe was out there and that it made decisions in which we had no say.  For this reason, I welcome the concept of subsidiarity and that we will decide what is right for Ireland.</P><Col N="1078"/>
        <P>There have been many directives from the EU in regard to water control, farming, heritage and so on.  Many people with whom I have spoken are concerned that we had no say in such matters and that they were decided by the EU.  I am glad I will be in a position to tell them that will not happen now.  It is important we re-engage with the people on these issues.  We want a democratic Europe where the institutions are made simpler in terms of how they work and the language they use and which will be more accessible to everybody who wants to know what is going on in Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the previous referendum campaign Ireland did not have the problems it has today such as the economic crisis and failure of the banking system.  There are huge challenges ahead.  The shape of Europe is changing and we must consider whether we want to be marginalised or part of the new thinking.  While I agree we must address issues of security, cross border security and crime I hope that much of what we do, in terms of how we do our own business, will be done at home.  People are concerned that because we are small we are being absorbed by Europe.  While they accept this is acceptable when it comes to addressing bigger issues they believe in terms of day to day issues that we have lost our identity to Europe.</P>
        <P>I look forward to working with the Minister and Government on this campaign and to debating the future role of Ireland in Europe.  This legislation is a first step in that regard.  We must be at the heart of Europe and we must have a platform for our prosperity.  We have had our period of reflection and obtained our guarantees on the key issues.  We must now look at how we can connect with the public in this regard.  There is a responsibility on all of us, including Members of this House, to look at how this can be done.  Many issues being debated in Europe could be brought to the floor of this House as a way of connecting with the public.  I see nothing wrong with Members of the European Parliament regularly attending this House to debate whatever is the issue of the day.  We could make more use of this Chamber in this way.</P>
        <P>We have the basis for a success story but we must go out and sell it.  There will be many divergent views on this subject and we must ensure we are good at our job.  We must assimilate the information, understand it and explain it to people in simple language.  We will need to know how to explain every detail in a simple manner to ensure the public supports us in wanting to be at the heart of Europe.  I wish the Minister well.  I hope the media will give more balanced coverage in this regard from here on.  All political parties need to go out and sell this treaty to the people; it is the only way forward for our success story in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister and his team on the work done in Europe during the past few months, which has been, as I stated previously when the Minister was not in the House, very impressive.  The Minister has done difficult but important work.  I extend those words of congratulations to the Minister&rsquo;s team of advisors who I am sure also did a huge amount of work in this regard.  It is very much appreciated.</P>
        <P>There is an important point that needs to made in this debate.  As Senator Fitzgerald correctly stated the world has changed since last year, as has people&rsquo;s understanding.  It is important to point out that not one word of the treaty has been changed.  That is crucially important in terms of our credibility having stated all last year and the previous year that we believed what was stated in the treaty.  However, we failed to convince people on issues from conscription, neutrality, pro-life, taxation and in regard to Commissioners.  It is important that the Minister when <Col N="1079"/>speaking about this stresses that point publicly.  If one word of the treaty had been changed we would have been in the same mess we were in last year with people suggesting such wording meant something different than it did.  What we have now is an interpretation by our European colleagues which confirms what we told the Irish people last year.  We can now go to the people and say that while we may not have been convincing enough or did not put enough effort into explaining the treaty last time, our credibility is sound.  What we said has been copperfastened, reinforced and underlined by our European colleagues.</P>
        <P>In terms of my view, I am unapologetically pro-Europe.  Almost everything for which I have fought in my public life, as an educationalist, a teacher representative, a politician, a trade unionist involved in the ICTU, is encompassed in this treaty.  The Charter of Rights is probably the issue of most importance to me.  I believe that the right to collective bargaining and the rights of workers is stitched into the treaty.  I accept not everybody shares that view, which is as it should be.  I believe that issues such as taxation and neutrality will be revisited many times in the future.  I can foresee a time when the Irish people will be seeking a European-wide view on taxation when our position has been undercut by others.  However, that is not a matter for now.  It is crucially important that we retain our control, autonomy, independence and constitutional right to govern our people as we see fit.</P>
        <P>Our neutrality is our independence, our autonomy, our power to take decisions on issues of importance to us.  I ask the Minister, when this issue is out of the way, to ensure we have a proper debate on neutrality.  I am not suggesting I have all the answers in this regard.  My views in this regard have changed many times down through the years.  It means different things to different people.  I know what I want it to mean but I know it is not a passive state, that we cannot idly stand by when wrong is being done.  I do not know what should be the exact line in this regard but I believe we must consider this.</P>
        <P>As Senator Fitzgerald stated, the world has changed.  There were times during the past six, seven, eight or nine months when we, having seen what happened to Iceland, welcomed our membership of Europe.  I am not suggesting this has solved all our problems but it gives us a different perspective in terms of where we are as part of a larger body that had to take note of our problems and allow us to draw on its resources when we needed them.  These were important.  I am not saying that is a treaty issue but I want to look at the bigger picture.</P>
        <P>In many ways, I am the wrong person to be talking about this.  During my years in European trade unions, I made more advances in Europe than I did in Ireland.  I remember fighting for employment equality legislation during the 1970s which the Government would not accept until we joined Europe.  All the legislation which I spent 30 years campaigning for was delivered in that first ten years of membership.</P>
        <P>The same happened with education.  I asked for a reference to education in the Maastricht treaty because different establishment bodies from 1956 did not want education to be included.  The charter of rights and recognition of workers rights was also crucial.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well and I will do my bit in this campaign.  I am a member of the group of trade unionists that supports the treaty.  I hope the Government has a strategy for the campaign and that the Minister will outline it to us on a county by county basis so we can put our shoulders to the wheel.</P>

Sin &iacute; an cheist faoin &aacute;bhar seo at&aacute;imid a phl&eacute; anocht.</P>
        <P>The Government has announced the referendum date for the second referendum and on 2 October the people will go to the polls for a second time to vote on the Lisbon treaty.  On 12 June 2008 almost 1 million people gave the Government their verdict on the Lisbon treaty.  By rejecting the treaty, they gave the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs a strong and unequivocal mandate upon which to negotiate a better deal for Ireland and the EU with their European counterparts.</P>
        <P>The people wanted substantial change to the existing treaty.  We wanted a better deal, a new treaty that contains the policy and political direction necessary to deliver a better Europe, a Europe that is democratic and accountable, that promotes workers&rsquo; rights and protects public services, a Europe that is positive and progressive.  As the global financial crisis began to unfold and the recession in Ireland deepened, we also wanted a new treaty that would challenge the failed policies of deregulation, centralisation and unfettered markets, the fingerprints of which are all over the text of the Lisbon treaty.  We wanted a new treaty that reflected the new social and economic challenges facing member states.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to deliver.  Not a single full stop, comma or word has been changed in the Lisbon treaty.  The proposition that will go before the Irish people on 2 October will be the very same treaty they rejected on 12 June 2008.</P>
        <P>When we brush aside all the meaningless rhetoric about &ldquo;legally binding guarantees&rdquo; we have nothing more than a series of clarifications on minor aspects of the Lisbon treaty.  When we come to vote on the Lisbon treaty in October we will be voting on exactly the same treaty, with exactly the same consequences for Ireland and the EU, as we did on 12 June 2008.</P>
        <P>The promise that we will retain our Commissioner must also be questioned.  The agreement by the Council of Ministers tells us we will keep our Commissioner for an unspecified period of time.  Unless this is written into an EU treaty, the likely outcome is that the reduction in size of the Commission envisioned in Lisbon will be delayed by five years until the next European parliamentary elections in 2014.  The Minister said that is nonsense.  He tells us and he will tell the Irish people that we have secured our Commissioner indefinitely but it is not written down in the guarantees.  I challenge the Minister to show us where it is set down because it was not set down for a reason.  This is an issue of trust.  Would anyone trust this Government to deliver on any commitment, be it on a European or domestic issue?  I certainly would not.</P>
        <P>On neutrality, the clarifications tell us that Irish troops can only be sent abroad with the consent of the Irish Government in the Council of Ministers and the Oireachtas.  This we already know but neutrality is not only what we do with our troops, it is also about the alliances we form, what we do with our resources and what other member states do in our name.  Provisions for permanent structured co-operation in the Lisbon treaty create the real possibility that wars which we do not support will be fought in our name and with our resources while the mutual defence clause creates obligations incompatible with any internationally recognised definition of neutrality.</P>
        <P>The Government could have secured opt-outs from these contentious areas of the treaty that deal with common foreign and security policy and common security and defence policy.  After its people rejected the Maastricht treaty in 1992 the Danish Government secured a number of opt-outs before putting the treaty to a second vote.</P><Col N="1081"/>
        <P>With regards to taxation, the Government has completely missed the point.  Under the Lisbon treaty, any move to a common corporation tax system across the EU would require a unanimous vote at the Council of Ministers, and anyone who read the treaty would know this.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s concern on taxation rests with Article 48 of the treaty, which allows the Council of Ministers, by unanimous decision, to alter the text of existing EU treaties.</P>
        <P>Today if the EU wanted to agree a common corporation tax system it would have to do so as part of a broader treaty revision process.  This would require both unanimity at Council and ratification in each member state, including a referendum in this state.  Article 48, however, allows the Council of Ministers to make significant changes to the treaties by unanimity.  EU leaders view national debate and referenda on issues of social and economic significance as &ldquo;cumbersome&rdquo;; we view such processes as fundamental tools of a functioning progressive democracy.  Lisbon does not affect our tax sovereignty, but it makes it easier for the Council of Ministers to make the change in future, and without the inconvenience of a referendum.  Again, this is an issue of trust.  Fianna F&aacute;il, despite its assurances, could not be trusted on this or indeed any other matter of importance.</P>
        <P>We should remember the concerns the Government has not acknowledged in its clarifications.  There is no mention of the reduced influence of smaller member states as a consequence of the new voting arrangements at Council, no mention of the 60 or so member state vetoes that will end, no mention of the controversial changes to international trade negotiations that were opposed by farmers and trade justice groups alike and no mention of the opening up of vital public services such as health and education to the vagaries of the market.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste said recently that saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Lisbon was necessary to secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic future.  We should remember that her former party leader and Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was one of the main authors of the Lisbon treaty, with input no doubt from his then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen.  The T&aacute;naiste has presided over the loss of more than 200,000 Irish jobs since becoming Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Their combined r&eacute;sum&eacute; on economic matters is not exactly inspiring.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s place is at the heart of Europe, and this is not in question.  The challenge facing Ireland and Europe is building a Union that meets the needs of its peoples.  We need a treaty that delivers a better Europe for all member state citizens and, in this context, Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to campaign for a better deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill.  I hope the Minister will forgive me when I say there is a slight sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> about this because we sat here before the last Lisbon referendum and discussed the treaty, the campaign and so on.  Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, what we have realised is that no degree of complacency can be allowed in the Lisbon treaty campaign.  The convictions and views on both sides are strongly held and expressed and the public tends to lack information about the European Union and can therefore be easily swayed by arguments that are persuasively put.</P>
        <P>It is important we learn from the mistakes of the previous referendum campaign.  An editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning states that the Government engaged in sleepwalking during the last campaign.  Perhaps that is a bit strong but we must recognise that the campaign could have been much more proactive.  In the Millward Brown survey carried out after the last campaign, 42% of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; said they did so because they did not know enough.  As governments provide political leadership and see the need for the European Union and for greater European integration in the challenging global environment in which we find ourselves, they have a responsibility, having negotiated and signed up to treaties and looked after the interests of their own member states, to sell them properly to the population at large.</P><Col N="1082"/>
        <P>In the forthcoming referendum campaign we have a second opportunity to provide clear and persuasive information to the public about the Lisbon treaty.  The Minister has made a good start with the White Paper that has been published.  We must provide clear and accessible information.  Unfortunately, the wording of the amendment to the Constitution is quite technical and many members of the public will find it impossible to make sense of it.  Thus, the campaign preceding the vote on that amendment will need to simplify the issues at stake so that people are in no doubt about what treaty contains, what its strengths are and so on.</P>
        <P>At this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs we mentioned that the Department of Foreign Affairs should prepare rebuttals to the false arguments we know will be raised by those on the other side.  It is important that where legally inaccurate points are made we are able to rebut them simply.  It will be helpful for all of us who will be out campaigning in favour of the treaty that we have those simply worded rebuttals available to us.</P>
        <P>People will say there is no difference between this treaty and the one they voted on last time around.  Essentially, that is true; there is no difference to the treaty.  However, a number of very solid legal guarantees secured by the Irish Government have been attached to the treaty.  This shows that the issues of concern to Irish people which caused them to hesitate or vote against the treaty have been addressed in a clear and legally unambiguous fashion.  In sensitive areas such as our traditional policy of military neutrality, the ability to set our own corporate taxes, the right to life, education and the family, Ireland&rsquo;s autonomy, independence and sovereignty have been protected.  We have legally binding conclusions to that effect and the European Council decision that contains those guarantees will be registered with the UN once the treaty is ratified and will form part of a protocol in the future, which is positive.</P>
        <P>Now that the Irish concerns have been addressed and we have solid legal guarantees, we need to consider what is good for Europe and not just what is good for Ireland.  This is important in the global environment in which we find ourselves.  When the Secretary General of the United Nations spoke to us yesterday, he talked about the multiple crises the world is facing at the moment.  There are a number of serious challenges facing the international community.  As a member of the Green Party I would say one of these major challenges is climate change and the threat of catastrophic consequences if we do not begin to address this issue urgently at a national level.  In another ten or 20 years&rsquo; time people will ask how there could have been such inaction.  The European Union has provided important global leadership on this issue and it needs to provide further leadership, but we need to empower it to do this by signing up to international treaties on climate change that will set a high standard for us in terms of reducing our emissions and encouraging other major international players to do so as well.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that the global economy is in a precarious state and we need a new system of international financial regulation.  We need to empower the European Union to sit at the table with other major players and agree a fairer and better regulated international system than has existed to date.  The United Nations must also be reformed.  We are all aware it is badly in need of reform so that it more adequately represents the international community but also so that it promotes the progressive values the EU and other powers have tried to promote at an international level for many years.</P>
        <P>We need a fairer international trade system.  Given that it is the largest single trading area world, the EU is in a position to exercise major influence in terms of improving and reforming the international trading system.  International terrorism is another major problem.  To promote peace internationally, the European Union needs to be empowered to address those issues alongside other major international powers.</P><Col N="1083"/>
        <P>We need a strong Europe and we must recognise that collective decision making is no longer a matter of choice but one of necessity.  We need, as Irish people, to empower the European Union to become a more effective player at an international level.  That is what the treaty of Lisbon is all about.  Now that our national and domestic concerns have been addressed through solid legal guarantees, we need to consider what is good for Europe and how we can build a stronger and better Europe.  The Lisbon treaty is an important aspect of this.</P>
        <P>I have one or two recommendations for the Minister.  One aspect of the democratic deficit in the European Union is the lack of information.  As politicians and elected representatives, we need to do something to avoid having a crash course in European affairs every time we have a referendum campaign on a European treaty.  A permanent EU information service should be set up in every EU member state.  This is something member state governments will need to agree to.  It is not something the European institutions can do themselves.  The Irish Government should promote this actively because we have had the experience of so many difficult popular referendums in which we come face to face with a lack of citizen engagement and lack of information about the European Union.</P>
        <P>The other thing we should promote and which will not necessarily require a new treaty is a wider and deeper process of democratisation across the European Union.  Put simply, it is about providing more information, consulting people more, and involving them more in decision making.  Such challenges are not beyond the imagination of the brightest and the best within the European Union.  We must find a way of promoting greater democracy within the EU because if we do not, we will find it increasingly difficult, even with some of the mechanisms within the Lisbon treaty, to get popular support and acceptance of some of the decisions and changes that may be made in the future, especially if people do not fully understand the reasons for them and the context in which they are made.  As a country that has struggled with its own referendums in terms of trying to persuade the public of the advantages and merits of various European treaties, we should promote this.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider again the recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, of which I was a member, and which sat last November and December?  It came up with a series of important recommendations that would help give the Houses of the Oireachtas a much more proactive role in terms of the overall European decision-making process.  It is through our national Parliament that we will engage the people of this country to a much greater extent in terms of what is happening, what is being decided and what is being debated at European level.  The recommendations made were the subject of a lot of discussion, had cross-party support and were set out very clearly in the report.  I would hate to see it sitting on a shelf as, unfortunately, tends to happen to the conclusions of many committees that are set up.</P>
        <P>It was an important committee.  Its recommendations, now that we are examining once again how to try to ratify the Lisbon treaty, are very timely.  I ask the Minister to re-visit the recommendations, given that they have cross-party support, and ensure they are implemented as speedily as possible, because it is only through &ldquo;Europeanising&rdquo; the activities of the Parliament that we will help to address the very serious democratic deficit which confronts us every time we try to ratify a European treaty in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey.  The Bill is undoubtedly one of the most important we will see in this or any other year.  I welcome its publication and commend the Taoiseach and the Minister for the hard work they have done since the original referendum was rejected.  I welcome the announcement that the next referendum will be held on 2 October.</P><Col N="1084"/>
        <P>As in the last referendum, the Labour Party will campaign vigorously for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote between now and October.  We will try to convince people, particularly those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; last time, that it is in the interests of the country for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to be returned.  We will support the Government in its objective of passing the Lisbon treaty in October.  That commitment is made easier by the series of legal guarantees that have been secured since the rejection of the original treaty, particularly the retention of Ireland&rsquo;s Commissioner and the declaration on workers&rsquo; rights and social policy.</P>
        <P>In 2008 I campaigned throughout the north east, particularly in the Meath East constituency, which was one of the very few that returned a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I pay tribute to politicians from other parties who went out and campaigned for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in that constituency, notably Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I canvassed in a traditional way.  I spoke to people on doorsteps, met people in supermarkets, attended public meetings and engaged with people about their concerns.  It was very clear to me at that stage, as it was to anybody who bothered to go out and talk to people, that people were very perturbed and underwhelmed by the efforts of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign in 2008.</P>
        <P>From the outset it was clear that the Government had no coherent communications strategy and assumed wagging a finger at people would convince them to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The never-ending lap of honour by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, did not help people to focus their minds or encourage a well-reasoned and well-thought out debate.  The information vacuum that existed was very quickly and effectively filled by the other side, which was a disparate alliance of various groups campaigning in favour of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>I spoke with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, and Deputy Joe McHugh at an ICA event in Termonfeckin in County Louth a number of months before the date of the referendum.  It was clear from the comments and questions from the floor that real concerns about defence, taxation, abortion and neutrality were expressed by many people.  Many people had already made up their minds before the Government campaign got underway.  It is something we need to learn a lesson from this time.  The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side was on the defensive from the start and as we know the rest is history.</P>
        <P>I commend the work done by Senator Pascal Donohoe in his sub-committee in the aftermath of the Lisbon referendum.  It threw up some very interesting and important information.  I hope we will learn lessons from it.  The Government needs to analyse the catastrophic communications failure that defined the last referendum campaign and I hope it is now ready to mount a very positive campaign.  So far it seems the Government has learnt very little and is choosing to rely on economic fear rather than constructive debate.  This seemed to be confirmed by reports that the Taoiseach is too scared to publish the report of an bord snip nua in case the people are incapable of processing more than one issue at any one time.</P>
        <P>I want to quote from an article in this week&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> in which Hugh Fraser, a former director of the Combat Poverty Agency, spelled out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the democratic process.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is much evidence of a systematic effort to close down, control or emasculate and control authoritative and independent voices on issues of social justice and thus to marginalise dissent.  Community groups receiving Government funding have been instructed not to network with other community groups and thus build up a collective voice on issues.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Does the Government agree that strong and vibrant community groups, many of which receive matching funding and grants from the European Union, might have a role to play in generating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote this time and getting support for it?  Community groups, voluntary associations <Col N="1085"/>and grassroots&rsquo; networks should have been empowered with information, training and funding to help sell the benefits of the treaty to our people.</P>
        <P>There was a real opportunity to achieve a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote with a bottom-up ground swell of support from the grassroots and groups and organisations that people trust and engage with regularly.  Instead, this Government is so hell-bent on destroying the community sector that a fantastic opportunity has been missed.  Community groups where town hall meetings might have taken place now have to ask permission before they open their mouths.  God forbid they might be allowed to network with one another in case they might say something that upsets the Government.  The fact we did not try to build support for the referendum from the bottom up is a missed opportunity.</P>
        <P>The Government has done a genuinely commendable and excellent job in securing the assurance and guarantees that will help to reassure many of those who voted against the treaty last time.  However, the Government and all of us have to exhibit some degree of self-awareness at the outset of this process.  Confidence in our institutions, Government and politicians in general is at an all-time low.  Trust is an endangered emotion, and yet the most unpopular Government in a generation feels confident that it can sell the treaty from the top down.  Anybody who believes a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is a sure thing or that fear alone will get a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is disillusioned.</P>
        <P>I urge all Senators and Deputies from parties on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side to engage in a positive campaign that is reflective and honest.  If we do that and treat people with the respect they deserve on this issue, it is to be hoped that our national commitment to Europe will be re-affirmed on 2 October.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, and commend the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill to the House.  It is an excellent Bill and the majority of the House is in agreement that there should be a second referendum on it.  In the last referendum on 5 June 2008, 53.4% of the Irish electorate voted against the proposal to amend the Constitution, namely, the ratification of the Lisbon treaty, and 46.6% voted in favour of the proposal.  The turnout for the referendum was 53.1%.  An analysis of the referendum results was provided by the library and research service.  It is important to analyse what has happened and the research carried out by the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, of which I was a member and Senator Donohoe chaired, was extremely helpful and highlighted the issues involved.</P>
        <P>During the campaign there were many unfortunate personal attacks and misinformation was given out by one group.  Libertas played a vital role in this area and its leadership projected the most negative approach to the development and expansion of the European Union.</P>
        <P>I commend the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and the Minister of State<b> </b>at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dick Roche, on the trojan work, stamina and tenacity they have shown in winning concessions from their European colleagues and bringing this matter to a conclusion.  Visiting Ireland last week, British Foreign Secretary, David Milliband, admitted he had not expected the Irish Government to have negotiated such a deal.  The outcome was a marvellous achievement for the Ministers in question, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and our officials in Europe.  As a former Minister of State in what has become the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I received tremendous support from our officials in Europe.  They are an extremely effective team whom I admired while in office and who have, with our Ministers, negotiated an effective solution to the issues raised by the electorate in the referendum June 2008.</P><Col N="1086"/>
        <P>The electorate may have done us a service in that we have sought clarification and secured reassurance.  I was particularly concerned about the proposed temporary loss of a Commissioner for member states for five of every 15 years.  Ireland has been well served by its Commissioners and few other countries have the same level of personal engagement with their Commissioner.  While I accept that Commissioners take a pledge to the European Union, they must bear in mind the ethos of their home country and will be aware of the effect of many proposals on their country of origin.  Although large and small member states were treated equally under the proposal on Commissioners, the smaller countries would have been affected more had it been implemented.  The success of the Taoiseach and Ministers in negotiating a concession on this matter from the other 26 member states was a major breakthrough.</P>
        <P>Holding a second referendum is not new to Ireland.  In the first divorce referendum a majority of people opposed the introduction of divorce.  When the second referendum went the other way those who had voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the first referendum accepted the outcome.  The Constitution does not debar the holding of a second referendum on issues of concern, of which the Lisbon treaty is one.  Those who voted against the treaty in June 2008 can feel vindicated.  I have not criticised anyone who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the first referendum for the good reason that opponents of the treaty had sincere concerns and worries which had not been clarified to their satisfaction.  Full clarification has now been provided.  For instance, Ireland&rsquo;s position on corporation tax has been confirmed and we have secured commitments on neutrality, abortion and other social issues of concern to people.  These commitments, which have been copper-fastened in the annexes to the treaty, will be registered in the United Nations and will become part and parcel of the treaty on which we will vote on 2 October.</P>
        <P>We cannot take a positive outcome for granted and must, therefore, rally support for the referendum.  At this crucial crossroads in our history, Ireland needs Europe more than ever.  Our membership of the European Union and eurozone have provided security not available to non-EU countries such as Iceland.  Ireland would be in dire straits if it were not a member of the European Union.  It is vital, therefore, that we reaffirm our clear commitment to the principles of the European Union and demonstrate our willingness to remain at the centre of decision-making in the EU.</P>
        <P>I am the Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesperson on European affairs in the Seanad and a member of two committees with an important role to play, the joint committees on European affairs and European scrutiny.  When I was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Des O&rsquo;Malley gave me responsibility for international trade and negotiating the Single European Act.  At that time, issues of concern to Ireland were always taken on board by our colleagues from other countries.  Not once in the period in which I negotiated on behalf of this country, with the advice of senior civil servants, were we dissatisfied with the outcome of a meeting.  We received co-operation and assistance from all member states and all the larger countries were extremely co-operative.</P>
        <P>The tremendous support and respect we had built up in the European Union will be returned to us if we vote in favour of the Lisbon treaty on 2 October.  On 2 October, the European Union&rsquo;s population of 500 million will observe the people of Ireland.  The future of Europe is in our hands and I have no doubt that if we discuss and explain the issues people will respond positively.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests that we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 2 October.  Rejection of the Lisbon treaty in a second referendum would have unthinkable consequences.  We have all played a part in finding solutions to the issues raised on 12 June 2008.  The White Paper should be circulated as widely as possible to enable people to read it prior to making a decision on 2 October.  Ireland continues to have an important role to play in the European Union, from which we receive substantial investment.</P><Col N="1087"/>
        <P>On the Order of Business this morning, I expressed concern about REPS 4.  It is regrettable that when REPS 3 concludes at the end of 2010 the membership of the scheme will not be in a position to roll over into REPS 4.  The closing date for applications for the scheme was 15 May and assurances were given to many farmers that, on the termination of REPS 3, they would continue in REPS 4.  I hope we will be able to resolve this issue tomorrow morning when members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party agriculture committee are due to meet the Minister.</P>
        <P>If we are to secure future employment and stability, we must vote to be at the centre of the European Union.  We must be inside looking out rather than outside looking in.  For this reason, I commend the Bill to the House.  We must work together.  I recognise the responsible attitude being taken by the Fine Gael Party, Labour Party and Green Party, all of which support the Bill and will support the Lisbon reform treaty on 2 October.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party fully supports the Bill which has been well crafted and drafted by the officials.  I expect that they, like us, have learned from the experience of the first Lisbon treaty referendum.  This factor appears to have come into play in the drafting of the legislation.  My party has no hesitation in supporting the formulation of the amendments, through the Constitution, which are required to implement the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Following the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Germany that there is no impediment to ratifying the Lisbon treaty in Germany, except for some changes required in domestic legislation, the implementation of the treaty depends on ratification in Ireland.  While Poland and the Czech Republic must sign the treaty, all depends on Ireland.  Since the first referendum, apart from the constitutional implications and toing and froing on the detail and clarifications, Europe has once again saved us in economic terms.  Being a member of the eurozone and a member state of the European Union, as well as having support from the European Central Bank, is of fundamental importance in safeguarding the country&rsquo;s financial viability and stability.  This has to be borne in mind when we talk about Europe from now on.</P>
        <P>There is a fundamental change in this treaty compared to the first Lisbon referendum, which concerns the commissionership.  That was one of the main issues in the debate and on the doorsteps.  There is no question but that it would be more efficient if the number of Commissioners were reduced.  However, it has been accepted in Europe that there is a feeling of greater democracy in having a presence within the European Commission, which is seen as the central body in initiating legislation, protecting the continuity of European integration and ensuring that the rule of law is upheld at European level.  It has been accepted that it is important to have a presence there and therefore there has been a fundamental change following the last referendum.  There is also a fundamental change, however, in terms of the guarantees that have been received.  Appearance and reality are both important in politics, but they got out of kilter in the first referendum.  There were real concerns that manifested themselves in that &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Those concerns have since been professionally researched.  All the issues that were raised and which seemed to have been of concern to the public have now been addressed in the guarantees that were provided by the Heads of State and Government at the last European Council meeting.</P>
        <P>It is clear that European leaders took Irish citizens&rsquo; concerns, as expressed in that referendum, very seriously.  They meticulously engaged with the Irish Government to try to identify where the problem lay.  The comprehensive decision which is set out in the agreement of the last European Council in June goes through every item.  The abortion issue was already protected in the treaties, but this decision explicitly states that the Lisbon treaty will have no impact on the protection of the right to life.  In addition, the rights of the family and education, as set out in our Constitution, are protected.  We have therefore a merging of the appearance and reality as <Col N="1088"/>to what the Lisbon treaty means.  We now have a European Council decision on this, which we are told is legally binding.  I will come to that point in a moment.</P>
        <P>All these issues, including taxation and the protection of the right to life, were raised by Senators in this House.  The guarantees expressly state that the treaty will make no change of any kind for any member state to the extent or operation of the competence of the EU on taxation.  One Senator was very vocal on the issues of security and defence.  However, these guarantees express the assurance that it is for Ireland to take decisions on these issues.  It says the treaty does not prejudice the security and defence policy of member states.  It does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.  An issue was raised during the campaign suggesting that in the context of a common defence, Ireland would have to come to the defence of another member state in the event of a terrorist attack.  These guarantees make absolutely clear, however, that if there is such a terrorist attack it is for the member states to determine the nature of aid or assistance to be provided to a member state which is the subject of such an attack or the victim of armed aggression on its territory.  It is crystal clear that these are decisions which we make in exercising our sovereignty.</P>
        <P>As regards conscription, the guarantees also state that the Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation.  It does not affect the right of Ireland or any other member state to determine the nature and volume of its defence and security expenditure or the nature of its defence capabilities.  It is a matter for Ireland whether to participate in any military operation which is, in all cases, of a peacekeeping kind.</P>
        <P>There is also the declaration on workers&rsquo; rights, social policy and other issues.  That declaration deals with services of general economic interest and services of non-economic interest, which was an issue of concern in the last campaign.  It is important to appreciate fully the significance of these guarantees.  No sooner was this agreement announced than Vincent Browne rubbished the guarantees on his TV3 programme.  He said they were not legally binding and he rubbished anyone who suggested otherwise.  This type of unbalanced reporting must be addressed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>To state something as a matter of fact when it is self-evidently incorrect is not balanced or informed reporting.  People in the media who are dealing with issues concerning the Lisbon treaty should at least do their homework.</P>
        <P>The EU Heads of State and Government say that this international agreement is legally binding, which means that it is.  In addition, it is an agreement under international law which will be registered in the United Nations.  It is international law which becomes part of European law.  These are not vague, general statements.  In a series of cases, the European Court of Justice has already determined the principle that EU law is part of international law and that the principle of good faith, which is a rule of international law, is binding on the European Community.  In one judgment, there is an unambiguous and unconditional prohibition of acts that are incompatible with the aims and objectives of international agreements.  If we take this as an international agreement it means it is binding on the EU and on member states.  If the European Commission comes forward with proposals which are incompatible with that agreement, it raises legal issues which can be addressed by the European Court.  It is also for the latter court to deal with these types of issues under Article 292 of the treaty.  If there are any disputes between member states or the European institutions on the interpretation of EU law, <Col N="1089"/>which is inevitably what would arise were this agreement to come into dispute, it is for the European Court to address them.</P>
        <P>The obvious benefits of the EU have evidently manifested themselves over the past year whereby our economic and financial stability has been dependent on the assistance we have received from Europe.  The values set out and reaffirmed in the Lisbon treaty, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and all the improvements that have been made to the treaty mean that this is of huge benefit to Ireland.  It is important that, as a small member state, we have a defined role in this structure and its institutions, which has self-evidently benefited this country since joining in 1973.  There is a strong case for safeguarding and improving that system, and that is what the Lisbon treaty does.  In light of the guarantees that have been provided on the number of Commissioners and the improvements the treaty brings to this country, I hope there will be consensus in this House and endorsement of the Lisbon treaty by many of the Senators who were reluctant to endorse it the last time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  It is appropriate that he is here for this debate, because his father served as President of the European Council in a distinguished way in 1990.  It was a pivotal part of the history, development and evolution of the European concept.  His grandfather, the late Se&aacute;n Lemass, pioneered Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the European Coal and Steel Community since the beginning of his term in office as Taoiseach in the early 1960s.  When Charles de Gaulle objected to the English joining the Community, we were also constrained from joining at that stage.  When we look at the history of Europe over the last century, there is probably nobody in the Chamber at present who is old enough to have lived through either of the great wars.  I do not know why they are known as &ldquo;great&rdquo; wars, because they were absolutely horrendous, given the millions of people that were killed.  It is only when one goes to the Continent and visits the war graves that one sees the devastation of human life and the destruction of a generation of young Europeans.</P>
        <P>It was out of all this that co-operation between the states of Europe was spawned.  This was down to the vision of people like Robert Schumann, Jean Monnet and others, who saw that the tradition of war throughout Europe over the centuries was something we should try to avoid and who wanted to chart a new course for the peoples that live across this great Continent.  Their vision has been evolving since the first treaty in 1957.  We joined the EEC in 1973.  At that time, our <i>per capita</i> income was around 50% of the EEC average, but last year it was around 130% of the European average.  That is a very considerable increase in the wealth and well-being of our nation.  We have seen the attraction economically of many multinational companies investing in Irish jobs and in manufacturing products that we sell to the rest of the European Union.</P>
        <P>The whole concept of the European Union is something to which people who hold the interest of their nation states and society would fully subscribe.  It is appropriate that we recommit ourselves to the ideal of the founding fathers, and in particular to the economic well being of the nation states.  We are in the greatest recession since the Great Depression.  There are those who think that it may be as bad and even worse than the 1929-33 era.  Several countries are tackling this across the globe, and it will have to be conceded that our participation in the European Union and in the euro is of some considerable assistance in trying to weather the current economic storm.</P>
        <P>We have gone from being strong advocates and supporters of the concept through various treaties to becoming somewhat lukewarm in some of the responses we are getting.  Some of that negativity has arisen because of internal political issues, economic difficulties and also due <Col N="1090"/>to a certain disenchantment and a feeling that the European Court of Justice has intruded into domestic affairs on social and ethical issues.  That was probably unnecessary and is something we should safeguard.  In that respect, I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials for the manner in which they have approached the outcome of the last referendum.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the White Paper, which is very useful and informative and will assist people.  Those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; for different reasons the last time might look to the role of the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs in the UN recently, where a strong pro-life stance was taken by the Minister and his officials in ensuring that abortion services were not part of a UN agreement.  It goes back to a comment I made previously.  The whole area of human rights has been hijacked by sectional interests to pursue their own agenda, whereas the overall intent of human rights is something to which we all subscribe and which need to be protected.  Therefore, we need to be very conscious of what is happening.</P>
        <P>It is important that the principle of subsidiarity applies across the European Union.  We should at all times seeks to ensure that this underpins the thrust of various declarations and legislation that emanate from the European Union.  I particularly welcome the declaration by all heads of state that protect the concerns that were expressed the last time, and the fact that these will be transposed into protocols when the next treaty occurs.  Those protections, particularly in the area of personal rights, right to life, family, education and so on, include such items as the right to life of the unborn, compatible with the equal right to life of the mother, to which many of us in this House subscribe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The State also pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, and Article 41.3.1&deg; is also protected under these declarations and the protocols that will ensue.  We will obviously have more discussion on that in the context of the Civil Partnership Bill 2009, which appears to put it under some threat.  Article 44.2.5&deg; provides for the right of every religious denomination to manage its own affairs and to make its own decisions regarding its own interests.  We have ensured that those who are concerned can be reasonably satisfied that the Lisbon treaty will not affect those strong convictions that they have.  The capacity of this State to set its own taxation rates has been fundamental to its economic well-being.  Most people in commercial life, particularly those who are responsible for attracting foreign inward investment to this country, acknowledge that this country&rsquo;s low corporation tax rates have been the single biggest factor to have assisted them.  The ability of this State to make decisions on such matters, rather than having them imposed from outside, is to be maintained.</P>
        <P>In the area of security and defence, it is clear that the Lisbon treaty does not provide for conscription or for the creation of a European army.  I am aware that incorrect, although strongly made, arguments about such factors influenced certain people during the last referendum campaign.  Those arguments seemed to have a particular influence on mothers who were concerned that their sons would be conscripted.  It is important that we maintain this country&rsquo;s right to decide whether to participate in military operations.  Irish troops have served with distinction in many overseas operations.  I have my own views on Ireland&rsquo;s decision to opt out of the EU&rsquo;s defence arrangements, particularly when it benefits from the Union to such a great extent., but those are personal views  Nothing in this treaty will allow us to participate in military operations in any way without a decision to that effect being made within the State.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to discuss the declarations on workers&rsquo; rights etc. in any great detail.  We can be proud of the constructive and valuable role Ireland has played in the development of the European project.  It is imperative that we continue to play such a role.  In that regard, we should work in the interests of everybody, including ourselves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I am glad to have an opportunity to address the House on this Bill, which deals with an important topic.  I have always appreciated the importance of the European Union to and for Ireland.  We must have a genuine sense of gratitude for how the Union has functioned on behalf of all of us.  I refer, for example, to the protections of the Common Market, environmental protection measures and certain aspects of the Union&rsquo;s employment legislation.  I believe that those who have represented Ireland at certain international fora, including EU negotiations, have always acted in the best interests of this country and in accordance with their own lights.  They have made a genuine effort to seek to advance the good of this country, even if they might not always have been right, focused on the right things, sufficiently well equipped or had a sufficient breadth of knowledge of the social dimension of certain issues.  There has been a tendency to focus unduly on economic issues, while forgetting that many other cultural issues are also important.  By failing to address such issues in time, we may have led some people to form the opinion that Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the EU had evolved in a manner that could not but be hostile to Ireland&rsquo;s right to determine certain sensitive issues for itself.</P>
        <P>I have always strongly believed in the right of the Oireachtas to submit important questions to the judgment of the people and, if necessary, to resubmit certain questions to them.  I emphasise, without prejudice to the question of whether the Lisbon treaty is good for Ireland at this time, that I have never seen the validity of the argument that there is something wrong with putting a referendum to the people for a second time.  Our Constitution envisages and provides for a delicate balance in this regard.  While certain matters have to be submitted to the people for their final determination, the right to submit such matters to them is clearly vested in the Oireachtas.  There is a reason we do not provide for names or signatures to be collected so that a certain issue is put to the people.  Democracy is more subtle than it is sometimes imagined to be.  If it functions properly, it leaves certain decisions clearly in the hands of elected representatives.  The question of what should be submitted to the people in a referendum is a good example of something that should continue to be decided on by elected representatives.  If the people are unhappy with that, they can register their displeasure in an election context.  Therefore, I have no problem with the Government&rsquo;s decision to refer this proposal to the people once more and I have no problem with the Bill before the House.  Negotiations have taken place and certain issues have been clarified.  Time will tell whether that has been done to the satisfaction of voters.  The business of submitting this proposal to the people for their scrutiny and judgment must be done once more.</P>
        <P>I have never had a problem with accepting that EU agreements or guarantees, such as those that were obtained at the December conclusions and again last month, enjoy a sufficient degree of solemnity and solidity.  I do not doubt that they will acquire treaty status in due course.  I have always felt that whatever is negotiated has a satisfactory legal grounding.  I have always sought to contemplate the question of what exactly is negotiated by way of guarantees.  As my colleagues will know, I have focused in particular on social and ethical matters in that context.  When I opposed the Lisbon treaty during the last referendum campaign, I repeatedly made the point that, as a result of the evolution of the EU, Ireland is no longer in a position to make its own decisions on certain sensitive social and ethical issues and areas of law.  That is a major problem for me and I know it was a major problem for many voters.  In that regard, I am glad the Government has moved on from merely talking about abortion and now seems to recognise that certain other traditional values are at issue.  A range of social and ethical matters, including the definition of marriage, laws impacting on family life, certain right to life issues, the question of who gets to run education in our society, the right of religious communities to provide education according to their ethos and values, and freedom of conscience issues in relation to religion, have come into play in this context.  They have been brought into play to a greater <Col N="1092"/>extent since the Union&rsquo;s equality competence started to emerge around the time of the Amsterdam treaty.</P>
        <P>The EU has clearly evolved from being a mere economic grouping and is now integrating in many more areas.  If we are honest about it, the Union is moving towards something that, in all likelihood, will look like a federal state in the fullness of time.  It is beyond dispute that there has been a growth in the EU&rsquo;s areas of competence.  It now enjoys competence in areas that have the potential to be very socially sensitive in Ireland.  It was in that context that I registered my disquiet and that of many people about the manner in which this country has sleepwalked into that situation.  We never had a full debate on where exactly we stood in terms of an ever more united Europe.  Members will recall that Albert Reynolds, who no doubt was doing his best for the country, used to speak about the billions of pounds he had obtained for Ireland in the form of Structural Funds.  I do not deny that it was an important issue in itself.  However, with perhaps one exception &mdash; the negotiation of the Maastricht protocol &mdash; there was always a failure of the imagination when it came to realising that situations might arise in the future in the light of Europe&rsquo;s growing areas of competence that could compromise Ireland&rsquo;s ability to go its own way on socially sensitive matters, particularly where it might have a more nuanced position or a different ethical outlook on certain issues from other member states.</P>
        <P>The Government sought and obtained clarifications for us.  I was honoured to be asked to take part in the work of the Joint Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in Europe which was chaired so excellently by my colleague, Senator Paschal Donohoe.  I took the opportunity as a member of the committee to give chapter and verse, as I saw it, on the issues of challenge pertaining to social and ethical matters.</P>
        <P>These are the issues that will have to be examined in more detail in the run-up to 2 October to see to what extent sufficient guarantees have been obtained so that we may determine whether Ireland can determine its position on social and ethically sensitive issues.  I pointed out the need for a constitutional filter that would basically establish quite clearly that Irish constitutional provisions would have primacy where there was conflict with European law in some of these areas I have described.  We have certainly had guarantees in relation to certain issues, for example the Irish constitutional provisions as regards life, education and the family.  That guarantee applies to the Lisbon treaty.  What is less clear is how Irish constitutional provisions might fare in decisions or initiatives of the European institutions which could occur regardless of whether the Lisbon treaty is passed.  For example, as we look at the civil partnership legislation coming down the tracks, there will be issues about the right of people in civil partnership situations to enjoy similar rights to those of married couples, as traditionally understood.  If we were to seek to nuance that situation and provide that the same rights would not fully apply, would we be already exposed to a situation such as what arose in the Maruko case, where the European Court of Justice basically held that where a member state &mdash; in the case of Maruko it was Germany &mdash; had already provided for civil partnership in its legislation, then it had to provide the exact same pension rights as those enjoyed by married couples?  The Maruko case is an example of how an area of EU competence could impact on an area of non-EU competence, namely, laws in relation to family, definition of marriage etc.  That occurred despite the fact that relevant directive was supposed to provide that the financial rights and so on attaching to such partnerships would be matters for the member states.</P>
        <P>Those are the types of issues on which people will continue to seek clarity.  It can be said beyond dispute that there has been a very positive broadening of the situation so as to recognise that the Irish constitutional provisions in certain areas will be unaffected by the Lisbon treaty.  A matter for further debate, however, will be the likelihood or otherwise of further possible <Col N="1093"/>interference from European institutions in court decisions deriving from treaties which we have already signed that might, nonetheless, impact on Irish laws in those very areas.  I look forward to the debate on that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sharing time with Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, with the permission of the House. </P>
        <P>There is a great temptation to address my remarks to those Senators who remain uncommitted, but of course I have a duty to address the House.</P>
        <P>The reality is that there is widespread belief among the general public that Europe has been very positive for Ireland.  So it has, from the simple matter of allowing us to trade within a community of 500 million, providing &euro;40 billion in direct agricultural aid, &euro;50 billion in Structural Funds and so on.  The amounts of funding, the supports and the benefits we have derived from European social policies such as the implementation of laws as regards pregnancy rights, time off at work, job sharing etc. all add up to a very positive experience.  In fairness to many on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, they are also in agreement on Europe.  The reality is that a grouping of 27 states needs to have a treaty in operation that is compatible with the work it is doing.</P>
        <P>I remember the last campaign.  Unfortunately there was an element of obfuscation on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to try to elude the real issues.  They tended to ask a question without waiting for the answer and when they got it they asked another and then tried to muddy the waters further by suggesting that if the problem was not the question of the right to life, it had to do with taxation and if not that, then it was neutrality.  If it was not neutrality, then there was some hidden codicil within the treaty which meant we would never have another treaty.  That was the worst end of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign.</P>
        <P>The Irish electorate has spoken, however, and the indications are there were many different reasons why people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Perhaps some of those involved dissatisfaction with certain aspects of Government policy.  People were dissatisfied over issues that were not clear and the way the Government and Opposition parties had presented Lisbon.  We need now to win over a majority of those very people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; the last time.  Do they not see that, deliberately or inadvertently, they have ensured that we have kept our Commissioner, that we have got from Europe a protocol in guarantees which will be registered as a legally binding treaty with the United Nations and that this protocol refers to the previous treaties, Amsterdam, Maastricht, Nice in succession?  The protocol is there to protect our tax policy, the right to life and military neutrality.  If I meet somebody who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; the last time, there is a wonderful opportunity to tell him or her, that whether it was intentional or not we have now achieved something very significant.  We have a written protocol that addresses all their anxieties and we have retained our Commissioner.  There really can be no justifiable reason any longer that can logically indicate a person should not vote for the 28th Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill.</P>
        <P>In the area of justice, co-operation and enhanced co-operation we must look to Europe more and more.  With our international trade and the amount of cross-border traffic a good deal of international crime is going and coming through Ireland from abroad.  In particular, even though we might focus on the crime families here in Ireland, at the end of the line these are expendable in deference to the real crime barons, many of whom reside on the &ldquo;Costa del Crime&rdquo; in Spain.  We need better bilateral arrangements, probably through the Lisbon treaty. <Col N="1094"/> That would be the best arrangement by far, which all 27 member states of the EU will sign.  If it is not the &ldquo;Costa del Crime&rdquo; it will be some other riviera on the Mediterranean where the crime lords will hang out.  Should the Criminal Assets Bureau, which has done excellent work, or the Garda go to make inquiries it will not be available to them in these states.  However, with enhanced co-operation through the Lisbon treaty there will be no safe place for criminals to hide.  That, allied with all the other positive undertakings we are about to get from the protocol, indicates to me that those who vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; could be told, having outlined the main objections from the last occasion, that every question has been answered.  My anxiety is that is no matter what question we answer for some people, it will not suffice because they have been against every European treaty and advance for the last 30 years and that will not change.  Notwithstanding that there are a few people who think like that, the vast majority are very objective, rational and consider very carefully how they vote.  It is to those people we must turn our attention and say we have achieved something very positive from the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote but we now need a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for Lisbon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Hanafin for sharing time.  If one thing demonstrates the broad church there is on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side for Lisbon it is that Senator Walsh and I find ourselves on the same side when we are diametrically opposed on particular issues.  I will address that in a minute.  The one thing we must do this time around with the Lisbon treaty is to sell a positive message.  We neglected to do this previously.  There was an air of complacency and it was to our detriment that we did not do that.</P>
        <P>It is easy to sell a positive message about Europe, particularly to women.  We got equality for women in legislation because of Europe.  Europe has served women well.  I shudder to think where we would be otherwise.  One always looks back with rose-tinted glasses at how it was in Ireland previously.  I would not like to have grown up in Ireland in the 1950s, and in many ways the Ryan report exposes much of what was wrong in Ireland at the time.  We forget the reality while we romanticise about the past.</P>
        <P>Separate from gender issues, much modern legislation about work and equality generally stemmed from Europe.  That is one reason we need to express loud and clear to the people why Europe is good for Ireland and Ireland has been good for Europe.  Europe has been good at protecting the rights of minorities.  Coming from a small island where we have had such influence we should remember that.</P>
        <P>I have reservations in one sense about the protocols that were arrived at.  I listened with interest to Senator Doherty&rsquo;s comments on the three protocols the Government has acquired.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned, not a word of the Lisbon treaty has changed.  It is very important that this is restated.  Every one of us who went out seeking a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote said the Lisbon treaty had nothing to do with taxation, abortion or defence measures.  Had the Lisbon treaty had a material effect on this it would have changed, but it did not, although this is a copper-fastened signed, sealed agreement to allay those fears as they were perceived to be reasons why people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I have a particular problem with the abortion issue.  It infuriated me when Mr. David Miliband came here last week and cited that as a reason the Irish people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Lisbon treaty.  The main reason people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Lisbon was because they felt they were ill-informed.  That is the challenge to which we need to rise.  The abortion issue was very slight.  If we speak incessantly about how we have the traditional values as perceived in Ireland copper-fastened it is dangerous.</P>
        <P>Approximately 10,000 people travel to procure abortion outside Ireland every year and over the past ten to 20 years that could amount to 200,000 people.  Even if one cuts that in half it is <Col N="1095"/>a quiet constituency of 100,000 people who are quietly very annoyed with this constant reference to the fact that we will not allow abortion in the country.  It is not for Europe to permit or deny this.  We must deal with it here in our Constitution.  This Oireachtas needs to grasp that nettle and have a debate about our position on the X case in particular.  I do not like using it but I hear it constantly referred to and it is a dangerous issue that muddies the waters around the Lisbon treaty because it has nothing to do with it.  I do not purport to represent people of a liberal agenda, but I know what I believe in.  The Oireachtas needs to legislate around this area once and for all, independently and separate from any other issue and have an honest debate on it.</P>
        <P>I am glad that many citizens of this country will galvanise on getting the Lisbon treaty through because it has nothing to do with Government or politics.  All we can do is influence people and tell them we believe it to be in the interests of the country.  A young girl, Maeve Jones-O&rsquo;Connor, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday about how she wants her future back.  She has no vote as she is 16 years of age.  We must remember such people who believe in Europe and do the duty of informing ourselves as we go out to vote as citizens.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Regan&rsquo;s point about the role of the media.  Last night the Minister was interviewed by a newscaster on the RTE news and she tried to drag in the question whether the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, SGPSNEP, will be published before the Lisbon treaty referendum.  That is not fair and should not be allowed to happen.  Senator Regan mentioned another journalist who spoke nonsense and untruths about what is or is not in the Lisbon treaty because he has a strong opinion one way or the other.  There is a serious duty on the Irish media to be fair and honest and report only on the facts.</P>
        <P>I was so disappointed with the RTE broadcaster last night who was trying to get the Minister to separate the issue of the Lisbon treaty.  It is far too important for this country to have the political issues of the day kicked around like a football.  She should not have been allowed to do that.  The Minister resisted her attempts to do it but it will happen along the way.  I hope RTE wakes up and recognises that people need the facts, not political football to be played with the issue.  It is so important that the media takes an unbiased, non-political approach to this.  We all pledge to inform ourselves and the people in an honest, forthright way.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with everything Senator O&rsquo;Malley said but two points in particular are worth emphasising.  The first is how virtually every issue that will be discussed in the Irish political world during the next number of months will be related back to the Lisbon treaty by some in our country.  Today I heard the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland has come out and said a proposal on the blood alcohol limit could influence the referendum and deliver a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  This morning a colleague of ours stood and talked about how a very important change taking place on farmers&rsquo; payments could influence a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>We have a responsibility as politicians in the contributions we make to be at pains to point out to people that if they feel strongly about what this Government is doing, there will be a general election to express their views against it.  The Lisbon treaty referendum is not the place to do it; it stretches far beyond that.</P>
        <P>The second point the Senator made that I agree with concerned the traditional issues, or socially sensitive issues as Senator Mullen would say, and assessing their role in why people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the treaty.  I accept they played a role in influencing how people voted.  However, I believe they have been put into their place by the broader issues now facing the country and our future destiny.  That was brought home to me by how I felt last June when the decision came through.  I remember sitting in my front room watching on television the result being <Col N="1096"/>announced at Dublin Castle.  As I said previously in this House, the physical geography and the starkness of where we are as a small island on the edge of Europe came home to me politically.  We were on our own that day.  We were shown for what we are geographically &mdash; a small country on the edge of Europe.  On that day I had a strong feeling of being alone on the edge.</P>
        <P>With the guarantees to be put to the people in the forthcoming referendum, Europe has reached out again and indicated it wants small open countries like Ireland to continue to play a role in the future of Europe.  This was brought home to me by an experience I had after my colleagues and I published the report of the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union.  I was invited to a private meeting of Christian Democratic foreign Ministers held before a European Council.  Our report had been published and they wanted to quiz a politician, who was not in government, regarding what was happening in Ireland and how Ireland was going to move forward in regard to Europe.  The one emotion that came through from all of them was utter exhaustion.  They were exhausted by the entire process that got them to the Lisbon treaty.  Their capacity for working on this any further was spent &mdash; it was gone.  The night on which we were having this meeting the foreign Minister of Greece asked me many questions regarding what was happening.  She was very forceful in the different points she made.  When I returned from that meeting I turned on the television to discover riots were breaking out in her country because of how young Greeks were feeling about what was happening to their economy.  Every European country is now managing the kind of challenge she was managing then with differing degrees of intensity.</P>
        <P>One point needs to be made to those who will campaign for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Senator Doherty has made clear what he will do.  I will be interested to see what Senator Mullen will do.  If they are saying the Lisbon treaty is wrong with these guarantees, what do they propose in its place?  Do the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners honestly believe that we have the ability to go back to all the other countries in Europe with the gigantic problems each of them is facing and get a better deal?  Does anybody really believe that at this stage the political capital or will exists in any European country to reopen the treaty and get a better deal?  Anybody living through what we are at the moment will know that it is just not the case &mdash; it will not happen.</P>
        <P>It is worth emphasising a number of points about where we stand with the treaty.  I encourage everybody to read the guarantees because the one quality they have, which the Lisbon treaty itself does not have, is that they are completely legible; they are written in plain English.  When I opened the White Paper to prepare for the debate, I thought I was reading the wrong chapter when I was reading the guarantees.  They are clarifications &mdash; my God they really are clarifications &mdash; in language people can understand and we should ensure we draw people to them.</P>
        <P>People who talk about a better deal often point to Denmark.  The irony is that when the result of the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty was announced last June, the Government of Denmark was about to embark on its own process to undo most of the opt-outs it had secured.  It was about to introduce legislation and embark on consultation with the Danish people to undo the opt-outs that those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side in Ireland praise.  The Danish representatives, who appeared before the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, were at pains to say that the situation in which they found themselves made it exceptionally difficult to progress their national interest with other European countries.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of whether the Lisbon treaty has changed, of course it has not changed.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly said, that would make nonsense of what we said in June 2008.  We need to be careful with that argument because, while the treaty has not changed, the operation of it has changed significantly as Ireland will have a Commissioner.  In the balance to be found between efficiency on the one hand and democracy on the other, the absence of a <Col N="1097"/>Commissioner, if not representing Ireland then with an awareness of Ireland, went too far down the efficiency end of the scale and away from the democracy end.  Guaranteeing having a Commissioner is a significant change from where we were.  Those of us who acknowledge that the Lisbon treaty has not changed should not lose sight of how important it is to have a Commissioner in place.</P>
        <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Doherty said about taxation.  He pointed out that the Lisbon treaty does not affect our tax sovereignty.  He then said that any decision taken in that regard would be a decision taken by the Council of Ministers.  Does anyone honestly believe that any Irish Minister from any political party, including Senator Doherty&rsquo;s, would go into a Council of Ministers and hand over a decision on our corporation tax?  It just would not happen.  It is inconceivable that anybody who will ever represent us at any Council of Ministers would make such a statement and hand over our sovereignty on corporation tax and other taxation matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is much in the report of the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union published a number of months ago that should be followed up on by all Members of the Oireachtas during the referendum campaign.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has responded, acknowledging that there are some really clear recommendations on how the role of the Oireachtas could be improved.  The work we do regarding Europe could be simplified and made clearer to the people we are serving.  We are kidding ourselves by saying there is a communications deficit regarding Europe; there is more than that, there is a result deficit.  There is an absence of things happening from Europe with the clarity they need, given all that is going on.  The Oireachtas could play a far stronger role in doing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1962 when Ireland made its first attempt to join the European Economic Community, Liam Cosgrave, who went on to become leader of my party, in giving a speech on our potential accession, said, &ldquo;If Ireland and other countries become members of the European Economic Community, the best prospects, indeed, possibly, the only guarantee of political and economic stability lies in the idea enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.&rdquo;  There is a time in our recent history when we would have looked down on economic and political stability and said that is a bit below us because we have so much more.  Given where we stand now, we really appreciate the value and security it has to offer.  That is why we all have such a vital role to play in participating forcefully in the approaching referendum campaign.</P>

        <P>It is a pity that the great debate we have had on this legislation has not been heard by the wider public.  People have made a great effort to research what issues will be involved in the forthcoming referendum.  They have listened to the people.  Many Members present would have canvassed during the previous referendum and would have spoken one to one basis people about the issues.  One of the reasons we did not succeed in passing the treaty in the previous referendum was owing to a lack of knowledge among the people.  It was not that the knowledge <Col N="1098"/>did not exist but that it was not discernible or accessible to people.  I am convinced that remains one the great challenges that faces us next autumn.</P>
        <P>We have to start from the premise that the Irish people passionately value their sovereignty, of which there is no doubt.  One can understand why they would because it was so hard won.  That value is almost inherent in our genes.  People may not express it in the context of a title such as sovereignty but they have a sense that they do not want to give away control of their destiny.  There is unrest that much of the bureaucracy that has come from Europe is unnecessary, or perhaps it is so as a consequence of the way we have implemented some European directives.  It is difficult to tell the person who keeps hens and is required to register them or the person who supplies apples tarts and scones to the local shops that he or she cannot continue to so unless he or she installs a stainless steel kitchen that they are not losing control when they are in those respects.  Perhaps such loss of control goes with membership of the EU or perhaps the EU has to examine more closely whether a regulation requiring the production of a straight banana is what people need.  Such bureaucracy is a nonsense in many ways.  The requirement for regulations based on hygiene or traceable diseases I can understand, but people cannot understand the logic of many other EU requirements.</P>
        <P>It is not only the Irish people who want to see their sovereignty protected.  I cannot remember anyone who was more vocal on this  issue than the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  She was particularly focused on ensuring Britain&rsquo;s independent status would not be diluted in any way.  If we studied other countries, perhaps we would find the same is the case.  Sovereignty is a factor we must understand in this context.</P>
        <P>When people raise issues we must be careful not to sideline the issues because we believe we have all the information and knowledge.  People&rsquo;s emotions come into play in the issues involved and not all concern knowledge.  We saw that specifically with the shopping list of objections people had on the previous occasion.  We knew the arguments being made were not correct but that did not matter.  When I canvassed on the previous occasion with the local doctor who was also involved in politics in a small town where I would be reasonably well known, I was taken aback by the reactions of the people I met.  I started out very sure of myself but discovered it was not always a matter of dealing with the issues people raised with me intellectually.  I had to deal with them emotionally and that was difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We carried out surveys to find out why people voted a certain way.  I believe Senator O&rsquo;Malley was wrong in what she said.  The abortion issue was high on people&rsquo;s list of issues, as were the questions of family life, right to life and so on.  They were high on people&rsquo;s list of issues and the surveys showed that.  It was also evident on the doorstop. The viewpoint of the people was that whatever decision we might make on these issues, they did not want someone else making that decision and imposing it on them.  That is fair viewpoint.  If we want to make a decision on pro-life issues, that is a matter for us as a sovereign State and nation.  It is not a matter for another body to tell us how we should handle such issues.</P>
        <P>The military issue was also a major one for people.  Young mothers in particular were strong and definite in their view that they did not want to commit their sons and daughters to a future war.  That issue was raised in previous referenda on treaties.  It was a definite issue of concern for young couples with children.  It was easy to say that cannot happen for reasons A, B and C.  We still have a major job to show we are committed to neutrality and that there is not some dallamull&oacute;g operating behind the scenes organising some movement gradually into a military alliance that will put responsibilities back on ourselves.  That is still an issue and we have to convince the people in that regard.</P><Col N="1099"/>
        <P>Most of the people who opposed the Lisbon treaty did it with good will.  I am certain there were others who had hidden agendas.  I am not sure we succeeded in outing or identifying those agendas.  It would not have been ruthless to do that but it would have been the right thing to do.  In the case of those who were genuine in opposing the treaty, it was left to us to know how to communicate with those people.  There was an opportunity to communicate and we lost out in that respect.  One of the reasons for that is we did not get the support of the media.  They did not make the type of effort necessary to explain precisely what was in the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge what the Government has achieved.  It sincerely set out to identity the concerns.  When the Taoiseach, Minister and officials went to debate this issue with the other 26 member states, most people would not have given them a 100% chance that they would be successful.  There was a fair amount of wrong sniping from the media.  The Government had hardly put down what precisely it wanted to address in Europe when people in the media were sniping at it.  On the other hand, the Government kept a cool head, did not panic and worked away quietly.  Up to the very end of the process, it was covered in two newspaper reports, one on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent </i> and the other on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The heading of the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> was Brown-Cowen rift endangers Lisbon treaty.  The heading of the article in <i>The Irish Times </i>was positive on that occasion to the effect that a breakthrough was likely.  When the breakthrough came 24 hours later, the <i>Irish Independent</i> carried a tiny article in the right-hand corner of a page stating that a solution had been achieved and the process had been a success.  Such coverage is not right.  When the good of the country is at stake, we must all pull together.  That must be done in regard the Lisbon treaty.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I do not care what surveys are being done or what figures have been thrown up.  We should not be complacent about the passing of this treaty.  In addition, we must respect everybody&rsquo;s opinion and we must try to communicate with people on the basis that they have a sincere position.  Many speakers have made that point.  If we do not pass the Lisbon treaty next autumn this country will be in a very serious situation.  That is not just because of the state of the economy, it is because of the network and goodwill we have developed with other nations.</P>
        <P>When I refer to people passionately defending our sovereignty, I do not think those who set about to achieve the independence of this country, at great sacrifice on that occasion, could in their wildest dreams have seen us holding the Presidency of Europe and then to be complimented on delivering it with panache and effectiveness.  That surely shows our status and our standing.  If we are prepared to endanger that then there is no doubt that we will become non-competitive in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and the Bill that is before the House to provide for a new referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Like Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; I have listened to the full debate.  We have had some excellent contributions on the Bill.  The Lisbon treaty is an important issue for Europe but it is vital for this country.</P>
        <P>A maxim taught to medical students is sometimes translated in Latin as, <i>Primum non nocere</i>, first do no harm.  That is a principle we should bear in mind when dealing with the Lisbon treaty and Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union.  In voting in the referendum on 2 October we should first and foremost aim to ensure we do not harm Ireland.  It is my humble opinion that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would do a great deal of harm to this country, its economy and future.</P>
        <P>It is essential that all parties, political or otherwise, who advocate a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, must hit the road running and take the initiative in providing the electorate with clear, concise information on what is contained in the treaty.  If that message is communicated properly I have no doubt the Irish people in their wisdom will deliver a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in October.  The &ldquo;No&rdquo; <Col N="1100"/>campaign cannot be allowed to muddy the waters again.  The legal guarantees sought and granted by our European partners in response to the concerns and issues that were raised during the previous referendum campaign on the Lisbon treaty will ensure that the people will respond in a similar positive fashion.</P>
        <P>From an economic perspective, we are living in a very different country now, 13 months on from the last referendum.  Even more important than the legal clarifications and the legal guarantees is the dramatically changed economic circumstances in this country.  We can no longer afford the luxury of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to our most important economic partner.  That is not scaremongering or bullying but rather a reality check.  I was struck by comments made by the Irish Exporters Association recently which stated that Ireland&rsquo;s export industry would die without Europe.  Its CEO outlined that Ireland&rsquo;s participation in Europe was vital to our economic well-being and emphasised the importance of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Lisbon treaty referendum in October.  He stated,&ldquo;It is not a question of a grey complicated argument, it is simply a question of our economic well-being and if we do not have a resounding &ldquo;Yes&ldquo; vote, this country is in deep trouble&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Exports are vital to our future prosperity and an essential ingredient in dragging this country out of recession.  Irish exports have grown more than a hundred-fold since we first joined the EU in 1973.  Since then the percentage of Irish exports being sold to European countries, other than the UK, has risen from 21% to 46% each year.  Ireland exports 80% of all goods and services produced here and Europe is our biggest customer.  It is vital to heed the words of the Irish Exporters Association, Chambers Ireland and other bodies and organisations that are concerned with job creation and investment in this country.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is in the national interest and in the economic interest of this country.</P>
        <P>Can one imagine how our country would have coped to date if we were not part of the eurozone?  The European Central Bank has provided valuable liquidity to our banks during the financial crisis.  Without the solidarity of our partners in Europe we faced economic meltdown.  Remaining at the heart of Europe is essential to attract investment.  Political uncertainty creates economic instability and now more than ever we need both political and economic stability.  I am delighted to see the return of the Minister, Deputy Martin, to the Chamber.  I welcome the fact that he has called on other Ministers to appear before Oireachtas committees, in the same way as he appears before them prior to GAERC meetings.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and those meetings are very productive.  We should consider putting them on a more formal basis.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael looks forward to campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum.  Heretofore, a great deal of emphasis was placed on the technical aspects of the treaty.  It is important to outline the benefits of the treaty to this country.  The treaty is all about being a player in Europe and being centre stage.  The treaty also relates to participation.  Ireland has benefited enormously as a result of its membership of the European Union.  We cannot operate in isolation or deal alone with global matters such as energy security, climate change and possible health threats.  We must work together, co-operate and show absolute commitment to ensure the ratification of the treaty which is fundamental to everybody in this country and the other member states of the European Union.  It is crucial that we show commitment to the cause and put our differences aside.  That is the only way we will persuade the people to support the treaty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words in support of the legislation and, more importantly, in support of the Lisbon treaty, the vote on which will take place early in October.  It is a significant time as it is the 20th anniversary of the fall of <Col N="1101"/>the Berlin Wall due to people power.  It is the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism and the spread of freedom and democracy across the Continent, and the charting of a new march forward for the people of Europe.</P>
        <P>If somebody had said to me in February or March 1987 when I was first elected to the Oireachtas that within little more than two and a half years the Soviet empire would have dissolved and the Iron Curtain would have melted down, I would have considered it an incredible dream.  Such has been the pace of people power in politics in the past two decades that we now have a strong and dynamic Europe with most countries on that Continent now members of the European Union.  The Lisbon treaty is the next step in ensuring a strong and peaceful Europe, a Europe that works and creates work.  In this time of economic difficulty, doubt and uncertainty, it is, as stated by Senators Cummins and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, absolutely imperative for the future economic well-being of this country that we ratify this treaty at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>Ireland has changed, as has Europe, since June 2008.  We must respect the decision of the Irish people a little more than 12 months ago when they rejected the Lisbon treaty.  We must recognise that a significant number of people had genuine doubts, fears and concerns about it.  While there are always people who will say &ldquo;No&rdquo; regardless of the question put before them, we must try to bring on board all people and ensure that the Lisbon treaty is carried.  It is important, as honesty and transparency is important in politics, that we point out without fear or favour that the Lisbon treaty has been clarified and not changed and that the same question is being put before the people on 2 October as was put before them in June 2008.  There was a need for clarification of the treaty and I congratulate the Government and the Taoiseach on clarifying some of the doubts and confusion that surrounded it on the last occasion, some of which was deliberately generated and some which was genuine.  It is hoped we are now in a position to wave aside some of the issues which caused that doubt and concern which resulted in people voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the treaty.</P>
        <P>We must all, between now and 2 October, seek to ensure that the clarified treaty is understood by the majority of people.  There is an onus on political parties, in particular the two main parties, to actively canvass and campaign in a real and meaningful fashion.  I hope we have all learned the lesson of April, May and June 2008 that playing silly politics with a referendum, with posters being displayed on billboards saying councillor A says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and councillor B supports Lisbon, is not what a campaign should be about.  It must be about knocking on doors, holding public meetings and distributing literature that explains what the treaty is about, how important it is for Ireland and pointing out that our very future depends on the European Union and our active involvement therein.  On this occasion, we need a real political campaign not of the type in which we all took part a little more than 12 months ago.  It is time for political leadership.  Members on the Government side of the House must show leadership as must those on this side of the House who hope to be a position of leadership of the country in a few years time.  We must show the strength of our political parties by actively supporting the Government in this matter through encouraging our supporters to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The state of our economy is perilous; we all know that.  Thousands of jobs per week are being lost, causing huge doubt and uncertainty for families.  The only certainty which we can offer our hard pressed constituents this summer and autumn is that in saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Lisbon, thus ensuring the European Union works more efficiently and effectively, we will be part of a strong team which can help turn the economic tide.  That is the challenge before us.  We face a big political task to convince our friends, neighbours and constituents that Ireland&rsquo;s future is at the core of Europe.</P><Col N="1102"/>
        <P Just="Left">I have heard many people who were opposed the treaty in 2008 and are set to oppose it again preface their remarks by saying, &ldquo;Yes Ireland must be at the heart of Europe and yes we support the EU &lsquo;but&rsquo;, and that is nothing but a cop-out.  One is either for the European Union or against it.  To use the biblical phraseology, &ldquo;He who is not for me is against me.&rdquo;  The phraseology, &ldquo;I am for Europe and I want Ireland to be in Europe but&rdquo;, is a load of codswallop.  The voices of negativity and rejection are old enough that their song has been on disc since 1971 or 1972.  We heard in 1987, 1992 and since then of the damage, peril and disaster that would face this country if we continued with the European Union project.  We must reject those voices of doubt, cynicism and opportunism.  Their only interest in campaigning for Lisbon or Europe relates to their own little pathetic political projects.</P>
        <P>The majority of Members of this and the other House see the Lisbon treaty as being so central to the future economic well-being of this country that they are wiling to put their shoulders to the wheel on this occasion.  Perhaps 12 months ago many of our local councillors were preparing for local elections and were looking elsewhere politically and, perhaps, there was such division in Leinster House on other political matters that we took our eye off the ball.  However, on this occasion there can be no doubt in terms of the question before us: do we remain at the heart of Europe as a central player, being influential, or do we shut down the window of opportunity which Europe offers us?  That is the question we must answer next October.  The challenge for all of us is to actively engage with the public to gain their support for the referendum.  The scale of the question before us next October is such that if we do not ratify the treaty the future of this country will be dark, dreary and bleak.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the onus and responsibility on the political establishment in this regard.  However, there is a need for us to point out to the public that it is they who will make the decision and it is they who have a responsibility to engage and educate themselves in regard to what this debate is about.  Politicians can lead and try to inform and drive opinion but, as in respect of rights and responsibilities, the electorate bears a responsibility to read about the treaty, to tune into debates on it and to make an informed decision in that regard.  I have enough confidence in the intelligence of the Irish people to expect that they can understand the treaty and the choice they have to make.  I hope they will say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions to this debate, which is hugely important in the context of our membership of the European Union and in terms of the future of this country during the next two decades.  A number of diverse contributions were made.  There appears to be a general sense among all Members of the importance of the role of national parliaments in terms of their relationship with the European Union legislative and decision-making process.  I outlined in my opening remarks the significance of the Lisbon treaty for greater engagement by national parliaments, especially in terms of prior access to European Union legislative proposals and having the capacity to have an impact on them.  Senator Fitzgerald made that point, as did Senator Ormonde in the context of the citizens&rsquo; petition initiative where citizens can petition the institutions of concern to them.</P>
        <P>I would like to rebut a number of points made.  I was struck by Senator Doherty&rsquo;s contribution and the degree to which he sought to distort the facts.  His remarks on the Lisbon treaty&rsquo;s voting rules show the difference in our world view.  Senator Doherty sees the removal of vetoes as a having a negative effect on Ireland but I see it as a chance to prevent other countries from blocking our national interests.  The Single Market was one of the most important things that happened to Ireland but for a long time it was stopped because of the <Col N="1103"/>need for unanimity.  Invariably it is in our best interests when the veto is removed on many issues.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should hear me out because I am responding to the point he made.  As I asked in the D&aacute;il last night, how many times has Ireland used the veto since we joined the European Union 35 years ago?  Once.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The threat of the veto is enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Once.  That speaks volumes about this issue.  This has been run up and down but it is a non-issue.  Ireland&rsquo;s place in Europe is not as the negative, suspicious blocker imagined by Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is as an active consensus builder positively engaged in shaping negotiating outcomes to reflect our interests from the outside.  Irish Ministers of various Governments and civil servants did not sit passively as proposals came through.  We nuanced them, reformed and amended them by working with others.  That is how the system works and we are good at it.  We have been effective and we have played this role to our great advantage during our membership to date.</P>
        <P>The points made about workers&rsquo; rights are addressed by the solemn declaration on workers&rsquo; rights and social policy where the European Council confirms the high importance the Union attaches to the responsibility of member states for the delivery of education and health services.  Similarly, we have obtained assurances in respect of trade where the Council must act unanimously when negotiating and concluding international agreements in the field of trade in social, educational and health services where those agreements risk seriously disturbing the national organisation of such services and prejudicing the responsibility of member states to deliver them.</P>
        <P>There is no threat to the capacity or competency of a member state to deliver health or education services.  It is a myth to suggest otherwise.  I know because I am a former Minister for Education and Science and for Health and Children.  I know how limited the competences Europe enjoys in those areas are and I know how jealously member states guard the right to provide their own health services.  Invariably on the health front, the debate has primarily developed in terms of public health issues when it comes to health care.  That is a fact and it scaremongering to suggest our public services will be privatised as a result of the Lisbon treaty.  It is an appalling myth.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge that a vote for Lisbon is a vote for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  The provisions of the charter cover workers&rsquo; rights to information and consultation within the undertaking, the right of collective bargaining and action, the right of access to placement services, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, the prohibition of child labour, protection of young people at work and family and professional life.  It is incontrovertible that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is better for workers&rsquo; rights than a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote because the <i>status quo</i> is less advantageous for workers than the Lisbon treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It defeats me how anyone can rationally argue otherwise.  Even taking the Laval, Viking and R&uuml;ffert judgments, the bottom line is that those judgments were case and country specific.  In the Laval case there was no <Col N="1104"/>statutory provision for the minimum wage but Laval could not happen in Ireland because we have a statutory minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I wish people would stop deliberately sowing confusion on these issues.  The charter fundamentally protects the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike.  The judgments said there were circumstances where they had to be proportionate but all rights carry that qualification.  The Lisbon treaty goes further than that.  All those cases were heard prior to the charter achieving full treaty status.  When the charter achieves full treaty status, it will significantly enhance workers&rsquo; rights.  There is no other construct one could put on this debate.</P>
        <P>It was interesting that Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who has been a prominent trade unionist for his entire life, is equally clear about the importance of the charter and the promotion of the social market, full employment, social progress, and social justice and protection.  There is a significant degree of case law where the European Court of Justice has already noted the primacy attached to social progress and the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of people as emphasised by the preamble to the treaty.</P>
        <P>The Viking and Laval judgments were decided before Lisbon and are an interpretation of the treaties as they stand today.  A rejection of Lisbon will mean that the existing treaties remain in place.  The judgments are not adverse to workers&rsquo; rights because they turn on the peculiar facts.  A rejection of Lisbon will thus not overrule the judgments or create any real or even perceived advancement of workers&rsquo; rights.  Voting against Lisbon because it will not overrule these judgments does not make any sense at all.  Lisbon will not improve the performance of the Irish soccer team but that is not a reason to vote against it.  Senator Doherty is saying that in his argument but people should vote for or against the treaty on the basis of what it does, not what it does not do.  We will return to this because the Union with the charter is a significant advance for workers but if people vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, they are throwing away an opportunity to enhance workers rights without question.</P>
        <P>In terms of security and defence, our legal guarantee in this area has been raised as an issue.  The guarantee states the treaty of Lisbon does not effect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.  It will be for member states, including Ireland, acting in a spirit of solidarity and without prejudice to its traditional policy of military neutrality, to determine the nature of aid or assistance to be provided to a member state that is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of armed aggression on its territory.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty spoke about that mutual assistance clause as if it were contrary to our policy of traditional military neutrality or somehow undermined our independence.  It does nothing of the sort and the guarantee we have stitched in clearly deals with that to a degree that some people might have qualms about it for the totally opposite reason.  There are those in this House who would think if a terrorist attack happened somewhere that we would provide assistance in terms of aid and support.  I would like to think if a European country was attacked by al-Qaeda that we would provide whatever assistance we could.  That is what the mutual assistance clause is about.  Many people in Europe are scratching their heads about some people&rsquo;s opposition to this clause.</P>
        <P>The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation.  It does not affect the right of Ireland or any member state to determine the nature and volume of its defence and security expenditure and capabilities, which was a point of strong argument on the last occasion.  Again, it will be a matter for Ireland or any other member state to decide in accordance with any domestic legal requirements whether to participate in any military operation.  I repeat that we can decide about any military oper<Col N="1105"/>ation.  I do not know how one could look for a more absolute guarantee than what we have achieved.  There is nothing more we could look for on security and defence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Doherty said we could not trust the Government on taxation.  The only party, with respect, that one could not have trusted on corporate taxation over the last ten years was Sinn F&eacute;in, which had clear views that the tax should be increased.  This is a legitimate political position to have, but it is the reality.  As the Senator said, unanimity is required on taxation.  Ireland retains a veto.  Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Lisbon treaty, provides that any future move to confer additional powers on the European Union or alter the provisions of the treaties would continue to require an intergovernmental conference.  This is known as the ordinary revision procedure.  A proposal to amend EU internal policies in a way that does not increase the Union&rsquo;s competences would not require an intergovernmental conference.  This procedure is referred to as a simplified revision procedure.  Any such decision would still have to be ratified in accordance with the constitutional requirements of each member state, which means in Ireland&rsquo;s case that advice would be sought from the Attorney General on each occasion as to whether a referendum was required.</P>

	<P>The Lisbon treaty also contains another simplified revision procedure, which provides that the European Council, acting unanimously, can decide that a policy should in the future be decided by QMV rather than unanimity.  This is a point the Senator was making earlier.  However, it would have to be decided unanimously; therefore, we retain the veto.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Unanimous&rdquo; means we call it.  This procedure is intended for a case in which all member states and parliaments are of the opinion that a certain issue can be decided by QMV.  The need for complete unanimity means this procedure will, in all probability, be rarely used, but the key point is that even in these limited circumstances nothing can be done without the agreement of all governments and all parliaments.  That is the point.</P>
        <P>Our legal guarantee on taxation could not be clearer.  The guarantee is clear in stating that nothing in the Lisbon treaty makes any change to the EU&rsquo;s competence with respect to taxation and, in particular, the right of member states to set their own corporate tax rates.  Retention of unanimity in voting on taxation and policy matters was a key aim during our negotiations on the treaty.  The aim was fully achieved and unanimity in voting on tax matters remains unchanged.  The Senator should not try to cloud that reality as he did in his earlier remarks.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Again, Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to create a fog around the issue of the Commissioner.  The figure of five years has been introduced out of the blue.  This happened yesterday in the other House and it has happened again this evening.  The scriptwriters and researchers are busy trying to put a spin on things and distort the reality.  We are not claiming anything more or less than the following, which is stated in the conclusions of the European Council &ldquo;Provided the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, a decision would be taken, in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, to the effect that the Commission shall continue to include one national of each Member State&rdquo;.  That was unanimously decided in December 2008 and reaffirmed on 19 June of this year.  It is unambiguous.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>

	<P>Backing Lisbon will result in our retaining our Commissioner indefinitely.  Claims that this arrangement is somehow time-limited are entirely bogus.  This is a considerable victory for Ireland because some member states, particularly the Benelux countries, wanted a smaller Commission.  There was a legitimate argument in Europe about this.  They were willing to accommodate us because they accepted this had been a real issue in the last referendum.  I acknowledge that.  People spoke about this when they voted.  We have responded to that vote and made changes.  We fought for and negotiated a Commissioner for each member state and we have achieved it.</P>
        <P>What happens if the Lisbon treaty is not ratified?  The Commission to be appointed in November 2009 will have to have fewer than 27 members, which is the legal position under the Nice treaty.  This means that not all countries can be represented.  The bottom line is this: the only way in which we can be guaranteed to keep our Commissioner is to ratify the treaty.  It is the only way.  The posters that went up saying &ldquo;Vote No to keep your Commissioner&rdquo; will now have to say &ldquo;Vote Yes to keep your Commissioner&rdquo;.  There is no other logical construct that one could put on it.  That is an important point.</P>

        <P>Oireachtas scrutiny, which many Members mentioned, is an issue that needs to be taken seriously.

	<P>A case was taken against the German Theatre Pension Institution for refusing to recognise his entitlement to a widow&rsquo;s pension as part of the survivor&rsquo;s benefits provided for under the compulsory occupational pension scheme of which his deceased same-sex partner had been a member.  The court in Munich referred the case to the European Court of Justice in 2006 for an interpretation of Council Directive 2000/78/EC, which lays down a general framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation as regards employment and occupation.  The preamble of the directive states that it is &ldquo;without prejudice to national laws on marital status and the benefits dependent thereon&rdquo;.  The ECJ was asked to decide whether the directive precluded domestic legislation under which after the death of his life partner the surviving partner does not receive a survivor&rsquo;s benefit equivalent to that granted to a surviving spouse.</P>
        <P>The court noted that Germany had legislated for same-sex unions and that while marriage was reserved for heterosexual unions, the conditions for same-sex unions in Germany were gradually made equivalent to those applicable to marriage.  The court observed that the German regime for same-sex unions was harmonised gradually with that of marriage.  In 2004, an amendment made by Germany to its own social security code made it clear that life partnership was to be treated as equivalent to marriage in the statutory old age pension scheme.  The ECJ relied on the fact that the German court that referred the case to it was of the view that because of the gradual harmonisation of life partnership and marriage under German domestic law, a life partnership, while not identical to marriage, placed persons of the same sex in Germany in a situation comparable to that of spouses as far as survivor&rsquo;s benefit is concerned.  It decided, therefore, that the directive precludes legislation such as that at issue in the case, under which after the death of a life partner the surviving partner does not receive a survivor&rsquo;s benefit equivalent to that granted to a surviving spouse.</P>
        <P>This case turned on the provisions of German domestic law and their interpretation by the German courts.  The ECJ did not say that Germany or any member state must introduce a scheme of registered life partnership for same-sex persons, nor that Germany, which has introduced such a scheme, must treat registered life partners in a manner equivalent to spouses for pension purposes.  The ECJ simply stated that because German law equates spouses and registered life partners for pension purposes, German occupational pension schemes such as the one in question must treat spouses and registered life partners equally.  The case is being made that this was interference by the ECJ in telling other countries what to do.  That was not the case.  The ECJ concluded it would be for the court in Munich to determine, on the facts, whether Maruko was a situation comparable to that of a spouse entitled to survivor&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>I have gone into detail on these issues which were raised by Senators because the Chamber is the place to do so.  It is important to deal with them on the record in a comprehensive and clear way.  These issues do not take from the fundamental point.  We have spent a lot of time over the past 12 months dealing with issues that were legitimately raised during the last campaign.<b>  </b>The matter to be decided was ultimately Ireland&rsquo;s vision as a society, our sense of where we want to be in ten years&rsquo; time and our value system, which we have shared for more than 35 years with the European Union.</P>
        <P>We went to our partners in Europe, stated the issues the Irish people raised and asked if they could respond.  The 26 other member states have responded in a generous way.  There was a general desire across Europe to reform the European Union.  The reforms contained in the <Col N="1108"/>Lisbon treaty are modest and will make Europe more effective on the world stage and enable it to deal with major issues, such as the global financial crisis, climate change and energy security.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s financial well-being and banking system is inextricably bound up with our membership of the eurozone.  Our membership of it and the role of the European Central Bank have been critical in the underpinning of our financial and banking system.  That underlines the importance of working with people, being proactive and being at the heart of Europe.</P>
        <P>We should not hold up the reform of Europe.  Others have come to us and have responded.  Do we want to be on our own and hold back the advancement of Europe?  Three major issues have arisen in the past 12 months.  I have mentioned one, namely, the economic crisis.  Another is the invasion of Georgia by Russia.  President Sarkozy&rsquo;s strong leadership on that occasion accelerated the ceasefire and his intervention was important.  He intervened as President of the European Union and had the full weight of the Union behind him.  That shows the importance of what the Lisbon treaty is endeavouring to do.  We saw a snapshot on that occasion of how Europe, as an important force, could make an impact in terms of peace and conflict resolution.</P>
        <P>Another major issue, which could surface again, is the supply of gas to Ukraine.  A number of smaller states were without energy for a number of weeks and their economies were severely impaired in the middle of winter.  It was the European Union, under the Presidency of the Czech Republic, that intervened.  It made a difference and helped to broker a resolution.  Ireland, as a small country, needs that protection and needs a Europe that is effective and capable to provide for our energy security, because currently 80% to 90% of our energy consists of imported fossil fuels.  We will develop, change and have alternative energies, but we want to be part of the European grid system and benefit from the major decisions Europe will take to guarantee future flows of energy supplies into the European Continent in the decades ahead.  That is what the Lisbon treaty is really about.</P>
        <P>The area of external policy and the appointment of a high representative is very much about having a positive role in world affairs.  Senator Bradford made a very interesting point about the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  I recently read a significant history on post-war Europe, and 37.5 million Europeans died in the Second World War.  That is what the European Union is about.  It is not about conflict or an arms race.  If one looks at what happened in the Balkans and the role Europe plays, it is about values, universal human rights, democracy and conflict resolution.  It is about being the largest donor in the world and, between the Commission and the European Union, &euro;48 billion in aid is donated to the developing world.</P>
        <P>That is what the European Union is about and, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have witnessed it on regular occasions, where Ministers exercise themselves in terms of setting criteria to which we want other countries to adhere.  We have witnessed that in a number of locations across the globe and it is the push Europe makes and will continue to make.  In essence, that is what the Lisbon treaty is about.  I urge the House to pass the Bill and I hope the Irish people will look at the treaty in that context on 2 October.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>

It concerns Ballinkillen national school in south County Carlow, which was the subject of a protest outside Leinster House a few weeks ago, where the parents, members of the board of management and some of the pupils were present to highlight the conditions that prevail at that particular school.  It is believed to be the oldest national school still in use in the country, as the building is over 200 years old.  The problem is that the majority of the students are not housed in the school building itself but in prefabs that are attached to or on the grounds of the school building.  The prefabs and the building itself are no longer fit for purpose.</P>
        <P>Successive boards of management have been promised action on a new school for the last 30 years, but no action has been taken.  When they first raised the issue of the difficulties with accommodation at the school 1982, they were given temporary prefabs.  Those temporary structures are still there, and both the building and the temporary structures are no longer fit for purpose.  There are 99 or 109 students in the school, which has four class teachers and additional resource teachers.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister of State outline to the House the progress that is being made on the provision of a new school building?  A number of comments have been made in the media by people connected with the school, and they expressed the understandable opinion that there is a bias in the Department&rsquo;s allocation of resources against small rural schools such as the national school in Ballinkillen.  I hope that the Minister of State will be in a position to ensure that a new school building will be provided as a matter of priority.  I know that we are in straitened economic circumstances at the moment, and that it is difficult for the Minister of State to give commitments, but for a building that has been promised for 30 years for the oldest national school in the country, it would be appropriate that the Department of Education and Science would act swiftly on the provision of a new school building as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I am happy to reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who unfortunately cannot be present.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position on the application to the Department of Education and Science from Ballinkillen national school in County Carlow for large-scale capital funding.</P>
        <P>Ballinkillen national school currently has a core staffing level of a principal and three mainstream teachers.  It also has the services of two learning support teachers and an enrolment at 30 September 2008 of 107 pupils.  The school&rsquo;s current accommodation consists of two permanent classrooms plus some ancillary accommodation.  The school also has the use of two prefabricated units.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the school management submitted an application for large-scale capital funding for the provision of a new school.  A more recent application for such funding was received in 2008.  In January 2009, the Minister for Education and Science met with a delegation from the school.  The delegation put forward a proposal for a new school building to be built on a site donated by a local resident.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science against published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the education partners.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of accommodation needed based on population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments, the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for pupil places and the condition of the school building itself.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under the prioritisation criteria, which I have already mentioned.  There are four band ratings in all, with band 1 being the highest and band 4 being the lowest.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to the schools.  In other words, a building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it and as it ready to proceed.  The application from Ballinkillen national school has been assigned a band 2.2 rating, reflecting the fact that the standard of its existing accommodation is such that it needs an extension that is greater than 50% of the existing building.</P>
        <P>Due to the scale of competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital programme, it has not been possible to date to progress the major building project for this school.  In February of this year, the Minister for Education and Science announced details of 43 major building projects to proceed to tender and construction and 25 high priority projects to commence architectural planning.  The project for Ballinkillen national school was not included in this announcement.  Therefore, it will not be proceeding in 2009.  However, the project for this school will be considered for the Department&rsquo;s 2010 capital programme.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the school management may apply for capital funding under various schemes such as the summer works scheme, emergency works grants and permanent school accommodation or temporary accommodation scheme.  These schemes are in place in order to meet accommodation needs as they arise and also to ensure that schools&rsquo; accommodation is maintained to an acceptable standard.</P>
        <P>Ballinkillen national school applied for funding for capital works under the summer works 2005 scheme, but subsequently withdrew its application.  In 2007, the school applied for and was recently approved &euro;37,000 in funding towards the upgrading of toilet facilities in the school. <Col N="1117"/> The Department has no record of any further application for emergency funding to address any other capital works at the school.  Any such application would be favourably considered by the Department.</P>
        <P>In addition, all primary schools receive an annual minor works grant to enable schools carry out small-scale works that can be completed without the need to interact with the Department.  For the 2008-09 school year alone, individual primary schools received a grant of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per pupil.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to advance all major projects at the same time.  However, all school building projects, including that for Ballinkillen national school, will be advanced incrementally through the system, over time, and as funding is available.  I thank the Senator again for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position in relation to Ballinkillen national school.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  Band 2.2 effectively means that they are going nowhere fast, if my understanding of the banding system is correct.  In his comments to the media, the parish priest mentioned the bias against rural schools.  The assessment process outlined by the Minister of State is based on population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments, and the capacity of the existing schools to meet demand.  It seems that most priorities are for new school buildings in urban areas.  That is understandable, given the recent housing developments around this city and other large urban areas.  However, clearly the bias against small rural schools exists in the system.  Maybe it is time that this is examined, in light of the fact that we will not have significant developments on the outskirts of towns, so that we can have fair and equal treatment for small national schools around the country like Ballinkillen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The first time I raised the subject of this Adjournment debate &mdash; the decision of the Government and the HSE to withdraw home help services &mdash; in the Seanad was approximately six weeks ago, when it first reared its ugly head in County Donegal.  This evening, I am calling on the Minister for Health and Children to reverse her decision to reduce by 2,246 the number of home help hours being given to the elderly people of County Donegal.  Since I became aware of this issue and started to ask questions about it and raise it in the Seanad, I have received numerous replies from the Minister, Deputy Harney, and from HSE officials.  I have been given many figures and statistics setting out the various numbers of hours that are apparently being provided.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to put such information to one side this evening.  I am not as interested in computer data and statistics printed on paper as I am in the elderly people of County Donegal &mdash; Mary, Johnny and Paddy.  I am concerned about people like the 97 year old woman whose home help services have been completely withdrawn, or the wheelchair-bound father whose services have been reduced to just 15 minutes a day.  The people to whom I refer dug deep when this country needed people to dig deep.  They went to hiring fairs before they were teenagers and were hired off to other families.  When they went to Scotland to work as tattie hokers, they sent money back to their families and communities at home.  Many of them lived through very difficult times, including the First and Second World Wars.  When their country needed them, they stretched out their hands.  They want their country to respond to the serious needs they have today.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, Fianna F&aacute;il is shaping a new type of Ireland.  When I say it is an Ireland of which I can no longer be proud, I accept that I am making a strong statement.  This issue <Col N="1118"/>involves more than statistics, numbers of hours and other forms of data &mdash; it goes to the core of what we are all about.  It is shameful for any Government to treat the elderly as they are being treated at present.  At a national level, the Government is withdrawing almost 27,000 hours of critical home help support on the basis of computer data, rather than on the basis of need.  It is completely wrong and utterly unjust.  In my view, it is one of the worst crimes the Government has committed in recent years.  I appeal to the Minister of State to encourage his colleagues to do the right thing at this late stage.  A great deal of damage has been done to elderly people and a great deal of hurt has been caused to their family members.</P>
        <P>The terms of employment of home care workers have been changed.  Some of them are now working just three hours a week, which makes absolutely no sense.  I noticed today that the Government has sent 1.3 million postcards, at what must have been a phenomenal cost, to homes across the country to tell people about guarantees that mean nothing.  The House debated the matter earlier.  In some cases, the postcards have been sent to people in County Donegal whose loved ones are having to cope with reductions in front-line services like home help hours.  The Government does not have the cop-on to understand it is more important to give people an additional 15 minutes of home help support  &mdash; to help them get out of bed, onto a commode and back into bed, for example &mdash; than it is to send postcards around the country.  It needs to get its act together.</P>
        <P>The issue I have raised is at the root of the problem of where this country is going.  What type of country is this Government shaping?  While I accept that we have to make decisions if we are to get the country back on track, we should not attack people who need the State to provide help so they can get out of bed, get onto a commode, get washed and get back into bed.  The Minister of State knows it is wrong to cut services of this nature.  I am sure the Taoiseach knows it as well, so why is it continuing to happen?</P>
        <P>IMPACT and SIPTU have organised a protest for 2 p.m. this Saturday.  I hope thousands of people will take to the streets to speak with one voice of their anger and disgust at what the Government is doing.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give the people of Donegal the answer they are looking for.  The Government should promise to review this matter and ensure that any cuts deemed necessary are made on the basis of the needs of patients and elderly people, rather than on the basis of the impression that County Donegal has a higher need than the HSE has budgeted for.  I remind the House that it is proposed to reduce by 2,246 the number of home help hours being provided in the county.  I do not know how much that will save, but it is not worth taking the dignity of our elderly people, which can never be paid back.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give us the right answer tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to Senator Doherty on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue and thereby giving me an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to services for older people and, in particular, the important area of home help services.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on older people involves supporting them to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  If this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care, where appropriate.  This policy approach was renewed and developed in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The development of services for older people throughout the country reflects the prioritisation of, and significant investment in, this area by the Government in recent years.  For example, additional funding of just over &euro;200 million was provided to develop or expand community-based services between 2006 and 2008.  This additional funding related to home care packages, <Col N="1119"/>home help, meals on wheels and day or respite care, for example.  Home care services are delivered either directly by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive, in partnership with the voluntary sector or through private providers, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>I will set out the position in relation to home help.  It is expected that the HSE will spend &euro;211 million on the home help service this year.  Over &euro;55 million in development funding has been provided since 2006.  The number of home help hours being provided has increased from 10.8 million in 2006 to almost 12 million this year.  The number of people benefiting from the home help service has increased from 41,400 in 2006 to approximately 54,500 this year.  Home care packages, which are a relatively new initiative, were introduced in 2006.  They were developed across the country through the Government&rsquo;s phased investment of &euro;120 million in new funding.  Home help packages consist of a variety of community-based services and supports, including a significant home help element in many cases, to best meet the needs of older people.  Home help clients may have significant medical, nursing or therapy requirements.  They may have recently been discharged from hospital.  They may be at risk of admission to hospital if their needs are not met in a planned way.  The HSE service plan envisages that approximately 8,700 people will benefit from home help packages at any one time.  Over 11,000 people will benefit over the course of this year.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that, notwithstanding its current financial pressures, the Government has made every effort to protect home care services for older people.  This year, the HSE aims to deliver the same quantity and quality of home help and home care packages nationally as it delivered in 2008.  I understand that the HSE in County Donegal provided 54,246 home support hours per month in the first quarter of 2009.  This was in excess of the number of budgeted hours, which is 52,000 hours per month for 2009.  Since 2003, there has been a 60% increase in the number of home help hours delivered to older people in Donegal.  In addition, 191 people in Donegal benefit directly from home care packages.</P>
        <P>Of this country&rsquo;s 32 local health offices, the local health office in Donegal provides the third highest number of home help hours <i>per capita</i> to those over 65 years of age.  The HSE has indicated that it intends to achieve efficiencies in service delivery by reviewing the scale of provision, particularly on Sundays and bank holidays when premium pay rates apply.  It aims to meet patient needs through a variety of supports, including public health nursing, day hospitals, day centres and home care packages.  Any person in County Donegal who is not satisfied with the level of home support being provided can appeal the decision to the HSE appeals officer in the north west.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the Government has made considerable improvements in recent years to enhance home care provision across the country, including County Donegal.  There is no doubt that demand can, at times, exceed service resources.  I am satisfied, however, that the HSE will continue to deliver the home help service in the best possible manner, taking account of evolving circumstances at national and local levels.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State take a clear message to decision makers at Cabinet level to the effect that this issue is not going to go away?  The response the Minister of State has been asked to deliver tonight on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is complete and utter nonsense.  I have that response already and it is devoid of any real facts as regards what is happening on the ground, the real people in the real stories.  I ask him to take a clear message to the effect that the people of Donegal are not going to tolerate this.  This is not the last that the Government has heard of this. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment. </P>
        <P>A couple of weeks ago I tabled a matter on the Adjournment regarding the number of children who have gone missing from the care of the HSE.  I received a response on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children that was really quite alarming.  While full figures for the years 2006-08 were not available, the figures that were available for 2000-06 and the incomplete figures for 2006-08 indicated that approximately 397 children remain missing from the care of the HSE.  All of these, with the exception of one child, I understand, are unaccompanied non-national minors.  I am very concerned that these children are extraordinarily vulnerable.  They do not have any families to speak up for them.  They do not have any links with or ties to the country and therefore have not established relationships that would allow people to advocate on their behalf and continuously urge the authorities to locate them and be assured they are safe.</P>
        <P>What is particularly alarming is that while it is accepted a number may claim to be unaccompanied, when they come into the care of they HSE, they tend to abscond in order to join up with family members.  That appears to account for a certain number, but we are not sure how many.  I presume some of those numbers may be for children who are located or whose whereabouts are accounted for.</P>
        <P>It now appears that a number of these children are being trafficked into Ireland, either for the purposes of child labour or the sex trade.  I am aware that a number of investigations are underway at present by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into some such incidences.  It is really important that we as Members of the Oireachtas speak up for these children and that we ensure their safety and whereabouts are kept to the forefront in everybody&rsquo;s mind.  I welcome the new joint national protocol which the Minister indicated was signed in April to ensure that the Garda works in conjunction with the HSE to locate every child who has gone missing.</P>
        <P>I would appreciate any update the Minister of State might give regarding the effectiveness of this as well as any update on the measures that have been undertaken by the Garda to find these children.  Most importantly, there is a danger that where so many children can go missing without there being much public awareness of the phenomenon, that a false message could be sent out to the effect that Ireland is a soft target for trafficking, and this obviously cannot be let happen.  I would welcome any update the Minister of State can provide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is unable to be present due to other business. </P>
        <P>The joint Garda-HSE protocol referred to by the Senator sets out the roles and responsibilities of both agencies in relation to children missing from care.  The joint aim of both organisations is to reduce the number of such cases, prevent them from suffering harm and return them to safety as soon as possible.  We are all very conscious of the devastation and stress caused to families and their relatives when a child goes missing.  Thankfully, the vast majority of these children are located safe and well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The protocol underlines the prominence given to this issue by both organisations, and the HSE and the Garda have worked closely in its development.  It provides clearly defined arrangements for addressing issues relating to children in care who go missing and sets out the most important actions to be taken by both organisations when a missing child in care report <Col N="1121"/>is made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition to children who come into HSE care in the more traditional ways, the protocol also covers separated children seeking asylum.</P>
        <P>An important feature of the protocol is the establishment at local level of a Garda liaison role with the HSE care placements.  This local liaison role includes a mechanism to identify children in care who are reported missing frequently and raises the responsibility for such cases to an appropriate level of authority in both organisations.</P>
        <P>At a national level both the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na agreed to review the protocol after six months of operation and at appropriate intervals thereafter.  It was felt that six months was the minimum period of operation before a meaningful review could be carried out.  The HSE has commenced a process to change its model of care for separated minors such that they can avail of foster care and residential arrangements across a broader spectrum than previously available.  The HSE has also appointed a senior manager with responsibility for managing these changes and developments on a full time basis.  This senior manager is actively engaging with all stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na meets the challenges posed in locating missing children and has assigned additional personnel resources to the missing persons bureau at Garda headquarters.</P>
        <P>An area to which the Minister attaches priority is that of child trafficking.  A dedicated anti-human trafficking unit was established in his Department in 2008 to ensure the State&rsquo;s response to human trafficking is co-ordinated, comprehensive and holistic.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 provides for severe penalties for trafficking of children and adults for the purposes of exploitation, which demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s determination to ensure that perpetrators of child trafficking are dealt with appropriately.</P>
        <P>In adopting a proactive approach to human trafficking, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has given priority to the issue of child trafficking.  For example, Operation Snow, an initiative undertaken by the Garda national immigration bureau, is designed to prevent the trafficking and smuggling of minors into, out of and within the State; to ensure the welfare of suspected victims of such criminal activity is adequately provided for; and to achieve prosecutions where criminal activity of the nature concerned has been detected.  From the commencement of the operation in 2007 to the end of 2008, almost 200 incidents had been the subject of investigation, with assistance provided for a total of 164 children.  The majority of these investigations revealed family reunification and other immigration motives as the explanation for suspicious activity by non-Irish nationals.</P>
        <P>The Minister is informed that, excluding separated children seeking asylum, 53 children have gone missing from HSE care from January 2009 to date.  Of these, 51 are accounted for.  Two remain missing, although contact has been made with them, and all appropriate efforts are being made to ensure their safety.  Regarding separated children seeking asylum, the HSE has indicated that 27 children went missing between January and May 2009, of whom two are accounted for.  Figures for 2007 and 2008 in respect of Irish children gone missing remain incomplete due to variations across the HSE in the definition of what constitutes a missing child.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Senator that the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and the HSE are fully aware of the importance of this issue and are committed to taking all necessary actions to ensure that these missing children are located and come to no harm.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I am not being awkward, but with all due respect his response had no details about what measures have been taken to locate the 397 children who remain missing from the care of the HSE.  I welcome the initiatives in place which the Minister of State has outlined tonight.  They are very important and will go a long way to protecting children in the future.  The last couple of months have been very traumatic for Ireland as we struggle to come to terms with the contents of the Ryan report and await the outcome of the Dublin archdiocese report but I am really concerned about what has happened to those 397 children and what measures have been taken to find them.  I intend to keep raising it and would appreciate if any details are available and if some indication can be given that we are still looking for those children and trying to ascertain what has happened to them.</P>
