	<P>I have notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to outline the actions that can be taken as interim, medium and longer-term measures to ensure harbour and vessel safety at Greencastle Breakwater, County Donegal, and the role of the new marine body in prioritising and supporting the development of marine infrastructure to support job creation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Liam Twomey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify if a decision has been reached on the opening hours of the accident and emergency department at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator Keaveney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Twomey as it is repetitious to a motion on the Adjournment on 7 May 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re transfer of functions of Bord Iascaigh Mhara &mdash; back from committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, Finance Bill 2009 &mdash; all Stages, with Second Stage to commence at the conclusion of No. 1, to conclude not later than 2 p.m., with spokespersons having 12 minutes to speak, all other Senators eight minutes, and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and Committee and Remaining Stages to commence not earlier than 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that my Adjournment matter cannot be taken because, as the Cathaoirleach stated, it is repetitious to a motion on the adjournment on 7 May 2009, which is three weeks ago.  However, I ask the Leader to look at the reply given to me by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on that occasion.  She stated in relation to the accident and emergency department at Wexford General Hospital that a report was being carried out and that it would be published at the end of 2009 or early in 2010.  We now know, however, <Col N="800"/>that 24-hour call at the accident and emergency department in Wexford General Hospital will cease at the end of the summer.  Either the Minister was misled by the HSE or this House was misled by the Minister, and the matter deserves a clear answer.  There is not much point in us putting matters down for the adjournment or asking questions in this House if we are to be given misleading responses by the relevant Minister, either deliberately or because she is being misled by her officials.  I want the matter cleared up because it is very important.  It was a deliberate untruth.  We were told that &euro;7.5 million would be spent on the accident and emergency department in Wexford when clearly the HSE&rsquo;s intention was to close down the accident and emergency department.  I want that clarified.</P>
        <P>I ask for an extension of yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  It was a very good debate but not everybody managed to get to speak on it, and I want that clarified.  I also want to ask a question about the Leader&rsquo;s role in the House.  I asked him on the Order of Business on Tuesday to put a few specific questions to the Minister responsible so that he would reply to those questions when he came into this House to contribute to the debate on the Ryan commission.  The Minister informed me that he was not made aware of any request from the Leader about the questions I asked.  Is the Leader obliged to put those questions to the Minister or to merely give an answer in the House?  I would like an extension of that debate, which was excellent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I noted with interest over the past week or so that the Green Party has indicated that it is unhappy with the progress on climate change and it is demanding of the Government that movement be made on this issue.  Members on the Independent benches, who are gravely concerned about the lack of progress on this issue, have decided to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow for No. 12, the Climate Protection Bill 2007 in the names of Senator Bacik and others, to be taken as the first item of business.</P>
        <P>Three or four times I raised the matter of credit unions, in respect of which I have tabled a Bill on the Order Paper, and each time I was opposed by hard political lobbying that prevents progress.  I am also opposed by a twisting of the truth by the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU.  I ask that people, particularly those who have been critical of regulators, take a serious interest in what the regulator of credit unions announced today.  The Financial Regulator announced that he wants the reserves of each credit union to be not less than 10%.  Every Member of the Oireachtas who gives the matter serious consideration should support the regulator&rsquo;s position.  This morning&rsquo;s announcement by the ILCU twists the truth in a language of desperation, undermining what we are trying to do.  Those comments should be resisted and rejected.</P>
        <P>Two months ago I stated in the House that almost 150 credit unions had not announced in their half yearly returns that they were making losses.  They are not required to do it, but they should do so.  This is a question of audit.  The unions did not break any law, but the law of the land is that credit unions may not pay dividends if their reserves are below 10% and unless they have a profit to show.  This morning, they are trying to twist the fact that they are not making profits.</P>
        <P>The ILCU has not been properly engaged in the governance of credit unions for many years, as I often stated.  It is trying to blame the regulator, and there will be a ready market for that.  At least 150 credit unions are not in a position to pay dividends this year.  The ILCU referred to hundreds of credit unions, but I have checked with the regulator and fewer than 80 of them will be impacted upon negatively by the requirement announced this morning by the regulator.  The ILCU has questions to answer and it should not mislead people.  The political world and classes should take a very strong line on this.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>Since becoming a Member of the Seanad I have supported, as have many people on all sides of the House, the placing of photographs on ballot papers.  We have reached a point at which the photographs on posters are the same as the photographs on the ballot papers.  I say this as a disinterested person, but very often there is very little resemblance between the photograph on the ballot paper and the person standing for election.  I am serious about this as people are being misled.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like an investigation into this matter.  Posters must carry a printer&rsquo;s name, but they should also carry a D, for the date of the photograph, an A or a line through it if it has been air brushed and an N if it is natural, that is, whether the person&rsquo;s hair is dyed, is a hairpiece or whatever.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am still approximately 40 years younger than Senator Norris and I do not need air brushing.</P>
        <P>I second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  He is correct in that the Bill would provide the Government, particularly the Green Party, with an opportunity to put its principles where its mouth is and to debate the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>As credit unions have been front page news this morning, Senator O&rsquo;Toole is justified in raising the matter.  Regulation is important and the Houses have bemoaned the absence in recent years of proper regulation of the banking system.  In this case an attempt is being made by the Financial Regulator to put a framework in place for credit union cash reserves.  Introducing a strict new ratio reserve by September this year will put pressure on credit unions.  The regulator went on to say, however, that some flexibility will be <Col N="802"/>built into the regulations.  As credit unions are owned by their members, the latter have access to reasonable rates when they start saving.  The ILCU has a duty to its members to ensure transparency and governance and that credit unions are flexible in their dealings with the regulator.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the operation of the HSE, an organ of the State that executes Government policy?  I am very concerned about this matter and I am raising this issue at national level.  The HSE is engaged in a war against acute hospitals in the southern area.  We know what it has done to services in Nenagh and elsewhere.  Cynically, the Teamwork report on the future of accident and emergency services at Tralee, Bantry and Mallow general hospitals will not be published until after the local and European elections.  On Friday of this week, the Taoiseach will travel to west Cork to give a commitment on the future of Bantry General Hospital.  This will come a week after the <i>Irish Examiner</i> leaked the story that the Government, through the HSE, will downgrade ICU and accident and emergency services at that hospital.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the way in which the HSE does its business and on the connection between the Government and the HSE?  The latter is trying to close acute hospitals and the Taoiseach will travel all the way to Bantry this week to give a commitment about that hospital&rsquo;s future.  Someone is clearly not telling the truth.</P>
        <P>Regarding the appearance of photographs on election posters and the fact that they may be air brushed, to be fair to a Government town council candidate in my area &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Donovan will be aware of this &mdash; his photograph on the ballot paper has been almost blacked out.  That was brought to the candidate&rsquo;s attention by people who avail of postal ballots and he is justifiably considering legal action.  I suggest that we consult <i>The Southern Star</i> because last week the same candidate forgot to mention the Fianna F&aacute;il logo in his election material.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Twomey, the information in the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s reply, which I read, was confirmed to me directly by the HSE when I pursued the issue of the accident and emergency department in Wexford General Hospital.  In a number of regions the HSE is considering &mdash; the process has started in the south east &mdash; the reconfiguration of acute services.  I was clearly told by the HSE that this matter would probably not emerge until the end of this year or early next year and that there would be much consultation in the meantime.  It would be alarming if we as politicians got such information from the HSE while something else is happening.</P>
        <P>I will not accuse Senator Twomey of this, but his constituency colleague in the D&aacute;il has raised the matter of Wexford General Hospital in the run-up to a number of national and local elections.  We must be careful not to make a political football out of the issue because it would not be in the interests of the hospital.</P>

	<P>Senator Walsh should respect the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant because I am dealing with a matter that was raised yesterday on the Order of Business.  I would welcome a debate on equality matters.  The equality agenda, while good, has been hijacked by sectoral interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time is up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I was appalled that a pub on the north side of Dublin was destroyed by a group from the Traveller community that ran out of control.  We need to debate that issue.  Publicans, who have an obligation to run and manage their premises, are not in a position to decide on who they will serve because the equality legislation is not being used as intended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That an is untruth.  Travellers are entitled to be treated as individuals, not as a single group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator listened more instead of mouthing off in the smug, bigoted way that he did, it would enhance the debates in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am horrified by the details of the horrific death of the troubled teen, Melissa Mahon, a 14 year old girl.  When we look at the facts of the case, it seems everyone has failed this child, including her family, the monster who took her life and also the HSE.  To be taken into care in this State should mean care, and care that works.</P>
        <P>Melissa is the 20th child to die in State care in this country in the last nine years, a terrible indictment of our State system.  We know who the troubled teens are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter still before the court and not yet fully decided.  I do not want comment on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  I am engaged in an Oireachtas study on early school drop outs, and all the teachers involved in the study can tell which children are at risk, even those in junior infants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to put in place a concerned watch register for the children who are at risk so we can <Col N="804"/>act early to save lives.  It is something everyone in this House would support because we know, given the history of neglect and abuse in this country which we heard so much about yesterday, we cannot allow any more of the lives of those who end up in care to be lost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I read in a newspaper this morning that the head of one of the religious orders thought the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse would be off the table by the end of the week.  The report will not be off the record of the Irish republic in my lifetime, and the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important we are allowed to debate and reflect on it.  It is the equivalent for us of what the Germans went through.  The reason the Germans can hold their head up in Europe is because in the 1950s, there were trials all over Germany, which are not mentioned much in the media and are not part of the Holocaust porn industry one sees on television.  In every major town in Germany, there were trials of local Nazis, and that kind of due diligence in pursuing the guilty must be part of the Irish republic&rsquo;s response to this report.</P>
        <P>We must also be allowed to reflect on every aspect of the report and not be rushed.  Therefore, we need every chance to debate it from all sides, so everyone is heard, including decent brothers and priests who did their duty.  All parties must be heard, especially the victims.  That must be worked out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a running story.  The report on the Archdiocese of Dublin will be released in the next few weeks.  I am concerned this will happen in the middle of summer and may not be adequately debated, but it is to be hoped the archbishop of Dublin will show the same diligence in being transparent about his own significant property portfolio, which is probably the largest and most valuable in the State, as he has been in requiring religious congregations to pay up.</P>
        <P>I hope the comparatively small voices of the victims are heard and that, for example, Michael O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s simple request that the GAA hold a minute&rsquo;s silence be considered.  All aspects of the report should be reflected and worked on without rushing away from it because how we handle this issue is important.  It will leave an indelible stain on the Irish republic.</P>
        <P>The Germans hold up their heads because they dealt with their past.  Let us deal with our own past and not run away from it now.  We should take every chance to mark the release of the report.  As part of marking it, I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to consider the incarceration of almost 4,000 people in our prisons.  Many people are in jail for minor crimes against property, such as fines or small thievery, and are in their own way social victims.  The Minister should consider, in marking the release of this report, a general amnesty for minor offenders and review of those currently serving time in prisons in view of the overcrowding and difficult conditions in jails and to mark a moment of humanity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer again to a matter I raised yesterday, that is, the atrocious sectarian murder in Coleraine.  A loyalist group has re-routed its march, and that is very welcome.  Speaking as a southern Protestant from a Unionist background, I ask the group to cancel the march completely because it is inappropriate for music to be played and people to march when a man is lying dead as a result of his religion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Returning to the issue we discussed yesterday and about which Senator Harris has spoken so passionately, namely, the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Leader gave an undertaking, on a number of occasions, that he would go to the Department and get a reading on the motion I again propose be taken today which concerns exemptions from the <Col N="805"/>operation of equality legislation.  I do this in light of the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, yesterday gave an undertaking to the House that he would examine the issue.  It is appropriate that we use this House to examine the issue, especially in light of the comments made this morning on RTE radio by Her Excellency, the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, who said she knew about the situation.  She said the report did not surprise her because she knew about the culture and ethic in the church at that time, which was of dominating authoritarianism.</P>
        <P>If we all knew about it and the Government knew, how could the authorities surrender children to these authorities and place such a culture and ethic above the law?  I am not anti-Catholic.  I simply seek for all churches to be placed at a level of equality with the rest of the institutions.  That cannot be seen as sectarian.  It is fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I endorse the comments of Senator Norris on the need for the march to be cancelled and the request that the group consider it.  It would be a sign of the maturity of the people of all communities that, while respecting the right to march, there should also be the right to respect human life.  It would be a sign of maturity all of communities if those involved in the marching season reflected seriously on what happened in Coleraine.  In this instance, they should go with what the majority would see as a sign of solidarity with the family who have lost a loved one, and with those who were injured and almost killed at the weekend.</P>
        <P>In the context of the good weather we will have in the next few days, when the sunburn index will be very high, I encourage the Leader to continue to allow discussions on cancer.  We have discussed bowel cancer and I have raised the issue of melanoma cancer awareness.  We should support the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s campaigns.  I ask for an update in October on the roll-out of BreastCheck to the remaining counties, including Donegal, which is due to happen in September or October.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for an update on the judicial review committee which has been talked about for many years.  It would have an oversight role regarding the judicial system and it is important we see some advances on that soon.</P>
        <P>Regarding posters and hoardings, whatever about the age and profile of people and whether their DNA is that which is in front of us, I suggest this is a day and age where many posters and hoardings are destroyed as soon as they go up.  Their value in terms of what is spent on them in comparison with what is gained from them in terms of visibility is almost negligible.  We should look at alternative ways of getting the message across about who is standing for election.  I suggest we pursue the idea of banning posters and hoardings and finding an alternative.</P>

	<P>I am concerned about an issue which is causing disharmony in a beautiful part of the world which is near and dear to the Leader&rsquo;s heart and where he holidays annually, namely, the area west of Gleneagle and towards the meeting of the waters, which includes Brickeen Bridge, Glena and Muckross, and encompasses a national park.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, made an order that a certain device will have to be attached to horses pulling carriages in the park from early next month.  I would like the Leader to use his good offices to discover what liaison, if any, has taken place with the town council because it appears that  if this is not required for insurance or other purposes, the licensing authority will be obliged to issue the licence and we will have one law on the streets and a different law, so <Col N="806"/>to speak, in the national park.  This could be a profitable business.  This is about not allowing the manure to be spread about.  Colleagues across the water got into frightful difficulty recently in regard to manure, moats and mortgages and apparently they were able to claim for that valuable substance on their expenses.  This is a matter for by-laws.  I wonder if the Government is putting the cart before the horse, so to speak.  I employ the words of that renowned, colourful journalist who wrote last week, is Government policy now &ldquo;A lot dung, more to poo.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>I support Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s call for a debate on the Health Service Executive and the manner in which it goes about its business.  For some time I have said the jury is out on the HSE.  However, for that period a number of people have been suffering due to the lack of an appropriate provision of service.  In light of that I suggest we have a debate on the matter.  I read with interest in today&rsquo;s newspaper about personal care packages for older people, which I initiated when I was in a position to do so.  They can be easily applied but I understand the problem is in the application.  I am in favour of ensuring that consumers avail of appropriate services.</P>
        <P>Last week I asked the Leader a question about the HSE and its changing procedures for processing medical cards.  That work has been removed from local offices and is centralised in an office in Finglas.  People cannot find out from their local office how their medical card application or renewal is progressing.  I understand staff who were dealing with this issue have been redeployed and new contract staff have been engaged for this process.  I seek clarification on the matter as it goes against the grain.  I would also like to know what additional costs are involved.</P>
        <P>I asked the Leader yesterday to outline Government policy on the stability of our financial institutions and the assistance provided with their balance sheets to obtain funds from the international markets.  It is important that the Leader makes a clear statement on the matter, whether it is today or some day next week.  More important, we had a debate on the National Asset Management Agency in recent days.  While we in this House participate in the parade, sometimes people watching get a different message.  I ask the Leader to make a clear, unambiguous statement on NAMA.  Is NAMA a bailout for developers?  I know the answer to that but I would like to hear it from the Leader.</P>

	<P>In the past two years we have seen the Green Party at the centre of Government.  In that time it has had ample opportunity to introduce a central plank of its platform, namely, climate change legislation, but it failed to do that on every occasion.  Some 19 months ago Senator Bacik introduced a Bill to this House that got favourable attention from all parties and all sides of this House, but that was moved into the sidings where it has remained since.  Today, we have an opportunity to debate that Bill again.  I ask all colleagues in this House, especially those in the Green Party, to get that Bill out of the sidings and back on track.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the economy.  It appears that in recent months there has been an upturn in the markets internationally that is growing and consistent.  The major indicators from the research authorities indicate that the upturn is real.  In light of the fact that we are a small open economy and should be the first to benefit from any upturn, I seek a debate on the economy with specific reference to what is happening internationally.</P><Col N="807"/>
        <P>I support calls made this morning for a general amnesty, in particular where people have been incarcerated for petty and minor offences.  That would be a wonderful gesture.  In other states an amnesty is given to certain prisoners, especially to mark the inauguration of a new head of state, for example, or some other great event.  I note that in the United States the outgoing President is allowed to give an amnesty.</P>
        <P>A fair point was raised this morning about posters.  Two more points could be made to describe those posters.  One is that many of them are digitally enhanced and the other is that the candidates are irradiated in that instead of the light coming down on people it seems to emanate from some candidates.</P>

	<P>When the Provisional IRA murdered Robert McCartney in Belfast it continued to intimidate his family for a long period, forcing some of them to emigrate.  The same thing seems to be happening in Dublin at present.  That organisation, not content with murdering Joe Rafferty also, now continues to intimidate his sister who decided to run for the local elections to highlight her brother&rsquo;s case and campaign for justice.  Five thugs smashed in her car and it is stated that the incident is related to her contesting the local election, especially against the Sinn F&eacute;in candidate.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should ensure that this case is thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators of the crime are brought to justice.</P>

	<P>Like my colleague, Senator McCarthy I ask the Leader for a debate on accident and emergency services in the southern region.  My colleague referred to a leaked report, but I am satisfied that the report that was leaked was predicated on outdated medical practices.  I am pleased to note that, at the request of the Minister, Professor John Higgins, a consultant obstetrician, is carrying out a review of acute hospital services in Mallow, Tralee and Bantry, my home town, and I look forward to that report.  He has plans and dreams for Bantry and I hope his report, which is due in a matter of weeks, will override the leaked reports, which are negative.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the downgrading and closure of Bantry hospital has been an issue since I first ran for public life in 1985.  As usual, at election time the state of the hospital and its services are exaggerated and exacerbated by all sorts of rumours.  I have confidence in Professor Higgins, whom I met.  I hope he will find ways of circumventing the problems there with accident and emergency services.</P>
        <P>I note there is a motion on the Order Paper to be taken without debate and I will obviously adhere to the request by the Leader regarding the transfer of seafood marketing functions to Bord Bia from Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  The issue is worthy of debate although I do not demand it today.  Sometimes orders are made that have significant impact and are welcome.  I urge the Leader to consider debating such matters in the House, including the salient features or the negative impact of the transfer of marketing functions from Bord Iascaigh Mhara to Bord Bia.  I hope it does not denigrate the status of BIM, which, from my dealings with it in the past 20 years, is an excellent organisation.  It has an international reputation that is second <Col N="808"/>to none.  I hope the transfer of some of its functions to Bord Bia will not have an adverse effect on Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>

	<P>On the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, Senator Harris is correct to say that we will be judged by future generations on how we responded as a society to the needs of the victims and survivors of abuse.  Horrific though the findings of the report are, it is clear that it is only the tip of the iceberg because the scale of abuse and the further revelations to come will shock us further.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s call for a change to the equality legislation and a removal of the exemption for religious orders.  We should also be looking at quashing the convictions of the infants and children who were sent to institutions on the foot of criminal convictions.  That is outrageous in this day and age.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator seconding the motion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I second it.  I express gratitude to Senators O&rsquo;Toole, McCarthy and Hannigan for proposing at my request that we debate today No. 12 on the Order Paper, the Climate Protection Bill.  I introduced that Bill in October 2007 with the support of Friends of the Earth and a coalition of environmental and development non-governmental organisations, all of whom are very concerned that we would see binding legislation committing the Government to making reductions in carbon emissions.  Since we proposed that Bill, and at the time we were told the Government would provide extra time for a debate on it, the UK has introduced a climate protection Bill on very similar principles.  We are seeing moves towards similar legislation in other countries and we are seeing an urgent deadline approaching at the Copenhagen talks this December.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan pointed out that this is an extremely urgent matter.  The Green Party promised it would commit to a climate protection Bill, the Labour Party has proposed one in the D&aacute;il, and we are proposing that we debate this Bill today as the Government committed time to it.  I would be very disappointed if the Green Party Senators voted against this proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  It is a vital amendment.</P>
        <P>Other colleagues have raised the issue of posters, which is obviously an issue of particular interest to me.  I would say that I am being told on doorsteps that I am better looking in real life than I am in my election posters.</P>

	<P>One could not but be moved following the statements made about the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  Looking at the facial expressions of Members in the Chamber, there was almost a crucified look on them, which is indicative of the trauma being felt in the community at the moment.  Like other speakers, I do not believe that the report will go away in a short time.  It will haunt us as a people for years to come.</P>
        <P>That said, I hope it challenges us at the same time.  There is a danger that as the emotion dies down after a few months, we may still be left with little action to show how sincere we were in our response to the suffering of those innocent victims.  We were all struck by the <Col N="809"/>apportioning of blame, which will go on for a period, between the religious orders, the State, society and so on.  Gradually we will tease out and analyse this situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are all well aware that many of the unfortunate victims should never have been in these institutions in the first place.  Most were sent at the whim of some official in the community at the time.  There will be legislative requirements.  I was taken by Senator Harris&rsquo;s suggestion of a human reaction to show we have moved on and have improved as a caring society.  There are many people in prison who should not be.  We have had the classic case of an unfortunate woman who was imprisoned for stealing a bottle of milk.  We have had a case of a pregnant mother having to give birth to her child in prison.  All this is wrong, and if we do not show a human, compassionate, caring response, then all the emotion we have had in this House and the haunting we have received from this report will be lost.  I sincerely support Senator Harris&rsquo;s suggestion of an amnesty for those people who should not be in prison.  Perhaps we could all could come forward with other, perhaps unorthodox, examples to show we have moved on and we have improved as a caring society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to facilitate Senator Twomey&rsquo;s request to have a further debate on the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  That report is just the beginning and I agree with Senator Harris.  How we handle the report and what we do in the future will be a litmus test of how we are as a people and as a society.  It is not good enough to talk about days of atonement and days of remembrance.  We need to see action and results that will in some small way help ease the pain of the people who have suffered.  We can never allow ourselves to go back to those days.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the publication of the Dublin archdiocese report.  No matter what Archbishop Martin has done, the colour of where he goes from now will be how he handles the report on his archdiocese.</P>

	<P>I call for a debate on how we conduct elections in this country.  I have noticed breaches of the Electoral Acts throughout the country, and I look forward to the publication of the findings of Standards in Public Office Commission following the elections.  We need to have a reformation on how we carry out elections in this country.  For example, thousands of people will be disenfranchised because they live abroad and they cannot vote.  Hundreds of people going on holidays or going on pilgrimages will be unable to vote.  That is wrong.  We must facilitate people in voting.  We must extend the franchise to all citizens so that we can have a truly democratic electoral process.</P>
        <P>I support the call made by Senators McCarthy and O&rsquo;Donovan for a debate on the HSE.  We have had a reconfiguration, which is a great way of saying acute services in many parts of our country are being closed, but especially in the city and county of Cork.  If we close the hospital in Bantry, does the Leader think it is right that a person living in the Beara peninsula must drive to Cork for hospital services?  It is wrong.  The HSE has failed in its duty to the people and we must amend it immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris and I agree on many things, but we do not agree upon the exemption of the churches from equality legislation.  I was in the House when it was introduced many years ago and I believe the churches should have the right to be able to be exempted.  I mention this because <i>The Irish Times</i> today referred to the fact that I supported Senator Norris and I would like to correct that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the other hand, I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Climate Protection Bill 2007, and I was very impressed yesterday by the actions of Senator Larry Butler, who invited us to the audiovisual <Col N="810"/>room to see the Spirit of Ireland.  The voluntary work being done to suggest how we can solve the problem is very imaginative thinking, although I have no idea whether it will work.  This is a huge scheme which is suitable for only five or six countries in the world - Ireland happens to be one of them - which traps wind power and links it to hydro-power.  The group behind it have set out to achieve financial success and energy success for Ireland in the next few years at no cost to the State.  It is very costly but these people have voluntarily put this together and are proposing that this take place.  From the State&rsquo;s point of view, it would mean wind farms would have to be erected and not be delayed as has happened in the past.  I mention this because Senator Butler introduced us to this topic yesterday.  He excited us at the possibility of what can happen, and it should be supported.  That is why I also support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s effort today.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke yesterday about events in North Korea.  It was referred by others in the media that it was a long way away and that we should not be too worried about it.  I was in Arlington Cemetery in Washington last year for the first time.  We saw the wall in which 57,000 Americans who died in Vietnam were commemorated.  My son was with me and we saw another wall commemorating the loss of 57,000 Americans who died in Korea in the 1950s.  The North Koreans announced yesterday that they were making void the peace treaty that brought that war to an end.  It is something that should concern us.  If 57,000 Americans died, I am sure millions of Koreans died.  That happened in the 1950s and it could happen again because the North Koreans have just announced that they regard the peace treaty as void.  We are on the brink of huge problems in that part of the world.  I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take an interest in that matter and to draw the attention of the European Union to it.</P>

	<P>While I have not yet completed my reading of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, it is a shocking report.

There is no doubt about that.</P>

The panel was shocked to hear how he had been treated and of how his family had been broken up.  It was shocking.  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, recently brought before this House a Bill which provides for expunging of convictions for misdemeanours, thus allowing people to travel to other countries.  That Bill should be extended to provide that a pardon be given to all those people who were so badly treated by the State and the organisations concerned.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Quinn and other Members who came along to the Spirit of Ireland presentation, a new idea that will enable Irish people, who have the spirit to get up when down, to create an economy similar to that which we have enjoyed for the past 14 years.  This will do it.  As Senator Quinn said, we are one of six countries that will provide this type of energy, resulting in a saving to the Exchequer of &euro;3 billion every year.  One can only imagine the impact of this over a ten-year period.  We would also be an exporter of energy for the first time.  I thank everyone who supported me.  This is a new start and together, we can do this.  I will bring forth a motion on this matter on which I will seek Members&rsquo; support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for organising the debate yesterday on the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  It was timely and important we held that debate as soon as we did.  To that end, I second Senator Twomey&rsquo;s proposal and the request of other Members for an ongoing debate on this issue.  Today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> contains an article in respect of another family that wishes to have the remains of their sister who died in 1955 exhumed to find our how she died.  While it was stated on her death certificate that she died from dysentery, apparently she had serious wounds.  I believe that the testimonies of Michael O&rsquo;Brien, Christine Buckley and Colm O&rsquo;Gorman will empower other unfortunate people to come forward.  This is not about money, I firmly believe that.  I read this morning that the Government is to have a say in how the money will be spent.  It is right that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should have a say in how that money will be spent.  </P>
        <P>Senator Harris&rsquo;s proposal, while a little unorthodox, is good.  I agree with him that there are people in our prisons for petty crimes &mdash; we all know them &mdash; who should be set free.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls to bring forth the Climate Protection Bill to the Seanad.  It is a matter that can be dealt with in a cross-party way.  I ask that the Leader facilitate this request if at all possible.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn and Butler spoke about the Spirit of Ireland presentation which many Members attended yesterday.  Those involved are people who have volunteered their expertise, including scientists, geologists, engineers and those with technical expertise in the energy field.  Ireland has the capacity to come up with solutions.  It did so before through the establishment of the ESB, which is responsible for the infrastructure in Ardnacrusha that was developed in the 1920s, the rural electrification scheme introduced in the 1930s and Turlough Hill, a similar project, that was developed in the 1970s.  The ESB has led the way in projects of this scale across the globe.  It has developed power stations in the United States and Europe.</P>
        <P>The Spirit of Ireland concept is similar and will require changes in legislation and cross-party support.  I am interested in the concept and I thank Senator Butler for inviting us to attend the presentation yesterday.  I said at the presentation that the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security might be an ideal vehicle through which this idea could be progressed.  I ask the Leader to make time available in the next session for a full debate on the Spirit of Ireland scheme, which deserves our attention.  It would allow us to develop windfarm co-operatives along the west coast of Ireland and to use natural valleys for reservoirs that would allow us as a country to become self-sufficient in terms of our energy needs.  It would also allow us to export energy.  It is an idea worthy of serious consideration.  Climate change is a big issue on all our agendas.</P>
        <P>Agriculture and transport are the sectors responsible for most of our carbon emissions.  While we cannot tackle the agriculture sector as we need to produce food and to develop agriculture, we can address issues in the transport sector through the electric vehicle strategy.  I believe the answer may lie in the Spirt of Ireland or a similar concept.  However, there will need to be a national debate on this issue which will require general consensus.  I ask the Leader &mdash; I am aware Senator Butler intends to bring forth a motion on this matter &mdash; to provide time for a debate on this issue.  The future of our country depends on it.  We must have the vision to support concepts like this.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s call for a debate on the Spirit of Ireland proposal.  I too have called for a specific debate on that proposal.  I congratulate Senator Butler on organising the briefing on it.  Like Senator Coffey, I believe this concept has tremendous potential, not least because at a time when serious questions are being asked about Ireland at <Col N="812"/>home and abroad in terms of how we manage ourselves, what a boost to our morale it would be if we could be seen to come up with an answer to the challenges we face.  This is the type of creative thinking Ireland needs at this time.  The matter deserves specific debate in the Seanad and I urge the Leader to organise such a debate at an early date.</P>

	<P>Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole, McCarthy, Callely, O&rsquo;Donovan, Bacik, Harris, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Buttimer, Butler, McFadden, Coffey and Mullen expressed strong views on the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, a matter of serious concern to every person on the island of Ireland.  I have no difficulty in providing further time for debate, as agreed with the leaders of the groups, when Members have had an opportunity to read the entire report, which comprises 3,600 pages, made up of five volumes.  Following the forthcoming elections, we will review progress on the matter.</P>
        <P>Matters on the Adjournment are dealt with by the Cathaoirleach, as has always been the case in this House.  Members called for a full debate on the Health Service Executive, including its proposals and the challenges facing it in terms of the downturn in the economy.  It is hoped this matter can be debated in the House prior to the summer recess, bearing in mind that up to ten or 11 Bills are due to come before the House for consideration prior to the recess on 10 July.  I will discuss the matter with the leaders on the next sitting day to see what progress can be made in this regard and on the important issue of hospitals in every part of the country.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is confident about Bantry hospital, on behalf of which he has been working hard alongside colleagues from all political parties.  I take on board the Senator&rsquo;s views.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris spoke about the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and an amnesty for minor offences.  His suggestion should be considered in the context of our overcrowded prisons.</P>
        <P>In regard to the proposed amendment to the Order of Business, those of us who have been in the House for the longest time know that the annual Finance Bill is the most important legislation we have to consider.  The Finance Bill 2009 will be before the House all day and all night.  Unfortunately, I cannot accede to the request but I will seek a way to accommodate a discussion on climate change on our next sitting day.</P>
        <P>I am uplifted by the remarks made by Senators Quinn, Buttimer, Coffey, Butler and Mullen regarding the Spirit of Ireland proposals.  Many of my colleagues were impressed yesterday by the presentation made on these proposals.  Unfortunately, time did not allow me to attend the presentation but I will make it my business to attend a seminar on the proposals for wind and water power.  If, as Senator Butler noted, Spirit of Ireland can save us &euro;3 billion, it will represent a significant opportunity.  Ireland is one of only six countries which can take advantage of the proposals and we are all prepared to support them.  I will allow a debate on climate change and the opportunities available to us for exporting energy.</P>
        <P>In regard to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s strong views on credit unions, the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Bill 2009 will be before us soon for our consideration.  This Bill will give effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision to increase the limit of its deposit guarantee to &euro;100,000 with effect from 20 September 2008.  I have no difficulty in facilitating a debate on credit unions but the debate on the Finance Bill will allow the Minister for Finance to enlighten the House on the concerns expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate my credit union in Castlepollard which is celebrating its 40th anniversary this weekend.  Great festivities are planned to mark the occasion.</P>

However, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has pointed out, certain areas must be debated.  Perhaps the Senator will raise the issue with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who will be in the House for part of our deliberations on the Finance Bill.  It would be an opportunity to gain clarification on this matter.</P>
        <P>In regard to posters and photographs on canvass cards being the same as those on the register of electors, many council candidates experienced difficulties in submitting the necessary digital details.  In the world of entertainment and in the words of Cash, it is early to bed and early to rise because you will have your tea if you do not advertise.

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding, which is only as good as most Members of the House, is that NAMA was set up to cleanse bad loans from banks so they can start to lend again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not about property developers.  The intention is to put the banks into a position whereby they can lend again to families and small businesses so that credit can flow.  This is essential if we are to create and sustain employment.  This is the simple explanation I have put together for a Senator who inquired about the matter yesterday.  I wish the Minister well in his efforts to free up credit because if the present situation continues for the next three or four months, it will be very difficult for families to survive, pay the wages of their staff and keep their doors open while paying off their debts to banks or for their leases.  The coming four or five months will be crucial for Ireland and the support of all parliamentarians from both Houses will be necessary as we address the bad debts which are killing credit.  I wish the Government well in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on the economy.  I have no difficulty with arranging such a debate at any time.  We debated NAMA on Tuesday and will consider the Finance Bill today.  We are discussing all the major issues affecting the economy.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins noted that the sister of Joe Rafferty is standing in the elections to make a statement and to seek support.  We support her in every shape and form.  It is regrettable that she must face challenges in terms of interference and bullying.  We live in a democracy, thanks be to God, and generations from both sides of this House gave their lives in 1916, 1921 and 1922.  We thought we were free of that after the Good Friday Agreement in the North of Ireland.  I condemn the actions highlighted by Senator Cummins.  I call on the Garda Commissioner to act immediately on the incident that Senator Cummins highlighted.  The greatest democratic opportunity the public has is to freely cast votes in the ballot box in support of who we think will best lead us in local government in the coming four or five years.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s reference to the transfer of marketing powers from Bord Iascaigh Mhara to Bord Bia.  The latter body&rsquo;s great marketing powers must be commended on promoting good food products.</P>
        <P>Other Senators referred to the Spirit of Ireland and I responded to that point.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn commented on events in North Korea, which present a major international challenge.  As he pointed out, 57,000 American soldiers who fought in the Korean war are laid to rest in Arlington cemetery.  Perhaps even more Korean soldiers died in that war in the 1950s.  We do not want to see that conflict resuming in any shape or form in the future.</P>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This Finance Bill gives effect to the supplementary budget measures and addresses the two important requirements of showing a credible way forward on our structural problems while assisting us in placing the economy on the <Col N="817"/>road to renewal.  We must demonstrate that we have the ability to make the right choices for everyone in this country, choices that will determine our long-term economic prosperity.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is true that we recently saw some glimmers of hope that an end may be in sight to the deepest and most widespread recession that the world has experienced for over a half century.  However, there is natural caution and reticence about forecasts of recovery and considerable uncertainty about both its sustainability and its strength.  Maintaining our public finances on a sustainable path is a pre-requisite for economic growth.  In this regard, the various expenditure-reducing and tax raising measures, introduced since last October, will have a beneficial impact by restoring confidence as well as improving our competitiveness.  The supplementary budget alone delivered improvements to the Government finances of &euro;3.3 billion in 2009.  Approximately &euro;1.5 billion of this improvement is due to expenditure adjustments, with &euro;1.8 billion additional taxation being raised.  Nonetheless, we are well aware that, as yet, global economic output is continuing to contract and is accompanied by falling world trade.  According to the International Monetary Fund, the advanced global economies, which constitute Ireland&rsquo;s major trading partners, are predicted to contract by 3.75% this year, which will in turn weigh upon our export performance.  The depreciation of sterling is also unhelpful for our indigenous exporters.</P>
        <P>Policy makers around the world have responded to the financial crisis with marked determination and there are signs now that these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.  The world&rsquo;s leading central bankers have noted improvements in business and consumer sentiment, while some important indicators in key economies have shown tentative signs of stabilisation.  Such developments underscore the importance for this country of continuing to pursue the path we have embarked upon so that the economy will be well placed to benefit from a global recovery.</P>
        <P>GNP is projected to contract by 8% this year.  A more moderate decline is expected in 2010, but our economic growth rate is expected to become positive by 2011.</P>
        <P>We need to remind ourselves that our economy has many strengths on which to build a recovery.  Our labour force continues to be highly skilled and flexible.  We are continuing to invest in education at all levels in order to ensure we have the skills demanded by our increasingly knowledge intensive economy.  The Government remains committed to providing a pro-enterprise environment and to maintaining our low tax burden on business.  We are also ensuring capital spending remains at a very high level by international standards.  This will allow us to maintain our investment in productive infrastructure which will help enhance our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Our economy remains resilient.  Labour costs are falling in both the public and private sectors.  Our capacity to make these adjustments in labour costs and work practices is critical to our recovery and will help us to reap large economic gains in the future.  I am very well aware that this process is painful and I do not underestimate the difficulties it is causing workers and their families.</P>
        <P>Our ability to respond to this most difficult of economic crises has been acknowledged by our European colleagues.  They understood very well that the purpose of the supplementary budget was to restore order and stability to the public finances. This is essential to enable us to protect existing jobs and generate the essential economic confidence that will lead both to further employment creation and to a return to prosperity.</P>
        <P>One of the ways in which we can ensure this return to prosperity is through our support and development of enterprise.  I made the point in my budget speech that, despite the recent increases, our tax system remains competitive and pro-enterprise in character.  Accordingly, I renewed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to our 12.<i>.</i>5%<i> </i>corporate tax regime.</P><Col N="818"/>
        <P>I undertook also in the supplementary budget to introduce a scheme of tax relief for the acquisition of intangible assets as a means of supporting the smart economy.  I believe this measure will help to maintain employment in our existing industrial base and will help to attract sustainable high quality jobs in the future into the economy.</P>
        <P>To address the fiscal challenge we face there is no escaping the unpalatable fact that tax increases are required; we must broaden our tax base significantly.  We are endeavouring to ensure that any tax increases are progressive and fair.  In that regard, I would remind Senators of the comments of the ESRI in its recent quarterly review about the redistributive impact of the budgetary measures we have taken since my appointment as Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I announced in the supplementary budget speech that I was terminating property-related accelerated capital allowance tax relief schemes in the health sector in order to help broaden the tax base.  As Senators are aware, all such schemes are now being terminated with the exception of the specialist palliative care units and the child care facilities.</P>
        <P>The Bill sets out the transitional arrangements for the pipeline projects affected by the termination of these schemes.  The schemes being terminated cover private hospitals, nursing homes, including associated residential units, convalescent homes and mental health hospitals.  The estimated annual saving from the termination of these schemes is &euro;60 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>The Bill also gives effect to the budget day announcement of the abolition of the special 20% tax rate applicable to trading profits from dealing in or developing residential land.  The income will now be charged at the individual&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate or at the 25% rate of corporation tax.  It also restricts the relief that may be available where trading losses are incurred from dealing in or developing residential development land.</P>
        <P>I consider that the proposals contained in the Bill relating to dealing in or developing residential land represent another significant step by the Government in ensuring that everyone makes a contribution toward raising additional revenue and broadening the tax base in our efforts to address the current difficulties we are experiencing in the public finances.</P>
        <P>The Bill runs to 32 sections and is structured by tax headings.  I will outline some of the main provisions in the time available to me.  Section 2 makes provision for the doubling of income levy rates and reducing the rate thresholds from 1 May 2009, as announced in the supplementary budget.  A rate of 2% will apply on income up to &euro;75,036, 4% on the balance up to &euro;174,980 and 6% on any income above that amount.  The exemption threshold is also reduced from &euro;18,304 to &euro;15,028.  Those with an entitlement to the medical card remain exempt from the income levy.  For those over 65 years of age, the exemption remains at &euro;20,000 for single individuals and &euro;40,000 for married couples.  Social Welfare and similar type payments also remain exempt from the levy.</P>
        <P>The income levy is a progressive measure, with those who are most able to pay paying the most.  The most vulnerable are protected by exemptions.  The composite rate provision applying to 2009 included in this section is intended as an anti-avoidance measure which prevents individuals who can control their income from front loading their yearly income to avoid the higher rates.  This section also provides that redundancy payments made in the first four months of the year will only be subject to the income levy rates in force during this period.</P>
        <P>Sections 3 and 4 make provision for my supplementary budget announcement that, from 1 May, mortgage interest relief will be limited to the first seven years for qualifying home loans.  This measure focuses resources on those most in need and provides a saving to the Exchequer.  The relief remains available to first-time buyers and those taking out a new qualifying loan for the purposes of trading up or improving their principal private residence.</P><Col N="819"/>
        <P>Section 5 of the Bill gives effect to the budget announcement whereby the level of tax relief investors can claim on the interest for mortgages and loans on residential rental properties is reduced to 75% of the interest accrued from 7 April 2009.  I am introducing this measure at a time when mortgage interest rates are at historical low levels and the repayment burden on investors has been reduced significantly.  The interest component of repayments is now less than 50% of the levels that pertained as recently as two years ago.  I am aware that rents are falling, after a number of years of strong growth.  This fact was taken into consideration when I framed the supplementary budget and decided to reduce rather than abolish this relief.  Ordinary workers on relatively modest incomes are being asked to make additional contributions to help with the recovery in public finances so I believe it is fair and equitable to ensure that residential investors contribute a proportionate share of the burden of adjustment needed in the economy.</P>
        <P>Section 6 abolishes the 20% incentive rate of tax for income arising from dealing in residential development land with effect from the 2009 tax year.  Such income will be taxed under normal income tax rules.  The incentive rate is being abolished in recognition of the fact that the relief has served its stated purpose of releasing development land.  The measure also introduces new arrangements for dealing with losses which ensure that where profits were taxed at 20%, losses cannot be relieved at 41%.  Any such loss will now be converted into a tax credit valued at 20% of the loss and can be offset sideways against income tax which would otherwise be payable on the person&rsquo;s other income.</P>
        <P>Section 7 of the Bill extends the period during which applications for certification can be made to the Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board from one year to two years so that the latest date for the submission of applications is now 31 May 2010.  To deal with any project that may avail of the new date for the submission of applications for approval, the period within which expenditure must be incurred for capital allowances is also being extended from 31 May 2011 and will now end on 31 May 2013.  It is my understanding that there are a number of significant projects currently in the pipeline which have not yet been submitted formally to the board for approval.  All are being promoted by experienced tourism operators and if the existing deadline for submission of projects to the board for certification were retained, none of these projects would be able to proceed.</P>
        <P>Section 8 amends sections 268 and 316 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 regarding expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of certain health-related facilities in order to provide for the termination of these capital allowances schemes and for transitional measures for pipeline projects.  The facilities covered by this section are registered nursing homes, convalescent homes, qualifying hospitals and mental health centres.  The amendments to section 268 provide that certain schemes that were previously open-ended in relation to incurring qualifying expenditure for capital allowances purposes now have a termination date of 31 December 2009, unless certain qualifying criteria are met.</P>
        <P>Section 9 increases the rate of tax that applies to interest on deposit accounts and to income from certain other savings products.  The normal rate of tax is increased from 23% to 25% with effect from 8 April.  For more long-term savings products, the rate of tax which applies is increased from 26% to 28%, also with effect from 8 April.  While the rates are increased by 2%, it remains the case that this income is not subject to the income levy.  Section 10 increases by two percentage points the rate of &ldquo;exit tax&rdquo; on life assurance policies and other investment funds, with effect from 8 April.  Those products previously taxable at 23% are now taxed at 25%, and those products previously taxed at 26% are now taxed at 28%.  As an anti-avoidance measure, where the investment is held in a personal portfolio investment undertaking or a personal portfolio life policy, the tax rate that applies with effect from 8 April is the standard rate plus an additional 28 percentage points.</P><Col N="820"/>
        <P>Section 11, in tandem with arrangements made in section 6, abolishes the effective 20% rate applied to trading profits from dealing in residential development land with effect from 1 January 2009.  An accounting period that straddles that date is treated for this purpose as two accounting periods.  Profits or gains on dealing in residential development land will now be charged at the general rate of corporation tax that applies to dealing in land, which is 25%.  Section 11 also introduces a new section 644C to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This section restricts the allowance of losses on residential land incurred before 1 January 2009 and carried forward to accounting periods beginning on or after that date to allowance on a value basis.  This is to ensure that the effect of the tax treatment of trading losses is commensurate with the effect of the increase in the tax rate on trading income from 20% to 25%.</P>
        <P>Section 12 ensures that, where an Irish resident company makes a gain on the disposal of shares deriving their value from exploration or exploitation rights, the gain will not be exempt from tax under what is known as the &ldquo;participation exemption&rdquo;.  By closing off a potential loophole, this measure means that such shares are treated the same as shares deriving their value from land or minerals in the State.</P>
        <P>Section 13 provides for a new scheme of tax relief for capital expenditure incurred by companies on intangible assets, as announced in the supplementary budget.  A new section 291A is being included in Part 9, Chapter 2 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for this purpose.  The scheme provides for capital allowances against taxable income on capital expenditure incurred by companies on the provision of intangible assets for the purposes of a trade.  The scheme applies to intangible assets which are recognised as such under generally accepted accounting practice and which are included in the specified categories listed in the new section.  The new scheme applies to expenditure incurred by a company after 7 May 2009.</P>
        <P>Section 14 increases the rate of capital gains tax from 22% to 25%.  This change applies with effect from 8 April 2009.  Sections 15 and 16 respectively confirm the supplementary budget increases in mineral oil tax of 5 cent per litre, inclusive of VAT, on auto diesel, and in excise duty of 25 cent, inclusive of VAT, on a packet of 20 cigarettes, with a <i>pro rata</i> increase on other tobacco products.  Section 17 defers the increase in the betting duty from 1% to 2%, in view of the likely adverse impact the increase would have, in current circumstances, on the betting industry.  This will have the effect of continuing the existing betting duty rate of 1%, unless and until an order is made bringing the 2% rate into effect.</P>
        <P>Section 18 provides the necessary legislative change for the decision, announced on 25 February last, to exempt small peripheral airports from the air travel tax.  It amends the definition of &ldquo;airport&rdquo; used for the air travel tax to exclude from the scope of the tax airports from which fewer than 50,000 persons departed on aircraft in the previous calendar year.  As regards section 19, the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 introduced an unjust enrichment provision in respect of vehicle registration tax, VRT, to limit the repayment of VRT claims by dealers.  This section corrects the formula that is used for the calculation of a repayment of VRT on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  It is a technical amendment.</P>
        <P>Sections 20 to 22, inclusive, relate to VAT and introduce a VAT on property anti-avoidance provision.  The sections form a package of measures which amend sections 7 and 7B of the VAT Act, to close off a loophole in the VAT on property legislation, which has been used to avoid paying VAT due on the sale of a property in certain circumstances.  The avoidance mechanism relied on misinterpreting a particular provision in the VAT Act, which was designed to prevent double taxation.  Section 23 is an interpretation section for the stamp duty provisions of the Bill.</P><Col N="821"/>
        <P>Section 24 provides for a new &ldquo;exchange of houses&rdquo; scheme, under which a person selling a new residential property can take a second-hand residence in exchange or part exchange and will not have to pay the stamp duty on the second-hand property until he or she either sells the second-hand property or in any event by 31 December 2010, when the scheme ends.  The purpose of the scheme is to give impetus to the residential property market by freeing up the overhang of completed but unsold new property, with consequential impact on employment.</P>
        <P>Section 25 is a technical follow-up from section 13 which deals with intangible assets.  The definition of intellectual property has been amended in the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to align it broadly with a similar definition being inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by section 13 of this Finance Bill.  It should be noted that this change applies to instruments executed after 7 May 2009.</P>
        <P>Section 26 provides for an increase from 2% to 3% in the existing levy on non-life insurance products.  The non-life insurance levy does not apply to voluntary health insurance, re-insurance, marine, aviation and transport insurance, export credit insurance and certain dental contracts.  The section also provides for a new 1% levy on life insurance premiums.</P>
        <P>Section 27 provides for an increase in the rate of capital acquisitions tax from 22% to 25%, and for a reduction by approximately 20% in the thresholds below which a gift or inheritance can be taken free of tax.  Although this is the first time the CAT tax-free thresholds have been reduced, I feel this reduction is justified in light of recent economic conditions.  The tax-free thresholds remain generous.  They now stand at &euro;424,000 for gifts and inheritances from parents to children, &euro;42,400 for gifts and inheritances between siblings, from aunts and uncles to nieces and nephews, and from grandparents to grandchildren, and &euro;21,700 for gifts and inheritances between individuals not covered by the first two categories.  The changes to the rate of capital acquisitions tax and to the tax-free thresholds both apply from 8 April 2009.</P>
        <P>Section 28 is an interpretation section. Section 29 reduces the statutory rate of interest applied by Revenue to delayed payments of taxation and to underpayments by taxpayers engaged in business activities.  The current daily rates will be reduced by 20% giving respective annualised equivalents of 8% and 10%, approximately, from 1 July 2009.  Section 30 covers miscellaneous technical amendments in respect of tax.</P>
        <P>I hope the Seanad has found useful this explanation of the measures in the Finance Bill.  As I have continued to emphasise, we must restore order and stability to the public finances so that we can protect existing jobs and generate the essential economic confidence that will lead to a return to prosperity.  I commend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us suppose that when the Minister ran for re-election in 2007 I had told him my house was worth &euro;350,000.  Can he tell me now when my house will be worth that amount again?  I do not believe he can.</P>
        <P>Too much is being made of speculation about growth returning to the economy, when we will start to see green shoots and what the future will hold.  Two years ago, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said that anybody who talked down the economy or who expressed concerns about it should commit suicide.  It now transpires, two years later, that what was happening in our economy was like a great pyramid scheme or Ponzi scheme, as it is called.  It involved excessive borrowing and the public finances going completely out of control.  All the time, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, carried on as if nothing was wrong.  Perhaps the Minister might respond to this question.  Is there an acceptance that it was Government policy which got us into this mess?  What the Government was doing for the previous five or six years has landed us in a situation in which <Col N="822"/>the indebtedness of this country will exceed &euro;100 billion.  There are many questions to be answered concerning what this means to the ordinary taxpayer and the State as a whole.</P>
        <P>Mortgage holders do not feel any relief that interest rates have come down because they have been crucified with increased taxes arising from the state of the public finances.  Ordinary civil servants now pay three levies: on income, health and pension.  These are the same people who took out mortgages in recent years.  This Government told them to go ahead and buy their expensive houses because it saw a good future for them.  Clearly that was a lie perpetrated on the people.  There should be an acknowledgement by the Government that its policies have destroyed the finances of this country but no Minister has had the courage to say that those policies have got us into the mess in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>Look at our economy which contracted by 9% in one year.  There has been a vast increase in Government borrowings, amounting to in excess of &euro;100 billion since the Government was re-elected.  Unemployment is destined to go beyond 500,000, unprecedented in the history of this State.  We continue to see increases in current day-to-day expenditure by the Government.  This seems to be an acknowledgement of its failure to get spending under control even after the many budgets it was required to introduce as emergency measures.</P>
        <P>What are the predictions for the end of the year in respect of Government income?  When the budget was introduced on 7 April 2009 we were told that Government income should be approximately &euro;34 billion, having dropped from &euro;37 billion at the beginning of the year.  There are now predictions it may be as low as &euro;32 or &euro;31 billion.  How will this impact on what the Government will do in the budget before the end of the year?  If it is the case that the losses will amount to another &euro;3 billion in addition to what the Government already predicted for its income, namely, 10% less than expected in November, we will see the harshest budget in the history of the State.  What we had in April will prove to have been only a taster of what is to come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is nothing in what the Minister said today, however, or in what Ministers have stated collectively, that gives any indication the Government has a plan.  Since the general election, the Government has borrowed in excess of &euro;30 billion just for day-to-day spending.  With the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency the Government proposes the introduction of &euro;90 billion worth of Government bonds.  A sizeable percentage of those will cover what are merely junk assets, complete rubbish.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to respond, not necessarily about NAMA, but about how dealing with that kind of junk and putting responsibility for it back on the taxpayer will affect public finances over the coming years.  We have already seen that the Government does not have control of day-to-day spending, there is contraction in the overall economy, unemployment is increasing rapidly and the Government&rsquo;s income dropping.  None the less, the bailout for the banking sector will be substantial.  How will it impact on public finances if the Government needs another &euro;2 or &euro;3 billion merely to service those junk bonds to be produced by the end of the year?  That is not the same &euro;2 or &euro;3 billion needed to service the Government debt which is being produced at an incredible rate.  This will impact on the ordinary man and woman because the Government is obviously adopting a policy of increasing taxes rather than controlling spending.</P>
        <P>This month average civil or public servants have seen a reduction in take-home pay of at least 10% compared with earnings at the beginning of the year.  That far outweighs any savings they might get on their mortgages or on other spending costs that have reduced.  The same applies to many other people across the private sector if they have managed to hold on to their jobs.  The biggest problem is that many have not managed to do so and there is still no response from Government as to how we can keep people at work or produce new jobs at a rate that will protect the solid basis of our economy.  Our economic base is reasonably solid now but is <Col N="823"/>not as solid as it was even 12 months ago.  However, one hears nothing from the Government and there is nothing in the budget that gives any confidence the Government is taking on board the seriousness of the deterioration in the overall public finances.</P>
        <P>What galls me, from the social point of view, is the way the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, led the Progressive Democrats culture of the past six or seven years, namely: &ldquo;To hell with the public health services.  We will find the new mantra in the private sector.&rdquo;  We have here an acknowledgement by Government that this was another fools&rsquo; paradise towards which it was trying to lead the people.  It is now getting rid of all the beautiful tax incentives that had been given out to developers and those involved in property.  These tax write-offs for the construction of private hospitals were not available to the Minister of State or me because only those who owned a substantial property could avail of them.  This is now being disregarded.</P>
        <P>As jobs are lost and incomes decrease, people close their VHI policies.  For seven years the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, blew out of all proportion the need to rely on the private sector and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party did nothing to rein her in.  Throughout that period, the Government failed to reform the public health sector.  As a result, wards and accident and emergency departments are being closed across the country as hospitals seek to stay within budget.  They know already their finances are in dire straits and must look forward to an even busier period towards the end of the year.  The continued waste of money across the public service is the reason for many of the problems in the health service.  We hear many fine words about accountability, transparency and reform but no action has been taken.  We will pay for this failure to act by having expensive and awful public services which should have been improved in the good times.  In addition, reliance on the private sector has fallen by the wayside.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While there may be a sense that the anger of ordinary people has diminished, I believe people are still angry because their lives and dreams have been destroyed.  The quality of life people experienced two years ago will not return for at least a decade.  The Government should stop spreading a message that things will be great in 2011.  I do not know from where it has received this information.</P>
        <P>Two years ago, public debt amounted to &euro;100 million, while Government debt was approximately &euro;50 billion.  Currently, while the combined debt of ordinary men and women is still more than &euro;100 billion, people have fewer means at their disposal to pay their debts.  Government debt now exceeds &euro;70 billion and the Government has given a commitment to bail out the banks by providing them with direct funding and acquiring distressed assets of some &euro;70 billion.  While I accept some of these assets will retain value, we do not know what their value is or when it will increase.</P>
        <P>As I stated, if my house was worth &euro;350,000 on the day the Government took office, when will it again be worth this amount?  This is a matter of speculation but we must deal with the here and now.  It would be wise of the Government to bear in mind the substantial debt of the nation &mdash; individuals and Government &mdash; and make some serious corrections.  Otherwise, the country will not benefit when the upswing occurs in a couple of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senators in welcoming the Minister of State and I welcome the opportunity to make a few points on the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>In the past two years, Members have had many opportunities to speak about the economy as activity, both domestically and globally, has experienced an unprecedented decline.  This has resulted in circumstances in which we simply cannot afford to continue to provide the level of <Col N="824"/>service provided heretofore.  While this is regrettable and I wish we had more money to provide more and better services, unfortunately, circumstances have changed.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey referred to the manifesto commitments of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party under former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The expenditures outlined in my party&rsquo;s election manifesto in 2007 were in line with anticipated increases in growth rates and tax revenues of 4% to 5% per annum.  When circumstances change, however, it is incumbent on governments and others to change their approach, which is what we have done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past year or two it has been necessary, through a series of budgets and other adjustments, to change focus and introduce a range of measures, not least those included in the Finance Bill.  These have caused pain and created considerable anger and frustration among many individuals and families.  Members of the Oireachtas are not exempt from this pain.  Senators, Deputies and other State employees will receive pay packets today which are substantially lower than they were last month.  This is a regrettable reality to which we must all face up, painful as it is.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Finance Bill 2009 as another important and appropriate measure on the bumpy road to economic recovery.  The Bill gives effect to the measures announced in the supplementary budget in April.  It marks another confident step by the Government to ensure we sort out our economic and fiscal difficulties.  Given our small, open economy, it is vital we operate flexibly and in an effective manner.  As the nation takes these difficult steps, we will begin to see the first green shoots of economic recovery.</P>
        <P>I will rebut some of the comments made by Senator Twomey.  Speaking in Dublin at the end of February, ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, stated he had full confidence that the Irish Government would take the necessary decisions, would come through current problems and was &ldquo;acting resolutely to do so&rdquo;.  At the beginning of May, the head of the eurozone group of Finance Ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, stated: &ldquo;I do think that the Irish Government, with great courage and a deep sense of responsibility, are on the way to taking the right step in a very difficult situation.&rdquo;  Ireland, he added, &ldquo;is behaving in the right way&rdquo; and &ldquo;we take our hats off and pay tribute to the Irish people in rising to the challenge and bearing the sacrifices that the Government is asking them to make&rdquo;.  It is a matter of public record that our supplementary budget was recently endorsed by Mr. Juncker and Commissioner Joaqu&iacute;n Almunia as the correct approach to our economic and fiscal difficulties.</P>
        <P>The market response to the sentiments expressed by Mr. Trichet, Mr. Juncker and others was clear last week when we learned that the National Treasury Management Agency international bond issue was oversubscribed.  While these bonds carried a higher interest rate than previous bond issues, nevertheless the oversubscription marked a clear improvement in international sentiment towards Ireland, which was due to the tough decisions being taken by the Government.  Although these decisions will inflict a great deal of pain on many families, we were left no with no choice in the matter.  We have moved far beyond considering the political implications of such measures and history will record that the appropriate steps were taken at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>As the Minister outlined, the aims of the Finance Bill were to show a credible way forward for dealing with our structural problems while protecting the economy and ensuring the measures introduced are fair and progressive.  The Government seeks to look after to the fullest possible extent those who are less well off, while sharing the burden across all sectors.  Those who can should pay their way in these difficult and unprecedented times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While many measures are not popular, it is necessary that we take them.  The establishment of the National Asset Management Agency to which Senator Twomey referred, is another <Col N="825"/>necessary measure.  The House had an excellent debate on NAMA as did a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service this week which lasted for four hours and which was attended by both Senator Quinn and me.  The meeting clarified plans for the new agency, although I accept some of these plans remain very much a work in progress.  Nevertheless, we now have much more information than previously and I am confident the principle behind the decision to establish NAMA is the correct one and the agency will produce dividends over the medium to long term.  The Government has taken the correct approach, which I believe will be mimicked throughout the eurozone, if not further afield.</P>
        <P>One of the first steps being taken in the Bill is to address the fiscal challenge in the area of taxation.  As the Minister indicated, we must broaden our tax base.  The taxation measures introduced will raise some &euro;3.8 billion and there will be cutbacks in expenditure of &euro;4.3 billion for 2009.</P>
        <P>As the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, pointed out, property related accelerated capital allowance tax relief schemes in the health sector have been terminated and it is estimated this will save up to &euro;60 million in a full year.  The rates of interest applied by Revenue on late payments and underpayments of tax by businesses will be reduced by 20% to annualised equivalents of 8% and 10%, approximately.  This is a welcome measure for businesses across the country.</P>
        <P>We have managed to keep our corporation tax rate of 12.5% in order to continue supporting enterprise in the country.  Indeed, there has been an increased level of expenditure by FDI companies operating in Ireland in recent times.  In fact, anecdotally, I understand that Mr. Bill Gates is currently holidaying in Mulranny in the west, which is a good vote of confidence in this country, not least from a tourism perspective but also in his particular belief that this country is moving in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>He is the only one who can afford it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Deposit interest retention tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisition tax have all increased to 25%, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s base-broadening measures and ensures that all forms of income contribute to the fiscal correction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The increases in the income levy can be seen as a progressive measure in so far as those who earn more pay more.  Notwithstanding that many in the public sector will receive their pay packets for the month this week, there is no question it will bring an unprecedented level of reduction and will inflict pain on a great many families.  We need to be conscious of that and to the fullest extent introduce any measures we can &mdash; I spoke to the Minister in person about his &mdash; in the area of mortgage default which will help those who ordinarily would not have difficulty in paying their mortgages but for whom, with these necessary measures being introduced, the situation may change.  Although the limiting of mortgage interest relief to the first seven years of a qualifying home loan may be seen as painful to some and, indeed, it is, it is also in line with the drop by the ECB in lending rates which, as the Minister alluded to, is unprecedented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are merely some of the highlighted tax measures to be introduced.  The Commission on Taxation is due to report in July and full reform of the taxation system will take place then.  An bord snip will also report in July on further cuts which we can make across the Departments, and they will be necessary.  As I stated earlier, there is a level of outgoings that we can no longer support and we need to cut our cloth to measure &mdash; it is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>GNP is projected to contract by 8% this year, as the Minister stated.  Indeed, Senator Twomey also alluded to that.  The contraction is expected to be more moderate in 2010 and in <Col N="826"/>2011: as international recovery gains momentum, our economic growth rate is expected to turn positive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been small signs internationally of a pick-up, as the Minister alluded to in his speech, and these signs are welcome.  The recession hit Ireland harder than most, as we are one of the most open economies in the world and, it must be said, we had an over reliance on a tax base which was substantially in the property sector.  Mistakes will always be made and any Government, as it looks back retrospectively, would like to have done certain things differently.  I am sure this Administration is no different to those in the past.  The fact of life is that Governments operate in a real-time environment and do not have the benefit of hindsight.  We need to move forward in a confident and determined way to display to citizens that this Government can and will take the appropriate measures to get this country back on the road to recovery as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Although there is a significant downturn in world trade, interestingly, the relative downturn in Irish exports is substantially less.  We are holding our own in terms of market share while other countries are losing market share in the world economy.  This is partly due to the nature and quality of our exports, many of which are in the food sector, as Senator Quinn will be well aware.</P>
        <P>When compared to Singapore which has lost 30% of its export market share and Taiwan which has lost 40%, the Irish Exporters Association has forecasted that our exports will fall by 13% in 2009.  This is significantly less than the countries I mentioned and is worth noting.</P>
        <P>Another striking challenge for Ireland is the fall in the value of sterling, which has been difficult for indigenous exports.  However, we are beginning to see the Irish market become more competitive as a national correction takes place in terms of our pricing.</P>
        <P>The Government is continuing to implement initiatives to ensure the unemployed are given incentives for up-skilling and are ready to face the upturn when it comes.  One such initiative announced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, is a work placement programme and a short-time working training programme.  The work placement programme is a six-month work experience programme for an initial 2,000 individuals who are currently unemployed.  Under this programme there will be two streams, each consisting of an initial 1,000 places.  The pilot short-time working training programme will provide two days&rsquo; training a week for 277 workers over a 52-week period.  I welcome this measure and others which are planned.</P>
        <P>On reports in the news today of the suggestion that there may be cuts in social welfare, it would never have been an intention of Fianna F&aacute;il in Government to cut social welfare.  In fact, the record will show that Fianna F&aacute;il in Government has produced more in the context of increases to social welfare and pension payments throughout the history of politics in this country.  I very much hope that it will not become necessary to cut social welfare or to reduce the likes of child care payments in the future.  Having said that, it is important we maintain an incentive to work and I hope we can find the appropriate balance in this regard.</P>
        <P>There are difficult and painful measures contained in this Finance Bill.  We have outlined that they are extremely necessary at this time.  On that basis I commend the Bill to the House as another step.  More will be required as we continue on the road to economic recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was also welcome, as were his words.  I must agree with Senator MacSharry when he stated the world has changed.  We cannot sit back and merely do <Col N="827"/>what we have done in the past.  We must change as well.  If these changes are taking place, to what extent are we taking the right steps and to what extent are we going in the right direction?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the danger of big government and the benefit of entrepreneurship.  I am not sure that, in general, this Government understands that the success of the economy will depend on entrepreneurs and we must find a way to ensure that happens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mentioned previously that I met Ms Elaine Chao, the former secretary for employment in the United States.  Her job was to ensure jobs were created but she stated it was her intention not to create jobs but to create the environment in which entrepreneurs could create jobs, and that is what we must ensure we do.  I am worried that big government will do things itself.  I remember somebody saying to me some years ago that he would get very worried when he saw anybody making decisions who never had to worry about where to get the money to pay the wages at the end of the week.  I am not saying that applies to any particular Minister.</P>
        <P>Commissioner McCreevy expressed concern earlier this month that raising taxes for high earners could produce diminishing results.  If one looks back to 1977 and 1982, the steps we took on those occasions damaged the economy.  It was not until 1987 when we took different steps that we were imaginative and got some sense of what we could do differently.  It was former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, who was given the task in 1987 and grabbed hold of it with imagination.</P>
        <P>Let me offer one example of that imagination, that is, the Irish Financial Services Centre.  The Irish Financial Services Centre reduced tax by a percentage and this is the real message we must get across.  With ingenuity it is possible to reduce the rate of tax and take more money in.</P>
        <P>The example I have often used is former Minister, Charlie McCreevy&rsquo;s, betting tax.  I remember he came in here and spoke of reducing the betting tax from 20% to 10% and there were howls that he was looking after friends in County Kildare.  The following year he came in and stated he would reduce it to 5% because he took more money in at 10% than he did at 20%, and he took more money in at 5% than he did at 10%.</P>
        <P>He stated it is essential we remain focused on the dynamic and human nature that drives risk-taking, economic activity and tax revenues and that we guard against policies and tax rates that drive risk-taking, economic activity and tax revenues backwards.  He stated that it was higher economic activity and not simply high tax rates that generated high tax revenue.  We could sink or swim depending on whether we lost sight of these simple facts.  We are in danger of being over-regulated and too top heavy.  We must avoid solving the problem by increasing tax rates to bring in more money.  The real benefit is gained conversely.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry discussed the cuts in social welfare and other payments mentioned in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  Some time ago, I referred to a letter to the <i>Irish Independent</i> that concerned me.  The letter writer had met a friend who was getting more money into his pocket after he had been made redundant.  He used to earn &euro;38,000, &euro;33,000 or so after tax, but he was better off staying unemployed thanks to mortgage relief and so on.  His objective was to lower his golf handicap.  I mention this letter because we are in danger of going in that direction if we do not understand what is occurring.</P>
        <P>I welcome some of the steps referred to today.  According to newspapers, Accenture, which employs 1,400 in Ireland, is planning to transfer its headquarters to here.  I do not know how many more jobs this would create because it may not bring many people with it.  WPP, the large British marketing and advertising agency, moved to Ireland last year.  Our lower tax rate makes us attractive, which the Minister for Finance recognises, and we must acknowledge that by reducing tax rates we can bring in more money.</P><Col N="828"/>
        <P>I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to one or two matters.  I am concerned about the retrospective aspect of the pension levy contained in section 2.  In addition, I disagree with the retrospective aspects of sections 6 and 11, which will abolish the 20% tax rate on profits from dealings in residential development land from 1 January 2009.  Adopting retrospective tax policies is always dangerous, not least because it complicates the system and makes the filing of tax returns more complex for businesses and individuals.  Retroactive taxes should always be avoided, for which reason I am recommending changes to sections 2, 6 and 11, but we will discuss them when we deal with the recommendations.  As the difference between January and now will not be great, the implementation of the changes dating from after the Bill&rsquo;s enactment would be more sensible.</P>
        <P>Regarding the new tax regime for intellectual property, a recommendation on the definition of intangible assets has been proposed.  I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of the promised new regime, but I hope that this section will help to attract international business to locate such operations in this country, which occurred previously.  However, I draw attention to the definition used in the context of intellectual property.  Under section 13, exemption from stamp duty under section 101 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 has been extended to include any trade name, trade dress, brand name, service mark, publishing title, sales authorisation in respect of medicine or product arising from any design, formula, process or invention and rights derived from research undertaken in the field of medicine.</P>
        <P>The definition of an intangible asset should be broadened to include marketing and distribution base lists, such as customer lists and other databases.  My company introduced a product called Superclub and identified our customers, the majority, who used it.  This scheme played an important part in helping my business to develop, to improve customer service and to bring the customer back to the business.  If intellectual property is given tax relief in the Bill, such things as customer lists could be included.  This area provides a considerable opening for other companies to set up in Ireland.  Thus, I recommend a change to section 13 so that the definition of an intangible asset would include customer lists and other marketing and distribution lists, which are invaluable to businesses.  When I was involved in An Post years ago, I realised it would be of benefit to attract <i>Reader&rsquo;s Digest </i>to Ireland by way of our post office service, and its customer list was very valuable to it.</P>
        <P>I am concerned by the provisions in section 5 on the deductibility of mortgage interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair residential premises.  Given that the interest comprises some of the cost of carrying out a rental business, it should be tax deductible.  It would pay the Government to introduce such a measure and, therefore, I recommend the removal of the restriction on interest.</P>
        <P>I was approached by someone and, while I am unsure as to whether the issue has been addressed, I will refer to a letter.  It is a little technical.  Employers have been setting up group pension arrangements for their staff on a defined contribution basis for many years.  According to this person, two models are available, the traditional approach introduced in 1972 and the newer group PRSA approach.  It has taken time for the latter to become established, but it was designed by the Pensions Board to deliver transparent, simple, portable and flexible pensions.  After years of research and development, PRSAs have become popular.  Large companies, such as eBay and Irish Life &amp; Permanent implemented PRSAs for their staff pension arrangements, with the employer contributing in each case.</P>
        <P>According to the writer of the letter, the problem that needs to be addressed is that employer contributions into PRSAs have always been treated in the same way as employer contributions to traditional pension schemes, that is, they have been run through payroll with no benefit in <Col N="829"/>kind.  That has been changed with the introduction of the income levy, to which employer contributions to PRSAs are deemed subject.  The reason is technical, but it relates to the way in which the PRSA contribution legislation was originally framed.</P>
        <P>Employees who have joined staff PRSA schemes will have to pay a levy on the contributions paid into their PRSAs by their employers, whereas employees in the old style pension arrangements will not have to pay such a levy.  This is obviously unfair and distorts the market.  The man told me that he spoke to a wide range of industry experts and the head of the pension division in Revenue, all of whom agree that this was not planned.  It was inadvertent and needed be changed.  The problem is that no one seems to be moving to change it, despite how simple that would be &mdash; for example, there could be a line in the Finance Bill stating that employers&rsquo; contributions to PRSAs are exempt from the income levy.  This would not be a major income generator and it was not the target of the income levy.  As the man said, it is unfair to hit one sector of the pensions market, which is the most highly regulated sector of the market, with the levy while leaving the broader pensions market unaffected.  I apologise for sticking to the detail of that letter, but it is an important matter.  The measure seems unfair and as it was not the intention, perhaps it can be solved in another way.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I welcome many of the measures contained in this comparatively short Finance Bill.  Last week, I spoke to Dr. James Watson, the man who won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for identifying the double helix structure of DNA.  He referred to America, innovation and investment in universities and in research and development.  According to him, all this occurred around universities.  Aside from Harvard, he used the example of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which was established in the same area.  Many innovations came from it and the jobs created were long-term jobs because they were based on science and technology.  The same occurred in Silicon Valley, where there was a very high level of investment in universities in Seattle.  The steps taken in the Bill are recognition of the fact that we can do something in this regard.</P>
      
        <P>I am concerned about the long-term effect of big government, that is, the belief that the Government can solve everything.  The less government there is, the better the chance of solving a problem.  The term used in the European Union is &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;, namely, trying to make decisions closer to the citizens.  In our case, more and more decisions seem to be taken at Government rather than local level.</P>
        <P>When an attempt was made in Britain to change what is called council tax or, under Margaret Thatcher, poll tax, it was very difficult.  When we tried to change it, and did so in 1977, we did away with what we called rates.  What has happened is more and more decisions are being made at the top.  I do not know if any Minister in the future will be brave or foolhardy enough to re-introduce rates, but the more we bring decisions to the top in Government, the less likely it is the right decisions will be made.  I encourage more thought being given to how we can manage to pass responsibility closer to where the systems are.</P>
        <P>Another criticism was made by Dr. Eoin O&rsquo;Leary, who said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The problem would seem to be that Irish Governments continually suffer from group-think.  They surround themselves with an elite consisting of policy advisers, consultants and spinners whose main function is to tell ministers what they want to hear.  There are too few dissenting voices inside the corridors of power.  Those who do offer alternative perspectives are either ridiculed as naive or accused of being resentful at not being part of the elite.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am concerned there are too many academics and economists being given too much say in advising the Government.  That is what went wrong in 1977, when we into difficulty, and the same source of policies was used in 1982.  It was not until, I understand, 1987, when those who <Col N="830"/>grabbed hold of the initiatives said they could do something about the situation in a different way.  The basic concept was that by reducing the tax rate, more money could be taken in by the State.</P>
        <P>That concept has been applied in a number of different ways.  It happened in 1987.  What did we do last October?  We increased VAT by 0.5% at the same time Britain, which supposedly has a socialist Government, reduced it.  We saw what happened.  It is a reminder to us that we should not automatically assume the way to get more money into the Exchequer is by increasing the tax rate, because very often the opposite is the case.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister of State to think along those lines, because if we are to solve this problem we need different thinking from that which we have had in the past.  We need skill, initiative and courage to take some of those steps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In the times in which we live, the distinctions between politics and political parties are becoming ever more blurred.  As politics moves increasingly towards the centre the traditional ways of defining policies as right wing and left wing are becoming more irrelevant.  The distinctions in politics today are exemplified by the election of President Barack Obama, and are the politics of hope and the politics of disillusionment.  Unfortunately, in the times in which we live, and in our own country, the politics of disillusionment are holding sway.</P>
        <P>We see how these politics play in other jurisdictions and how it helps the rise of racist and xenophobic politicians and political parties.  It also leads to a type of politics which is about quick and easy solutions to the depths of problems that have not been faced in generations.  We find ourselves in this Finance Bill, the second in an eight month period, trying to deal with the scale and depth of those particular problems.</P>
        <P>It can be fairly argued what has been proposed and put in place now represents short-term solutions to immediate problems.  I do not think they can be argued in any way, however much other political parties may try, as an attempt to cause offence or create greater economic disharmony.  There are international economic factors at work, and we have our own indigenous factors that have made the situation in this country worse.  We require a radical change in how we structure our economy and make decisions about it, and this Finance Bill, building on the previous one, is a sincere attempt to do that.</P>
        <P>Those who prefer to practise the politics of disillusionment will live on soundbites and play to prejudices, but will avoid answering, in public at least, how they would respond in similar circumstances.  The reality is the situation would be the same whoever was in Government, and the room for manoeuvre in dealing with the situation would be as small.</P>
        <P>It is fair to compare the current circumstances to those which existed in 1987.  Much has been made of the Tallaght strategy, when the incoming Fianna F&aacute;il Government took the budgetary parameters of the outgoing Fine Gael and Labour Party Government, and the new leader of Fine Gael at the time, Alan Dukes, was seen to facilitate that.  The reality was the incoming Government would probably have acted in the way it did anyway, because the room to manoeuvre was so painfully small, just as it is now.</P>
        <P>The gap between what we receive in our taxes and intend to spend, an expectation that has arisen during the Celtic tiger years, is so vast we can use the three mechanisms available to us, that is, cut expenditure, increase taxation or borrow more.  It has not been admitted in the last 18 months that the mechanism which has been used most by Government and which has the longest impact for future generations in terms of paying back, is borrowing more than we have additionally taxed and cut services.  That will still be the mechanism chosen, because to do otherwise would have a serious affect on public services.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>The measures in the Finance Bill, particularly the levy, represent a short-term response to the immediate situation.  I welcome the fact the levies, in their second incarnation, are far more progressive than when they were originally introduced.  They include many anomalies, as Senator Quinn has said, and it is possible some of them can be addressed when we look at the Bill.</P>
        <P>I suspect most can only be addressed in the context of next December&rsquo;s budget and the following Finance Bill, because we need the report of the Commission on Taxation, which, I am proud to say was an input from my party in the programme for Government.  When the commission issues its report, including its recommendations, what is accepted and included in a future budget and Finance Bill will be the means that can iron out many of the anomalies which have been introduced as a result of the introduction of both levies.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say the amount of change in taxation brought about in such a short time has probably been the largest shift this country has ever seen.  It is too large an increase over too short a time period.  Yet, when one looks at the basket of taxes collected in this country, including income tax, VAT, capital gains tax, corporation tax and money gained through social insurances, we still collect less in the total combination of taxes than any other European country.  Despite this, we have an expectation that our services should be similar to those in other EU countries.  I am afraid we cannot do that.  We cannot have an economic recovery and the sense of expectation of the highest possible public services with taxes that are below the European norm.  The problem we have with our taxes, which I hope the Commission on Taxation will be clear on, is that we collect the wrong taxes in the wrong way and in ways which affect disproportionately the wrong people.  People who are on low incomes and different types of income are affected disproportionately, and we need a fairer, more effective and efficient taxation system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a debate which will arise in next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  This Bill is a series of short-term measures to address the immediate issues facing us.  It could be fair to say it is a sticking-plaster approach to the economic difficulties we have.  It is necessary.  The fact the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the ESRI have talked, sadly, about these measures being necessary shows confidence that the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are doing the right thing.</P>
        <P>It is also confirmation that any alternative Government or Minister for Finance would have to do the same thing.  That is the reality.  Senator McCarthy can mutter under his breath, but the reality is that unless the Opposition can say, if there was a new Government tomorrow, which of these measures would be changed and which alternative measures would be put in their place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">The reality is that any of the measures one seeks to change will mean the introduction of an alternative measure that has the same effect.  I tire of hearing soundbite politics and talk of bailouts to sectoral interests.  Exactly the same policies are being instituted in every other country in the western world.  The reality is that if we do not have a financial services sector, we will not have an economy.  We must ensure there is political, ethical and corporate responsibility, but if we do not repair the collapse that has occurred we cannot have future economic activity in this country.  The same measures have been proposed in every other developed country in the world.  People might not like the proposal to set up NAMA but the <Col N="832"/>proposal for a nationalised bank, a good bank or a bad bank would result in exactly the same amount of taxpayers' money being put at risk.  It is not a question of having a better system, it is only a question of having an alternative means to do the same thing at exactly the same risk.</P>
        <P>If we are not going to conduct that type of honest politics then the politics of disillusionment will win out.  As a glass half-full person I believe we can strive for hope in this country.  We have the means within our own population to recover.  We still maintain a high level of economic wealth and prosperity.  If we use that as the basis of going where we need to go, but by taking a different route &mdash; one that is less concerned with the individual and the erosion of community values &mdash; then this could be a time not only of introspection but of renewal and self-discovery that we have lacked as a nation in the past.</P>
        <P>We can achieve the measures outlined in the Bill, which is only part of the formula we have to use at the moment.  We must control public expenditure and invest appropriately in infrastructure that would allow for future activity.  Unfortunately, we have to depend on how the international recovery affects our main trading partners.  Those elements, if done correctly, will mean that we as a country can prosper.  The Bill has been drawn up with the right means in mind and it is following the only policy approach that is open to us as a nation.  If other politicians and political parties are honest enough they would accept that the room to manoeuvre and the need to be honest with people means that their approach can be more dangerously wrong than that which is being followed at the moment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the House.  I look forward to interacting with him on the Finance Bill 2009.</P>
        <P>Much has been said in recent times about the economic downturn.  It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in the current situation.  To paraphrase Laurel and Hardy, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another fine mess they&rsquo;ve gotten us into.&rdquo;  No one would win any prizes for guessing who &ldquo;they&rdquo; are.  We have seen an unbelievable waste of Celtic tiger resources in recent years.  Senator Boyle might want to believe he is sitting on the opposite side of the House and talking about honest politics, but it is about time he started to exert influence at Government level to have meaningful debate rather than just making cheap political soundbites at the other side of this House.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the enormous wealth, prosperity and success this country enjoyed in the Celtic tiger years.  There were the haves and the have-nots.  Unfortunately, many people were left behind but when there was a lot of money around there was no long-term thinking on the part of Government in terms of providing for a possible downturn in the future.  The downturn came with profound consequences.  The manner in which thousands of people have joined the dole queues has been almost like a tsunami.  People who were working or were self-employed and were doing well, rearing their families and making valuable contributions to the taxation system have suddenly found themselves unemployed, which has brought a whole host of difficulties.  I was unemployed twice in my life and I know it does not do much for one&rsquo;s morale to join a dole queue every week and not to know when one will come off it given the bleak future.</P>
        <P>The downturn provides us with an opportunity to reconfigure Government schemes such as the back to work scheme and other social welfare schemes.  Now is the time to reconsider such schemes and to provide for more training and upskilling.  That would allow people the opportunity to get a qualification, skill or trade and to contribute again to the economy when the upturn comes.  We have no reason to think it will not happen.  We need to ensure the people on the dole queues will not be on them for the long term.  We all know families who have been affected by people losing their jobs and more people will end up on the live register before the end of the year.  The ESRI forecasts in that regard are quite frightening.  We must be careful about spending on social welfare.  IBEC has made stomach-churning proposals that we should <Col N="833"/>slash social welfare.  People living on &euro;220 a week find it difficult enough to live on that type of money without more being taken from them.  We need to ensure supports are in place for people, not just financial supports but the provision of education to allow them to train and upskill.  We must ensure we do not create poverty traps or long-term unemployment such as we saw in the 1980s.</P>
        <P>When all is said and done we are left with two classes of citizen.  There are those I mentioned who are working hard to make a living and to rear their families, who are making their rightful contribution to society through the PAYE system and, unfortunately, there are others who legitimately live for significant periods of time in this country, who are proud to say they are Irish but yet do not pay tax in this country.  I will refer to tax exile status this afternoon when we consider Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill.  Every good luck to somebody who has been successful owing to their business or entrepreneurial skills.  Many of them got it by hard graft.  I am sure none of them stayed in bed and had someone knock on the door, hand them the idea and send them off.  It is about time we started being fair and used the taxation system to ensure those who fly in and out under the Cinderella rule pay their dues.  All we are looking for is equality and some element of fair play.</P>
        <P>The rate of unemployment increase is alarming.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply on existing schemes.  There are many obstacles to people who wish to return to full-time education.  I know of a person who was employed.  I will be vague but try to give as many details as I can at the same time.  They decided to go back to education to pursue a four-year university degree.  The individual has a partner and young family and lobbied the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on the provision of support.  No grants were available to enable that individual to access some financial support from the State to return to study.   People who complete third level courses and graduate in various disciplines generally pay tax at the higher rate.  The grant system is a great investment in a person&rsquo;s education.  It would be a great return if we could use that system to facilitate the return to education of people who have become unemployed recently owing to the downturn in the economic fortunes of the country.  We need to invest in education.</P>
        <P>I have a question for the Minister of State on the effective marginal tax rate.  For many years the Progressive Democrats mantra was that this was a low tax economy and people paid very little tax.  We now know that many people did not pay any tax.  That type of right wing political ideology has created huge hardships for the economy.  The Progressive Democrats Party has been wound up and is no longer in existence.  What will be the effective marginal tax rate for those earning &euro;80,000 a year once the Finance Bill is enacted?  What does the Minister of State think of the ESRI report that asserts that the rates of taxation have risen from 43.5% in 2008 to 52% in 2009?  I have the table from the Irish Taxation Institute.  A person who is self employed and earning &euro;40,000 is on a rate of 50%.  These are quite frightening statistics, and it is a mockery to say we have low tax rates when clearly we do not.  We now have two income levies, the health levy, the PRSI increase and the pension levies for those in the public sector.</P>
        <P>The pension levy is actually a tax.  The reason it is called a levy is because the Government cannot introduce a tax between budgets.  Therefore, it called it a levy although it is the same thing.  Is it fair that a cleaner in a school or a part-time firefighter, of whom there are many of them in the Minister of State&rsquo;s city and county, must pay a pension levy when they will never receive a public service pension?  This is an issue that has been communicated to the Government by spokespersons of my party in the D&aacute;il and by the trade unions.  There are people cleaning schools or who are part-time firefighters in every town and village in the country who are paying a pension levy and not getting a pension in return.  It is a mockery to suggest in the first place it is a pension levy because it is not.  It is a form of taxation, allied to the health levy, the income levies and the PRSI increase, that is creating huge difficulties for people.</P><Col N="834"/>
        <P>Most of us who have been knocking on doors in recent weeks will have come across families similar to the one I encountered in west Cork.  Both parents are public servants who are not earning big salaries but because of the income levies, the PRSI increase and the pension levies, they have had to cut out the extracurricular activities for their children such as music lessons, Taekwondo or any other classes that involve a fee.  They have had to reconfigure their finances and cut out many of these things.  The quality of family life suffers terribly because of it.</P>
        <P>The straitened economic times are contributing to people&rsquo;s negative mental health.  There is huge pressure on people in the current economic climate.  There was a piece in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> recently which stated that many marriages will run into difficulty owing to this type of economic hardship.  We need to be mindful of this.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle was very quick to mention the setting up of the National Asset Management Agency as the panacea for all ills.  When it was announced, some people thought it was a good idea but when they teased it out, it is not nearly as clear as was being suggested.  Dr. Michael Somers of the National Treasury Management Agency did not mince his words at the committee when he made statements on the possible operation of NAMA:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am still not sure how the proposed NAMA operation would interact with the NTMA.  Government statements have said it would be under the aegis of the NTMA [The Minister stated this when he announced the setting up of NAMA] ... it depends on the legislation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Dr. Somers suggested that if it were up to him, he would prefer management of the debt to remain with the banks where there was experience and expertise in dealing with it, in which case the NTMA could oversee their operations.  However, he said he was unsure what the agency&rsquo;s position was at the time.  Does the Government realise the gravity of that statement?  If the individual who is charged with overseeing NAMA is unsure of its operation, how can the compliant taxpayer and the citizen of this country expect to have any faith in that organ of the State?  It does not do much for investing faith in the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</P>
        <P>When asked what he knew about NAMA, Dr. Somers stated that he knew very little apart from what he had read in the newspapers.  When he was asked about the workings of NAMA, he stated that he did not know whether NAMA would be a function of the NTMA, or whether it would have a separate board and the NTMA would just carry out the management.  He said he did not know what NAMA was going to be.  When asked why the NTMA has four external boards, he said: &ldquo;It is like this: one would not start from here if one was starting again.&rdquo;  That is quite serious and I would be interested to know the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the issue.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of people making an honest few quid from small and medium-sized businesses.  The downturn has come, the banks have stopped lending and there is huge pressure on these people.  These businesses often form the backbone of the rural economy.  There are other areas of industry that can flourish during the economic downturn but because of draconian legislation enacted by both Houses, the fisheries industry in this country is on its knees.  That is one of the areas that can flourish through the boom and we can learn a lot from that.  The Government should listen to the concerns of fishermen and look at the operation of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  Homes of fishermen were raided in west Cork as if they were common drug dealers or part of some kind of Colombian drug cartel.  These are the people on whom we depend unofficially to police our shoreline.  These are the people who came across the cocaine haul off the coast of west Cork.</P>
        <P>We rely on the people who were 40 miles out from Killybegs and discovered a massive stash of cannabis.  They contacted the mainland and stated they would come back to Killybegs on the condition that when they got back, the Naval Service would seize the drugs and they would <Col N="835"/>be allowed to go back out to where they were and fish the water there.  When they came into Killybegs, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency officers were there and they boarded the vessel, checked the log, the gear and the quantity, quality and volume of catch.  These people had only complied with the law and contributed to ensuring our shores are not used to import drugs freely into the State, yet that is the treatment they got from an organ of the State.  We can depend on these people to regenerate rural economies only if they are allowed to do so.</P>
        <P>Representatives from these organisations attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  They have clearly stated that the current criminal sanctions against fishermen are putting them out of business.  They are being criminalised by being brought in front of Circuit Court judges and their catches are being confiscated, as are their boats and equipment.  This is unbelievable but it is happening.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, ask his senior colleagues to look at relaxing the criminal sanctions, introducing administrative sanctions and giving a break to people in an industry on its knees?</P>
        <P>Small and medium-sized businesses are paying high rents for their premises.  One particular retail outlet on Grafton Street saw its rent increase last November from &euro;118,000 to &euro;165,000 per year.  That is enormous by any stretch of the imagination.  That premises is now standing idle and will remain so if it costs &euro;165,000 per year to rent.  The Minister should bring in the landlords and demand flexibility to give people a break in the current economic climate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have often quoted Dickens in this House and it is worth remembering Mr. Micawber when he said:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen and six, result happiness.  Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are in a slightly different situation today in so far as the annual income is &euro;34 billion and the annual income expenditure is &euro;52 billion.  It is interesting to hear commentators from the Opposition speak well about different aspects of the economy.  They do not, however, deal specifically with the substantial problem of how to raise that type of income and what the Government was obliged to do.  The reality is that the Government was obliged to introduce a supplementary budget and that it took hours, days and weeks of planning on the part of Cabinet to ensure it was fair.  In as much as it could, the budget established a balance in a progressive tax system to ensure equity and fair play for all.  There is no easy way of giving bad news.  It is a hallmark of a political party that will put the country first regardless of the political consequences.</P>
        <P>Often, when one knocks on a door one is asked what happened to the money in the good times, as if it had fallen into a well somewhere.  The reality is that many excellent projects were undertaken with the money available in the good times.  We were well positioned for a global downturn in that Ireland had the lowest tax wedge in the OECD; the National Treasury Management Agency was in place and we had full employment.  Funds were made available for many necessary works, including infrastructure.  Our economy is well placed for the upturn which appears in the marketplace at the moment, although it would be foolhardy to suggest we have turned a corner.  There are positive indicators in the international marketplace notwithstanding the fact that 3.3 million people in the US lost their jobs, the German economy will contract by 5%, the Japanese economy will contract by 6% and the French and Italian economies will contract by 3% and 5% respectively.</P>
        <P>While there has been a global downturn, we were fortunate it happened when it did given our banking system was in near crisis.  The Government upheld the structures and security of the State.  It is interesting to note that the Opposition parties did not support the introduction <Col N="836"/>of the bank guarantee scheme or nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, undertakings that were absolutely necessary.  The finance spokesperson, when repeatedly asked by Vincent Browne what his or her party would do, could not come up with an answer.  The Government spent many hours, weeks and days ensuring equity and fair play in the supplementary budget that was necessary.  There are aspects of the supplementary budget that are worth examination, including mortgage interest relief.  There is no doubt it was a positive sign for our economy that we were able to allow large levels of mortgage interest relief.  I hope that when the economy picks up, this issue will be revisited to ensure the necessary construction industry can get back on the road.</P>
        <P>Another aspect is the 2% increase in deposit interest retention tax, which will bring in &euro;70 million in a full year.  That indicates there is &euro;100 billion on deposit in this country.  I would like if we could consider giving incentives to people to spend some of that income thus ensuring less need for increased taxation.  Other positive aspects include allowances for development in intellectual software.  This is thinking for the future in the midst of difficult times.</P>
        <P>While it was necessary to raise capital acquisition taxes because of the need to raise income, valuations have fallen substantially in the interim.  The capital allowances were welcome.  Excise duty is an area which I hope we can re-examine.  We should seek to ensure ministerial orders in the North dovetail with the Republic to ensure the price of alcohol and fuel is maintained at the same level.  This would prevent much of the illegal activity across the Border.  I am particularly cognisant of the fact that many of the people who engage in these illegal activities use a cover of disparate republican view to justify them.  In other words, it is a double edge sword.  If we could introduce a minimum pricing order on excise duty on mineral oils and alcohol, similar to the one in place in Scotland, this would assist us in our endeavours to ensure criminality is removed from the system.</P>
        <P>I am cognisant also of matters relating to social welfare.  It does no harm to remind ourselves that we have one of the best social welfare systems in Europe.  Despite world difficulties and the downturn, the Government has continued to care for the less well-off to the best of its ability.  On allowances, social welfare recipients here are often paid two or three times the amount paid to recipients in the North, thus leading to a temptation for people to defraud the Irish State, a matter which is currently being dealt with by Government.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment in Government, in light of the inability to pay the Christmas bonus, to examine what savings can be made not alone in the Department of Social and Family Affairs but across all Departments to ensure the payment is reintroduced, even at a reduced rate, which is welcome.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill 2009.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt but that the country is in a serious financial state.  However, I believe there are inefficiencies in our systems that are not being tackled by Government.  There exists <Col N="837"/>a golden opportunity for Government to tackle inefficiencies throughout the State.  Considerable power has been given down through the years to the Revenue Commissioners by this and the other House.  It has been brought to my attention that the heavy hand of the Revenue Commissioners is now coming down on the small business community.  I know of people who have received attachment notices under powers given by us to the Revenue Commissioners.  In the case of one person who was due to make returns in respect of PRSI and PAYE for March 2009, payment of which was due in mid-April, the Revenue Commissioners issued in May an attachment notice to the relevant bank.  That is outrageous given the pressures under which small businesses are operating.  The Revenue Commissioners would not enter into a payment plan with a small business struggling to remain open in respect of payments due in March 2009.  I have no problem with the Revenue Commissioners wielding the heavy hand on people who do not make some effort to pay their dues, but in this case &mdash; there are several such cases throughout the country &mdash; the heavy hand of the Revenue Commissioners was used to issue an attachment notice to the relevant bank for money due in respect of PAYE-PRSI in March 2009.  It is outrageous that the Revenue Commissioners would come down heavy on businesses which are experiencing difficulty obtaining credit from banks.</P>
        <P>Another issue I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to bring to the attention of the Minister is redundancies in the construction and small business sectors.  They have paid redundancy to former employees but have been waiting six months for the State to refund 60% of the cost.  Something should be done about this immediately because they need that money.  They cannot re-finance through the banks because of the current credit difficulties.  The Department of Finance should immediately refund its 60% share of the redundancies paid out by small businesses, builders and developers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This debate demonstrates the irrelevance of the Seanad to financial matters.  We are basically neutered by the Constitution.  Only one Member of the House, Senator Twomey, has tabled a handful of recommendations.  We are not even allowed to amend the Bill.  This reveals our lack of significance with regard to financial and economic matters.</P>
        <P>However, the debate at least offers me an opportunity to put certain matters on the record.  I am not innately antagonistic to the Government and say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; on successfully floating Government bonds.  This was an interesting indicator of some degree of resurgence.  NAMA is another interesting development.  I understand that Accenture plans to relocate its headquarters from Bermuda to the IFSC.  I would insert a caveat, however, because I understand that only ten jobs will be created by the move.  That does not suggest significantly increased activity.  Once again, it may become another financial black hole.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin quoted Dickens and the words of Mr. Micawber with great accuracy.  However, he was less accurate when he said we were recently near a banking crisis.  There is no question that we were actually in the middle of a crisis but I do not think we took the correct response.  Internationally, this crisis was precipitated not only by underlying systemic failures and greed but also by Bush&rsquo;s decision to let Lehman Brothers go to the wall.  However, I think we should have let Anglo Irish Bank go down because, in my humble opinion, we do not have an obligation to international investors.  Money has not been freed up and we do not know how much will be spent on it.  I recently interviewed on my radio show P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, the chief executive and owner of Aer Arann.  The airline has an annual throughput of &euro;100 million but he cannot even raise &euro;100.  That is astonishing.</P>
        <P>We must consider the effect of this on people.  A recent episode of &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; reported on people who are losing their homes to these very institutions.  Mr. Jerry Beades, who is a Fianna F&aacute;il builder and a decent man as far as I know, was struggling to continue his <Col N="838"/>work but had to let people go because of the unavailability of credit.  It was heart-breaking to see these people being told the news.  At least he confronted the situation in a manly fashion and addressed these men face to face.</P>
        <P>The principal reason I wished to speak is the social welfare budget.  I spotted a gap due to the lack of photographic identification which I gather has been resolved as a result of my intervention.  However, I wish to highlight the increase in the tenant contribution.  This comes on top of an 8% reduction which was kept very quiet.  What about older people and single men who are less educated and vulnerable?  They received letters from the Department of Social and Family Affairs which they were advised to show their landlords.  That is astonishing impertinence.</P>
        <P>I have received a letter from a well-educated professional man who is temporarily out of work.  In January, after negotiations and without waving the Department&rsquo;s letter, his landlord decently agreed to reduce his rent by 15%.  However, when he had to apply for rent allowance in March the community welfare officer was totally unhelpful.  The budget contained a decrease in the rent allowance which effected an increase in the weekly contribution from &euro;18 to &euro;24.  This might appear marginal but is significant to a person in receipt of &euro;204 per week.  To my correspondent&rsquo;s considerable shock, a further decrease in the allowance of 8% was imposed.  This was unexpected and never went through.  The letter my correspondent received from the Department reminded him of a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on people living in substandard rented accommodation, the majority of whom were isolated and ageing men.  He asked what stability, surety or peace can be afforded to the most vulnerable in our society if the Government can without notice or approval reduce social welfare payments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I salute Senator Hanafin and strongly support him in his efforts to reinstate the Christmas bonus.  I refer to my good friend and north Dubliner, the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, whose father I remember well as a man of varied qualities, some good and others not entirely so.  He will be remembered forever as the man who introduced free travel for elderly people.  Throughout his career he looked after those vulnerable people and I ask the Minister of State, as his father&rsquo;s son, to tell the Government not only is reinstating the Christmas bonus the right thing to do, it would also be good for Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>This budget was precipitated by a collapse in our tax take.  We found ourselves having to bridge the gap between income and expenditure.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a fine record in supporting social welfare and pensions for the less well-off in society.  Senator Norris touched on the wonderful actions taken by Mr. Haughey for the elderly in terms of free travel and increases to the old age pension.  If people say we blew the boom, I am happy to stand over the decent increases we gave to old age pensioners and how we looked after them with free travel.  We have done the right thing from a social point of view.  This Government has borrowed &euro;20 billion to ensure social welfare recipients can maintain a decent existence.  One will not take many holidays on &euro;210 per week but at least recipients have a better standard of living here than they would in most European countries.</P>
        <P>As Senator Hanafin noted, prices have decreased substantially across the board.  Commercial rents have been reduced by up to 25%.  However, one will have to fight with one&rsquo;s landlord to achieve such a reduction.  O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s sandwich bars are a shining example of this.  I recently attended a speech by Mr. Sweeney at a Chambers Ireland event at which he stated the rents in 50% of his sandwich bars were reduced by between 20% and 25%.  He told the landlords that he would be unable to stay in business without substantial reductions.  This reveals that one can reduce one&rsquo;s rent by approaching the issue properly.</P><Col N="839"/>
        <P>The Government was then faced with a situation whereby it had to intervene in the banking deposit scenario.  Unless the Minister for Finance had acted promptly and swiftly in that case there would have been a substantial run on our banks at the time.</P>
        <P>Small businesses are finding the situation difficult at the moment, as the Minister knows.  Recently, however, banks have introduced special charges on people with overdrafts, which is scary.  The Minister should examine these charges in the interests of small businesses which make this country tick over.  These overdraft charges represent an extra cost for businesses and it is not good enough.</P>
        <P>A strong effort is made in the Bill to bridge the taxation gap.  Senator Quinn was right to mention that there was a period when we were overtaxed and such taxation did not work.  Over-taxation led to a black economy, which was not much good to the Exchequer.  As this is an interim measure I understand why the levies must be there and they will be regularised in the next budget.  It is important to note, however, that we will become very big property owners shortly as a result of NAMA.  The Minister should also examine stamp duty because we are getting very little return from the current stamp duty regime.  We could charge 50% and the return would still be the same.  If stamp duty was reduced it could kick-start the property market again by the end of this year.  Some sales are beginning to take place as property prices fall to a certain level and people start buying again.  That is very important, but I warn the Minister about property tax.  I would examine ways of structuring such a measure.  The introduction of a property tax in the next budget would not send out the right message to those who wish to buy property or for hard-pressed people who purchased expensive houses in the past.  The Minister should examine what might be done to structure such charges.  The United Kingdom does not have a property tax but one must pay a local charge there for services such as water, libraries and the fire brigade.  That approach might be considered here.</P>
        <P>If we tried to introduce property tax, how would we value it?  It is very difficult to put a value on any property at the moment.  I know a young couple who bought a house in Bray for &euro;315,000 and spent an additional &euro;50,000 on refurbishing it.  A similar house in the same road is now selling for approximately &euro;250,000, which gives some indication of where property prices are going.  The price one paid for a house two years ago will not be the same as the price today.</P>
        <P>I have covered most of the matters I wished to raise in the context of this Bill.  I heard criticism from the Labour Party about NAMA but it has not come up with one solution.  Its suggestion is to nationalise the banks but what about small investors in bank shares?  They have lost a lot of money because the shares are not worth what they were.  How will we deal with these people?  I think the Minister is proceeding the right way with NAMA.  I encourage him to introduce NAMA as soon as he can because the current situation is inhibiting the banking sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the House.  I will be very brief.  In his fine address, Senator Butler has made a good case for indicting the Government on its financial record.  If we take management of the public finances as a litmus test, the Government has failed no matter which way one looks at it.  Senator Butler referred to blowing the boom but this must be taken in two parts.  Part one involved the huge expenditure on public services <Col N="840"/>and infrastructure.  We welcome the level of investment on infrastructure but we have missed the fundamental points of making the country competitive again, including by upgrading broadband services.  Part two is that we have maligned our public servants by introducing a pension levy, thus making them pay for bad government.  </P>
        <P>With respect to the Minister, the abolition of the Christmas bonus was a very bad decision.  It told the most vulnerable people that they must pay the price for bad management of the economy.  It might be a small sum in the overall pot, but when I go out knocking on doors I meet people who are incensed by this measure.  They are ordinary decent people who, irrespective of politics, are under pressure, struggling and worried about next Christmas.  Leaving politics alone, I appeal to the Minister to restore the Christmas bonus for ordinary genuine Cork people in Togher, Bishopstown and Wilton where I have been canvassing for the past three months.</P>
        <P>Senators Butler and Twomey are right about small and medium enterprises being squeezed by the banks.  They are squeezing people who are providing employment and trying to keep the economy moving.  It is crazy to do so.  I have heard of banks putting pressure on business people by letter, refusing credit and almost taking the keys of business premises.  It is wrong and it should not be happening.  I know the Minister is working on this but we need our banks to support small and medium enterprises, which are the lifeblood of the economy.  They will not walk away if they get fair play from the banks.</P>
        <P>As an educationalist, I believe the Minister has got it wrong regarding the pension levy.  Never in the history of the State has middle-income Ireland been put under such pressure.  T&aacute; siad go l&eacute;ir faoi bhr&uacute;.  They are under pressure.  I know of countless families who will be under enormous financial pressure when they get their pay cheques this month.  Couples bought property during the boom when both partners had jobs, but one job may now be gone or under pressure.  We can no longer allow an unfair and unbalanced pension levy to affect those on middle incomes.  The levy should be reviewed and changed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Opposition has put forward numerous proposals through Deputies Richard Bruton and Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell and in this House from Senator Liam Twomey.  We need to get rid of inefficiencies in our economy thus keeping costs down to restore competitiveness.  The Minister might be surprised that last week I complimented him on his tour of Europe on the bond issue.  He will get credit from some of us on this side of the House for what he does right, if it works, but there are question marks about NAMA.  Neither Dr. Somers nor the Minister has provided the complete picture to people.  Eliminating inefficiencies in our economy must be through strong regulation and good governance which we have not had from the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors.  He may be an unfortunate victim to be in the position at this time but the best option available to us is to put the budget to the people through a general election and let the people give the next Government a mandate to govern.  That is what the people really want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their comments and I will try to address each of them as best I can.  I will begin by pointing out, in response to Senator Twomey, that the supplementary budget marked a new departure in budget formulation in Ireland.  For the first time, detailed multi-annual plans were contained in the budgetary projections.  Targets have been set for adjustments to taxation and expenditure for 2010 and 2011.  While the detailed specifics of the measures are still being formulated, the overall policy areas for examination in this context have been announced.  This multi-annual consolidation plan will ensure we restore the public finances to a sure footing by the end of 2013.</P><Col N="841"/>
        <P>Senator Twomey expressed doubts about the reliability of economic forecasting and as the Minister for Finance for the past year I have had to share those doubts on occasion.  However, the Economic and Social Research Institute in its recent commentary on Ireland&rsquo;s recovery scenarios made it clear we have a good prospect for recovery if we take the right corrective action.  The ESRI very strongly supported the steps taken by the Government to date in the four budgetary adjustments conducted since I was appointed Minister for Finance.  These adjustments were not easy but their cumulative effect has been a fiscal correction of between 4.5% and 5% of gross domestic product, which is very substantial by international standards and is the reason investors in other countries are recovering confidence in Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have to take these difficult steps and I appreciate that many of them will be the stuff of party debate in both Houses.  A moment ago, I heard Senator Buttimer speaking on various Government decisions.  The hard incontestable fact is that two thirds of our expenditure relate to payroll and transfer payments to welfare recipients.  These are very important payments but the idea that one can economise on expenditure without, for example, having the pension levy is unreal and sooner or later all parties in the House will have to face this fact.</P>
        <P>The supplementary budget struck the appropriate balance between the need to restore order to the public finances and protecting the economy.  It is important to understand that in making adjustments to the fiscal position for 2009 the supplementary budget was only the final step in the process.  In July 2008, expenditure savings of &euro;1 billion were delivered for 2009 and those savings focused on reducing the payroll bill and a range of efficiency measures.  I will not bring the House through the October budget, which we already discussed here and I remember Senator Twomey commenting on it at the time.  We also had adjustments in February 2009 with expenditure savings of almost &euro;1.8 billion and finally we have the supplementary budget of which the Finance Bill before the House today implements the taxation side.</P>
        <P>I know Senators realise that maintaining our public finances on a sustainable path is a prerequisite for economic growth.  I am looking forward to the reports from the Commission on Taxation and the special group on public service numbers, both to be delivered this summer.  As Senator MacSharry noted, they will have an important role to play in identifying measures that will improve the budgetary position in the coming years.</P>
        <P>Our tax system remains competitive and pro-business.  Senator Twomey spoke about the increase in taxation in the recent budget.  For most income earners, these increases have only brought us back to 2004-05 levels.  I do not believe this is excessive given the scale of the financial decline we have seen in our receipts.  If the Senator wishes to confirm this fact, I will refer him to annex A(iii) of the published budget book which details the average tax rates of various categories of income since 1997.  This table clearly shows that average tax rates for the average worker are approximately at 2004-05 levels.  Ireland remains a low-tax economy and even after the supplementary budget, the country will still benefit from one of the lowest tax wedges in the EU for an average worker and one of the lowest in the entire OECD for married one-income earners on average wages.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey and McCarthy raised concerns about the banking sector.  It is clear that Ireland, like many developed countries throughout the world, will need further measured and appropriate action in this area.  That is why we will establish the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  I  understand Senators had a full debate on this earlier this week.  I have no doubt Senators are aware the aim behind the establishment of NAMA is to reduce uncertainty and the lack of transparency about the level of bad debts and to ensure the flow of credit on a commercial basis to individuals and businesses in the real economy.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn questioned the Government&rsquo;s support for entrepreneurship and I remind him that the business expansion scheme and the associated seed capital scheme continue to be <Col N="842"/>available to small and medium-sized enterprises.  The limits on the amounts that can be raised by companies and the amounts that can be invested by individuals were significantly increased when the schemes were extended in 2007.  Despite the need to secure a substantial increase in tax, in recent budgets and Finance Bills measures continued to be introduced by the Government to maintain and enhance pro-employment business tax reliefs.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn suggested the changes in sections 6 and 11 of the Bill for the treatment of income and losses from dealing in residential development land represent retrospective taxation.  I am satisfied the changes being made do not represent retrospective taxation.  An individual subject to taxation under schedule D in respect of income from dealing in residential development land is not required to pay preliminary tax on his or her 2009 taxable income until October and November 2009 while the final liability for the year of assessment 2009 will not be settled until October and November 2010.  In the case of a company, the final corporation tax liability of any company affected by the change in the tax rate to 25% announced in the budget will not be settled until after the date of the budget announcement and in almost all cases not until the end of 2009 at the earliest for companies with accounting periods ending in March 2009.  In these circumstances, the tax changes announced are not retrospective in effect.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also raised the issue of liability of personal retirement savings accounts to the income levy.  The position is that an employer contribution to a personal retirement savings account is chargeable to income tax in the hands of the employee as a benefit-in-kind under the 1997 Act.  As the income levy treatment follows the income tax treatment, the employer&rsquo;s contribution to the personal retirement savings account is subject to the income levy.  The income levy was specifically designed to maximise the yield by gaining access to income that can generally be sheltered from income tax.  It should be noted that it is not only pension contributions that are subject to the income levy; capital investments, patent royalties, forestry, mining operations and earnings from writers, composers and artists are also subject to the levy.</P>
        <P>In reply to the point made by Senator Quinn on employers&rsquo; contributions to PRSAs and the 1% life assurance levy I announced on 7 April 2009, this is one part of our concerted effort to raise the necessary revenue.  Since the supplementary budget, a number of issues have been raised by the life insurance industry.  In response to these concerns, I have agreed to change the implementation date to 1 August to give a longer lead-in period for implementing the new levy.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also raised the increase in the standard VAT rate in the 2009 budget.  As I stated previously, the timing of the VAT increase was unfortunate given the subsequent temporary reduction in the UK rate and may have sent the wrong signal to consumers.  The subsequent increase in the UK rate was temporary.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy asked what was the marginal tax rate for an individual earning &euro;80,000; it is 50%.  However, looking at marginal tax rates can be misleading, in particular in the context of the credit system.  What really matters is the effective rate of tax.  The marginal rate of tax for a single individual earning &euro;36,400 is 30% while the marginal rate for another individual, earning &euro;36,401 &mdash; that is &euro;1 more &mdash; is 51%.  However, they both have the same average effective tax rate of 19.2%.  I could give other examples &mdash; but I will not weary the House &mdash; to show that marginal tax rates are not as decisive as many Senators seem to suggest.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators, including Senators MacSharry, Boyle, Hanafin, Butler and Buttimer, for their contributions.  I appreciate the understanding shown by the Senators of the progressive nature of the measures contained in the Bill and the recognition that we are exposed to changes in the international position.  I thank Senators for their constructive debate today.</P>

	<P>The Senator seeks to reinstate the exemption limit which applied in respect of persons aged under 65 years for the period from 1 January 2009 to 30 April 2009.  The exemption limit was reduced in the supplementary budget to increase the yield to the Exchequer from the income levy in the current year.</P>
        <P>An individual with an income of up to &euro;18,304, who would have been exempt from income levy, will now be required to make a maximum contribution of &euro;203.78 to the Exchequer this year.  Persons with income in excess of this amount always would have had a liability to pay the income levy.</P>
        <P>A single individual with an annual income of &euro;18,304 would pay income tax of less than &euro;1 on that income.  With earnings of &euro;352 or less per week, such an individual is exempt from both PRSI and health contributions.  The health payment, therefore, amounts to only 1.11% of the gross income of the individual.  Where the individual has a full medical card, he or she is still able to avail of the exemption arising as a result.  Similarly, it should be noted that the income to which this exemption applies is only after any social welfare entitlements have been disregarded.  Persons who are solely dependent on social welfare payments have no obligation to pay the income levy.</P>
        <P>To accept the Senator&rsquo;s recommendation would cost &euro;25 million in 2009 and &euro;50 million in a full year.  The income levy, as currently structured, is highly progressive.  Those who pay most are those who can afford to pay, while the most vulnerable in society are protected in so far as possible.  In view of these circumstances, I am not prepared to accept the Senator&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(1A) Aggregate income shall not include capital allowances for sole-traders, farmers and other self-employed persons for investment made to comply with environmental obligations.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The recommendation relates to self-employed persons who must pay the income levy.  It is proposed that the costs incurred by sole traders and self-employed persons should be disregarded because they relate to turnover rather than income.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator will be aware, the income levy has been introduced as a measure to help stabilise tax revenues.  The levy applies across all income streams and is determined on an individual basis at progressive rates, depending on the financial circumstances <Col N="845"/>of the individual.  To maximise the yield from the levy and ensure it is applied in a similar fashion across all sectors, it does not allow for tax shelters and incentives to be used to minimise the amount particular sectors should pay.  Such exceptions as have been allowed have been in particularly vulnerable areas such as redundancy payments, medical card holders, the aged and those in receipt of social welfare and similar benefits provided by other Departments.</P>
        <P>The recommendation seeks to grant special treatment to those individuals who invest in capital assets to satisfy environmental requirements in the particular sector in which they are trading.  This would be contrary to the general thrust of the policy underpinning the income levy and would place certain taxpayers in a preferred position over other taxpayers.  The tax system already provides reliefs in respect of such capital investments, allowing the investor to write off in full the relevant cost of the investment over a defined period against income tax.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the acquisition of assets for use in a trade normally results in an increase in the asset wealth of the business and the possibility of the owner disposing of this asset for a gain at a later date.  The intention of the income levy is that taxpayers should contribute based on their personal circumstances and ability to pay.  It is for this reason that the levy is being applied on the gross income of individuals without granting relief for deductions such as pension contributions or capital allowances.  In the circumstances, it would be difficult to justify granting a special concession for individuals investing in their businesses.  This is particularly the case given that taxpayers in employment have no such opportunity to limit their exposure to the levy.</P>
        <P>The cost of the Senator&rsquo;s proposal cannot be estimated with any accuracy.  However, not allowing deductibility of all capital allowances increases the yield from the levy by approximately &euro;70 million in a full year.  For this reason, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 3<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, between lines 3 and 4 to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The Minister will review the application of the income levy to employees&rsquo; remuneration in respect of employers&rsquo; contributions into their PRSAs and will report to both Houses of the Oireachtas, within one month of the passing of this Act, on the feasibility of exempting employer contributions into PRSA schemes from the income levy.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I apologise for the convoluted nature of the amendment.  It has been an education for me to compose the amendment in the Bills Office where I received some assistance in the past hour.  The recommendation would not result in additional cost as it would require the Minister only to review the application of the income levy.  I have worded the recommendation in this way to enable the Minister to accept it.</P>
        <P>The recommendation reflects a view expressed to me by a person who works in the pensions industry advising on all elements of pensions, including traditional PAYE pensions and personal retirement savings accounts or PRSA schemes.  His position is not one of narrow self-interest but arises from his belief that an inadvertent mistake has been made with regard to the income levy.  The levy is unfair to employees who have PRSA arrangements and the problem could be rectified if departmental officials were to take time to examine it.</P>
        <P>The problem which needs to be addressed is that employer contributions into PRSA schemes have always been treated in the same manner as contributions into traditional pension schemes, in other words, they are treated as if there were no benefit-in-kind implications.  The position changed with the introduction of the income levy, with employer contributions to PRSAs now <Col N="846"/>deemed to be subject to the levy.  While the reason is technical, it relates to the manner in which the legislation on PRSA contributions was framed.  Reverting to the original position would cost little.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to carry out a review of the matter and return to the Houses within one month.  I am confident he will give serious consideration to changing the current provisions as I do not believe this outcome was intended.  My informant tells me that almost everyone with whom he has discussed the issue has stated it was not intended.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The income levy applies to all emoluments of an employment, including anything treated as a taxable benefit in kind.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an employer contribution to a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, is chargeable to income tax in the hands of the employee as a benefit-in-kind under section 118 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  As the income levy treatment follows the income tax treatment, the employer&rsquo;s contribution to the personal retirement savings account will also be subject to the income levy.</P>
        <P>Section 778 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that an employer contribution made to an approved retirement benefit scheme or a statutory scheme is not to be treated as an emolument of the employee for income tax purposes.  Again, in terms of income levy treatment, any employer&rsquo;s contributions to such schemes will not be subject to the income levy.  If the income levy treatment was to be changed as regards employees&rsquo; contributions, there might be a need to examine the underlying income tax treatment.  The Minister will consider the issue in the overall context of what should be the appropriate income tax and income levy regimes for the future.  As matters stand, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for considering the recommendation.  I will accept the position he had taken provided the Minister examines the issue.  I deliberately worded the recommendation in this way to enable the Minister to review the issue with a view to achieving the objective I seek.  I believe the problem I highlight is an unintended anomaly which the Minister will agree to address.</P></Speaker>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, line 48, after &ldquo;2009&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;unless it can be shown that the person had occupied the house as their principal private residence in the past 3 years&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The recommendation relates to people who will lose mortgage relief if they rent out their home.  A number of people who lost their jobs have chosen to rent out their homes.  When such people rent out their house they lose their mortgage interest relief.  An allowance should be made for a person who must rent out their house owing to financial problems.  Such a person should be allowed claim mortgage relief and at the same time rent out his or her house for three years to assist him or her to get through the present crisis.  We are assisting far bigger institutions with far greater sums.</P><Col N="847"/>
      <P>There also has been much debate in this House about those on fixed-rate mortgages.  Some speak supportively on the matter but will not vote for it.  I do not see much coming from the Government to help people who are distressed financially because of the present crisis and this would be one measure that might assist such people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add a word of support for Senator Twomey.  This is a recommendation that is worthy of consideration.  The wording to be inserted is quite correct: &ldquo;unless it can be shown that the person had occupied the house as their principal private residence in the past 3 years&rdquo;.  It seems this is a recommendation that would be capable of being accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This recommendation was discussed as an amendment during the passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il.  The effect of the recommendation would be to exclude from the new restriction on the amount of interest that can be deducted in computing a person&rsquo;s taxable rental income, interest paid by individuals who had occupied a house as their principal private residence before that house was rented out for residential use.</P>
        <P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s concern primarily relates to possible situations of hardship that might arise given that, in current economic circumstances, people may be losing their jobs while still having large mortgage repayments to meet.  Individuals who find themselves in such a situation may well be looking to other possible sources of income to keep up those repayments, including the possible renting of their home.</P>
        <P>While individual&rsquo;s may have options to help defray the cost of mortgage repayments, short of vacating their homes, such as the rent-a-room relief scheme, such options may not be suitable in every situation.  Certain individuals who have lost their jobs may well decide to move back in with parents or perhaps with other members of the family to rent their home.</P>
        <P>The immediate financial benefit from such a course of action is obvious as they move from having to fund the mortgage from their own resources to having it wholly or mainly funded from rental income.  In that regard, if the individual concerned is unemployed, it is highly unlikely he or she would be in the position of having to pay tax on net rental income on foot of the reduction in interest deductibility announced in the budget.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A single person getting the top rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, which is currently just over &euro;204 per week, would need to be in receipt of net rental income in excess of &euro;7,676 per annum before he or she would pay any tax.  This is because his or her personal and PAYE credits would act to absorb any income tax chargeable on his or her combined social welfare and rental income up to &euro;18,300.  In the case of a married couple with one earner who is unemployed, the position would be that they would have to be in receipt of net rental income of close to &euro;10,000 before income tax would be payable.  It is highly unlikely that the letting of a property in the city would give rise to net rental income of those amounts.  For these reasons, I am unable to accept the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In his response, the Minister of State has taken a scenario where someone has no income and, therefore, no taxes to pay.  However, the reality is that at the height of the Celtic tiger, which is when one would have bought a house if one had been living in it for the past three years, young couples would have mortgaged themselves to the hilt on their double incomes to purchase a house.  If one of those individuals were to lose his or her job, it would force the couple to move back in with parents because of the difficult financial constraints on families.  Anyone who has lived in their own house for three years will not move back in to live with his or her parents for a small financial saving.  The people who have got that independence for a couple of years would like to keep it.</P><Col N="848"/>
        <P>I am getting the sense through this crisis that the Government is not that bothered if it harms the ordinary man and woman who pays certain taxes and who is affected by this crisis when compared with the largesse it has granted to parts of the financial services.  A few issues such as this have arisen.  There is this option.  There is also the option on fixed-rate mortgages where the Minister of State need not necessarily abolish the full fixed-interest mortgage but could make it 50:50.  The Government is giving nothing to cut the ordinary taxpayer some slack.  That is up to the Minister of State, however, if that is the way he wants to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Needless to say, I reject the underlying imputation there.  I had a person in my clinic on Saturday last who was in exactly the situation described by the Senator.  He had lost his job, although he hopes to get one reasonably shortly, but his wife is still in employment.  He did observe that his annual mortgage interest payments had reduced from approximately &euro;18,000 in September 2007 to a little over &euro;12,000 today.  No doubt the mortgage interest burdens of many have reduced.  He was on a tracker mortgage which is one of the most favourable arrangements at present.</P>
        <P>Where people, even those married with children, move back into their parents&rsquo; homes, in certain circumstances that is done on a temporary basis.  Indeed, it has happened in my own family but not for reasons to do with unemployment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&ldquo;(1A) From the 21st of May 2009 any application for this relief shall be accompanied by an analysis conforming to guidelines set by the Revenue Commissioners demonstrating that the social benefits of the project exceed the social costs.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the part where the Minister is talking about getting rid of capital allowances for certain health care facilities.  In some respects, the Government has accepted it must row back significantly on what was its core health policy for a number of years, that is, the co-location of private hospitals and giving tax relief for their construction while at the same time refusing to develop the public services in a way that would have been expected during the height of the Celtic tiger.  Before the Government does this, when it looks at the benefits of what it is getting rid of, it should also look at the social cost in terms of the services which will not now be provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This recommendation proposes that applications for tax relief in respect of registered nursing homes, convalescent homes, mental health centres and private hospitals be accompanied by a social cost-benefit analysis conforming to guidelines to be drawn up by the Revenue Commissioners.  As I understand it, the intention is that tax relief would not be available for a project where, on the basis of such analysis, its social benefits do not exceed its social costs.</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P>As mentioned by the Minister during the D&aacute;il debate on a similar Report Stage amendment, the then Minister for Finance requested independent economic consultants, Indecon, to undertake a detailed review during 2005 of the property related, including health related, tax incentive schemes in existence at that time.  The consultants recommended that the schemes for nursing homes, convalescent homes and private hospitals be continued as there was a need for ongoing investment in those areas.  It can be taken from this that the external consultants regarded the potential benefits from each of these schemes as exceeding the potential costs.</P>
        <P>The scheme for mental health centres only came into effect on 23 January 2007 and therefore was not part of that review.  However, it should be noted that a condition with which a qualified mental health centre must comply before getting certification from the HSE is the provision of data to the HSE for onward transmission to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance to allow for the ongoing assessment and evaluation of the costs and benefits arising from the overall scheme.</P>
        <P>A key recommendation of the Indecon review was that the costs and benefits of any proposed new tax incentives should be assessed prior to their introduction.  The then Minister for Finance announced in budget 2006 that he would implement this recommendation as far as appropriate.  That was considered appropriate in the case of the mid-Shannon corridor tourism investment scheme.  The Goodbody Economic Consultants group was engaged to carry out an assessment of the costs and benefits in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s introduction.  The schemes of capital allowances for registered nursing homes, convalescent homes and private hospitals were introduced before the consultants carried out their 2005 review and made their recommendation on carrying out cost benefit analyses.  On the basis that they recommended that these schemes be continued, it can be taken that they concluded that the benefits would outweigh the costs.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is terminating the schemes and, as he stated in the D&aacute;il, there seems to be no point in requiring a cost benefit analysis to be carried out at this late stage.  He also mentioned that where it is considered appropriate, this kind of analysis should and will be carried out before the introduction of a new scheme and not when a scheme, which is in operation, is being wound down.  The Revenue Commissioners are not the competent authority to draw up guidelines on how to carry out a cost benefit analysis of tax incentive schemes.  Revenue&rsquo;s role is to administer the tax system and to collect the appropriate tax due under the law.</P>
        <P>The examination of projects, be they on roads or nursing homes, can be an artificial exercise.  The figures derived from cost benefit analyses often depend on one&rsquo;s assumptions.  In many instances, such an analysis is not as scientific as it purports to be.  In my observations and experience, I am sceptical of the recommendation, in addition to the reasons previously stated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2005, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, announced that co-location was Government policy to deliver additional beds in the health care system.  She refused to fund a large number of beds in the public system and instead opted for that to be done through co-location.  Her reasons were that co-location would occur more quickly than public hospitals could be built and that it would be more cost effective.  The Minister defended this policy, but the Minister of State has called it a bad idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Twomey as I am disappointed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s lack of confidence in cost benefit analyses.  I agree that assumptions must be made, but those of us fighting against over-regulation, who have argued strongly for such analyses, very <Col N="850"/>often find there is Government reluctance towards anything that smacks of delay.  Europe, however, now insists on cost benefit analyses despite the doubts about assumptions that may have to be made.</P>
        <P>The recommendation is worthy because it demonstrates that the project&rsquo;s social benefits exceed its social costs.  I am unsure as to whether that is regularly the case.  I support the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The underlying tenor of my reply was that there is little point in undertaking a cost benefit analysis at the stage at which the schemes are being abolished.  Where a cost benefit analysis is required in any area of the economy by EU or domestic law, it must be done.  In addition to the futility in the case used in my example, I have some scepticism.</P>
        <P>Unlike Senator Twomey, I do not believe that co-location was a bad idea because it is being abolished.  That does not follow.  Given his background in the medical profession, he has more knowledge of these issues than I do, but part of the rationale for co-location was that there were heavily subsidised private beds in public hospitals and we needed to change that situation.  Contrary to how the matter has been portrayed, particularly by the left, as a conservative or reactionary measure, co-location was a progressive measure.  I have debated the matter in the House as a Senator and a Minister of State.  Perhaps we should have opted for something akin to the national health system in the 1940s.  The vested interests of the medical profession defeated that move and brought down a Government of which Senator Twomey&rsquo;s party was a part.  For better or worse, we have a hybrid system in which approximately 50% of the population is insured and 50% is covered by the public system.</P>
        <P>Obviously, economic circumstances have drastically changed since 2005.  A considerable amount was invested in private hospitals, the most striking of which is the Beacon Clinic on the M50 in Sandyford.  A general principle that should apply to all governments but in respect of which all governments have been slow in acting is that all incentives should be for a limited period.  Otherwise, they cease to have a stimulating effect and cost money.  The best incentives achieve effects for three or four years.  Senator Twomey&rsquo;s party leader introduced the seaside resort scheme as the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  It lasted for a period of years, then ceased.  In no circumstances should incentives exist indefinitely.  They are usually introduced to stimulate activity, after which they should cease.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&ldquo;(1A) From the 21st of May 2009 any application for this relief shall be accompanied by an analysis conforming to guidelines set by the Revenue Commissioners demonstrating that the social benefits of the project exceed the social costs.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This addresses the same issue as recommendation No. 5, although I am sure the Minister of State will not accept this recommendation either.  We should clarify a few matters.  I have never <Col N="851"/>had a problem with hospitals like the Beacon Clinic.  They are stand-alone clinics and have to survive on their own, even if they do receive certain tax credits at times.</P>
        <P>The co-location policy was very different because it tried to marry a private system onto an inefficient public system, using the same consultants in both hospitals.  The Government rushed through that deal, which would cost the taxpayer significant amounts of money.</P>
        <P>After it was done and the contracts were signed, the Government then began negotiations with the consultants.  There was an attempt by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to use Aneurin Bevan&rsquo;s statement in her negotiations with the consultants.  She attempted to stuff their mouths with gold.  The Government has also back-tracked on that contract.</P>
        <P>It was quite an expensive contract and did not deliver much in the way of improved services for ordinary patients in the public health care system.  When we have time to look at what the Minister, Deputy Harney, did regarding co-location and consultants&rsquo; contracts, one will realise she was being very foolish with taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>

	<P>The same reasons I adduced regarding the previous recommendation apply here.  We have to think ourselves back to the very different economic and financial context of 2005.  It seems to me many financial incentives introduced over the years by all Governments, especially during the past 20 years, have been designed to encourage people with money to invest in facilities, including socially deserving facilities and those which have employment benefits during construction.</P>
        <P>As I said in my previous contribution, for such incentives to be effective, they need to be relatively short-lived.  Other incentives were being phased out at the time this was introduced.  We are now in a situation where individuals and organisations up to and including the wealthiest in society have experienced substantial losses of income and wealth.  The State has also lost a lot of revenue.  A very rigorous attitude will be needed to deal with any tax incentives of this type, hence the reason for the abolition of this particular one.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I see no reason people who pay DIRT could not be informed in a statement they receive from their bank of the amount they pay every year.  I heard some of the debate in the other House earlier, but the bank statements do not show, in full, the amount of DIRT people pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Banks and other credit institutions are required to issue annual statements in respect of accounts with a balance in excess of &euro;20 unless otherwise agreed with the consumer in writing.  The question of whether information on the amount of deposit interest retention tax deducted from interest payments should be included on these annual statements was considered by the Financial Regulator in 2006.  Following consultations with the industry, the regulator considered the imposition of such a requirement would involve implementation costs and concluded he could not introduce this requirement without the general agreement of the industry.</P>
        <P>Following further discussions, the regulator included the provision in chapter 3 of the consumer protection code that where tax is deducted from interest paid, the statement will provide information on the tax deducted, or inform consumers how they may obtain a certificate detailing the tax paid.</P>
        <P>At present this is catered for in section 262 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which requires a financial institution to issue a separate statement containing information on deposit interest retention tax when requested to do so by an account holder.  This information should include the amount of interest paid, the amount of DIRT deducted, the net amount of interest paid and the date of the payment.</P>
        <P>A provision whereby such statements are issued on request strikes a reasonable balance and ensures a statement is issued only to those account holders who wish to have the information.  However, in light of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, I will request the regulator to consider the matter further.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is to deal with stamp duty on second-hand houses.  This recommendation was given to the Minister of State and I would like to hear his views on it to see if he considers it a worthwhile option to get the second-hand property market moving in light of the number of people in the sector losing their jobs.  The website, <i>www.daft.ie</i>, stated the stock of unsold second-hand houses has risen to approximately 60,000 from 20,000 at the beginning of 2007.  It is quite clear there is a need to stimulate this market and one way to do so is to cut stamp duty.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of tax on house purchase in the world.  This would be a worthwhile measure to try to see if we could get this market moving again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I think we may, in some instances, be confusing where the recommendations fall.  I do not accept the Senator&rsquo;s recommendation.  In the October budget, the Minister for Finance reduced the top rate of stamp duty on commercial property from 9% to 6%, which applies to all non-residential property valued at more than &euro;80,000.  In the Finance (No. 2) Act 2007, his predecessor, who is now Taoiseach, reduced the stamp duty payable on residential property and abolished it for all first-time buyers of residential property.  While the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, has decided not to change property stamp duty rates at this time, all tax measures are considered as part of the budget process and will be reviewed in light of the changing economic position.  Any recommendations which may be made by the Commission on Taxation will also be taken into account.</P>
        <P>The Minister has, however, taken a measure in this Bill to stimulate the residential property market.  Section 24 of the Finance Bill provides for a new exchange of houses scheme under which a person selling a new residential property can take a second-hand residence in exchange or part exchange and not have to pay the stamp duty on the second-hand property until the earlier of the date he or she sells the second-hand property or by 31 December 2010, the date the scheme ends.  The intention of the scheme is to free up the overhang of completed but unsold new property with the consequential impact on employment.</P>
        <P>A person selling the new house and accepting the second-hand house may decide to sell that house, to renovate it before sale or to rent it out.  Even though the individual buying the new property might not be a first-time buyer, if he or she intends to occupy that property as his or her principal place of residence for five years, he or she will not have to pay stamp duty on that new property unless it is over 125 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> in area, in which case a reduced rate of stamp duty applies.  This relief for non-first-time purchaser owner-occupiers buying new property was introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>A consequence of accepting the recommendation, which I presume is unintended, is that the payment of a premium on foot of a grant of a lease for residential property would remain taxable at the higher rate, that is at the current rates of 7% on amounts from &euro;125,000 to &euro;1 million and 9% on amounts more than &euro;1 million.  Given that it is estimated that the changes covered by the recommendation would cost approximately &euro;130 million, it is difficult to see the rationale for the proposal.  I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Recommendation No. 8<i>a</i> is fairly self-explanatory.  It is just a question of changing the VAT rates to ones that will work for people in business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the increase in the standard rate of VAT in budget 2009, as the Minister for Finance previously stated, it appears that the timing of this increase, given the subsequent temporary reduction in the UK rate, may have sent the wrong signal to consumers.  However, given the current Exchequer deficit position, the policy decision of increasing the standard VAT rate continues to be necessary to support the public finances.</P>
        <P>We are borrowing to fund day-to-day public services, which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct our public finances.  We must remember that although the UK cut its standard rate of VAT from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis from 1 December 2008 to the end of 2009, at the same time it increased excise duty on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to off-set the 2.5% reduction in VAT on those items.  Consequently, there was no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in UK VAT.</P>
        <P>The recommendation to reduce the standard rate to 21% and the lower VAT rate from 13.5% to 10% would cost the Exchequer more than &euro;1.1 billion in a full year.  In the current economic climate, these VAT changes would be too costly to implement.  This was part of a ten-point plan put forward by the Fine Gael candidate in the Dublin South by-election.  I commented that the figures did not add up.  Furthermore, as a small open economy, many of our goods and services are imported, especially in the case of those at the standard rate.  Cutting the VAT rates could benefit the economies from which we import more than it would benefit us.  In other words, while it might help the consumer, it would not necessarily be the most effective way of helping our economy.</P>
        <P>There are means of stimulating the economy outside of the VAT system. The Government is providing a long-term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the average in the European Union.  This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long-term productive capacity.  Automatic stabilisers such as social welfare payments provide a <i>de facto </i>stimulus to the economy.  In regard to temporary or permanent reductions in VAT, while the UK has temporarily reduced its VAT rate, this is not the approach being adopted by most other member states.  It seems likely that, given the difficulties also being experienced in the UK public finances, the restoration of the VAT rate as legislated for will go ahead.  If there were any change in that situation it would unlikely be for long.  The UK potentially has a larger deficit to address than ours, now and in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is saying the Government is spending too much so we must tax people more.  Common sense would dictate that the Government should try to rein in its spending better also.  The policy decision was made in the budget that the Government would favour more taxes rather than controlling its spending as a way to solve the current crisis.  The Government&rsquo;s justification for that is nonsensical in that the implication is that VAT really applies to imports, which are mainly purchased by the consumer and, therefore, it does not contribute that much to the economy, and it is all right to increase VAT.  That is evident in the Border counties where one can see that due to the variations in VAT consumers have chosen to flock to Northern Ireland to the detriment of business in Border counties.  There was a need to be innovative and to show flair.  The Government failed to take the tough decisions that were necessary to counteract the serious damage to our economy, especially the consumer economy.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="855"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>At any rate we did not put up the VAT rate to 35%, which is what happened in 1983-84 when the first great Border influx took place.  Travelling across the Border has far more to do with the exchange rate than it has to do with VAT rates.  There has been a net 3% change in the VAT rate.  At one time the change in the exchange rate was in the order of 25% from approximately 68p or 69p to the euro to where it is now, at approximately 87p or 88p.  That is the fundamental objective reason, not the variation in the VAT rate.</P>
        <P>It is very easy for the Opposition to make general statements of principle that one should concentrate on reductions in expenditure rather than taxation.  If Senator Twomey&rsquo;s party was in government with the Labour Party it would have to do the same as we are doing, namely, tackle expenditure and find new sources of taxation because some of our sources of taxation, such as capital taxes, in particular stamp duty and corporation tax, which have been buoyant have to a great degree dried up, not completely, but compared to the previous position.  For a period they put us in the happy position of being able to reduce borrowing, increase expenditure and cut taxes.  I well remember the debates of the 1980s when there was a constant lament, particularly from Labour parties in government, at how little corporation tax and capital taxes were producing.  That is one of the reasons we have set up the Commission on Taxation.  I doubt the Senator is saying he is not interested in what the Commission on Taxation has to say.  I would put it to him that his party must consider and evaluate where new sources of taxation are to be found.</P>
        <P>There have been very considerable cuts in expenditure and those are ongoing.  My own office had a budget last year of about &euro;720 million, but that has been cut by 25% to under &euro;500 million.  That has happened across many Departments.  The problem is that Fine Gael is very specific about where taxes should be reduced, such as in this recommendation, and quite extraordinarily vague about where expenditure should be cut.  Fine Gael is not behaving any differently from any other Opposition party in the past, but while in theory the party has access to the books, it takes the view that it is its responsibility to put the opposite point of view to the Government.  I respect that, as it is roughly the division of labour.  The idea that the party can be vigorous on expenditure and that there would be no necessity whatever to raise taxes will not hold a moment&rsquo;s water if and when it returns to Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been many predictions of the future by Ministers today but the Minister of State&rsquo;s prediction of a Fine Gael and Labour Government has been the most passionate we have had.  He must some concerns about that option.  I cannot really speak for Labour Party policy but some of Fine Gael&rsquo;s views on accountability, transparency and value for money over the boom years of the Celtic tiger often won us no friends.  If these views had been taken on board, we probably would not be in the mess we are in today.  We can fight it on that rather than saying we are opposing for the sake of opposing.  We have also put across very good policies in Opposition and they have been taken up by the Government as it recognises their worth.  The Minister of State may be passionate about what he thinks on this, but I am afraid he is misguided.</P>

When we talk about cutting stamp duty to 2%, the Minister of State tells us that it is up to 7% or 9% at the moment.  There is very little happening in this section of the housing market.  Many people in this area are losing their jobs, and not just estate agents.  This sector of the economy is dead to all intents and purposes.  It is not moving and nothing is happening.  Things can done on a temporary basis but there is a need to do something to stimulate this section of the economy.  A flat rate of 2% of something is better than 7% or 8% of nothing.  That is the way the Minister for Finance should look at this.  The Minister of State talks about doing innovative things.  Let us do this and let us see if we can improve things quickly.</P>

	<P>We have all addressed this on the last recommendation on VAT.  It is yet another revenue cutting measure and there are no proposals on where the revenue would be made up.  I am taking at face value the Fine Gael position that the deficit should not be increased, even in the short term, and if anything, reduced more than the Government is planning.  No credible explanation of how this is to be done has been provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is easy to understand how this can be done.  Monthly transactions for second-hand houses were running at around 7,000 per month, but that has now dropped to 3,500.  This market is slowing down and will gradually die away.  There is always a bit of unpredictability.  Fianna F&aacute;il politicians are the best people to understand unpredictability.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s former boss told us two years ago that anyone talking down the economy should go and jump in the river.  With more than &euro;100 billion borrowed two years later and with exposure to the taxpayer, Fianna F&aacute;il should not lecture anyone about unpredictability.</P>
        <P>There is a certain chance in many things we do.  This is one of them.  The Minister of State can reject it with the same dead hand of the Government that is too long in office and is too afraid to make a decision and do something that might be in any way radical.  The Government <Col N="857"/>is considering buying junk bonds for &euro;90 billion, yet this Minister of State is worried about lost revenue that may come from this proposal which will be running into a few million euro.</P>

	<P>Our estimates are much higher than that.  The Commission on Taxation will be studying how property should be taxed, including any knock-on implications that may have for stamp duty.

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue, which is the need for the Minister with responsibility for the marine to outline the actions that can be taken as interim, medium and long-term measures to ensure harbour and vessel safety at Greencastle breakwater in County Donegal and the role of the new marine body in prioritising and supporting the development of marine infrastructure to support job creation.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister for State, Deputy Sargent, will take this Adjournment matter and I will provide him with a brief outline of the issue.  The existing harbour at Greencastle had difficulties with particular prevailing winds and needed a breakwater to address the issues of the inner harbour and to facilitate larger boats which tie up at Killybegs because they physically cannot get into Greencastle.  It is a very busy harbour because not only does it have fishing vessels, it also has a small amount of marine leisure activity.  Is has the RNLI, cliff sea rescue, pilot boats and the Magilligan to Greencastle car ferry.  Magilligan has just been moved from international to domestic status but that is another day&rsquo;s work we achieved.</P>
        <P>At present, there is a project at Greencastle that will cost &euro;36 million overall but a difficulty has arisen.  We have spent &euro;5 million but there is a particular point at which things are at their most dangerous and the money for this year seems to have dried up.  However, what has been achieved will be consolidated.  At present, the breakwater is out a certain level and is above the water in certain tides but it is causing difficulties because it is changing the course of the tide and making it dangerous for all vessels using Greencastle Harbour.  I am not saying this because we want to cause bother.  This project is at a stage where for health and safety reasons it needs to be completed.  It is well-started but not far enough out to deal with the currents and tides in operation at that point.  It is at its most dangerous.  Rock armour will be put in place to try to hold what we have.  We do not want to have spent &euro;5 million on a breakwater to realise that the tidal impacts over the coming months will remove the work already done.  We do not want to lose the money that has been spent.</P>
        <P>We understand that contractual arrangements are in place for some harbours that are a priority.  However, if a sum of hundreds of thousands of euro became available we could spend it.  It is not a case that the money would be returned to the Department unspent.  We are <Col N="860"/>constantly able to bring in more stone for the breakwater to continue this project.  In the interim term we are seeking a commitment that should moneys become available, they will be given to this project.  We promise to spend them if they do.  We also ask that in the 2010 budget priority would be afforded to this project for health and safety reasons.  Many of the projects under contractual arrangements will finish by the end of this year and we seek an interim commitment that we will become the priority for 2010.</P>
        <P>The changes in Area 6 have been very difficult for the fishermen who have been given perhaps three days a month to fish but have loans of &euro;200,000 on their boats.  Over the coming years, one will have to establish one&rsquo;s right to fish in Area 6 and we know Greencastle Harbour will be a very busy port.  I am not here to argue the case for work on Greencastle Harbour.  It has already been made, sanctioned by the Department of Finance, started and therefore will be finished.  It is that there is a potential danger to health and safety from leaving the work the way it is and we need short, medium and long-term projections of what we can do.</P>
        <P>I welcome that there will be a consolidation of the overall marine infrastructure.  It was ridiculous to have seven different Ministries dealing with it which made progress in an island nation impossible.  I wish it well but I hope it will have a role in being able to give us clear indications on the priorities, how they have become priorities and that where dangers arise, as they have in Greencastle, they can be addressed.  We all believe in the future of our coastal communities and the importance of the marine sector not only to Donegal but to all coastal communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as seans a thabhairt dom freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist th&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I want to clarify the position with regard to the responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the development of fishery harbours.  My Department is responsible for the day-to-day running, maintenance and development of the six fishery harbour centres.  These are located at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l, Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth.  There are numerous other fishery harbours which are not in the ownership of my Department.  These are in the main in the ownership of local authorities and my Department is committed to assisting where possible in their development and upgrade.  Funding for such developments is provided under the Department&rsquo;s fishery harbours and coastal infrastructure development programme, subject to the availability of Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>Greencastle Harbour falls into this category.  It is owned by Donegal County Council and that local authority is responsible for the day to day operation of the harbour as well as its maintenance and development.  Greencastle Harbour was identified by Donegal County Council as a priority for further development.  The recommended development at the harbour is divided into three main phases which will provide a rock breakwater, fuel and mussel berths and a new deep-water berth at the harbour.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has agreed to co-fund phase 1 of the development which involves the provision of a rock breakwater.  When completed, it will extend to 290 metres in length.  The cost of phase 1 has been estimated at &euro;16.8 million and is being funded jointly by the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Donegal County Council.  The agreed funding breakdown is that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will fund 75% and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Donegal County Council will each fund 12.5%.</P><Col N="861"/>
        <P>In addition, although the harbour is in the ownership of Donegal County Council, agreement was reached whereby the Department&rsquo;s engineering division would project-manage the development.  This decision was taken as the Department is fortunate in having a highly experienced engineering division with accumulated expertise that could not be readily available within the resources of Donegal County Council.</P>
        <P>Work commenced in 2007 and considerable progress has been made to date.  The spend on the project was &euro;1.537 million in 2007 and a further &euro;5.062 million in 2008.  A further &euro;1.6 million has been allocated to progress the development in 2009. Issues relating to safety are always of paramount importance and feature highly with both the Department&rsquo;s engineering staff and Donegal County Council who are the people charged with the day to day running of the harbour.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the harbour development project at Greencastle is designed to ultimately address the health and safety issues already existing at the harbour.  The issues are harbour congestion, wave penetration and cross currents at the harbour entrance.  The Department&rsquo;s engineers have advised that it is expected that these problems will continue to feature at Greencastle to a greater or lesser extent as the project advances and can in reality only be fully addressed when the project is completed.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s engineering division will continue to ensure that health and safety will not be compromised during the breakwater development at Greencastle.  I assure all harbour users that appropriate measures are being taken to address health and safety concerns as construction of the breakwater advances from the shore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The measures being taken include the deployment of navigational markings, diver survey inspections of the constructed breakwater works and the issue of a marine notice warning all ship owners, agents, shipmasters, fishermen, yachtsmen and seafarers about the breakwater construction site and the changed tidal current patterns in the Greencastle area.  Health and safety, however, is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility and there is an onus on all harbour users to proceed with due diligence and care while navigating in the vicinity of the breakwater, which is under construction, and while entering Greencastle Harbour.  The investment in Greencastle Harbour is significant and I am confident that any inconvenience caused during the construction of the breakwater will in time pay dividends for users for generations.</P>
        <P>My Department is in correspondence with Donegal County Council regarding the payment of arrears outstanding for construction costs on harbour works to date and is seeking an undertaking that future liabilities accrued by this Department on behalf of Donegal County Council will be discharged in a timely fashion.  It is hoped that, subject to the availability of Exchequer funding, the payment of arrears by Donegal County Council and the undertaking outlined, funding for the continuation of work on phase one of the project will be considered under the 2010 harbours and coastal infrastructure programme.</P>
        <P>On Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s question on the new marine body, I confirm that my Department colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has been asked by the Taoiseach to chair a co-ordination group of Departments on marine related matters.  The Minister of State has stated that it is important that all relevant Departments co-operate as effectively and efficiently as possible in marine-related matters, particularly in the current economic climate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I accept that money is available in 2009, but that will only bring the ongoing work to what I would call a safe halt.  We are scared that in 2009 the word &ldquo;halt&rdquo; might mean that it is a closed project and we will have to fight a new battle to ensure it becomes an open project again.  We hope this is an <Col N="862"/>ongoing project and that, subject to very unusual circumstances, it will recommence as soon as money is available for it.  That is the commitment we seek.  The health and safety issues are not the day-to-day issues.  We understand that people will be inconvenienced by activity but our difficulty is that if the project is left in its current condition for any length of time, it will provide opportunities for a disaster to happen.  We will have to react quickly if that occurs.</P>
