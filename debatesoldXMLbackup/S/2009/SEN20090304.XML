	<P>I have notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give approval to the building project in Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bun Beag, County Donegal, to proceed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Michael McCarthy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the position in relation to the proposed new extension to Kinsale community college, the reason for the delay in this project, and if he will give a commitment that the project will proceed in the near future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the progress made to date on the establishment of a satellite radiotherapy centre for the north west.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to facilitate the annual holiday for the Friedreich&rsquo;s Ataxia Society of Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to report on his interactions with his Northern counterparts to address the international port status of Magilligan, which has placed an economic noose on the Foyle ferry that is currently out for re-tender and is in need of a change of security status for this cross-Border project to thrive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill,<b> </b>McCarthy and Doherty and they <Col N="318" />will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ross and Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Adoption Bill 2009 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to adjourn not later than 5 p.m., if not previously concluded, and No. 22, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 34 on the development of microfinance, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7 p.m.  The business of the House will be interrupted between 1.30 p.m. and 3 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision to take only Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill today and to have the Report Stage debate on another day.  This is much more satisfactory than what was originally planned.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the optimism expressed by the Deputy Leader in the House yesterday, when he indicated that tax receipts would be adequate to prevent the need for further budgetary measures, was short-lived, as became clear from the Exchequer returns published later in the day.  The Taoiseach indicated that a range of taxation and expenditure adjustments would be made by the Government towards the end of the month.  Again, we are waiting.  I note the Taoiseach did not call this a budget.  I must ask when is a budget not a budget.  We are talking about spending and taxation measures.  I ask the Deputy Leader to break away from the doublespeak we have heard and tell the people the truth.  If we need a budget at the end of the month, the people want to see a fair and comprehensive budget.  The key word is &ldquo;fair&rdquo;.  They are tired of the drip-feed of information and the lack of a roadmap.  Does the Deputy Leader agree that a comprehensive roadmap is necessary to restore confidence both nationally and internationally?  Without this, it is hard for people to plan.  If the country does not plan, individuals do not plan.  People do not know what the Government&rsquo;s plans are in both these areas.  I ask the Deputy Leader to use his influence and that of his party to ensure we have fair and comprehensive measures and that we have a roadmap.</P>
        <P>People can see the contrast between the waste at the top and the decisions taken on the front line, including provision for special needs, which I mentioned yesterday.  The waste must be tackled, whether it is helicopter trips or the stories from F&Aacute;S which have been highlighted so effectively and for so long by Senator Ross and others in the House.  Will we see comprehensive plans to end the type of waste that has resulted in so much disillusionment and made it hard for people to accept the very measures that may be necessary to save this economy?  I would be interested to hear the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s response to these points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement made by the Government yesterday on taxation.  I am one of those who has been shouting for an approach in that direction for the last three or four months.  I look forward to seeing what the approach will be.  As long as there is a fair and progressive approach to taxation people will have to bite the bullet, and society will be prepared to do so if measures are taken fairly, honestly, openly and effectively.</P>
        <P>I agree with 99% of the points made by Senator Fitzgerald, particularly in terms of waste, which must also be examined.  I am not sure about her reference to helicopter trips; this may be the only point of difference I have with the Senator this morning.  The Government must continue to operate and I do not think it should run in front of the media worried about a Minister using a helicopter if it is properly used for proper reasons.  Its members should not simply back off on that.</P><Col N="319" />
        <P>I have not seen the outline of what the Government members intend to do for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, but it is time they stood up and faced down ridiculous and stupid media comment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Never was it more necessary to promote our economy abroad, and if that means going over there and sloshing horrible-tasting green beer, shaking hands with the ancient order of this, that or the other thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or meeting the various brotherhoods then so be it.  If that is what it takes to get people to come to this country, invest in this country, buy in this country and have confidence in our economy, the Government would be better off going abroad to wherever the important markets are in a properly organised and effective fashion.  I want to see them do that and I will defend it publicly.  If it gives cheap headlines to tabloids and irresponsible journalists, so be it.  If something needs to be done it should be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s announcement yesterday about its plans.  However, I would prefer if it used real language, rather than spin, and told it like it is.  For a long time, most of us have been saying there was a need for another budget, and now the Government is saying it will do this but is not calling it a budget.  It brought in levies and did not call them taxes.  People will not buy this.  Is it any wonder they are cynical when they are seeing money going out of their wage packets and yet the Government will not call them taxes?  This must stop.  I also welcome the fact the Government has invited the Opposition parties to contribute.  However, it must be a real contribution.  There is no point in doing this in a token fashion.  The Government has already taken on a number of ideas my party has put forward, and I would like to see it take on more.  However, its members must interact in a genuine way and not cynically engage in banter across the floors of the Houses.</P>
        <P>Serious questions must be asked about the advice coming from the Department of Finance.  Every single figure that has been announced in either House in the last year and a half has been not just wrong but gigantically wrong.  The T&aacute;naiste said last week there would be no change and that the public finances were fine, but a week later estimates are saying the complete opposite.  This is crazy stuff.  No Government should be run like this.  We must ensure we have the right advice.  If we need further advice let us go and get it, because we need it fairly quickly.</P>
        <P>I would like the Government to make a statement on the national development plan and the prioritisation of projects.  This was touched on previously and I would like an update in this regard from the Deputy Leader if possible.  I am particularly concerned about broadband and where it fits into the plan.  It should be the number one priority.</P>
        <P>I agree with the previous speaker about the role of tourism, which has never been more important to the Irish economy than it is now.  We must protect it.  Whatever cuts are being introduced, I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure they do not affect spending in one of the most valuable sectors of the economy.  Tourism is important across the island, particularly in areas <Col N="320" />facing difficult circumstances due to the regional spread of economic activity.  Investment in tourism should be maintained to ensure the regional distribution of wealth does not change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to ask the Deputy Leader to convey to the Taoiseach and the Ministers travelling to the United States for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day the severe plight of the undocumented Irish there.  I know from a reliable source that many of them are now out of work, and if they show their faces they could end up in jail.  It is becoming very serious because of the major downturn in the American economy.  Similar to what was said by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, if this occasion were used by the Taoiseach and senior Ministers to convey to President Obama the seriousness of the situation, it would be worthwhile.</P>
        <P>I mentioned yesterday the need for a debate on the seafood industry, but I call today for a general debate on the entire fishing industry and in particular the serious plight of trawlermen.  I ascertained last night that among the whitefish fleet, particularly in the west and south, 70% of trawler owners are on interest-only loans, which is very serious.  In view of the 40% reduction in the fishing fleet due to decommissioning, if this were to continue and if the recession were to last three or four years, we would not have any fishing boats or fishermen.</P>
        <P>To give an example, one young fisherman bought a brand new boat in 2004 costing many millions, and with grant support from the Government and the State he ended up with a net bill of &euro;1.5 million, which he hoped would diminish over the years.  Five years later that bill is &euro;1.4 million, he is on an interest-only loan, and he is close to handing over the keys of his house to his bank manager in frustration.  The fishing industry is in crisis.  I reiterate that if help is not provided, in four or five years&rsquo; time we may have to sell our national quotas to the French, the Spanish or the English, because we will have neither fishermen nor vessels.  This is quite serious, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning 1,500 people in Waterford, in a company called Bausch &amp; Lomb, are waiting to see whether they will keep their jobs.  It is estimated that more than 150 jobs will go.  When this company went on short time a couple of months ago, I asked that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment intervene with the company to protect the jobs of the workers.  To the best of my knowledge, that did not happen.  I ask again that the Minister and her officials speak to the company with the aim of protecting the jobs of the remainder of the workforce.</P>
        <P>The company provides excellent employment opportunities and it is essential these jobs are retained for the sake of Waterford and the south east.  It is incumbent on the T&aacute;naiste to meet the management of Bausch &amp; Lomb to discuss the protection of these highly skilled jobs.  It is better to assist a company while it is still operating than to spend a fortune supporting the laid-off workers through social welfare.  The Taoiseach spoke about this, but speaking and acting are two different matters.  I ask for action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that Opposition parties have met officials from the Department of Finance to ascertain the state of the public finances.  The Taoiseach briefed the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party last night and, while we are in no doubt as to the seriousness of our current circumstances, we fully support the Government in its efforts.  Few parties would take the stand we have taken in advance of local and European elections in regard to the grave international crisis we now face. </P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>We must take whatever action is necessary to protect Ireland incorporated.  I am confident that Opposition Members will come on board once they see the books.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, with a view to improving services at social welfare offices for those who must claim unemployment benefits and assistance.  The photograph of queues outside a social welfare office in Cork, which was published in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, is totally unacceptable.  I raised this issue in the 1970s when circumstances were similar and I raise it again today.  I ask the Minister to provide proper facilities for those who apply for unemployment payments.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a variety of premises available to it, such as Citizens Advice Bureau offices, F&Aacute;S buildings and community centres.  Surely it could take an initiative  to avoid the spectacle of upset and depressed people standing in front of their fellow citizens in the rain and cold.  A similar photograph was published last week depicting a queue in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This is happening throughout the country and it is time the Minister took control of the matter and provided facilities which allow people to retain their dignity as they apply for their just entitlements.  The number of unemployed is rising constantly and people are demanding action.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I offer a guarded welcome to the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce a mini-budget at the end of this month.  However, even though there will be relief at this decision, the Government does not deserve great credit.  Its management of the economy and its attitude towards the crisis in the banking sector simply has been to react to the latest disaster or set of figures.  It took the absolutely disastrous set of figures published yesterday to force it to do what it had said it would not do.  The reality is that there is absolute bedlam in the public finances.  They are completely out of control.  If the Government had not acted yesterday, the consequences would have been cataclysmic for various areas of the economy, whether in terms of increased borrowing rates or another run on the banks.  The lack of international confidence in Ireland would have increased.  The Government has run the economy into this situation and it was reluctant to take action until forced to do so.  It is now introducing, under incredible pressure, measures it wanted to delay.</P>
        <P>I caution Opposition leaders against falling into a political trap when they examine the books.  If they look at the books and make suggestions, they will be blamed for the pain that will be inflicted.  The Government is asking for the Opposition&rsquo;s ideas on punishing the Irish people so that it can share the blame.  A cunning, cynical, dangerous game is being played and the Opposition should be careful.  It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to address these problems.  I will ask the Deputy Leader a question now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The trend of the Government has been constantly to find a crutch which would allow it to share the blame.  If it is not the social partners who, God knows, will probably be brought back into the equation in the coming weeks, it is the Opposition that will be the crutch, and therefore I beg Opposition Members to be careful.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s figures indicate we are very close to national bankruptcy if nothing is done.  I urge the Government to take urgent measures now rather than waiting for the next set of figures before responding because all that will do is undermine confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader if we can possibly hold a debate in the Seanad on the budget in advance of its announcement.  Although I am doubtful about it, the Government seems to listen to every dog on the street about the necessary measures, but we are never given the opportunity to outline our views until the budget is published and, therefore, we become irrelevant.  If the <Col N="322" />Government is serious about taking suggestions and a bit of flac, let us hold a debate here in advance of the budget and see whether it takes on board our views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It was previously proposed that the House should hold a debate on the media.  The importance of the freedom of expression enjoyed by a free press in an open society cannot be overstated.  It is essential to democracy, but it also brings obligations and responsibilities.  The media have an ideal opportunity to play a positive, proactive role in resolving the present crisis.  A co-ordinated and co-operative approach is needed if we are to make an early recovery.  We should differentiate between responsible journalism and tabloid and frenzied coverage of economic and other matters.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole put his finger on the pulse of the issue by offering the example of overseas travel by Ministers.  I believe that each of these Ministers would prefer to be at home with their families at that time of the year.  We should not underestimate the importance of Ministers and Government representatives meeting their counterparts abroad, particularly when, as we all accept, we are dealing with a global crisis.  If they do not travel, others will take advantage of the opportunities presented.  It is important we do not adopt a negative attitude towards ministerial travel and I hope the Government does not respond to such negativity.  Members on both sides of the House who have experience in this area will know that much good can be done by such visits.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to the United States, for example, results in images being sent all over the world and officials have an opportunity to interact behind the scenes.  That applies to visits to other countries also.  I suggest we hold a discussion on the media not in a critical manner but to present opportunities for co-operation with them in addressing this crisis, which I think is possible.  I believe many positive minded people in the media, if the current was with them, would respond to this and would do so quickly.  I wish the Ministers the best of luck.  I have no doubt the outcome of their trips abroad will be positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, the Minister for Finance refused in his response to my Adjournment matter to intervene to assist hard pressed fixed-rate mortgage holders.  He also stated that his only role in respect of the banks was to create a regulatory framework, which must be the joke of the century considering how much he failed on that front.  Last night we learned of the introduction of a new budget, with an extra &euro;2 billion hole in the bucket.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is some bucket.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We keep pouring water in only for it to run out the other end.  How much more tax can workers &mdash; middle income earners &mdash; take?  This is a serious issue.  There will be anarchy in this country if workers are continually asked to pay while the Government fails to come up with a job creation strategy.  The only way to plug the hole in the bucket is to put in place a job creation strategy.  The only basis on which I will justify St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day trips abroad is in respect of job creation.  This is not business as usual any longer.  Every Minister should assure the people and this House that they are going abroad on that basis.</P>
        <P>Where is the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment?  She did not intervene to save the jobs at risk in Waterford.  Where is her job creation strategy?  What is she doing?  A week ago she told us our public finances were fine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Healy Eames must put a question to the Deputy Leader.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="323" />
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point last week in this House that although we have a political arrangement with the North we do not have an all-Ireland economy.  We are draining to the North.  The T&aacute;naiste has not addressed this issue and will be a failure unless she puts in place a job creation strategy.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment addresses this House on her strategy to save this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Healy Eames has made her point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the emerging reality of a mini-budget.  I am conscious that support is being sought across the political divide this morning.  Should that divide not be forthcoming, I am certain the Government will continue to do what it must.  I have noticed that debate in this House often focuses on what is happening in Ireland.  It is not acceptable to consider the Irish economy out of the context of the world economy.  We need to balance our books.  I would welcome a strong and decisive move on the part of the Minister for Finance to ensure our finances are brought under control.  This will provide stability and confidence in the markets.  At a time when governments throughout Europe are going around with a cart and asking the financial institutions to bring out their dead, when banks are falling left, right and centre and given the world economy was in serious jeopardy of depression earlier this year, to pretend when debating issues in this House that we live in an economic vacuum is a nonsense.</P>
        <P>I would welcome if the Minister for Social and Family Affairs took the opportunity to come to this House to comment on the great improvements in stamping out fraud.  The measures introduced by the late Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan and implemented by the current Minister have saved the taxpayer &euro;450 million.  The people calling for the elimination of waste and fraud in social welfare are the same people calling for the introduction of measures to eliminate the need for people to sign-on.  While it will take time to get our offices in order, social welfare fraud and abuse must be eliminated.  This means people will have to sign on.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the call yesterday by the leader of the Green Party and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, for Ireland to withdraw from the European Defence Agency, a call I have been making for a long time, in particular since that group, which coyly changed its name from the European Armaments Group, is interested in the manufacture of armaments and in developing an export industry to go into competition with the United States.  This, in my opinion, explains some of the energy with which Mr. Ganley prosecutes his opposition to the Lisbon treaty.  If the Government does withdraw from the European Defence Agency, and I understand there will be a Cabinet meeting today on the matter although the Government has unscrupulously avoided this issue and has not responded to my questions on it for the past 18 months resulting in my having to oppose the Lisbon treaty, I and other people will be permitted, as we want, to campaign in favour of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>With regard to the budget, like a rose, a budget by any other name would smell as sweet or as sour.  We must listen carefully to suggestions from all quarters, including Fintan O&rsquo;Toole who made a compelling case for an examination of tax relief on pensions.  The current cost of this tax relief is up to &euro;2 billion, which is a luxury.  This measure should be examined.</P>
        <P>We ought to discuss also the report of Transparency International, a motion on which I tabled a few days ago and which is listed as No. 22, motion 35 on the Order Paper today.  The Deputy Leader appeared yesterday to be open to providing time for such a discussion.  I am <Col N="324" />not particularly proprietorial and do not necessarily believe we should discuss my motion but we should consider the issues involved.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Deputy Leader will indicate when the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 will come to this House.  This is nasty, badly drafted and politically corrupt legislation which badly needs to be examined.  The Government should take on board the call by the Ombudsman, Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, that her office be given a role in monitoring the processes by which this is applied.  I point out in support of that argument that the Irish Human Rights Commission, even in the state to which it has been reduced by the nasty operations of this Government, and Mr. Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Human Rights Commissioner, have advocated this and have indicated that Ireland is unusual in Europe in not permitting these areas to be examined.  It is astonishing that the person who dismissed this out of hand is a spokesperson for the Department of Finance.  If the Department of Finance, which as various speakers have said cannot get the figures right even occasionally, is to be supreme in terms of human rights, we are in trouble.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call from Senator Ross for a substantial debate next week on the economic issues facing this country.  It is important Members of this House have an opportunity, in advance of the introduction of the mini-budget, to examine in detail the options facing the Government and the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that too many of us believe we are playing a game of politics rather than undertaking a full examination of the crisis facing this country, which is in the last chance saloon.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not concerned about traps being laid by Government.  What is involved is much more important.  Politically speaking, the public has made an irreversible decision in respect of the current Government.  We on this side of the House are challenged to rise to the occasion and to respond to this grave national crisis.  The man and woman on the street do not concern themselves with who is implementing measures.  They want serious political attention to be given to the financial and economic distress faced by tens of thousands of people.  I welcome the opportunity for Opposition parties to bring forth ideas, suggestions and proposals.</P>
        <P>Many people on this side of the House and in Opposition in the other House hope to be part of the next Administration running this country.  We must rise to the challenge and illustrate what we would do and how we would do it differently.  I look forward to a debate next week or the following week when all issues will be up for discussion and we can outline some of the options and choices we would make.  We must cast aside political difference and party political fears.  It is not an exaggeration to say the country is going down the tubes before our eyes.  I have been fortunate enough to be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for over 20 years, as have a number of my colleagues and never in those 20 years, or in the history of the State, have we faced such a crisis.  We celebrated the 90th anniversary of the first D&aacute;il some weeks ago, but what we now face is the end of genuine Irish economic independence unless substantial decisions are taken very soon.</P>
        <P>I am not worried about the party political side of the equation, I am gravely concerned about the state of the economy and the future of the country.  This House has a major reflective role to play.  We need to debate for a full week, sooner rather than later, the economic options facing the country.  As Senator Ross said, a post-budget debate is a waste of time.  It is the sort of political practice and gamesmanship that has got us into the mess we are in.  Let us all work <Col N="325" />together and debate this issue next week.  Let us be realistic.  If not, we might as well shut down this House and go home.</P>

	<P>I welcome the announcement of the mini-budget or whatever the Government will call it.  I also welcome the Government&rsquo;s inclusive approach in indicating that it will brief the Opposition on budgetary figures.  That is very important, although Senator Ross is right that there is a danger for the Opposition in being brought in too closely.  Deputy Joan Burton&rsquo;s call for the publication of the interim papers from the Commission on Taxation to enable Opposition and Government Members to see what the commission proposes to do is a useful recommendation to explore.  I echo the calls of other speakers for a debate on the economy in advance of whatever mini-budget or tax increases we face. </P>
        <P>On a more positive note, I was privileged to play a part in ensuring that we unanimously passed a cross-party motion calling for the release of Ingrid Betancourt.  Will the Deputy Leader consider issuing an invitation from the Seanad to Ingrid Betancourt to address this House?  Her release was one of the more positive items of news in the past few gloomy months.  FARC is, unfortunately, still holding other hostages and it would be a celebration of her release to invite Ingrid Betancourt, as a former Senator from Colombia, to speak to us.  It would also serve a very useful purpose of highlighting the plight of the hostages still held in appalling conditions in Colombia, who do not have the profile that she had.  Hearing her speak would put our troubles in context.</P>
        <P>I had the privilege of sharing a platform with Archbishop Tutu recently at a meeting in Trinity College where he pointed out, very memorably, that people in South Africa wish they had our economic troubles.  To hear a speaker from Colombia &mdash; I have heard her speak with passion and eloquence since her release &mdash; who was imprisoned for years in conditions that threatened her health and her life, and who was deprived of the company of her family, would be inspiring and would be a very nice gesture on the part of the Seanad.  I would welcome the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s thoughts on that suggestion.</P>

I would welcome an all-party debate in this House to put all our heads together.  I am sure many ideas would come from the other side that I would like and many I would not like.  Members across the floor might perhaps welcome suggestions we could put forward.  We should have that ongoing debate as soon as possible.  I do not want the International Monetary Fund to decide how best we can do business.  We must sort this out for ourselves and we will do so.  We did it before and we will do it again. </P>

	<P>It is not a mini-budget that the Government intends to introduce, it is a crisis budget, which is caused by bad management.  The new unemployment figures show that 10.4% of our citizens, a record high of 354,000 people, are unemployed this morning.  Our <Col N="326" />fellow citizens have been let down.  I ask the Deputy Leader as a matter of urgency to hold an all-party debate on what is best for the country.  If the Government really wants co-operation and bipartisanship, let us see it and stop the rhetoric and cn&aacute;imhse&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to the House because it is a disgrace and an abomination that the national carer&rsquo;s strategy has been deferred or postponed?  It is a gross insult to the 160,000 people who care for our fellow citizens.  Why is the strategy not going ahead?  Why not publish the document and discuss and consult on it?  What is wrong with that?  The excellent work of our carers saves the State &euro;2.1 billion per year.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader hold a debate next week on the promotion of Ireland for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day?  If the Government is serious about the promotion of Ireland and the rekindling of the Celtic nation, the Deputy Leader should invite the leaders of our party, the Independent Group and the Labour Party, and the party leaders in the other House to go across the world with Ministers on behalf of Ireland.  If the Government really wants to promote Ireland it should invite Deputies Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore to the White House too and let us collectively promote Ireland.  Senator Healy Eames is right that we should focus on job creation and job protection, not the rhetoric of empty vessels from the other side of the House.</P>

        <P>I welcome Senator Bradford&rsquo;s calm, balanced approach and I look forward to seeing the fruits of that when we debate the crisis.

Can I ask the Deputy Leader to organise a debate in which Senators can call on other regulatory bodies to conduct some of their fitness <Col N="327" />to practise inquiries in public, as the Medical Council is doing?

	<P>A Japanese businessman once said to me that if Japan had a product like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, it would use it to increase Japan&rsquo;s profile, give more opportunities to Japanese businesses and bring more success to the Japanese economy.  Therefore, I support Senators O&rsquo;Toole and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who have said we should not ignore the great opportunities for success offered to us by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  We should not be afraid to go abroad and take advantage of the occasion of our national holiday.  I do not agree with those who suggest the T&aacute;naiste is in a position to &ldquo;create&rdquo; jobs.  Her job, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is to develop an environment in which jobs can be created by others.  When I hear that the Government is trying to &ldquo;create&rdquo; jobs, I have some fears.  We should recognise the opportunities afforded to us by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, we should make it clear that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day may be used to improve Ireland&rsquo;s profile and encourage investment in this country.</P>
        <P>I support part of what Senator Ross said to the Deputy Leader.  We need a debate on the economy before the budget is announced.  In the past, such debates have usually taken place immediately after the budget, which is too late.  We want to debate these matters now.  If a business suddenly discovered it was about to have problems paying wages at the end of the week or the end of the month, that would be a crisis.  That is the sort of crisis we have at the moment.  We need to avoid the danger of State cheques bouncing over the coming year.  We need to take steps.  I do not accept the point made by Senator Ross about an issue on which Senator Bradford is correct.  When the Government faced a crisis in 1987, the Opposition said it would support any tough steps it decided to take.  I strongly accept Senator Bradford&rsquo;s words on this matter.</P>

While they can be pointed out, we should not spend too much time on them.  We should look to the future.  If we are to get out of this crisis, we should not just take short-term steps.  We need measures that will help us in the short term without damaging us in the long term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the view that we should have a week-long pre-budget discussion.  The best propositions that emerge during the debate should be taken into account when the budget is being drawn up.  When we examine the grave crisis that is developing on foot of the fall in the Exchequer returns, we cannot escape the reality that last year&rsquo;s decision to increase the rate of VAT has led to an exodus of shoppers across the Border and overseas.  I ask the Deputy Leader to take that on board and raise it with the Minister for Finance.  While it is difficult to quantify the huge drop that has taken place, I suggest it needs to be factored into the discussions that will take place over the next few weeks.  We need to estimate the degree to which the increase in the rate of VAT led to the haemorrhage of money out of this country over the last couple of months.  On the basis of my personal experience, having observed the queues in towns like Newry and Enniskillen, I suggest the increase in the VAT <Col N="328" />rate contributed significantly to the reduction in the Exchequer returns.  The own goal we may have scored needs to be analysed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decrease in energy charges, for which I had been calling for a long time.  I contend that the question of price control needs to be examined critically.  If we can make changes that generate more spending, that will have a positive effect on the Exchequer returns.  The issue of waste in this country, which was mentioned earlier, also needs to be analysed.  A tighter auditing process is needed.  Those who work in this country&rsquo;s extraordinary and excellent native Civil Service were recruited from schools and universities through the most rigorous processes.  Our Civil Service has been supplanted and overcome by a network of ministerial advisers.  The jobs of many civil servants are now being done by extra personnel in the offices of Ministers of State.  A whole phalanx of people are doing work that should be done by the native Civil Service, which has the genius to do it.  The immediate elimination of that nonsense would save significant money.  That critically needs to be considered.  If we eliminate waste and fraud in a number of areas and tighten auditing processes throughout the country, enormous savings can be made.  While I am calling generally for an overall debate at this time, I can give the Deputy Leader some specific examples when I speak to him privately later today.  A focused debate needs to take place over the course of a week.  We should all come up with practical suggestions.  I have cited a couple of examples.  Many more will be thrown up if we have a week-long debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Most, if not all, Senators, referred to yesterday&rsquo;s Exchequer returns.  Several Senators suggested we should have an anticipatory debate on possible budgetary measures.  Many speakers speculated on the Government actions that will be taken after the Opposition parties and the social partners have been consulted.  On the question of whether the actions in question constitute a budget, I think it is clear to say that it is a rose by any other name.  Even before the onset of the current economic crisis, it had long been suggested that the theatre of the Budget Statement, as an annual event during which all decisions on taxation and social welfare are announced, needed to be changed.  As I recall, Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesman on finance, Deputy Bruton, suggested in a reform paper that the era of the annual budget needed to pass into history.  I agree that all Governments need to have the flexibility to anticipate events, to react to them as they happen and to introduce new fiscal measures on foot of them.</P>
        <P>The reality is that Exchequer returns are produced monthly rather than daily or weekly.  The returns for February 2009, which were published yesterday, when taken in addition to those for January 2009, show there has been a decrease of &euro;1.8 billion in anticipated tax receipts for the first two months of the year.  If we factor them across an entire year, it is clear that a gaping hole will need to be addressed.  The statement made by the Government yesterday, that further measures will be needed by the end of this month, represented the first step in that process.  Certain measures are needed in the taxation area.  I am confident that following the report of the Commission on Taxation, which is examining wider aspects of taxation policy, including equity and efficiency, we will have a taxation system that is much fairer than the system we have at present.  It has to be put into context.  The percentage of national income accounted for by tax receipts is far smaller in this country than in most other European countries.  The relevant figure in Ireland is approximately 35%, whereas it is over 40% in most European countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about stealth taxes?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="329" />
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Some Scandinavian countries collect up to 50% of their national income in taxes.  The level of tax a state collects determines the level and quality of public services it has.  Not only do we need to bridge the gap in current public expenditure, but the issue of taxation needs to be addressed by all political parties if we want to develop a better society and increase the quality of public services.  Those who think that some elements of our tax system are unfair believe there should be a focus on how the tax burden is distributed.  The Exchequer figures published yesterday show income tax receipts have fallen by 7% and that there has been a huge decrease in value added tax receipts.  Our system of taxation should be reformed so we are less reliant on taxes such as VAT and stamp duty on the purchase of property.  We should concentrate on ensuring the tax burden is more fairly distributed across a range of taxes.  There needs to be proper equity within the taxation system.</P>
        <P>Some 28% of workers pay no income tax.  Our higher rate for very high income earners is relatively low.  As interim measures, I hope these areas will be addressed and will help with the shortfall we have in the meantime.  An anticipatory debate on the budget would be very good.  The Government and the country would benefit from the collective wisdom in this House and it should contribute to the necessary debate.  I will see what is possible in that regard.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the question of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day trips by Ministers.  The number of trips will probably be smaller than in previous years, but the focus of those trips will be aimed very much towards attracting investment into the country and selling the country as a destination for goods and services and for the establishment of new industries.  A secondary element to these trips is to recognise, identify and support Irish communities abroad.  It is our national holiday and that is an important function of Government representatives when travelling abroad.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the question of the undocumented Irish finding themselves in an economic bind because of the scale of the recession in the United States, and this needs to be added to yesterday&rsquo;s calls for a particular debate and approach from the Irish Government in addressing these needs.  He also asked about the white fish fleet and the financial situation of many boat owners who are able to pay only the interest on very substantial loans and the effect that has on coastal communities.  This needs to be taken into account because we need to develop and support a fishing industry for our economic future.  Senator Kelly also made that point on the development of the tourism industry and time can be given for a debate on it in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins asked about the situation in Bausch &amp; Lomb and his concerns will be passed on to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Government made a policy decision to establish a &euro;100 million fund to protect existing jobs and I presume this is one of the areas where the fund will have an effect.  Returning to the general debate on the Exchequer returns, Senators Ross and Bradford made several statements.  Senator Bradford made a largely positive contribution, but the use of phrases such as &ldquo;national bankruptcy&rdquo;, &ldquo;last chance saloon&rdquo; and &ldquo;going down the tubes&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It might help the individuals concerned, but we heard a very positive comment this week from the President of the European Central Bank, who talked about our general ability to work ourselves out of this crisis.  That international view is the type of signal we should be working on.  If we keep going in the direction we have been taking on lower tax receipts and inability to meet the gap, we might come close to the types of situations indicated by those Senators, but it is far from fair to indicate that we are there now or to create an impression that there is an air of hopelessness about this.  I have faith in the ability of the <Col N="330" />people to meet the economic challenges ahead but it can be done only in a non-partisan, non-point scoring way.  If we have this anticipated debate it will be a forum to allow such views to be expressed.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked for a debate on media responsibility which follows from a number of requests made yesterday, and time should be provided to allow that to happen.  Senator Healy Eames talked about mortgage protection.  She should be aware that in the recapitalisation legislation passed by these Houses there is a provision that over a 12-month period there will be no repossessions.  This morning there is a direct meeting between the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, representatives of the Irish Banking Federation, the Financial Regulator and other interests to see how this can be pursued to ensure it has a practical effect and that the fear of house repossessions does not hang over many of our citizens.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin, Leyden and Buttimer mentioned social welfare services and social welfare fraud.  Several points need to be brought to the attention of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and provide the basis for a wide-ranging debate in this House.  The unacceptable delay in new entrants to the job seeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit has been caused by the numbers of people losing their jobs.  Since the beginning of this year 1,000 people per day have lost their jobs.  That represents 3% of those who were at work, and the scale of that to be dealt with by social welfare officers has caused the Minister to transfer civil servants from other Departments to deal with the applications.  It is hoped the new system will ensure the benefits are given as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris talked about the European Defence Agency and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s views on that issue.  In developing a rolling declaration that would become a protocol in a future European Union treaty for the accession of a country such as Iceland or Croatia, the issue of foreign and security policy may convince a significant number of people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the last referendum to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; subsequently.  The Minister&rsquo;s comments were an effort to inform that.  Senator Norris also mentioned Transparency International, which was referred to yesterday, and there is no difficulty about a debate on that.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill awaits Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and will come to this House once it is finished there.  Senator Norris referred to comments by the Ombudsman seeking a role in that area, and legislation about upgrading the functions of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office is pending, so we will have two opportunities to examine that area in discussing legislation in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik asked about publication of the Commission on Taxation report, which will be very helpful in the next year in defining what we should be doing regarding taxation.  If there are completed papers, they can and should be made public and that will help our immediate situation.  She also made a very helpful suggestion on using the debates we have had in this House in support of Ms Ingrid Betancourt&rsquo;s plight and the adversity she faced as an individual as an example to this country in difficult times.  Considering some of the negative comments that were made today, it is fair to say we live on a planet where one third of the population lives on less than $2 per day.  Despite the fall in economic growth and growing unemployment, this is still a very rich country in global terms and we need to be reminded of that from time to time.  The mechanism for a request such as Senator Bacik&rsquo;s is the Cathaoirleach and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I am sure the committee will look favourably on that.</P>

	<P>Senator Buttimer talked about the unemployment figures and the promotion of Ireland through St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  He also referred to the carers strategy.  The post<Col N="331" />ponement of the carers strategy is based on the fact that the production of the document to date is far from satisfactory.  It does not meet the future needs of carers and it needs to be considerably revamped.  There will be a future document.  I have no indication on when that will be prepared but I will try to get that information to Senator Buttimer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Feeney talked about the willingness of self-regulating bodies to hold fitness to practise hearings in public, commending the example of the Medical Council.  We dealt with the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill 2008 yesterday.  There were calls yesterday as well that we have a debate about regulation in general and a debate on that area might bring this point to the fore.  The Senator repeated a call made several times that there should be a debate on eating disorders, which I will bring to the Leader&rsquo;s attention when he returns.</P>
        <P>In line with the contributions of other Members, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly made the suggestion, which may be something we must consider, that the structure of an anticipated debate on budgetary measures that are needed might have to take place over several days.

        <P FLI="0">This could essentially be described as a drafting amendment.  It seeks to amend the section that deals with the interpretation of the term &ldquo;Hague Convention&rdquo;.  The Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Hague Convention&rdquo; means the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, 1993, the text of which, subjection to <i>subsection (3)</i>, is set out for convenience of reference in <i>Schedule 2</i>;...</P>
        <P FLI="0">My amendment is that it should include the words &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;text&rdquo; in line 3 for the simple reason that only the English text of the Hague Convention is annexed but there is also a French text, which is equally authentic.</P>
        <P>The concluding paragraph of the convention, which is on page 116 of the Bill, states the convention was &ldquo;Done at the Hague, on the 29th day of May 1993, in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authentic&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We in this country are used, by way of interpretation, to having regard to the Irish language as well as the English language, preferring the Irish language constitutionally.  It is not the same point but, by analogy, we should also have regard to the fact that there is a French language version of the Hague Convention which the Bill declares to be equally authentic.  I see no reason we could not include the words &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo; because the reference in the section of which we speak is to the English language text rather than to both.</P>

	<P>Senator Alex White drew an analogy between the constitutional position regarding Irish and English and the reference at the back of the Bill to French and English, but it is understood that the English version is the one that is to be interpreted in the event of a dispute.  I argue that it is a given that such would be the case.</P><Col N="332" />
        <P>There is no constitutional position of the French language whatsoever.  The entire Bill is in English.  English is one of the recognised languages under the Constitution.  The fact of it being in the English language is understood.  It is a presumption, if you like.</P>
        <P>If it is of any comfort to the Senator, if he feels that problems may arise in the future, it is something at which we can have a look prior to Report Stage, as with any of these amendments.  However, I am satisfied the proposed amendment is not necessary and that the English language is understood in this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It has been 16 years since Ireland signed the Hague Convention.  That is quite a long time gap.  That may explain one point which I find interesting.  The Minister of State spoke persuasively about the power and significance of the English version.  Then there was the matter of the French version.  I wonder is there an Irish version of the Hague Convention.  This would predate the position where, as a result of Government advocacy, the Irish language became one of the necessary languages of the European Community and a horde of translators was employed.</P>
        <P>The reason I ask is because the Minister of State also raised the question of the constitutional provisions.  Of course, as he will be aware only too well as a fine lawyer, if there is a conflict between the English version of the Constitution and the Irish version, the Irish version prevails.</P>
        <P>This is an aspect of the matter.  Senator White was worrying about French but we do not even know whether there is a version of the Hague Convention in our own language.  If there is, presumably, by analogy with the constitutional position, it would be the Irish version, not either the English or the French version, that would prevail in law.  It is an academic point but in a way the entire debate on this Stage is academic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I may be responsible for taking us down the road of that perhaps not significantly helpful analogy as between the Irish and English languages if an issue arises in terms of what the Constitution means.  The point we are making in this amendment is a somewhat narrower one, that if one refers to the Hague Convention in the interpretation section of the Bill, it states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Hague Convention&rdquo; means the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, 1993, the text [I suggest, &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo;] of which, subjection to <i>subsection (3)</i>, is set out for convenience...</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is merely for the sake of completeness.  Schedule 2 acknowledges &ldquo;both texts being equally authentic&rdquo;.  We are incorporating the convention into Irish law by way of this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the last page of the Bill, it states that both texts are equally authentic.  That is fine, nobody disagrees with that.  All the amendment does is state that when we speak about the Hague Convention, we mean the convention set out in Schedule 2 in English.  It also exists in French and if anybody wants to refer to it in French, he or she can go off and refer to it in French, take it out of the library or whatever.  Simply for the sake of completeness, all it states is that what one will see in Schedule 2 is the English language version of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Alex White is trying to anticipate where there might be a conflict in the future and where there might be a possibility of two interpretations arising from the two languages, French and English.  There can be no doubt that English, being a constitutional language in this country, is the language in which it will be interpreted in the event of that happening.  As I stated, I will look at this matter again and we can revisit it on Report Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State that it will be looked at again.  I may have taken us down something of a siding on the interpretation point.  I accept what the Minister of State says.  There is an issue about the version of the convention to which we should have regard and I agree it would clearly be the English version.  This, however, is more of a drafting amendment and does not anticipate a problem with interpretation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be dangerous to include a line such as this because wherever legislation incorporates the text of a convention, it is always in English.  If we start stipulating in express terms &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo; in a section such as this in one Bill, the danger is that in other legislation where we have not inserted that phrase, a lawyer in the years to come might claim the French text is the definitive version.  It is a technical point but it might be dangerous to start including this if it has not been the practice heretofore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister of State has said he will look at the issue again.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 50 are related to amendment No. 2 and they will be taken together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, line 30, after &ldquo;Convention&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;and includes an adoption from a country other than one a party to the Hague Convention or a bilateral agreement if the Authority considers that the adoption can be effected from a third country in a manner compatible with this Act&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This issue that arises from widespread concern expressed by those with an interest in adoption.  The general response to what is being achieved with this important and comprehensive legislation has been welcoming.  The Hague Convention clearly transposed into our law the basis for inter-country adoption.  The codification of all of the previous legislation going back to the 1950s is welcome and I commend the Minister of State and his officials on the extraordinary work that has been done in putting this Bill together.</P>
        <P>Concerns still remain, however, about countries that will not be covered by the Hague Convention.  I am not for a moment saying we should not promote, improve and uphold international standards.  That is the point of the convention.  It requires a high level of scrutiny on adoptions across the board.  The whole point of the convention is that it be applied as the basis for inter-country adoptions.</P>
        <P>Inevitably there will be countries from which Irish people wish to adopt children that will not be in a position to fall within the remit of the Hague Convention.  The easy answer to that is that if we are to apply an international standard, it must be that set out in the Hague Convention, and if a country does not meet that standard, so be it.  No one, however, would want to dispose of human situations in that way.  Every time a law is made, there will be hard cases and exceptions, especially in such a human area.  Our concern, which is shared by many of the adoption associations, is that countries such as Russia, Vietnam and Ethiopia, could fall outside the requirements in the convention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bilateral agreements can be made with these countries.  Currently the bilateral agreement with Vietnam is in the process of being renegotiated.  We are aware that Vietnam has become a popular country for Irish applicants because it follows model practice promoted by the Adop<Col N="334" />tion Board, the Health Service Executive and the Minister of State&rsquo;s office.  The Minister of State has indicated his support for a new bilateral agreement to replace the agreement that expires in April.  The Department has yet to send a draft agreement, however, through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Vietnamese authorities.  The time is now critical for this new agreement given the situation in which many people find themselves.  We do not want a hiatus to cause a collapse in adoptions from Vietnam, depriving 20 or more families and children of the opportunity to live in loving and secure environments.  Ultimately those children might never be adopted if there is a delay in the application by Irish authorities on this urgent issue.</P>
        <P>Other countries have established bilateral agreements with Russia so there are precedents and a willingness on the part of the Russians to enter bilateral agreements.  There are hundreds of thousands of children in orphanages in Russia and we should not close Irish homes to them.  Standards must be applied but that is what the convention seeks to do and that is what the Minister of State wants to achieve.</P>
        <P>Recent analysis of adoption law in Ethiopia deemed the regime there compatible with Irish law.  Why then is there a hold up in the establishment of a bilateral agreement with that country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment.  Like other Senators, I received information from the International Adoption Association that highlighted its concerns in respect of children who have been adopted or who may be adopted in future by Irish parents from countries without bilateral agreements but where they are being prepared but are not yet concluded, particularly Vietnam, Ethiopia and Russia.</P>
        <P>In excess of 1,000 children have already been adopted from Russia.  There is, however, a concern among the members of the association that because agreements are in the process of being finalised and because the Bill is proceeding with such haste, these countries might fall outside the terms of the Act as currently drafted.  This is a useful amendment to cover that instance, not in any way by lowering the standards that must apply in any inter-country adoption but ensuring countries with which bilateral agreements are being concluded but are not yet concluded may still be covered if the authority considers that the adoption can be effected in a manner compatible with this Bill.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are detailed provisions on the bilateral agreement arrangements in sections 73 to 80 of the Bill.  This amendment does not serve to undermine those but includes in the definition section a recognition that there may be a shortfall in time with some of these countries and recognises that there are already families in Ireland who may be in the process of concluding individual arrangements with children in other countries, notably siblings.  Families who have already adopted a child have a real concern that in future they might not be able to adopt siblings.  I know that other provisions cover this matter, but it is an important amendment to the definition of the section.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik, especially her final remarks.  It would be cruel to inhibit the adoption of a sibling because adopted children, particularly if they are of a particular age group, can often be bereft and in need of support even though they may be placed in a positive family.  Concern has been expressed to me about Vietnamese adoptions and, in fact, people have even indicated their concern that the Department is not serious about meeting the requirements within the timeframe.  After the debate on Second Stage I had further communications with people who said they did not take the Minister of State&rsquo;s assurances <Col N="335" />seriously.  I would like to provide him with this opportunity to strengthen his response in this area.</P>
        <P>In a general profile, this section examines inter-country adoptions and three different scenarios are created.  First, there is the domestic adoption of Irish-resident children, which is not the subject of this amendment.  Second, there are inter-country adoptions effected outside the State and, third, inter-country adoptions requiring subsequent domestic adoptions.  That reflects the current situation but the approach to certain provisions applicable to domestic adoptions could undermine the completion of inter-country adoptions effected abroad.  For example, without prejudice to the provisions that concern the rights of fathers and the religion of parents, the treatment of these could have the effect of rendering inter-country adoptions which require subsequent domestic adoption incapable of being completed.  This amendment addresses the point about the third country in a manner compatible with the Bill.</P>
        <P>As it stands, the legislation contains impediments, for example, the ability of assessed and qualified applicants to provide loving and secure homes to children in need from other countries.  There is ambiguity over the ability of Irish adoptive parents to complete such legal proceedings on their return which could result in foreign authorities declining Irish applications despite the laws in such countries being fully complied with.  This would be contrary also to the essence of the Hague Convention whereby contracting states are obliged to accept adoptions completed under the laws of other contracting states.</P>
        <P>We have a situation therefore where there are millions of children in institutions throughout the world, a comparatively small number of which &mdash; about 30,000 &mdash; are internationally adopted.  Ireland has about 400 of these, yet we have this continuing inhibition contained in the legislation which is worth highlighting.  That is covered by the phrase in amendment No. 2 which states that &ldquo;the adoption can be effected from a third country in a manner compatible with this Act&rdquo;.  These issues arise from that matter.  As the Bill stands, we have a situation whereby there can be at least the initiation and partial completion of an adoption with these third countries but that is dependent upon a subsequent finding of the High Court in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  I brought the legislation to the attention of a number of my friends and constituents who are either adoptive parents or hope to adopt.  One of the issues they raised strongly with me was the fact that countries outside the Hague Convention would become almost exclusion zones as far as the adoption procedure is concerned.  What I have heard from my colleagues is important in the sense that they are not trying to reduce the bar.  They want the standards and conditions applicable to the Hague Convention to be the set standard, but they want prospective parents to have the opportunity to adopt children from countries outside the Hague Convention zone.  I support that concept.  We are probably not talking about very many such adoptions.  However, we must recognise that the possibility of the door being shut firmly in respect of a number of countries arising from their non-participation in the Hague Convention is a negative aspect in the legislation.  The amendment would provide for the inclusion of such countries with the highest possible standards being applicable.  I hope the Minister of State will reflect favourably on this amendment.  It is one area of the Bill that has been brought to my attention by a number of concerned persons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise a couple of issues concerning these amendments and perhaps the Minister of State can cast some light on the situation.  First, it is disgraceful that people are wondering whether or when the bilateral agreements will be concluded.  If this matter was clarified it would relieve much anxiety for people who, for example, want to adopt children from different countries, including Vietnam.  People are genuinely concerned about this.  I will quote from a letter I received, which stated: &ldquo;This is a massive blow to us, as we are registered with the mediation agency whose applications will effectively be put on hold from <Col N="336" />April 1st.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister of State can update the House on this situation.  People are saying the Vietnamese Government has told the Irish authorities it will cease to accept adoption dossiers from Ireland from 1 April.  Is that accurate or has the situation been updated?  I hope it has, but if it has not it is unacceptable that people are left to worry that their applications will not go ahead because, for some technical reasons, we have not concluded the bilateral agreements.  The Minister of State should clarify the current situation, what his intentions are and what other countries he will deal with through bilateral agreements.  That would be helpful.  These amendments seek to remove the uncertainty that exists currently, albeit unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on standards and building flexibility into the legislation.  The Bill requires some flexibility because Irish families may wish to adopt children from countries which, for a variety of reasons, have not signed up to the Hague Convention.  Does the Minister of State envisage that some flexibility will be built into the legislation in this way while keeping the highest standards?  I fully recognise there are downsides to this which is why I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views.  What is the international situation with regard to this matter?  Have other countries that have signed the Hague Convention continued to allow some flexibility so that people can adopt children from non-contracting states?  Will that flexibility apply to our legislation in future?</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 50 proposes one way of dealing with the points that have been raised.  It would allow the adoption authority to make an exception.  The authority could assess whether an exception was required or desirable, having regard to various factors, but ensuring the standards continued to be met.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about these amendments.  Can he outline the Government&rsquo;s intention concerning the issues I have raised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole point of this Bill is to facilitate families in Ireland who can provide a loving and secure home for children, many of whom are in institutions and would benefit from a good home, to do so.  I speak in favour of these amendments.  Some 78% of families in Ireland seeking to adopt children want to do so from countries that have not signed the Hague Convention or countries with which Ireland does not have bilateral agreements.  We adopt approximately 400 children annually, which means that about 300 such babies potentially could be denied adoption unless we insert this important amendment.  Every month, 20 babies are adopted from Vietnam which equates to 240 babies a year.  It is critical a new agreement is put in place by 1 April.</P>
        <P>I know what it is like to have to wait for an adoption baby from abroad.  I would hate to think any hold-up in the process was due to some lack of action on the part of my Government.</P>
        <P>I agree with the urgency of securing the bilateral agreement with Vietnam.  I support the amendment to enter new bilateral agreements with Ethiopia and Russia, or at the very least to allow adoptions with these countries continue.</P>
        <P>I also support the proposal concerning the adoption of siblings from non-Hague Convention countries.  It has been well-documented that adopted children seek out other children in their own likeness.  It gives them a sense of belonging.  It is important we do not reject this amendment or else the supply of foreign adoption babies to Ireland will be cut off.  It would also prevent parents from adopting the siblings, or even nationals, of their already adopted children.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State that it is important we support standards set by the Hague Convention.  However, when I first adopted in 1994, I was counselled under that convention, not knowing that it was not law.  Since then the Adoption Board has been following the Hague Convention, even though it was technically not in force.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of these amendments, particularly in the case of adopting siblings, is worthy, one with which I am sure the Minister of State agrees.  It may well be that the words used, technically, are not quite correct for the legislation.  I do not know why as they seem fine to me.  If the Minister of State is unable to accept the amendments as they are, it is possible to achieve the same objective by changing the text to address his concerns.</P>
        <P>I was not aware, until Senator Healy Eames stated it, that 78% of adoptions are from non-Hague Convention countries.  It concerns me a great deal because I assumed adoptions from Russia, Vietnam and Ethiopia were exceptions.  I hope the Minister of State will accept these worthy amendments in some form or other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Concerning my earlier comments on the Department&rsquo;s attitude regarding Vietnamese adoptions, there seems to be a certain amount of confusion.  The closing of the existing bilateral agreement was triggered by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  That was in spite of a general acceptance that the Vietnamese experience has been a model one and was promoted as such by the Adoption Board.  On top of this, despite the positive remarks the Minister of State made during the debate, he has not yet sent a draft of the new agreement to Vietnam.  I accept he made a successful and positive trip to Vietnam before Christmas but this agreement expires in less than two months.  My colleagues have also raised concerns about agreements with Ethiopia and Russia and the possible adoption of siblings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this important area.  It has occupied much of my time in preparing this legislation over the past six months.  I have had many discussions with the Adoption Association and many parents who approached me in my constituency office and elsewhere on this matter.  I have received many e-mails from parents concerned about the situation, particularly as it applies to Vietnam.</P>
        <P>I have enormous sympathy with those parents because they have come through a long and personal process.  For many, it began with approaching the HSE to apply for adoption.  While there is a necessary element to the process with due diligence required, much of it is regrettably prolonged unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>I understand the huge frustration expressed by adoptive parents on achieving a bilateral agreement with Vietnam and other countries.  The Hague Convention, however, has at its core the protection of children rather than the protection of parents&rsquo; rights.  While this is putting it bluntly, it is understood and no one will argue with that.  It is important to place that as a central principle in this debate.</P>
        <P>Some questions were raised about the safety of adoptions from Vietnam with the United States and Sweden preventing any further adoptions from the country.  We began the process of rolling over the existing agreement or securing a second agreement by 1 May.  The Government made a decision to negotiate a new agreement on my recommendation in December, following a visit by members of my office and the Adoption Board to Vietnam.  I hope this week to send a draft agreement to the Vietnamese Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I have communicated this to the Adoption Association and other interested bodies.  It will be up to the Vietnamese Government to agree to the draft.  Hopefully, we will be in a position to settle this issue before the deadline.</P>
        <P>We did encourage prospective adopting parents to identify with Vietnam, as it is a country in which we have confidence.  While I sympathise with their concerns about the agreement, I ask them to keep their nerve on this.  The Government is determined to reach an agreement with the Vietnamese authorities.  Its policy is based on solid and sound investigations of the Vietnamese adoption process.  We are fortunate enough to have an agency on the ground to <Col N="338" />assure us about this, unlike other countries which have too many, and have a secure system in place.</P>
        <P>Senators have been calling for a parallel system for countries that have not signed up to the Hague Convention or those with which we do not have a bilateral agreement.  We have gone to enormous trouble to get a bilateral agreement with Vietnam and we will do so again with Russia and Ethiopia.  If we were to create an alternative mechanism that would operate outside the principles of the Hague Convention in respect of adoptions from countries which, for whatever reason, cannot sign up to that convention or with which we do not have bilateral agreements, it would dilute what we are attempting in this Bill.  We cannot anticipate developments in this regard.</P>
        <P>We are seeking to enter a new era with regard to adoption in this country.  The Bill is the product of a lengthy consultation period which commenced in 1993, when we signed the Hague Convention.  The initial intention was to transpose the latter into Irish law but it was then decided to consolidate the principal Act and the various amendments relating thereto into the legislation before the House.</P>
        <P>Having learned from the mistakes made in other countries, engaged in an extremely lengthy period and received the views of all interested parties, we want to create a new structure under which there will be a solid grounding for adoption and in respect of which concrete minimum standards that are complaint with the Hague Convention will apply.  The Government has given this matter all due consideration and any dilution of the central principles I have outlined would weaken the Bill.</P>
        <P>We are moving forward and trying to put in place further bilateral agreements.  Adoptions of Russian children will be able to proceed until the Bill has been enacted.  We must wait until the situation relating to Vietnam is resolved before trying to exert further pressure in order to achieve agreements with Russia and Ethiopia, which have been popular among prospective adoptive parents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I welcome the fact he has taken up the invitation extended to him by the House to provide a clearer commitment.  He has certainly done so.  There was a precision, clarity and materiality about what he said, particularly in respect of Vietnam, and I am sure his comments will be welcomed by the international adoption agencies.  I welcome his statement to the effect that the draft agreement is being worked on, is almost complete and will be sent to Vietnam by the deadline.  I thank the Minister of State because we have already done a useful day&rsquo;s work.  What he said represents a clear advance on the much more nebulous commitments put forward on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>On the principle of the need for clarity, a good regime, etc., in respect of non-Hague Convention countries &mdash; some Members raised issues in this regard &mdash; the Minister of State&rsquo;s approach is one of integrity.  What he said certainly convinced me because I have always believed, in respect of matters of adoption, the absolute and fundamental principle revolves around the welfare of the child and not around the very human needs and aspirations of prospective parents.</P>
        <P>Not only am I satisfied with the arguments put forward by the Minister of State, I am also very pleased by them.  He stated that he has already communicated the position with regard to Vietnam to some of the adoption agencies, so there is probably not much need for Members to do likewise.  This represents legislative progress in which the House has played a reasonable part.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="339" />
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the commitment the Minister of State provided in respect of the draft agreement with Vietnam.  He indicated that he has informed the various interested bodies with regard to this matter.  It is good that he should do so.  As recently as yesterday morning, one of the organisations in question, the International Adoption Association, IAA, did not appear to have been informed of developments.  The IAA may have received information yesterday afternoon, which is fine.  I will not make an issue of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can give the IAA the good news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister of State will contact the IAA because he is aware of its interest in and the amount of work it has carried out in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that there has been a lengthy period of consultation in respect of the legislation.  There is no doubt that this is the case.  It would appear that such consultation was extremely meaningful, particularly in light of the level of detail contained in the Bill and the Minister of State&rsquo;s knowledge of the issues and familiarity with the various arguments put forward, which I welcome.</P>
        <P>There is some concern that, following the lengthy period of consultation, things will happen quickly in respect of the legislation.  Organisations whose representatives met or lobbied the Minister of State in respect of making certain inclusions in the legislation, only obtained sight of the Bill some four or five weeks ago.  It was initially proposed &mdash; I do not believe the Minister of State was involved in any way in this regard &mdash; that Committee and Report Stage debates on the legislation would be taken on the same day.  That did not occur, which was good, because the Leader changed the proposal.  There is a need for breathing space, not only for outside organisations but also for Members, in order that various matters might be considered before the conclusion of Committee Stage and prior to the taking of Report Stage.  Concerns have been expressed that matters are proceeding extremely quickly in respect of the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister of State will allow some measure of latitude to organisations, particularly those which are non-expert from a legal point of view, in order that they might have their say.</P>
        <P>The specific proposals contained in amendment No. 2 essentially suggest that there should be a third category of possibility.  The first category relates to inter-country adoptions involving countries that are signatories to the Hague Convention, and the second to countries with which Ireland has bilateral agreements.  If the amendment were to be accepted, the third category &mdash; I accept that the Minister of State is balking at this and I understand his reasons for doing so &mdash; would involve inter-country adoptions being allowed if the authority considers that an adoption &ldquo;could be effected from a third country&rdquo; in a manner compatible with the legislation.  The amendments puts forward a high level of control in respect of such adoptions.</P>
        <P>I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point with regard to diluting the application of the Hague Convention and the position with regard to bilateral agreements.  I must admit that I am swayed by the argument he offers in this regard.  If one is intent on putting certain structures at the heart of one&rsquo;s regime, one must think twice in respect of allowing inter-country adoptions which do not fall within those structures.  Nevertheless, the amendment would give rise to a high level of control because the new authority established under section 94 would be obliged to come to the conclusion that a proposed adoption could be effected from a particular third country in a manner compatible with the legislation.  High standards would have to be applied and, in that context, the new authority would be obliged to apply those under the Hague Convention with which we are familiar and those we are seeking in respect of bilateral agreements.  The amendment would provide flexibility in respect of allowing the third category of adoptions to which I refer to take place.</P><Col N="340" />
        <P>I will not press the amendment.  However, I ask the Minister of State to have regard to the point I have made before Report Stage.  We might revisit the matter at that point.  If, perhaps for a technical reason which I cannot currently contemplate, a bilateral agreement could not be affected, the amendment would provide that in the essentially exceptional circumstances I have outlined, an inter-country adoption could take place from a state not covered by the Hague Convention or a bilateral agreement.  In such circumstances, the new authority could deem that such an adoption could take place once it was completed in a manner compatible with the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s comments will reassure many parents who are involved in the adoption of Vietnamese children.  He indicated his hope that there will be an agreement and he referred to the fact that the USA and Sweden have stopped all adoptions from Vietnam.  Are the difficulties being experienced in respect of this matter relative to the Vietnamese side or to the Irish side?  Do those difficulties relate to standards?  What has given rise to the delays outlined by the Minister of State?  In light of those delays, is he confident a bilateral agreement will eventually be concluded?</P>
        <P>With regard to Russia and Ethiopia, if the bilateral agreements are not concluded before this legislation is passed, what will be the situation for the parents concerned?  The Department will have to undertake quite a large information initiative for parents who are involved with these countries at this point.  The Department might already be doing that, but there is a need for clarity for parents on this issue.  I have conducted adoption assessments as a social worker over the years and I am aware it is an extremely traumatic and difficult time for people to get to the point of being accepted as adoptive parents, not to mind the difficulties of inter-country adoption.  Now there is an entirely new legal framework which parents will have to negotiate.  A huge information initiative is required to help people understand the implications of the Hague Convention and to give them reassurance in the case of bilateral agreements.  Will the Minister spell out the implications of bilateral agreements not being in place by the time this legislation is passed?  That is very important.</P>
        <P>On the other point about flexibility, I agree that standards are incredibly important in this area.  There has been exploitation internationally.  Everybody wants to give a home to a child who is in need and who might be in horrific circumstances in the countries from which they are being adopted, but we know from international research that there have been appalling abuses in the adoption area, not least in Ireland in the past.  Standards, therefore, are critical.  The Hague Convention guarantees good standards.  Adoption will not be allowed from any country that has not signed up to the Hague Convention.  If, as Senator Healy Eames said, 78% of adoptions in Ireland at present are from non-Hague Convention countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>And non-bilateral agreement countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;what are the implications of that for social policy in this country with regard to adoption?  More important, what are the implications for the individuals who are currently dealing with those countries?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s advice to them?  What will be the knock-on effects of this legislation for them?  The Minister should spell that out as clearly and in as much detail as possible in response to these amendments.  It would be extremely helpful in ensuring that the many couples who are involved in adoptions from these varying countries will know what the future holds for them when this legislation is passed.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister still intend to make bilateral agreements after the Hague Convention comes into force or will it put an end to such agreements for all time?  Can bilateral arrangements still be made with some of these countries after this legislation is passed?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="341" />
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done to the Minister with regard to the Vietnam agreement.  Let us hope it is established by 1 May so there is no breakdown for the couples in the process of adopting there.  I wish to focus on Russia.  I am aware of a number of couples &mdash; I am close to one of them &mdash; who have been approved to travel to Russia.  This Bill is going through the Oireachtas at a rapid pace and if the Bill is enacted before the adoption process has been completed, will they be unable to adopt from Russia?  This is unbelievable.  I seek a commitment that, at the very least, adoptions in process, that is, where a declaration has been given by the social worker and the Adoption Board that within six months the couple can travel and identify a child in Russia for adoption, will be facilitated.  We are talking about people in their mid-40s, who have spent five to six years getting to this stage only to discover that they might not now legally adopt from Russia because a bilateral agreement is not in place.</P>
        <P>What is the position regarding the bilateral agreement with Russia? Will the Minister discuss the position of the couples that are currently in the process?  It will be a terrible outcome for people who have gone so far in the process if it is stopped at this stage.  The Minister will be aware that they are currently identifying with agencies in Russia for a suitable baby.  That is how close they are to adopting.  This Bill was introduced two weeks ago and it is already on Committee Stage.  It is going through the Oireachtas rapidly.  If another six months were available, couples in the process might have their adoptions finalised.  We must think of the couples in the process.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response on that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s response.  It is useful to remind ourselves that the rights of the child, not the parents, must always be paramount.  The Minister is to be commended on the progress that has been made with Vietnam.  However, I share the concerns of other Senators.  It is a concern that some other countries in the EU have broken the link with Vietnam.</P>
        <P>The valid questions that have been raised by Senators about this illustrate the difficulty with the current arrangement, a difficulty that will continue under this Bill when enacted.  Senator Fitzgerald has put down a useful amendment, No. 49, which would resolve some of these problems in a pre-emptive or proactive way by requiring that prior to the expiration of any existing bilateral agreements, the Minister concerned would indicate whether that bilateral agreement was likely to be renewed and would give reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the progress being made.  Does the Minister think that would be helpful?  It would mean that even if only a twin-track approach is taken, in other words, an inter-country adoption can only be carried out with a state that is party to the Hague Convention or to a bilateral agreement &mdash; I can understand why the Minister does not wish to dilute that principle &mdash; there would be a little more certainty about the status of bilateral agreements or future bilateral agreements with countries with which we have long-standing relationships and from which a large number of children are already adopted and resident in families in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal first with the suggestion that we are proceeding too quickly.  The Adoption Bill has been a long time in gestation.  We published it five or six weeks ago after extensive consultation with the representative groups over the past few years.  Since my appointment I have met the groups whenever they have requested such meetings and there is a very good relationship between them, the Office of the Minister for Children and my staff.  We have afforded the representative associations all the time we can to ensure they are up to speed with what we are doing.</P>
        <P>Some 66 amendments have been proposed.  We are about an hour into the debate on Committee Stage and we are dealing with amendment No. 2 so we cannot be accused of being too quick on this.  It is right that we take our time.  We have had the period of consultation with the public and representative groups, and it is now a matter for the legislators.  They can talk <Col N="342" />to the people who make representations to them.  We are taking our time with the legislation and I do not accept that we are dealing with it too quickly.</P>
        <P>We have made progress with Vietnam.  That is due to the huge amount of work by the people in my office, the adoption authority, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the consular staff in Hanoi and the people in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  A huge amount of effort has been put into it.  The question is what we do after that.  It must be remembered that the Vietnamese authorities have to agree to the proposal we will put to them.  It is a sovereign Government and we cannot tell how long that will take.  We cannot tell whether it will agree to it or what problems might arise.  That is the next stage.  People should be aware of that.</P>
        <P>We are determined to proceed with trying to achieve a bilateral agreement with Russia.  Again, however, the rights of the child will be central to that.  We will have to be satisfied and have reassurances about the basic principles of international adoption relating to consents, ensuring there is no improper financial gain and the protection of children.  Those are the central issues as well as eligibility.  We will have to resolve all those issues.  There is nothing to stop us proceeding with further bilateral agreements.  The Vietnamese agreement has been in compliance with the Hague Convention.  We have moved on, however, and we are trying to establish better standards now that we are in the process of enacting an Adoption Bill and transposing the Hague Convention in Irish law.  The bilateral agreement must be upgraded to reflect these changes.</P>
        <P>It was stated that 78% of Irish adoptions are of children from countries which have not adopted the Hague Convention or with which Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement.  I am not sure what is the source of this figure but it is incorrect.  I am informed that a large majority of adoptions are of children from Vietnam and that these are carried out on foot of a bilateral agreement which will expire and, I hope, be replaced at the end of April.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>May I clarify the figure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Please do. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Of those seeking to adopt a child, 78% are considering countries which have not signed up to the Hague Convention or with which we will not have a bilateral agreement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, the figure is cited in anticipation that Ireland will not have a bilateral agreement with Vietnam.  Let us not give the impression that three quarters of applicants will be left high and dry, even if we secure an agreement with Vietnam. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, the figure would be lower. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>While it is not the Senator&rsquo;s intention to give the wrong impression, it would be an unintended consequence of allowing the 78% figure to hang in the ether.</P>
        <P>On the issue of adopting siblings from countries which have not adopted the Hague Convention and do not have a bilateral agreement with Ireland, the problem, as I outlined, is that, having signed up to the standards of the convention and consulted as widely as possible before incorporating them into Irish law, we should not require the authority, even on a case-by-case basis, as suggested by Senator Alex White, to satisfy itself that all adoptions comply with Hague standards on consents and the absence of improper financial gain in a third country.  Ireland, as a small country with a small regulatory authority, cannot do an investigation of these countries to a standard sufficient to ensure an adoption should be accepted.  We should be resolved and determined to remain within the boundaries of the Hague Convention and such bilateral <Col N="343" />agreements as we are able to secure based on the convention&rsquo;s principles.  These are the standards we should apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On that point, the Minister of State appeared to indicate that his Department is not in a position to work on the bilateral agreement with Russia until such time as the bilateral agreement with Vietnam has been concluded.  Perhaps I misunderstood him. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>My point was that we will probably spend more time on the bilateral agreement with Vietnam but we are making progress with Russia.  In other words, we are addressing the issues which arise in this regard.  I do not wish to give an impression that the process has stalled completely but a great deal of our time is taken up with the agreement with Vietnam because it is the most popular country for foreign adoptions.  We also have an excellent relationship with the country and we recommend it to prospective adoptive parents. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>My point was related to the resources available to the Minister of State&rsquo;s office to secure bilateral agreements.  As the Minister of State noted, the Department has an agency working on the ground in Vietnam and departmental staff have been able to visit the country and work with Vietnamese officials.  I hope we are moving towards a resolution although if I am to interpret the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments correctly, that is not definitively the case.</P>
        <P>What resources are available to the Minister of State&rsquo;s office to address the issues which require investigation and reach satisfactory bilateral arrangements, for example, with Russia and Ethiopia?  Are these resources sufficient to reach bilateral agreements in the coming weeks and months?  What timeframe does the Minister of State have in mind for concluding such agreements?  Is it correct that Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with Russia?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, I stated that 78% of those seeking foreign adoptions are considering non-Hague Convention countries or countries with which we do not have bilateral agreements.  This figure is from the International Adoption Association, which does research in this area.  Couples seeking foreign adoptions contact the association for advice and to declare their interest.  That is a fact and we should not make little of it. </P>
        <P>I do not believe the Minister of State answered my question on couples who are in process and have a declaration to travel to Russia.  For example, I have just received a text message from a couple who state they have been given a declaration to travel in June and have been informed that is fine.  This Bill could be enacted by June.  In that case, what is the position of the couple?  They have also been informed that many of the couples on their course are now excluded.  Foreign adoptions in Russia are clearly an issue.</P>
        <P>I share Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s concern that the Department may not have sufficient resources or that its staff may be over-worked.  I have no doubt that it is doing brilliant work with regard to Vietnam.  However, I was recently involved in bringing a body home from Vietnam and our dealings with the Vietnamese authorities were horrifically slow and difficult.  It took us three weeks to have the matter dealt with.  These are human issues which take a long time to address.  Human issues also arise on this side.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position of couples who are in process and have a declaration to travel but may not have travelled to collect the baby they wish to adopt before the Bill is enacted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>My office has outstanding human resources available to it.  The effort and work of my officials is not constrained by time issues.  Complex issues must be resolved, which takes time.  I reject any suggestion, although no such suggestion is being made in the <Col N="344" />House, that anyone has failed to apply himself or herself or that public servants have caused a delay. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not make any such inference. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, no such inference was made by anyone in this House.

Such accusations are absolutely unfounded. </P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The uncertainty experienced by prospective adoptive parents is disgraceful. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State did not interrupt Senators.  I will allow Senator Fitzgerald to contribute again when the Minister of State has concluded. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The record may show something different.  Let us not get stuck on this issue.  While I apologise if I have provoked Senators, I acknowledge the hard work being done in my office on this issue.</P>
        <P>We are determined to secure a bilateral agreement with Russia before the Bill is enacted.  We cannot guarantee this outcome will be achieved and it would be dishonest of me to suggest we will do so because we are dealing with a sovereign third country which will make its own decision on whether to sign a bilateral agreement.</P>
        <P>I advise the couple who texted Senator Healy Eames to have faith for the moment and continue to deal with the country from which they propose to adopt a child.  The last thing we want is people to go to countries where Ireland does not have a track record, has no experience and has not, therefore, obtained safeguards.  We need to be careful in our choice of terminology and language because this is an extremely sensitive issue for prospective parents.  While there will be turbulence in this time of change in regard to adoption in Ireland, we do not want people to panic and seek alternatives.  Instead, we ask them to stay the course in this difficult and uncertain period.</P>
        <P>The Department does not lack resources and it certainly does not lack determination.  We are working extremely well with the agencies on the ground in third countries and representative groups here.  I hope we will be able in the near future to assuage the fears about which we have heard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I used the word &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo; because parents in this situation have told me that by 17 February it was apparent the agreement had still not been sent to Vietnam.  The Minister might confirm the date on which the agreement was sent to Vietnam.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="345" />

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>We have communicated this to the support groups and they are aware of the position.  I hope to be able to send this proposed agreement through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Vietnamese Government in the next day or two &mdash; certainly this week.  It will then be up to the Government of Vietnam to decide whether it will sign up to that agreement.  There may well be negotiations and difficulties between the two countries.  We can anticipate that as these are the difficulties one faces when dealing with sovereign governments.  If it were simply the case that sending the agreement represented its ratification, it would be fantastic, but obviously that is not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill, which deals with the Hague Convention, is in the Seanad, but at the same time the Minister is trying to finalise an agreement with Vietnam which has not yet been sent to the Vietnamese Government.  It is a reasonable point to make that it would have been preferable if this had been dealt with before the legislation came in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reserve my position for Report Stage so I will not press the amendment at this point.</P>
        <P>I ask the Acting Chairman for clarification as I am still a relative rookie.  We were dealing with amendments Nos. 2, 14 and 50, and perhaps I was expected to address Nos. 14 and 50 at the same time, but they have not been called yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 can be discussed now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is amendments Nos. 14 and 50.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, it is amendment No. 50.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might have anticipated amendment No. 14 in some of his remarks a few minutes ago, but it is a considerably different proposal to that made in amendment No. 2, which had to do with a third category of possible inter-country adoptions.  I will not press that amendment at this stage but reserve my position for Report Stage.  Amendment <Col N="346" />No. 14 is a proposal akin to a grandfather clause, if it can be described in that way.  The intent is similar to that of amendment No. 50 tabled by Senator Fitzgerald.  It would allow for families who have already adopted a child from a country that has not approved the Hague Convention or with which Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement to conduct a second or subsequent adoption from that country.  It would be something akin to an interim measure while those families are growing and developing as families.  No adoptions can be completed by first-time applicants to that country, and if this amendment was not accepted or the issue not addressed in some other way, a child who has already been adopted from that country and is now an Irish citizen would be precluded from growing up with a sibling from his or her country and culture of origin.  The basis of this amendment is to allow for such adoptions in what are essentially exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I understand what the Minister said in reply to the previous amendment.  It is his view that we should have a regime whereby either the Hague Convention or a bilateral agreement applies, and to do otherwise would be to dilute the regime we are seeking to introduce.  That argument has considerable force.  However, the Bill itself, in section 81, does allow for arrangements in exceptional cases with a non-contracting state.  Thus, according to my brief consideration of section 81, we are already contemplating in this Bill, quite rightly, allowing for adoption from countries that are not party to the convention and with which we do not have a bilateral agreement.  In fact, it is at section 81 that Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment is directed.  Either amendment would deal with the point I have mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister will address this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 50 refers to section 81, which states: &ldquo;The Authority may enter into an arrangement with a non-contracting state that is not a party to a bilateral agreement if...the prospective adopters are relatives of the child&rdquo;.  The amendment would continue this with &ldquo;or have previously adopted a child from a non-contracting state&rdquo;.  I support the amendment on the grounds it would be similar to a grandfather clause.  If I have adopted a child from Russia, for example, with which there is no bilateral agreement at the moment, and I find out that a sibling of the same family is available for adoption, it is essential that my family be allowed to adopt the other child for the sake of both the new child and the existing child in the family.  It is good practice.  There is much research to show that this is useful in helping both children gain an understanding of their own identities and a sense of belonging.  It is also positive in terms of building their self-image and self-esteem, and good for their overall health and well-being.</P>
        <P>This is also the case if the child available for adoption is not a sibling of the existing child but is of the same nationality.  I mentioned earlier that it was a very important aspect of the development of the adopted person that he or she find someone in his or her own likeness.  There is evidence that many adopted people, because they do not find people in their own likeness, look forward to having their own children because they are the only people similar to themselves.  Where we can complete families and work in favour of the existing child and the child to be adopted, we should do so.  I strongly support this amendment.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The point about amendment No. 50 is that the Minister, in section 81, is already allowing for some exceptions which are deemed necessary.  The amendment does not, for example, create a right to adopt where a person or couple have previously adopted from a non-contracting state.  Rather, as I said earlier, it provides for the making of an exception where the authority deems it required or desirable having regard to a range of factors.  There is already a safeguard in that the authority must be satisfied the standards applied <Col N="347" />to the adoption accord with those of the Hague Convention.  Thus, it is not creating another track, a possibility about which the Minister was concerned in our earlier discussions.  However, it allows for an exception in terms of what is referred to as a grandfather clause, which could be helpful to many couples.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We have held wide-ranging discussions with the International Adoption Association on the grandfather clause and I have explained our reasons for not permitting it.  The clause arises in this grouping of amendments for the simple reason that the arguments I made earlier apply in respect of it.  We are introducing standard setting legislation and people have been crying out for us to sign up to the Hague Convention.  It would be seen as a dilution of that convention&rsquo;s principles if we allowed an adoption simply because one has already adopted a child from the same country.  In seeking to change the practice, we cast no aspersion on adoptions made from these countries in the past.  The adoptions to which Senators referred were made in the utmost of good faith.</P>
        <P>I am informed that no evidence exists to suggest that the adoption of siblings from the same country is of benefit to an already adopted child.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Senator claims to possess research that would suggest otherwise but my information indicates that no such evidence exists.  It boils down to the question of whether psychological ties are more easily formed between people from the same cultural backgrounds or if it is the common humanity among people from various ethnic backgrounds that determines whether such ties can be formed.  In the absence of evidence which would convince us of an overwhelming benefit and having given the matter all due consideration and consulted all the relevant parties, the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) In this Act, &ldquo;married couple&ldquo; means an opposite-sex or same-sex married couple or a couple who have entered a registered civil partnership with each other.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important amendment but I should at the outset declare my interest as counsel in the case taken by Zappone and Gilligan regarding the right of same-sex couples to marry, which clearly has a bearing on my proposed amendment.  Amendment No. 3 takes a conservative approach in that it follows the practice in the Bill of using the term &ldquo;married couple&rdquo;.  My colleague, Senator Norris, has tabled an amendment which takes a different approach but would have a similar effect.  I considered a more radical amendment that would have extended the categories of those who are eligible to adopt beyond persons whose relationships are recognised.  This Bill replicates an anomaly that exists in Irish adoption law whereby the only persons eligible to adopt are either single persons applying alone or married couples.  In other words, no provision is made for adoption by a cohabiting couple, whether of the same or the opposite sex.  That is anomalous because it means that a lesbian woman, gay man or heterosexual person could adopt on his or her own account irrespective of whether he or she is living in a relationship with another person.  Eligibility for adoption would be considered on the basis of the individual and whoever he or she lives with will have no legal relationship with the child.  It is anomalous that cohabitees are not capable of being considered as adoptive parents.</P><Col N="349" />
        <P>The more radical amendment I considered would have the expanded &ldquo;married couple&rdquo; to &ldquo;married couple or cohabiting couple or person&rdquo; but I restricted the scope of my amendment to a definition of &ldquo;married couple&rdquo; as a married couple of opposite sex or the same sex or a couple who have entered into a registered civil partnership.  This is a pre-emptive amendment because it looks ahead to the time when, as the Government has clearly indicated, a legal system of civil partnership will be in place for same-sex couples.</P>
        <P>If the legislation proceeds as the Government has indicated in the heads of the Bill, a system will be established of presumptive recognition of cohabiting opposite sex couples.  Perhaps my amendment should, therefore, include this type of relationship.  The amendment would also have to be accompanied by various other amendments to take account of a couple who were previously in a registered civil partnership, just as the present Bill provides that a couple whose marriage has ended will no longer be considered to adopt as a married couple.  Where &ldquo;married couple&rdquo; is used in the Bill, it is taken to mean a couple who are married to each other and are living together.  I am trying to extend in a somewhat restrictive manner the categories of those who are eligible to adopt to include only those same-sex couples who are married or have entered into civil partnerships.</P>
        <P>When I raised this issue on Second Stage, the Minister of State responded: &ldquo;Adoption is a right that is afforded to children, and the right of a child to a family is at the core of adoption legislation.&rdquo;.  I completely agree with that statement and believe we cannot emphasise it enough.  He went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">There is also a right in my view which must be considered, that of same-sex couples.  Their rights need to be explored.  The Civil Partnership Bill is the forum at present for the extension of those rights.  I am an extremely strong supporter of those rights but this Bill is not the appropriate forum for that.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s argument except that the heads of the Civil Partnership Bill make no reference to children or adoption.  This is the reason Senator Norris and I have proposed amendments.  The British legislation on civil partnership was introduced subsequent to reforms of that country&rsquo;s adoption law to enable adoption by same sex couples.  A precedent therefore exists for providing for eligibility for same sex couples in adoption rather than civil partnership law.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this method of extending eligibility, notwithstanding his stated view that the Civil Partnership Bill is a more appropriate vehicle.  I welcome his acknowledgement that the right of same sex couples in this regard needs to be explored but it would be useful to do so in the context of the Bill before us.</P>
        <P>The Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board guidelines on adoption by same sex couples indicate that current legislation is clear on the issue.  Under current legislation it is not possible for a partner to apply to become a guardian of a child nor is it possible for him or her and the same sex partner to adopt a child jointly even where one of them is the birth parent of the child.  This can no longer be justified in a modern state wherein, we know, there are already many children living within a secure and loving family whose parents are a same sex couple but with whom the child has no legal relationship as a couple even where one of the parents, as would be typical, is the birth mother of the child.  That is an anomaly.</P>
        <P>Many years ago, although rather belatedly, we equalised the position of children born in and outside marriage, which was a very important move.  We say, and the Minister of State has reiterated this, that in all legislation of this type the primary concern must be the best interests of the child.  I ask the Minister of State how it can be in the best interests of the child to continue to discriminate against children of same sex couples.  There are in Ireland already many children, some of whom are well into their teens and older, whose relationship with their <Col N="350" />non-birth parent within a same sex relationship is not legally recognised.  It is wrong that we continue not to recognise their relationship with their families.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt there will be opposition to the amendments tabled by myself and Senator Norris.  It may well be that the old canard that children have a right to two parents of the opposite sex will be restated.  However, that is a meaningless thing to say.  Children live in many different arrangements and with many different parenting situations.  We have had in Ireland a long history of different types of parenting arrangements.  All research indicates that it is the quality of parenting that matters to the child.  What is important is that the child live in a loving home.  The quality of parenting rather than sexuality or gender of either or both parents is what matters.  I refer the Minister of State to the research of Susan Golombok and others.  The most authoritative research establishes that there is no disadvantage to a child in being brought up by a same sex couple, a single parent or married parents, rather it is the quality of parenting that is of paramount importance.</P>
        <P>At a recent seminar on civil partnership organised by Senator Norris, Fergus Ryan, an expert on this area of law, made the point that extending rights to children of same sex couples, as in this case, is not taking rights from married couples or from children within marital families, rather it is giving extra cake &mdash; to use that analogy &mdash; to people who should have it.  That is an important analogy to make.  If there are already, as we know there are, children in Ireland living in families with same sex parents who currently have no right to a legal relationship with the non-birth parent in that relationship, it is wrong that we do not extend to them the right to be adopted by their other parent thus ensuring they then have all the rights that follow from that.  I am speaking again about the rights of the child as this must be framed in that context.</P>
        <P>I cannot see any logical justification for opposing the principle behind this amendment and the amendment tabled by Senator Norris.  I acknowledge many other amendments would have to flow from this amendment, if accepted, in particular to recognise the ending of a civil partnership.  The amendment is predicated on a civil partnership regime being introduced.  In principle, the amendment seeks to extend recognition for adoption eligibility to same sex couples.  I do not see how the Minister of State can oppose that principle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment is somewhat different.  It seeks to insert in chapter 3, page 29, section 33, which states that the authority shall not make an adoption order or recognise an inter-country adoption effected outside the State unless the applicants are a married couple who are living together, a new subsection (<i>b</i>) which states that that the applicants are a couple of the same sex, over 21 years of age who can demonstrate that they have been living together within the jurisdiction for not less than two years and who have demonstrated to the appropriate authorities under this legislation that they are fit persons to adopt.  I believe this meets the type of criteria indicated by the Minister of State, including a stable and successful relationship.  Also, the welfare of the child is seen to be paramount and has been so adjudged by an independent body.</P>
        <P>Elements of the amendment tabled by my distinguished colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, appeal to me.  In particular her amendment assumes the marriage of two people, Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, which is the subject of a case before the courts, is valid under the Irish Constitution.  It is a case I strongly support.  It seems to me to be perfectly clear and could not possibly be clearer going back over 40 years.  It is precisely the reason Declan Costello in his 1967 governmental review of the Constitution indicated that he, as a member of Government and a distinguished lawyer, felt it necessary to spell out what had not been spelled out previously, namely, that marriage under the Irish Constitution should mean marriage between a man and a woman.  It is obvious that in his opinion it does not mean that.  That <Col N="351" />view was articulated in 1967, some 42 years ago.  I am taking as granted that that is the position.  In other words, I am waiting for the courts to recognise the constitutional position, namely, that Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan are married and that other marriages are valid.  It would be extraordinarily insulting on the part of the State of Ireland were we to tell Canada and other countries what should be their arrangements in regard to marriage and whether they are valid.  That is my reason for supporting Senator Bacik&rsquo;s excellent amendment.</P>
        <P>My amendment commends itself because it is directly in line with the principles of this legislation.  It is idiotic to say we accept there are people in same sex relationships, each of whom can individually adopt a child but that the person not involved in the adoption has no relevance whatever in the situation.  That is completely idiotic.  Senator Bacik was reserved in what she said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always reserved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is idiotic, contemptible and inhumane and it does not redress this human situation.  Moreover, if we are interested in the rights of the child, why then do we not listen to what the children affected are saying?  There have been a number of marvellous, courageous and splendid interviews on radio, television and in the newspapers by these children who want to know why we do not recognise their relationships with their parents.  If one wants to know whether the shoe pinches, one asks the foot, not the shoe.  In this case, the foot is being ignored.  There is a strong argument for this provision on the basis of what the children who are already in this situation are saying.  It is idiotic that same sex parents can individually adopt a child and that the non-adopting parent is not permitted to have a legal relationship with the child.  That is farcical.  It is the result of cowardice on the part of the Government which refuses to face up to what is essentially sectarian and religious prejudice and hypocrisy.</P>
        <P>With regard to the domestic partnership law, this is a blatant flaw.  This was made obvious during the briefing session.  The British amended their adoption legislation before introducing their civil partnership legislation.  In light of the fact that we have produced a civil partnership Bill with this glaring lacuna, it would seem obvious that this situation should be addressed at this point.  A recent survey indicated that 62% of the people have no difficulty whatever with recognition of full civil marriage for gay people which would automatically confer on them the right to adopt.  Why is this Government intimidated by a few backwoods people?  Why not get on with the job and do it with some little remaining degree of vision?  I call on the Government to do this in the light of the clearly expressed views of the people which have vindicated people like me who have always said the Irish are decent, tolerant, compassionate, understanding, and not at the blatant level of idiocy and hypocrisy that we see in this neglect of the welfare of children.  It calls into question that ceremony in the Mansion House, out of which I am very sorry I did not walk, where we trumpeted our succession to the ideals of 1916 and the D&aacute;il of 1919 and recited yet again this notion of equality for children.  No religious prejudice or preconception should ever be allowed to take precedence over the rights of children.</P>
        <P>It was a proud day for me when I sat in this Chamber and heard a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan Quinn, say she would need a clear, cogent and factual reason to introduce discrimination against any Irish citizen.  That was a proud day for democracy and I was thrilled when I heard it.  I would like a bit of action on the fine rhetoric that emerged from the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, when he said there was absolutely no justification whatever in law for disadvantaging any Irish citizen on the basis of sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>With regard to capacity I read with interest that there was evidence given by a person in that case who presumed to give evidence, who had no qualification whatever, had never published any research, who, when I said that in the House had the impertinence to write to the <Col N="352" />Cathaoirleach to complain.   How dare those people stick their noses into an area where they have no competence whatever.</P>

If two people of the same sex are living together why can one not adopt the child of the other?  I congratulate Senator Norris on his courage in speaking out alone.  It was a lonely station.  Some of the comments we hear in this Chamber about same sex relationships are not the general opinion of the Irish people.  We are a very tolerant race.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very hard to have this debate because, despite the many welcome advances we have made in our ability to discuss a range of issues openly, people on both sides of the argument, particularly those with a traditional view such as mine, can easily and quickly feel demonised.  They sometimes feel bullied into not expressing their views.  I would like for people never to abandon values of absolute respect, regardless of their point of view, even if they feel that those points of view are destructive.  No doubt Senator Norris believes that my point of view is destructive.  Some of his and Senator Bacik&rsquo;s points of view, were they to carry weight, would be destructive of our society and injurious to the dignity of persons.  That is my only motivation in speaking on these issues.  I would rather that people&rsquo;s arguments on these issues were never characterised as religious.  I describe myself as religious and know that Senator Norris is also a religious man.  We have very different views on this issue just as people who do not share my faith or any faith might hold different views, or perhaps the same views.</P>
        <P>I try to approach the issue from the point of view of respect for what I regard as the natural law and its philosophy, which is far from being the preserve of religious people, as Professor <Col N="353" />John Finnis in Oxford makes clear.  I also try to seek out the common good.  I am absolutely at one with Senator Bacik in trying to work out the implications of the statement that the welfare of a child shall be paramount.  That is my starting point in respect of a range of issues, whether research that involves the destruction of embryos or adoption by same sex couples.  As Senator Ross said on another topic, on another occasion, it is inaccurate to portray as exclusively religious or sectarian viewpoints that are deeply held and whose premises perhaps differ from those of the proponents of these amendments.  It is dangerous to label the views of other people as either sectarian or religious, although I support the right of religious people to advance a religion-based argument.  I hear all sorts of arguments based on prejudice and personal convenience every day of the week.  Every voter and public representative is entitled to take his or her lived experience into the ballot box and the debating chamber.  My motivation is to seek out the common good based on rational argument and principles that seek to vindicate the dignity of the person in all circumstances, without fear or favour.  It is in that spirit that I approach the amendments tabled by Senators Norris and Bacik.  I am taking as my starting point the constitutional architecture in which we operate.  I refer to the State&rsquo;s pledge in the Constitution to &ldquo;guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded&rdquo;.  I heard what Senator Norris said about Mr. Justice Costello&rsquo;s views.  It would be the settled view of most people in society that the Constitution prefers the family based on marriage &mdash; by which I mean marriage between a man and a woman &mdash; not because it wants to be hard on anybody or to disrespect anybody&rsquo;s private life, but because it believes that marriage offers the optimum set of circumstances for the upbringing of children in our society.  That is not to say that children who find themselves in circumstances other than marriage are not well loved and, in many cases, very well reared.  The business of the State, and the reason the State takes an interest in marriage, as distinct from leaving it as a private arrangement between parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
     <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the break I made the point on these amendments that we should not look at people&rsquo;s views on this matter on the basis that they are likely to be sectarian or religious if they come from a traditionalist position.  People of different religious views will be on both sides of this argument and there are people who would be concerned about allowing same-sex adoption for reasons that have nothing to do with religion.  They might be of any religious faith or none.  I said it is important to examine this issue on the basis of reasoned argument, taking as our starting principle that we seek the common good, to vindicate the dignity of the person in all situations and to address the needs of the child as a paramount consideration.</P><Col N="354" />
        <P>In considering whether it would be appropriate to allow for or to facilitate adoption by same-sex couples, I said it was appropriate we examine our Constitution, which is a natural law document.  Saying the Constitution is a natural law document can be mistaken for meaning it is a Christian or Roman Catholic document.  The concept of natural law has to do with the idea that each human being has certain inherent rights which cannot be given or taken away, even by a majority vote.  I pointed out that there are thinkers, such as Professor John Finnis of Oxford, who are eminent in natural law but who do not come from a particular religious perspective as they reason their case.</P>
        <P>I made the point that people of religious faith are entitled to speak from their lived experience as they assess issues and that people come from all sorts of perspectives.  People base their political views on issues such as personal convenience, bias, personal upbringing and preferences.  All sorts of reasons motivate people and in a sense it is wrong to look behind people&rsquo;s reasons for having particular views.  Instead, we should test the quality of people&rsquo;s arguments using the reason we have all been given.</P>
        <P>In approaching the question of same-sex adoption, I look at the Constitution&rsquo;s pledge to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded.  Contrary to what Senator Bacik appeared to indicate, that has always been understood to be the two-parent, man and woman, father and mother family.  One of the questions we must address is whether we would like that to continue to be the case or to see the wording of that revisited in a dramatic and, perhaps, surprising way to include other family forms.</P>
        <P>Nobody denies that children are brought up in diverse family situations and that there is nobility and heroism to be found in many situations where children are reared.  However, that is not the question.  The issue of interest to the State is how to promote the best interests of children by supporting the model which works best for most people most of the time.  We all know there are dysfunctional traditional families and that terrible things happen within what has been called the traditional family.  We know people will be brought up outside the traditional family, perhaps by same-sex or single parents, and that in many cases their upbringing will be heroic and will involve great love and huge self-sacrifice.  Does that mean the State should be neutral on the question of family form?  Far from it.</P>
        <P>The State must vindicate the rights of the child in every situation while promoting the model it sees as being of timeless value in guaranteeing the best interests of children.  This will always be imperfect because the law cannot bring about a perfect world; nothing can.  However, the law can seek to promote and champion what works best, not to treat as equal value forms which do not work so well.  It is meaningless to acknowledge on the one hand that the welfare of the child should be paramount while on the other hand rely on statistics which, on closer analysis, are not so reliable in seeking to claim that it does not matter whether a child has a father and mother as long as the quality of the relationship is good.  Of course the quality of the parental relationship is the key issue but that ignores, rather than answers, the question, which is in what circumstances is the quality of the relationship most likely to be good.</P>
        <P>The Constitution underpins my argument and it was drafted in this spirit.  Common sense would acknowledge that allowing for same-sex adoption would deny children the acknowledgement of their right to a mother and a father, where possible.  It clearly places the wish of adults above the rights of the child in a way that is not compatible with the stated aspiration that the welfare of the child is paramount.  My distinguished colleagues quoted polls suggesting there is majority support for same-sex marriage.  There may well be now without a thorough debate on it, but it is always dangerous to rely exclusively on statistics or surveys as we seek to determine <Col N="355" />what is proper and just.  This is particularly true in a context where it is very difficult to have an honest, searching, meaningful debate on where the rights of same-sex couples end and how they might impact on the rights of children were we to support or sponsor same-sex adoption.  It is very difficult to have that debate.  People take it very personally, and I understand that, but we must have that debate and it must begin from first principles about what children need and what we owe children.</P>
        <P>Allowing same-sex adoption would deny children acknowledgement of their right to a father and a mother where possible.  The Iona Institute poll, which is not done by the Iona Institute but by a reputable polling firm, which would require that certain standards be met &mdash; that does not need to be said but it is no harm to add it &mdash; found that over 90% of the public support a child&rsquo;s right to a mother and a father where possible.  The burden of proof in the child welfare debate clearly lies on those who argue that marriage between a man and a woman is not the optimum environment within which to raise children.  Those who argue that it does not matter whether there is a male and a female parent really do have the burden of proof on them in this debate because they are the ones advocating radical social change.</P>
        <P>It was my colleague, Senator Bacik, who suggested &mdash; I hope I do not misquote her &mdash; that all of the evidence pointed to the realisation that it does not really matter whether there is a father and a mother and what matters is quality of relationship.  She cited, in particular, the research of Professor Susan Golombok.  I quote, on Professor Golombok&rsquo;s study, what was stated in the High Court in the Gilligan and Zappone case where a couple are seeking to have their Canadian marriage recognised as a valid marriage in Ireland.  It appears that in the Golombok studies only 38 children were used and this is a tiny sample.  This is a problem with all studies on same sex parenting.  There is little by way of reliable, longitudinal studies and people will differ as to what such studies mean.  Often the studies are based on how people think they themselves are doing as distinct from being based on an objective analysis.</P>
        <P>Miss Justice Dunne, the judge in the Gilligan and Zappone case, stated: &ldquo;until such time as there are more longitudinal studies involving much larger samples that it will be difficult to reach firm conclusions on this topic&rdquo;.  Today the studies are flawed in many ways and this was pointed out by Professor Linda Waite, not the academic to which my colleague Senator Norris referred who, I think, was an Irish academic, but Professor Linda Waite who is a sociologist in the University of Chicago and who describes herself as a neutral on gay marriage.  She is a leading expert on the family, however, and she gave evidence in the Zappone-Gilligan case.  She admitted that she had not read the Avon study but she made this comment on the very small size of the group of lesbian headed families from which Professor Golombok extracted her study.  She stated that it is wonderful to have 39 randomly selected lesbian families but it is too few to say anything about and that to give an example of a recent study done by a colleague of sexuality, the National Social Life Study, any group that had fewer than 50 representatives was never mentioned and 39 is a very small number of lesbian families.</P>
        <P>This is just to deal with the academic work cited by my colleague Senator Bacik.  This is a problem that arises where the studies are not longitudinal, they are based on small samples and often rely on people&rsquo;s perceptions of how they themselves are doing.  This is important.</P>
        <P>I find it quite credible that some studies of lesbian families, for example, of same sex lesbian couple headed families, would show that there is lots of nurturing and lots of good stuff going on.  I have no difficulty with that at all.  My point would be, first, that those advocating that a small number of studies allow us to make this radical social change are asking us to take on a great deal.  Second, those studies may well prove to be unsatisfactory.  Third, there are other studies which suggest otherwise.  Fourth, when one looks at lesbian couples then one must ask <Col N="356" />what are the implications of that for same sex male couples and whether they perform to the same standard in the perception of the limited studies that have taken place.</P>
        <P>Can we really afford to drive all of this debate on the basis of statistics in surveys?  When we come back to the core point and regardless of whether one can find a statistic to show it in the short term, it is the experience of the centuries and the intuition of most reasonable people that fathers and mothers do make a difference, that there is a difference between a father and a mother and that gender is not just a social construct.  That is the majority reasonable opinion in our society.</P>
        <P>That is not to say that one will not find situations where through force of circumstances, for example, a heterosexual couple splits up and a natural parent finds himself or herself in a same sex relationship.  One can always point to those exceptional situations.  One can point to cases where a person dies in a car accident and a widow or a widower is left to bring up a family.  Nobody wants to make any adverse comments about those people, but are we going to pretend that it does not really matter that such has happened or that it does not really matter that the child no longer has the society of a father or a mother with all the complementarity that the presence of both biological parents brings to the situation?</P>
        <P>As we talk about studies, there was a meta-analysis, that is, a higher level analysis of existing studies, of all available meaningful data concerning the impact of marriage and other forms of relationship on child welfare.  By the way, I am not interested in quoting partisan studies.  I am happy to show any studies I quote to my colleagues, whether they agree or disagree with me.  Everything must be tested in the rigorous light of day here.  The study to which I refer was in Child Trends.  It was done in June 2002.  It was a bipartisan American meta-study of various family and marriage studies called Marriage From a Child&rsquo;s Perspective: How Does Family Structure Affect Children, and What Can We Do About It?&rdquo;  Here is the money quote, as they say:</P>
        <P LI="1">[R]esearch clearly demonstrates that family structure matters for children, and the family structure that helps children the most is a family headed by two biological parents in a low-conflict marriage.  Children in single parent families, children born to unmarried mothers and children in stepfamilies or cohabiting relationships face higher risks of poor outcomes than do children in intact families headed by two biological parents.  Parental divorce is also linked to a range of poorer academic and behavioural outcomes among children.  There is thus value for children in promoting strong, stable marriages between biological parents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Once again, this is not to deny the heroism and the value of exceptional cases.  This is not to deny &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Harney, stated that the worst day in Government was better than the best day in Opposition &mdash; that the best day in a non-traditional family is far better than the worst day in a traditional family, and nobody denies that at all.  However, what we must do if we care about the common good and if we care about the welfare of children is promote what works best, not with the needs and aspirations of adults in mind in the adoption context but with the needs and just desserts of children in mind.</P>
        <P>That quote is backed up by other studies and reports.  It is not today&rsquo;s topic but it was raised by my colleague, Senator Bacik, in the context of cohabitation that there is an anomalous situation where the Bill does not refer to the possibility of adoption by cohabiting couples.  People&rsquo;s increasing tendency to cohabit before marriage is leading to an increase of births outside marriage and this is bad for children according to research.  Some 44% of British babies are now born to unmarried parents according to a new report compiled by researchers at the <Col N="357" />University of Essex.  Researchers estimate that cohabitees are likely to make up three quarters of those parents.  John Ermisch, professor of economics at the University of Essex, stated that the rise in births outside marriage is a real cause for concern.  The instability of these unions means that more British children will spend significant parts of their childhood in families with only one parent and this appears to have long-term negative consequences.</P>
        <P>Professor Ermisch stated that many of these cohabiting relationships are doomed to failure, leaving the baby in a single-parent family, and that the time couples spend living together in cohabiting unions before either marrying each other or separating is usually very short, the median duration being about two years.  He stated that the unions that produce children are much less likely to be converted into marriage and more likely to break up than childless ones.  He stated that only 35% of cohabiting couples stay together until their children turn 16, compared with 70% of married couples.  So much for the statistics.</P>
        <P>The reason I mention all this is to make quite clear that it does matter what our adoption legislation envisages in terms of who may apply to adopt and that again is without denying the fact that in certain circumstances, indisputably one will find children in situations that do not conform to the socially preferred model.  That is not to say we cannot confer generous rights on those children who must all be cherished equally, but it should not be glibly extracted from it that we must cherish equally all the relationships that give rise to those situations.  I think this is what the Constitution speaks of when it acknowledges equality but also says the State shall have regard to differences in capacity and function.  One can fully acknowledge the incontestable dignity of each human person, whether he or she is gay or straight, married or unmarried, while at the same time saying that if one wants children to have the best possible upbringing, the State must work hard to protect the traditional, time-honoured and socially successful model.  That is what this is about.  On that basis, if the welfare of the child is paramount, we will start much earlier in this debate asking what works best for the children and how we promote it.</P>
        <P>I take issue, therefore, with Senator Bacik&rsquo;s approach which is that we will have civil partnership anyway so there is nothing too bad about pre-empting it by envisaging that same sex couples might adopt.  I have concerns about the civil partnership legislation and the inherent unfairness in it, although now is not the time to rehearse that.  The State, however, does not propose to envisage adoption in the civil partnership legislation and therefore it would not only pre-empt the legislation but dictate its content and go further than the Government proposes by envisaging same-sex adoption and do so in a manner that would blithely disregard what the Constitution requires with regard to Senator Norris&rsquo;s earlier point.</P>
        <P>Following the logic of Senator Norris&rsquo;s position, that it is insulting to the Canadians to deny that a marriage valid in Canada is not valid before the Irish courts, where would we stop?  If we follow that logic, we make our constitutional values subject to the whim of every nation on earth.  I read recently that there is a body of respectable opinion in Canada that proposes the legalisation of polygamy.  The argument, although I do not know if the Canadian Government accepts it, is that if same-sex relationships are to be equated with marriage on the basis that the two people love each other, why not equate polygamy with marriage?  There may be more than two people but they are of different genders so it is more like traditional marriage in that respect.  This is where we go when we abandon first principles and make hollow claims on the basis of what we claim equality means and depart from objective scrutiny of the good of the human person and the common good.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>I am not afraid to hear the best arguments in favour of same-sex marriage, relationships or adoption.  I prefer to regard relationships as a private matter where no one would be scorned <Col N="358" />but neither should the State pretend that there are relationships equivalent to traditional marriage given the importance of the complementarity of the sexes.  I am willing to have a respectful debate in which all the issues are teased out without fear or favour or insult or rancour.</P>
        <P>I do not expect the Government to accept these amendments.  With due respect to the sincerity of their proponents, I believe these amendments are destructive in what they envisage in terms of social policy.  That is to be regretted.  I reiterate that the civil partnership legislation does not envisage provision for same-sex adoption but that is not enough.  The Government owes it to us to vocalise and express its clear support for a model of adoption and family life that acknowledges the primacy and preferred status of the two-parent, father and mother model for the upbringing of children, not because we want to reject anyone&rsquo;s sincere or legitimate aspirations but because we want to promote objectively what is in the best interests of children and society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a sensitive and important issue.  It is not helpful to talk about people&rsquo;s sincere views as destructive.  It is not good to be holier than thou because ultimately we are deciding who has the right to be a parent and the construct in which they have that right.</P>
        <P>I do not want this debate to be polarised into who is right and who is wrong, it is too important for that.  I was disappointed to hear Senator Mullen quote research stating that two biological parents make up the best construct to give value for the child.  Where does this leave adoptive parents?  The amount of evidence that shows adoptive parents are providing wonderful homes for Irish children and that Ireland is exceptional in its provision of good homes, completely contradicts this research.  I accept that the most important thing is for the child to be reared in a loving family.  It is the quality of the relationship the child experiences as he or she grows that helps him or her become a full person in adulthood.</P>
        <P>There is an anomaly in that a single person who is lesbian or gay can adopt in his or her own right but cannot do so jointly.  That must be worked out.  There is a wise phrase that one good single parent is better than two bad married parents and we must listen to the concerns on both sides of the argument.  I respect those concerns of people in gay relationships who wish to be parents to adoptive children.  I equally respect and uphold the rights of married couples to be adoptive parents.</P>
        <P>Having said that, we should back up a little.  We must now address this and the best way to do so is through the civil partnership Bill.  We must get first principles correct, this is too important an issue to kick to touch quickly.  Irish people need more time on the issue and, having noted the damage that can be done by saying biological parents are better than other parents, or that the views in some of the amendments are destructive, people do need more time and I am willing to give them that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have seen dramatic changes in Irish society over the years.  Until 1972 women had to leave the public service if they got married.  I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s remarks on former Deputy M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn coming into the Houses and decriminalising homosexuality, an act that displayed great political courage.  It was an extraordinarily brave action in the political context of the time.</P>
        <P>It is one thing to discuss theory but real lives are different and what we say and do has a real impact on them.  We talk about the ideal forms of family for children but the reality of what works for children is different.  The quality of parenting is key, and no one can quote any study that proves one way or another which family form is best for children.  Whether with male or female, married couples or same-sex couples, the key to the child&rsquo;s future is the quality <Col N="359" />of the relationship and the care the child receives.  I acknowledge that we still live in a deeply homophobic society despite the changes we have seen.  We must be aware of that fact and be sensitive to it.  Children are being brought up in same-sex families for whom words spoken casually here could be extraordinarily painful and difficult.  There are heartfelt views on this matter.  We have seen the debate in the United States, which is at a different stage from what is occurring here.  It does not matter whether one is left wing or right wing, conservative or liberal, people have deeply held views on this issue.  It is not easy because it brings out all the different views and values people have.</P>
        <P>We live in a society where people die because of homophobic attitudes.  As a recent report showed, young men and women experience extraordinary levels of discrimination in school if they are gay.  Anecdotally we know that suicide rates are greatly impacted upon by the horrific pressures experienced by homosexuals, which can lead to a lifetime of depression, upset and difficulty.  While we have seen great progress, society still has much work to do in this area generally.</P>
        <P>My legal advice is that without the legal structure of civil partnership in place and the issues of permanence that would be so addressed, these amendments are premature.  I fully accept that they are not premature for those who want to see this legislation in place, such as gay couples with children who want recognition and legal status.  I accept that people in such circumstances are experiencing difficulties.  When will the civil partnership legislation come before the House?  Is it intended to address in that legislation some of the anomalies that were outlined by Senator Bacik?  She said this type of amendment was dealt with in England under adoption legislation, but civil partnership legislation may already have been in place there, although I am not absolutely sure.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on those matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

	<P>I entirely agree with you, a Chathaoirligh, but the finger inevitably points at the person whose microphone is on.  I am just pointing out my innocence on this occasion.  It was not my phone.  </P>
        <P>I strongly support what Senators Bacik and Norris are proposing in these amendments.  However, Senator Fitzgerald may be right in terms of the sequence of events, given that we are to have civil partnership legislation.  I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with Senator Bacik or Senator Norris but, curiously enough, Senator Norris&rsquo;s proposal may not have the same exposure to the problem of being premature as, with respect, has Senator Bacik&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>While I am not seeking to differ in any sense with what she is seeking to achieve, on the contrary, Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment No. 3 contemplates &ldquo;a registered civil partnership&rdquo;.  There is no provision in Irish law for a registered civil partnership, although I am not saying that that alone defeats her amendment.  However, it may be that what Senator Fitzgerald said is more correct as regards that amendment than it is concerning Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment No. 20, which may not fall foul of that particular objection.  It refers to &ldquo;a couple of the same sex over 21 years of age who can demonstrate that they have been living together within the jurisdiction for not less than two years&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Without getting too bogged down in the legislation, I wish to make a few more points.  We are inclined to debate the debate a lot here, rather than getting down to the issues of substance that are contained in the Bill.  I take in good faith what Senator Mullen says about the need <Col N="360" />for respect for one&rsquo;s point of view.  He made that point before and I agreed with it then too.  As a general point, however, I find it hard to take if somebody says in a debate like this that it is important that the values of respect for one&rsquo;s point of view are at the heart of what we say, but then goes on to say that the effect of the two amendments would be destructive.  Senator Mullen said that clearly and did not seek to moderate the point he made in respect of the word &ldquo;destructive&rdquo;, which he used again at the end of his speech.  The word &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; derives from the word &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; so, essentially the argument is being made that if we are to permit adoption by same-sex couples, as contemplated by these amendments, it would destroy something.  Would it destroy marriage or what would it destroy?  &ldquo;Destroy&rdquo; is a big word.</P>
        <P>We are essentially turning these arguments into abstractions because Senator Mullen invites us to look at the Constitution and its natural law base.  We then end up in what appears to be an entire abstraction.  This comes up in all these debates.  It first arose 25 or 26 years ago when we debated the issue of abortion.  It also came up concerning the divorce referendum when it was argued trenchantly that if we were to allow divorce, it would destroy marriage.  That is what was stated at the time.  I am quite sure the words &ldquo;undermine&rdquo;, &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; and &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; were used then, or words that meant the same thing.  Nevertheless, the availability of divorce in our jurisdiction has not destroyed marriage.  It did not destroy the institution of marriage for those who were already married or for people who got married since divorce was introduced in Ireland.  Therefore it is not destructive.  Without further elaboration, I cannot see why or how it can be seriously argued that changing the law to allow for adoption in the circumstances proposed by Senators Bacik and Norris would destroy anything.  That point needs to be elaborated further than just stating that it is in our Constitution.</P>
        <P>That begs the question of why it is in the Constitution.  While I can understand that historically, if it is in the Constitution and it is not right or we do not agree with it, maybe we should take it out of the Constitution.  It is a circular argument to say &ldquo;You better look at the Constitution because it is in there&rdquo;.  As Senator Mullen said, one must address the rational arguments for it, not just the fact that it appears in the Constitution or that the Constitution would appear to mean what is being advocated by Senator Mullen &mdash; that marriage is based on a union between a man and a woman.  That would appear to be the position under our Constitution, but the argument does not end there.  The Constitution is an important solemn document but the argument must be made.  I do not agree those advocating adoption by same-sex couples have to carry, as Senator Mullen put it, the burden of proof of demonstrating that it should be allowed.  We need to get away from the abstract and examine everyday life as already pointed out by some Members.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen acknowledged there are many good instances in circumstances where children have been adopted by same-sex couples and they are successful and loving families.  The burden shifts to the other side of the argument to demonstrate why same-sex adoption cannot be legislated for in the real world.  In fact, the burden is carried as much by the other side of the argument.</P>
        <P>Where is this right that claims a child must be adopted into a marriage based on union between a man and a woman?  What is it derived from?  Has the child the right to a father and a mother?  I would like to hear more arguments about this.  I believe, as Senator Healy Eames and others have said, a child has the right to a loving and nurturing upbringing.  Is there a right that the couple should be of the opposite sex?  How could we vindicate the right that there should be two parents, because many children are brought up by one?  There are too many abstractions in this debate.  Our role is to be practical legislators.  Of course, we have to have regard to all the arguments, statistics and otherwise.  We must look at each other&rsquo;s arguments <Col N="361" />across the Chamber.  We need to carefully consider the arguments of those who disagree with us.  It is not enough for us to say, &ldquo;It is in the Constitution and that is the way things should be&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I would need to be convinced that the common good would be affected by this proposal for same-sex couples.  As the Minister of State said earlier, the welfare of the child has to be at heart of all of this debate.  I am not convinced the welfare of the child in all circumstances can only be vindicated by the <i>status quo</i>.  In fact, I need to be convinced by those on the other side of the argument rather than me having to convince them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their extensive contributions on these two amendments.</P>
        <P>Gay men and lesbians make very good parents.  It must be made clear they always have and always will.  We must also acknowledge that many same-sex couples foster children.  They are entrusted to them by the State through the Health Service Executive proving the State does not have any set view on this matter.  The argument that same-sex couples cannot be good parents is contrary to the case.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Healy Eames that adoptive parents must go through a more rigorous process of selection to become parents.  There is nothing to stop natural parents becoming parents whereas adoptive parents must go through an extraordinary and difficult ordeal.  Biological parents, therefore, do not have an advantage over adoptive parents in parenting.</P>
        <P>The constitutional position is the background to this debate.  In my view, marriage is preferable to cohabiting for adoption purposes because of the obvious permanence.  This is without any reference to sexual orientation.  A married couple provide that level of permanence in the assessment of suitability and eligibility for adoption that is carried out by the Health Service Executive.  While a couple is preferable, single people are allowed to adopt.</P>
        <P>While marriage continues to be defined as it is in our Constitution, adoption will not be available in those circumstances.  If there were an amendment to this constitutional provision, this debate would be moot.  As Senator Alex White said, the civil partnership Bill will be introduced soon.  According to the programme for Government, it was intended to be introduced at the earliest possible date but in the past three months the legislative programme has been more than somewhat put to one side because of the extraordinary economic circumstances.  The Gilligan-Zappone case will also give a much clearer judicial interpretation on where the family stands constitutionally.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Mary White&rsquo;s comments, from my work with young people as the Minister of State with responsibility for children, I have noted young people find it difficult to come to terms with their sexual orientation and, in many cases, they self-harm.  This is a challenge for teachers and youth workers to recognise and acknowledge.</P>
        <P>We do not want the message to go out from the House that with the route we are taking on adoption there is an adverse comment on sexual orientation.  Through the fostering process, it is recognised that we have no problem with gay men and lesbians being parents or minding children.</P>
        <P>The UK situation was referred to by some Senators.  The UK, however, does not have a constitution and, therefore, is more free to legislate in these areas.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen relied on several surveys for his argument while warning about relying on other surveys.  The facts are clear &mdash; we have an adoption system and there are clear categories of who can adopt.  The adoption legislation incorporates that within the constitutional framework and that is the basis for the Government&rsquo;s consideration of this.  It is child-centred legislation.</P><Col N="362" />
        <P>An interesting point was raised about adopting a natural child of a gay partner.  I have not scoped this out clearly and we need far more consultation on it.  Would it include an adopted child of a gay partner or just the natural child?  I agree with Senator Alex White that the amendment in the name of Senator Bacik anticipates legislation that has not yet come before either House.  As such, it would be extremely difficult to incorporate the provision in the amendment in law without even mentioning the points I made previously.</P>
        <P>The other amendment deals with the question of cohabiting couples.  I may have read it wrong but the import of this amendment appears to be that there should be discrimination in favour of same sex cohabiting couples, while opposite sex cohabiting couples would not be able to adopt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with great interest to what my colleagues said and I was particularly heartened by the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  I do not anticipate that we will succeed in respect of this matter.  I cannot speak for Senator Bacik but I will not push my amendment to anything other than a voice vote.  However, we will seize the opportunity to take on board some of what has been said.  The Senator and I have agreed to work together to produce a composite amendment to be moved on Report Stage.  This amendment will contemplate some of the matters that have been raised.</P>
        <P>To a certain extent I am pulling my punches when I state that no amount of high-octane smarm will conceal attitudes.  It is one thing to make a ritual gesture in the direction of dispassionate, intellectual inquiry, debate and so forth, but that is just not the case.  If I am tempted further, I will place certain matters on the record of the House.  At this point, however, I will not do so.</P>
        <P>I would certainly take some of these things personally.  I have no desire to become a parent but I recognise the extraordinary nature of the discrimination that has existed during my lifetime.  I come from a fairly respectable background.  However, I have known eight people who were murdered simply because they were gay.  The source of this is the Christian church &mdash; one church in particular &mdash; and the kind of pastorals that usually emerge during Lent.  I must state that I am not taking any more of it.</P>
        <P>The comments relating to young males who are gay committing suicide are, of course, true.  However, what the hell else do people expect when the various churches continue to be exempted from the operations of the equality legislation?  There have been numerous reports in respect of this matter.  One recent report indicated that 80% of bullying cases in schools involve a homophobic element and that in 80% of such cases nothing is done.  The main reason is that people who are paid by taxpayers are afraid to take action.  The person who has the final say, namely, the manager of a school, is almost invariably a member of the church.  That is not tolerable.  The Minister of State is a very decent man and I ask him to bring this matter to the attention of his colleagues.</P>
        <P>The notion of the right of a child to have a father and a mother is absurd.  Who can deny that right?  It is an observable fact.  A child&rsquo;s parents may not be present but I cannot understand how he or she could come into existence in the absence of an admixture of male and female.  He or she may be conceived in a test tube or in some other way but he or she will certainly have a father and a mother.  Let us put this notion to one side.</P>
        <P>What we are dealing with is the nurture of children.  Let us forget the various points regarding the possible longitudinal defects of certain studies which have been impugned by people who apparently did not even read them.  I thought that was an engaging admission, as was the admission made by the other person quoted by Senator Mullen who stated that she has no <Col N="363" />expertise whatever in the matter, that she has never written any academic papers on it and that she does not possess any qualifications in this area.  That is splendid.  These are the types of people to whom we should listen.  How impressive.</P>
        <P>I react very badly to the notion that in the single instance of gay people we are going to reverse the procedure that usually applies to every citizen and state that they are guilty until proven innocent.  No thank you.  Let us see the studies which indicate that children adopted by gay people can be damaged.  There are no such studies.  It is one thing, as happened on previous occasions, to impugn the background and reputation of people engaged in the production of results on one side but it is quite another to signally fail to produce any evidence that damage can be caused to children adopted by gay people.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to the issue of the rights of children.  As stated, we already possess the evidence provided by children adopted by gay people.  Why are theirs the only voices to which those who strongly oppose what I am suggesting absolutely and adamantly refuse to listen?  Yesterday, as part of my day&rsquo;s business, I met two people who want to start a radio station in Dublin which will cater to the gay community.  After approximately 45 minutes, I asked the individuals with whom I was meeting whether either of them is gay.  They both replied in the negative but indicated that there is a need for such a radio station to fill a gap in the spectrum.  That is both interesting and heartening because it suggests that this matter has really entered the mainstream.  One of the people in question said that I might recall a letter he sent me in which he indicated that both of his parents are gay.  He is of the view that he has been enriched by his experience.</P>
        <P>In all the newspaper articles and television and radio reports relating to this matter, I have never heard a child of gay parents state that he or she was damaged by his or her upbringing.  What damaged people was the disgusting, immoral and hypocritical way in which individuals were forced into marriages to which, in light of their deepest instincts, they were not suited.  Children were born in such marriages, which eventually collapsed and broke down.  Let us be honest and not engage in a theoretical approach to this matter.  Let us consider the rights of children and what they have to say in respect of it.</P>
        <P>I feel strongly about this issue and I am not prepared to be a second-class citizen.  When I hear people use phrases such as &ldquo;well they are not equal&rdquo; and &ldquo;forms which do not work so good&rdquo;, it is not the grammar that particularly offends me &mdash; the word &ldquo;well&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;good&rdquo; should have been used &mdash; rather it is the idea that I will continue to be defined in a certain way.  If one examines the language used by my colleague, one will find that regardless of whether he states that he is representing the Roman Catholic view &mdash; he indicated that this is not necessarily the case &mdash; all the language used, such as &ldquo;complementarity&rdquo; etc. follows, very directly, the line taken by the Vatican.  That line is deeply destructive in respect of gay people and I strongly resent and repudiate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his considered comments on this matter.  Like Senator Norris, I do not propose to divide the House in respect of my amendment.  Rather, I wish to reserve my right to do so on Report Stage on the basis that the Senator and I have agreed to draft a composite amendment that will seek to address the clear discrimination that exists against same sex couples and to permit adoption rights.  In so doing, we will certainly take on board the constructive comments that have been made by others, particularly the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>In essence, we are discussing two different issues.  I thank the Minister of State for saying that he is willing to consider the first of these.  This issue, which I first raised, relates to a child &mdash; there are many such children living in Ireland today &mdash; who is born to a mother who is in a same sex relationship.  That woman&rsquo;s partner has no legal relationship with the children or, to <Col N="364" />put it more pertinently, the child has no legal relationship with his or her non-birth mother.  That is unfair to the child, who lives in a secure and loving home with two parents, and creates a form of second class citizenship for such a child.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I completely agree with Senator Norris regarding the nonsensical nature of speaking about a child&rsquo;s right to a father and mother.  Such a right is not enforceable where the father is deceased or where, for example, a child is conceived through rape.  A large number of the children to whom I refer were born into secure and loving homes and have two parents.  Let us provide a means whereby the child can have a legal relationship with the non-birth parent in that situation.  How can that be done?  We propose to do it through adoption legislation, by permitting the non-birth parent to adopt the child.  However, there is another way and I am anxious to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on it.  The way cohabiting parents deal with the rights of the birth father and the right of the child to a relationship with the birth father is through the simple mechanism of the statutory declaration.  This is a standard form declaration which is sworn by the father in the presence of the mother and a solicitor, following which the father gets full legal guardianship rights along with the mother who has them by virtue of the birth.  The plight of children born to same sex couples, where one is a birth mother and one is not, might be addressed through the guardianship mechanism.  Is the Minister of State willing to consider that?  In other words, it would treat a cohabiting non-birth mother in the same way as a cohabiting birth father.  This issue could be addressed through adoption but I can see that is, perhaps, a simpler mechanism to deal with it.  It could be done in the context of giving civil partnership rights.</P>
        <P>The second issue is that of gay couples who wish to be considered generally for adoption on the same basis as opposite sex married couples are at present.  There is clear discrimination here.  I will go through the arguments.  The Minister of State said that Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment would effectively bring about discrimination between heterosexual cohabitees and homosexual cohabitees.  He is correct; it would.  At present, cohabiting opposite sex couples have no right to be considered for adoption as a couple.  However, Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment is justified in a situation where same sex couples cannot enter a legally binding relationship recognised by the State.  I say that without prejudice to the Zappone and Gilligan case which is about the right to marry for same sex couples.  I believe that right exists.  At present, the mechanism in adoption law appears to preclude gay couples, especially non-married gay couples.  That is a difficulty.  I believe the Minister of State&rsquo;s criticism is unfounded.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State rejected my amendment with the criticism that it is premature.  I refute that outright; I do not accept it is a premature amendment.  There is a clear commitment by the Government to bring forward civil partnership legislation.  We have the heads of the Bill.  It is common drafting practice to draft legislation but to delay its commencement when it is contingent upon something.  I can offer a clear example, of which the Minister of State will be well aware.  The Children Act 2001 provided for children detention centres and a new regime for the detention and treatment of children in the criminal justice system.  Large portions of that Act were not commenced for several years after the Act was passed.  It is not premature, therefore, to provide in this legislation for something that will become law.  One could simply delay the commencement of the particular section until the other legislation is in force.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said a decision has been taken to confine adoption eligibility to married couples rather than extend it to cohabitees.  It is a pity an extension of the categories of eligibility was not carried out in this Bill.  As I and Senator Fitzgerald have pointed out, it is anomalous that one can adopt as a single person or as part of a married couple but not otherwise.  However, one can see how, in the interests of children, an adoption authority would wish to be convinced where a couple are adopting that there is evidence of commitment.  The fact <Col N="365" />that the couple entered some form of binding legal relationship might provide that sort of evidence.  It is in the spirit of that conservative approach that I drafted my amendment.  It confines eligibility to adopt to married couples but it defines a married couple in a somewhat different way from the definition used by the Minister of State.  It is, therefore, in line with the Minister of State&rsquo;s policy arguments that eligibility should be confined to particular groups.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will take those comments on board.  Perhaps he would also answer a direct question.  What does he propose to do for those children who are currently alive and well and growing up in a secure, loving home but have no legal relationship with their non-birth parent?  We have seen the very distressing case of a grandmother whose grandchild&rsquo;s birth mother was killed in an accident.  It meant there was no legal recognition of the place of the child&rsquo;s non-birth mother in the child&rsquo;s life.  It was most unfortunate.  Had there been a breakdown in relations, for example, the grandparents through the non-birth parent would have had no rights and the child would have had no rights of access to them.  That is the type of difficulty we must address.  Will the Minister of State consider addressing it, if not through this route through some other route such as guardianship?</P>
        <P>I asked the Minister of State a direct question about the civil partnership legislation.  Will he consider providing for adoption or guardianship rights for same sex couples in the civil partnership legislation instead?  Even an indication that it might be considered would answer many of the points Senator Norris and I have made.  These are not issues that necessarily must be dealt with in the Adoption Bill but, given that they were dealt with in the Adoption and Children Act 2002 in the UK before civil partnership, it appears to be a logical approach.  It is anomalous that discrimination is continued in what is otherwise an excellent and reforming Bill that seeks to modernise our system of adoption.  I genuinely welcome the Bill but it is unfortunate we did not take the modernisation a small step further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for their courtesy in their responses.  I recognise that the position I advocate in the current climate is not the position that enjoys majority support in the media.  It tends to be the view that is considered not to be politically correct.  In a society where people who have a traditionalist world view presume to speak there can sometimes be a tendency to be intolerant of their views, an intolerance that perhaps replaces the intolerance and lack of charity and respect that was previously shown to homosexual persons in a way that I deplore.</P>
        <P>However, I wish to take issue with my colleagues, Senator White and Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, who seem to have a problem with my view that the consequences of what Senators Bacik and Norris are proposing would be destructive.  Senator White sought to parse the word &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; in a rather tortured way.  This is a word we use every day of the week as we try to speculate on the possible effects of policies that are proposed.  We say a policy could be destructive of something.  Destructive means damaging and negative.  It in no sense suggests that the people themselves are wilfully destructive people or anything like that.  I detect a sensitivity on that point that turns into a certain censoriousness.  It is almost as though there is a fear I might point to negative effects and that I dare not say that what is proposed would be harmful or cause problems.  That is almost an attempt to censor me.  I use that word in the most respectful manner but I used a word that is in the everyday language of discourse.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames is from the same secondary school as me.  I was disappointed that she used the most personalised language of the afternoon in telling me that I was holier than thou.  That is clearly to identify that I have a particular moral position or attitude.  I do not regard myself as holier than Senator Healy Eames; I do not know how holy she is to begin with.  I certainly do not regard myself as particularly holy.  I regard myself as having a sincere point of view that is based on rational argument about something I believe is important for our society <Col N="366" />and touches on the welfare of children.  I am sure Senator Healy Eames and I agree on many issues relating to the welfare of children and I would like to think that as she reflects on the phrase &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo;, she might regret it just a little.  I do not intend to be holier than anybody, I merely intend to contribute my&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald said she did not believe we would quote any study that shows what works best for children.  There might have been an unconscious glibness about what I had to say about surveys and statistics.  While surveys clearly help to determine what assessment people have reached on an issue, they do not prove whether they are right or wrong in that assessment of a situation at a given time.  Statistics, if they are impartial and carefully compiled, are a tremendous aid but they are not the last word.  They are not merely theoretical but explain the practical position on the ground, an issue Senator Fitzgerald and others correctly identified as important.</P>
        <P>I was correct to respond to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s statistics by making one or two relevant points about statistics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not mention statistics. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Senator to continue without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator referred to Professor Susan Golombok.</P>
        <P>Will we be so mindless as to ignore statistics?  Surely we must factor them into the debate and consider the evidence.  As to different types of family form and outcomes for children, other countries, including Britain and the United States, tend to be far ahead of us.  I am concerned that, as a small community, Irish academia may be disinclined to go against the trend of opinion and treat these issues dispassionately.</P>
        <P>To clarify an issue for Senator Alex White, who is no longer present, in saying something could be destructive, I mean it could have damaging effects.  I believe this could be the case if the amendments were accepted, although I do not argue that the family would be destroyed in every scenario.  Such an interpretation of my words would be radical and illogical.  The Senator correctly said that just because something is stated in the Constitution does not mean it ought to be stated in the Constitution.  My point on the Constitution is that I believe that what is proposed would be unconstitutional.  The logical course, therefore, is to seek to change the <Col N="367" />Constitution in the first instance rather than introduce an amendment that would, in my view, clearly fall foul of the Constitution &mdash; others may differ from me on that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State correctly spoke of the love and goodness there can be in other family forms.  He also spoke in positive terms about same sex couples fostering children.  The logic of his position is that he believes the civil partnerships Bill should envisage adoption for same-sex couples and the Constitution should be changed to accommodate that.  If that is his belief, he should say so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State also stated that marriage is about permanence and that having two parents is preferable to having one parent.  He is correct to identify these factors as two of the key ingredients marriage offers, both of which make married couples particularly suited for adoption.  He omitted to mention the concept of complementarity, a word Senator Norris believes is derived from Catholic church thought.  The Senator appears to believe I am much better read in Catholic church teaching than is the case.  That men and women are different and bring something different to the party, so to speak, is my own thought.  I point out to my colleagues, especially those who appear to believe I have a problem with adoptive parents, that I am not against this Bill and believe that adoption is wonderful, but I recognise that adoption often comes about as a result of unfortunate circumstances.</P>
        <P>I have cited reputable surveys which show that two biological parents in a low conflict marriage offer the best chances.  Those who deny that are either extremely sensitive or unconcerned about considering what data can show and teach us, and that is wrong.  We can applaud adoptive parents, as I do, for all the good they do and the love they bring, particularly in difficult circumstances, without closing our eyes to realities that can be demonstrated through statistical analysis and otherwise.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the word &ldquo;complementarity&rdquo; is a word used by the church.  Senator Norris insists on seeking to link my views with those of the church of which I am a member.  I remind him, however, that he too is a religious man who has a different view.  I do not claim that his views are those of the Church of Ireland.  The Senator also stated that he would place on record certain matters if provoked.  He should do so as a full debate is needed.  I do not believe anything he chooses to say will be disadvantageous to me.</P>
        <P>I am ultimately the only judge of the origin and source of my opinions.  When I say they are rationally held and I hold them independently of my religious views, I am entitled to be taken at my word.  To second guess that is to engage in a sinister form of thought control that would seek to characterise sincerely held traditional views as religious.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, is this relevant to the amendments we are debating? </P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My contribution is relevant to the points made in response to my earlier contribution and I have not strayed from those points.  I am trying to bring about circumstances in which respect as distinct from mere lip service is shown to different points of view. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Bacik and Norris are correct that there is a degree of unenforceability about a child&rsquo;s right to his or her biological parents, particularly when one parent is deceased.  Let us remember that the proposal in the amendments tabled by Senators Bacik and Norris is to directly include same-sex adoptions.  A judgment must be made when the suitability of parents for adoption is being considered.  It is astonishing that the Minister of State and others believe that many issues, for example, the means of prospective adoptive parents and whether they have the correct attitude to parenting, must be considered in determining whether people are <Col N="368" />suitable for adoption.  This process is lengthy and one which I support.  Bizarrely, however, I have not heard anything to suggest the Government believes that the presence of a father and a mother should be considered to be a particular advantage when people are being assessed.  That is the minimum one would expect.  We should not be afraid to say that having two parents of different sexes is a definite advantage, in the same way as having sufficient means and a correct attitude to parenting are considered advantages.</P>
        <P>There appears to be a dangerous culture of political correctness which is deliberately blind on that issue.  Is such blindness in the best interests of children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that my colleague, Senator Bacik, referred to the case of Mrs. Gill.  I do not believe she would object to her name being used in this debate.  Mrs. Gill is from a farm outside Birr in County Offaly in the heart of Ireland.  Her daughter was killed in a road traffic accident.  She desperately wanted her daughter&rsquo;s same-sex partner to be recognised but that was not possible.  When one has this level of commitment to the sort of change we are seeking from middle Ireland, we must listen again.  We must also listen to the voice of the children in question.  </P>
        <P>I hesitate to say the current position is unchristian.  I will leave that to George Bush whose Christianity led him to bomb hundreds of thousands of people to extinction.  I was never the media spokesperson for the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Dublin, as Senator Mullen was, and my habits of speech and intellectual curve, so to speak, do not always follow the Anglican model, from which I diverge greatly.</P>
        <P>Phrases such as &ldquo;sinister thought control&rdquo; and &ldquo;dangerous culture of political correctness&rdquo; were used.  Having been invited to place on record certain matters, I will do so.  Senator Mullen will remember an occasion during a previous debate when he leaned across to me and said that if I continued he may have to rake up a certain article which appeared in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While it is important to consider many other issues, as I have consistently done, there are circumstances when it is <Col N="369" />necessary to discuss this issue.

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Then we will have to find another forum in which to decide the truth of the matter, because Senator Norris has sought to misrepresent the situation.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris talked about the case of Mrs. Gill.  It should be perfectly possible to give children rights and to acknowledge they have them in such a situation without necessarily envisaging same-sex adoption or a formalisation of the relationship.  I would have thought that if one member of a same-sex couple was a biological parent and both had care of the child, it would be in the best interests of the child for the couple to contract privately to make sure the child was at no disadvantage in the event of the death of one or other parent.</P>
        <P>We could also consider presumptive schemes, for example, whereby we could ensure the law would protect the child&rsquo;s rights.  However, we must avoid the mentality that sees the adoption of children in any circumstances as somehow the right of the parent.  It is the child&rsquo;s right to be in the optimum circumstances.  The State cannot ignore, nor should it ignore, the fact that in considering what is optimum in society it must have regard to time-honoured tradition, the statistically supported importance of two-parent families, biological if possible, and the complementarity of the male-female relationship.  I do not think I am being very radical or very conservative in proposing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>There are circumstances in which older children, such as 16 and 17 year olds, are adopted, and whenever a child is over seven his or her own opinion is taken into account.  If a child, particularly an older child, were to say he or she wanted to be adopted by the partner of his or her mother or father, that could not happen under the current legislation and our constitutional position.  However, the rights of children must be central to all of this.  The discussion has had a tendency to stray away from these important issues.</P><Col N="370" />
        <P>I understand both amendments are being withdrawn but I want to address some of the questions that were put to me directly.  Would I consider adoption or guardianship rights in the context of the civil partnership Bill?  I cannot anticipate the discussion on that Bill, but the Senator is right in saying that is the correct forum for that major discussion rather than in the context of adoption rights.  The rights of children in the context of adoption is quite a specific area on which most of the commentary has focused.  There will be ample opportunity to discuss these issues at that later time, but I cannot anticipate or commit to what will be contained in that Bill.  I have my own opinions, but I am standing here as a representative of the Government and our position is that we intend to stick with the current eligibility and suitability arrangements.  I understand the amendments are being withdrawn and we are satisfied with that position.</P>

	<P>I wish to finish my point.  It was regrettable that the word &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; was used, because it is a particularly damaging word in the context of parents and babies.  I would use this word, however, in the context of which Senator Fitzgerald spoke &mdash; the damaging homophobic attitudes that have been upheld in our school system.  These have <Col N="371" />contributed to serious mental health problems in some of those affected and, according to another study with which I am involved, to early school leaving.</P>
        <P>In an Oireachtas study currently being carried out, we are looking at a group of students who suffered from homophobic attitudes and investigating how it has contributed to their decisions to leave school.  Even this is almost minor compared to the future effect on their attempts to build their own families.  It is a complex issue and one that does not go in straight lines.  I thank the House for listening to me and I believe this is relevant to the amendments under discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose, as I have done throughout this debate, to be concise and to keep my comments directly relevant to the amendments we are discussing, which were tabled by me and Senator Norris.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Healy Eames, I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that same sex-couples are currently fostering children.  We allow single people to adopt, as indeed we should.  I am glad we do not confine adoption eligibility to married couples but extend it to single persons also.  As I said, perhaps we should consider extending these rights beyond that to cohabiting couples.  We allow gay couples to foster; clearly, the next step is to allow them to adopt.  When everyone is working in the best interests of the child, there is no policy rationale for continuing the discrimination against gay couples that precludes them from being considered eligible for adoption.  It does not matter to me or to any gay couple seeking to adopt whether it is done through this Bill, the civil partnership legislation or another Bill.  However, it is important that the Government commits to this as it is clearly in keeping with Government policy of ensuring the best interests of the child, which is to be in a loving home, whatever the sexuality or gender of the parent or parents.</P>
        <P>I asked the Minister a direct question, which he did not answer, about regularising the position of children currently living in a home in which one parent is a birth parent and his or her &mdash; it is usually her &mdash; same-sex partner is a non-birth parent.  The partner currently has no right even to be considered as a guardian of the child and therefore the child has no right to a legal relationship with that parent.  Would the Minister of State consider regularising the position of those children in some other way so that their relationship with their non-birth parents may be recognised in law?  This could be done in ways other than through adoption.</P>
        <P>It might be less cumbersome to adopt something similar to the statutory declaration for cohabiting birth fathers, as I suggested earlier.  It would be entirely in keeping with the State&rsquo;s admirable policy of supporting the best interest of the child and a secure and loving home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Healy Eames in regard to the horror of bullying in schools.  I declare an interest in that I sit on the boards of approximately 120 secondary schools in this country through the CEIST network.  I would wish the school which Senator Healy Eames and I attended and any other school with which I am involved to be cold houses for bullies, regardless of whether their bullying is on the basis of a person&rsquo;s appearance or same-sex attractions.  That has to be made clear.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are at present debating two amendments which would bring about the institutionalisation of same-sex adoption.  I remind Members that I have not proposed an amendment to the Bill which would seek to second guess what happens under the law.  I am aware that single people can apply to adopt and that children are sometimes adopted into situations involving <i>de facto</i> same-sex couples.  Members will not see an amendment from me which calls for that to end.  The Minister of State is correct to outline circumstances in which a 17 year old child might wish to be adopted into a particular situation.  The best interest of the child would probably dictate that he or she be left with his or her biological parents, who may be a same-sex couple.</P><Col N="372" />
        <P>I am speaking against the amendments proposed by Senators Norris and Bacik, which would create as a norm the concept of same-sex adoption.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the issues that have been raised.  The facts that he set out in regard to fostering are valuable because they have not previously been published.  The more such information is made available to the public, the better.  To take up Senator Mullan&rsquo;s comments on the Mrs. Gill situation and mechanisms for a legal framework around that contact, perhaps the Minister of State can respond on Report Stage with proposals for a solution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik asked me about the statutory declaration procedure for guardianship.  I understand the father must be named on the child&rsquo;s birth certificate in order to make such a declaration.  Prior to the 1997 Act, one was required to apply to the High Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>One had to apply to the District Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutory declaration is clearly unable to address the issues raised by Senator Bacik.  I would not wish to make a commitment in this regard.  The guardianship rights afforded to natural fathers in an unmarried situation are limited to those who are named on the birth certificate in respect of making a statutory declaration in the absence of applying to the courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They can apply.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that but I have carried out the procedure on behalf of two children.  The Minister of State is correct that the right is particular to natural fathers.  A separate issue arises where the mother does not consent to the natural father being named as a guardian, regardless of whether he is on the birth certificate.  An application to the courts is <Col N="373" />required in the latter instance but where the mother consents to the natural father being a joint guardian on an equal basis, the two can simply sign the declaration before a solicitor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Must not the father be named on the birth certificate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to check that.</P>

	<P>I think he does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State may be correct.  In any event, we are not discussing a birth parent in the context of the Bill before us.  I am pointing out that a clear procedure exists in law whereby the natural mother consents to somebody else being a joint guardian with her.  I do not expect the Minister of State to commit one way or another now but I ask him to consider a procedure for swearing a statutory declaration before a solicitor where the natural mother consents to signing an affidavit verifying that she was in a loving relationship with her partner.  It offers an alternative route to recognition of a partner in cases where a child lives with two parents but has no legal relationship with one of them.  People just get on with their lives in the normal course of affairs but difficulties arises where one party dies and the child has no inheritance rights or other legal rights which I need not outline.  A number of problems can arise in the absence of a legal relationship with a non-birth parent.</P>

	<P>They are directly related to the amendments and respond to the significant points that have been raised.  The glory of our Constitution is its organic nature.  It did not stop in 1937.  This is why one can elicit unenumerated rights from it.  If it was a static document rather than being subject to revision by the wish of the people, we would be stuck at the point where its framers placed women exclusively in the home.

	<P Just="Left">My next point, on the recognition of foreign marriages, is even more important.  Arrangements are in place for the recognition of such marriages and I do not consider it appropriate to impugn them.  Foreign divorce can also be recognised.  In that context, I find it tendentious to speculate on the notion of polygamy.  I do not find such discussion flattering or well informed but it is of a piece.  Subsequent to the establishment of the Wolfenden report committee to investigate homosexuality and prostitution, a subsequent report was issued in this country which linked homosexuality and drug abuse.  One gets a little weary as a respectable old fairy being everlastingly compared to tarts and junkies.</P>

	<P>I do not wish to prolong the debate on this but I did check Jeffrey Shannon&rsquo;s excellent book which contains no reference to the natural father needing to be named on the birth certificate.  Clearly, however, he must be the natural father for the statutory declaration to be made.  If an issue arose, proof would be required that he is the natural father because the right attaches only to the natural father.  Clearly, this would be an extension of the right to a statutory declaration creation of guardianship.  I raise this because this happens only with the consent of the natural mother.  Otherwise, the court application must be made.  This is a useful mechanism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the birth of the child has been registered, and either the particulars of the father have been registered or the mother has sworn and furnished to the accredited body a statutory declaration that the father is unknown or missing, and cannot be traced using reasonable inquiries, unless the court permits placement notwithstanding a failure or refusal to swear such a statutory declaration,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State.  On amendment No. 4, the Bill does not specifically require a child&rsquo;s birth to be registered before placement for adoption, which is an omission.  More fundamentally, we would argue that the father&rsquo;s details should be registered where adoption is contemplated unless the mother completes the statutory declaration to the effect that the father is unknown, missing or cannot be traced without using reasonable inquiries.</P><Col N="375" />
        <P>On amendment No. 6, section 16 merely gives the father the right to apply to be consulted in regard to adoption.  It is extraordinarily insulting and offensive to state in legislation that a father has only the right to be consulted in regard to permanent removal of his child from him.  It is unbelievable that in 2009 this minimal level of protection is being proposed in law.  We wish to protect fathers in this situation by providing that fathers who are named on a birth certificate can veto adoption unless the court gives the go ahead.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 7, the power to dispense, without any attempt to even notify the father, is much too wide.  The High Court can dispense without notice to the father if it believes such action inappropriate.  We suggest this provision be tightened up considerably and that where conception of the child was the result of an offence, namely, rape or incest, there should be no need to notify the father and that otherwise notification should be given.  Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are similar and do not require further comment.</P>
        <P>May I speak at this point to amendment No. 12?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The general theme behind these amendments tabled by the Labour Party requires greater consideration.  It is incumbent upon us to ensure the natural father has particular rights prior to a child being placed for adoption.  The problem with the amendments, and in particular amendment No. 6, is that they are far too rigid in terms of the role they provide for the natural father.  Also, they are not sufficiently balanced.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on section 16 which is close to the current situation under the Adoption Act 1998 which provides rights of consultation with the natural father.  Section 16, as drafted, provides for a much better balance.  It is important that the natural father be consulted and that he should have the right to apply to the authority.  However, we must be realistic.  As has been stated already, in circumstances where a mother is giving up a child for adoption the reality is there is rarely a good and lasting relationship between the parents.  I have already put on record other circumstances such as where a child is conceived through rape, where the father of the child is estranged or where the mother, for good reasons, does not wish to have any continuing relationship between her and the father or the father and child.</P>
        <P>The amendments, in particular amendment No. 6, do not recognise that reality and place too great a rigidity on the rights of the father.  I am concerned about the proposed new section 16(1) which states a child shall not be placed for adoption nor may an application be made without the consent of the father.  This goes against the Bill in situations where, for example, the father has deserted, is unknown or has never had any link with the child beyond conception.  I caution against taking on board these amendments.</P>
        <P>Similarly I am concerned about amendment No. 7 to section 18.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 16 have the same effect and state: &ldquo;the father has committed an offence such that&rdquo;<b>.  </b>It appears to me the Bill as drafted covers the mischief wherein it provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . where the Authority is satisfied that, having regard to&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the nature of the relationship between the father and the mother, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the circumstances of conception of the child,</P>
        <P LI="1">it is inappropriate for the accredited body to contact the father...</P>
        <P FLI="0">This covers the situation.  It would be unduly rigid to require proof of committal of a criminal offence.  There may be all sorts of reasons even where a rape has been committed that the mother has not reported it as such.  That is the reality.  There may be all sorts of reasons why <Col N="376" />it is impossible to say that in fact an offence has been committed.  The authority must be satisfied about the circumstances of conception in order to deem it inappropriate to contact the father.  I believe it is best to leave this as is and to give the authority flexibility in this regard.  It is important to retain the natural rights of the father.  However, we must be careful not to set in stone a rigid system whereby even where there is effectively no ongoing relationship between the child and the father, the father maintains a veto.  The effect of these amendments would be to hamstring the authority, in particular amendment No. 6.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 16 place too onerous a burden on the authority or the mother.  I am opposed to these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two concerns in relation to these amendments.  I am inclined to agree with Senator Bacik in regard to the rigidity of section 16 in particular.  What is the situation if the father cannot be found or if there is not certainty &mdash; this does relate to only this amendment &mdash; in terms of who is the father?  The Minister of State might address those questions.</P>
        <P>Currently as I understand it, the natural father has rights and must be consulted.  As far as I am aware, that is how adoption works.  In a case where a father is consulted and wishes not to be named on the birth certificate, what are the rights of the child as opposed to the rights of the father or mother?  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on those two issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have sympathy with both sides of this argument.  There is an echo of a previous debate here because we are speaking in this regard of the importance of a father in a child&rsquo;s life.  I know we are operating within a particular constitutional architecture and as such the Minister of State will be so guided.  I sympathise with some of the concerns raised by Senators Bacik and Healy Eames.  However, the substance of section 16 appears to be rather onerous, regardless of whether it reflects the status quo, in that it requires a father to advise the authority of his wish to be consulted in regard to a proposal to adopt.  Is it not possible to draft a provision that establishes that where a child&rsquo;s father is guardian, he must be consulted while providing for the circumstance where an offence, such as rape and so on, might have been committed?</P>
        <P>Is it possible to exclude in certain circumstances the right, which otherwise exists, for the father who is a guardian to be consulted and to provide that where the father is not a guardian he may advise the authority of his wish to be consulted?  Is it not possible to deal with the different types of circumstance that can arise giving particular and due respect in the context of all we say nowadays about the importance of fathers in children&rsquo;s lives?  Should that not be reflected in new language that provides for certain duties on the part of the authority towards fathers who are guardians rather than putting the onus on the father to advise the authority?</P>

We need to consider these issues, with deference to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s legitimate concerns and to the fact the Minister of State will have taken careful advice on where stands the Constitution.</P><Col N="377" />
        <P>While it is extremely undesirable that somebody guilty of rape, albeit the matter was never tested in court, would be consulted, surely we should operate in general terms on the principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  Are we or is Senator Bacik straying from that to a degree?  I do not offer that point in a dogmatic way.  These issues must be kept in tension with each other but I am concerned that we are still leaning too far away from the right of a father in normal circumstances to be consulted.  If a father has applied for and is the child&rsquo;s guardian then in all circumstances the onus should be on the authority to consult.</P>

	<P>Section 17(2) continues the current regime where in fact &ldquo;the accredited body before placing the child for adoption, shall take such steps as are reasonably practicable to consult the father&rdquo;.

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I know but in fact there is already sufficient remedy under the Adoption Act 1998, and under the provisions that replicate most of the same procedures in this Bill, the natural father is to be consulted and has the right under section 16 to give notice of his wish to be consulted.  I accept that one should be innocent until proven guilty in the criminal law but we are talking here about the rights of the child.  It would be most unfortunate if an authority had to wait for a conviction before it could act on concerns about particular individuals.  This Bill concerns the rights of the child.  It would be unduly rigid to insist on evidence of a criminal offence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that Senator Bacik may have scrutinised this more carefully than I have.  Section 17 states that the &ldquo;accredited body...shall request the Authority to provide it with a copy of any notice received by the Authority from the father&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for her work in helping me to get the Bill through the House.  She is right.  We do need to read the Bill in light of the sections coming up and clarify some of the issues legitimately raised.  The rights of the father are much improved in this legislation.  The father&rsquo;s consent cannot be dispensed with without reference to the High Court and that is a dramatic improvement on what was there before.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast is not here to press the amendment but we do not intend to accept it because we feel the right balance is struck and section 19 states that in all questions &ldquo;the State, the Authority or the court...shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration&rdquo;.  I apologise to the Leas-Chathaoirleach for going ahead.  That will be the guiding principle in assessing whether the father has been appropriately consulted and if it is sought to dispense with the consent of the father.</P>
        <P>I oppose amendment No. 4 because I think the right balance is struck between the rights of the natural father, the mother and of course the rights of the child.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>My official has given me a prompt.  Section 22 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 provides:</P>
        <P LI="1">The father of a child who was not married to the mother of the child at the date of his or her birth or at any time during the period of 10 months before such birth shall not be required to give information under this Act about the birth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The registrar shall enter the father&rsquo;s details in the register if the mother and father jointly request this or on the production to the registrar of a court order or statutory declaration naming the father of the child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That answers the earlier point because in order to sign a statutory declaration to be a joint guardian one does not have to produce the birth certificate or show that the father was named.  That is what I thought and I am grateful that it has been clarified and that in order to sign the statutory declaration giving the birth father rights of guardianship jointly with the mother there is no requirement that the father be named in the birth certificate.  That is remedied by the Civil Registration Act which strengthens my argument that there could be a similar mechanism for the non-birth partner of a birth mother.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking so much about rights today, the rights of couples, fathers, mothers, and of the child but is it fair to the child that the father can say he does not wish to be named?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, paragraph (<i>b</i>), line 30, after &ldquo;effect&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;stating that she has been fully counselled as to the effect of her decision, that she understands the effect of her decision and that she has made her decision freely&rdquo;.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">There are some good points in this section which deals with the &ldquo;Explanation to mother or guardian as to effect of adoption&rdquo;.  It provides six criteria that must be met before the adoption goes ahead.  Our amendment suggests including another criterion, that the mother has been counselled as to the effect of her decision, understands it and has made it freely.  While the Minister of State might not want to accept the detail of these words, would he accept the principle that a provision of this nature should be built into the legislation?  In other words, a certain amount of work should be done with the mother before a final decision is made.  If one examines the history of adoption over the years, one will find cases of mothers who now feel, retrospectively, that not enough work was done with them before they gave their children up for adoption.  Many women believe that they did not have enough time or information to make their decision or that the consequences of what they were doing were not spelled out.  When a woman is deciding whether to give her child up for adoption, it is obviously a highly emotional time.  That makes it all the more important that she is given every opportunity to discuss the decision, to get counselling and to receive as much information as possible.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on this straightforward amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment that is to be proposed will give Senators an opportunity to speak as part of a wider debate.  In my contribution on the motion I have moved, I hope to talk about the legislative changes that are needed.  The amendment that has been tabled refers to the ongoing difficulties that exist.  While I accept that many of them need to be addressed, I suggest that now is not the time to do that.  Specific legislative proposals are required to bring about the changes that are needed.  I hope Senators can take that on board in line with the spirit in which this motion has been moved.  I hope the motion will move the debate away from the narrow macroeconomic issues with which we have been consumed over the past year.  It is obvious that global difficulties are affecting flows of capital.  Nations and large institutions are finding it difficult to access credit.  These difficulties are having their most marked effects on individuals.  The extent to which credit is made available to people depends on the economic standing they have in the first instance.  The difficulty is that people are excluded from credit for reasons that are sometimes arbitrary, especially in recessionary times.  When access to credit is denied to people, they are pushed further down the social ladder.</P>
        <P>The concept of microfinance, which has been developed and refined internationally, is growing in popularity in Ireland.  I will explain that a particularly Irish version of microfinance has been available for many years.  I hope this debate will focus on microfinance as one of the means of achieving national economic recovery.  In its ultimate sense, microfinance involves giving people who cannot get credit by ordinary means access to small sums of money to help them materially as they develop the lives they lead and wish to pursue.  In developing countries, there has been a tendency for community groups to benefit from microfinance.  Most of those involved in microfinance in such countries are women, who tend to be excluded from credit by the nature of conventional credit in most societies.  The principle that underpins the concept of microfinance facilitates the flow in a community of funds that would not otherwise be available.</P>
        <P>Microfinance is especially helpful for people who are establishing employment opportunities.  The most recent unemployment figures show that Ireland has entered a phase of double-digit unemployment, sadly.  Opportunities need to be offered to individuals, families and communities to help them to meet the challenges they encounter.  One of the effects of large-scale unemployment is that it does not discriminate between the communities in which it occurs.  We know from our experience during previous economic downturns that if the national unemployment rate is 10%, the rate in certain communities is two to three times that figure.  We need to avoid a recurrence of that phenomenon by offering certain means of financial support.  A version of microfinance has been made available in Ireland over the years through this country&rsquo;s credit union movement, which is almost 60 years old.  Credit unions offer people small loans to allow them to do some of the things that microfinance allows them to do.  The loans offered by credit unions continue to represent a small proportion of overall lending in this <Col N="381" />country.  When credit union lending is considered in the context of overall lending in this country, it is clear it is not as targeted as it could be.</P>
        <P>Other countries have put in place legislative means of doing what I propose we should do.  The US Community Reinvestment Act provides for money from social and commercial lending institutions to be reinvested in particular geographical areas.  We need to take this concept on board as we continue to re-examine how we structure our banks and financial institutions.  One of the lessons we should learn from the banking and financial crisis is that lending practices have not been used to add greater value to certain localities or even to the country as a whole.  The prime criterion has been to achieve the highest return in the quickest possible time.  It may be difficult for some people to accept there should be a social dimension to the lending of money.  On behalf of the Green Party, I contend that the adoption of such a principle would lead to greater long-term returns for society and for those who make the original investment.</P>
        <P>The amendment to this motion that will be moved mentions many of the difficulties that have been faced by the Irish credit union movement over the years.  It, perhaps, mirrors the position in which Irish banks and financial institutions find themselves.  There are liquidity difficulties.  It is somewhat apposite that tonight&rsquo;s debate takes place shortly after a recent news report referred to the registrar of credit unions, who operates within the Office of the Financial Regulator, moving against a particular credit union.  I am probably very familiar with that credit union as it is on the main road between Cork and Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>At the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very large credit union and maybe some of its difficulties and those of other larger credit unions were caused by their attempts to be like banks &mdash; it was a case of too much too soon.  Approximately 14 larger credit unions have broken away from the Irish League of Credit Unions in recent years.  The credit union concerned, Mitchelstown Credit Union, was the first in Ireland to have an ATM machine.  Adopting many of the characteristics of conventional banking may have created difficulties.</P>
        <P>Many of the difficulties credit unions have are a combination of the credit crisis that exists anyway and legislative bars that exist due to legislation that needs to be reviewed.  The Credit Union Act 1997 is 12 years old.  It is an unofficial rule of thumb that ten years is the best period in which to review such legislation.  With the changes being forced upon us we have an opportunity to examine the relationship between financial institutions and regulation in general, and how the credit union movement needs to be looked at in terms of how and by whom it is regulated and the legal structures.  Now that a central banking commission has been proposed to supersede the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, there is an opportunity for Members to question whether the registrar of credit unions should remain there or in a separate structure.</P>
        <P>There are arguments by the credit unions about the types of restrictions they feel have been placed on them under the legislation.  This is ironic because there seems to be more effectiveness or a greater willingness in terms of resources to use a regulation system for credit unions that did not apply to the conventional banking system.  The office charged with enforcing that regulation, the registrar of credit unions, would argue that the legislation ties its hands in having the most effective form of regulation.  I note that both problems are put outside.  There are three problems: liquidity, the problems the registrar finds regarding enforcing regulations and the problems the credit unions have with the legislation.</P>
        <P>The hope is that tonight&rsquo;s debate will address the need to re-evaluate the Credit Union Act and put in place a better Act and a system of regulation.  This is needed for our system of social finance in this country and for better defining and using social finance, as it is for conventional <Col N="382" />banks and other financial institutions.  On those grounds I move the motion and look forward to an open and interesting debate this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am very happy to second the motion.  I would like to address particularly the issue of microfinancing across Europe and the need to promote a much greater availability of these services to address the growing levels of unemployment due to the economic crisis in the EU and globally.  As my colleague, Senator Boyle, said, microfinance aims to close the gap by providing small-size financing services to those who are excluded from traditional banks.  Microfinance initiatives have been very successful in developing countries but to date this success has not been transmitted fully to the European microfinance sector.  According to the EU multiannual programme, MAP, for enterprise and entrepreneurship, microfinance focuses on the supply of loans up to a maximum of &euro;25,000 to new and already existing microenterprises.  At European level it is the Green Party&rsquo;s view that policy makers must provide greater facilities for microcredit for the new unemployed.</P>
        <P>In 2003, before the credit crisis and the knock-on effects on the European and global economy had hit, the European Commission&rsquo;s report on microcredit for small businesses and business creation said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The insufficient supply of microloans is a major issue, in particular where business founders are unemployed persons, women or part of ethnic minorities.  Supporting the supply of microloans is, therefore, not only an issue of entrepreneurship and economic growth, but also of social inclusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In Europe 2 million enterprises are created every year, 90% of which are microenterprises with fewer than five employees.  Many reports note the success of microlending around the world.  Nearly 70 million individuals are served by microfinancing institutions, MFIs, worldwide.  A European survey in 2001 found that 93% of the 2.5 million European SMEs are also microenterprises.</P>
        <P>Within five or six years of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, microfinance institutions in central and eastern Europe and the new independent states had attracted more than 1.7 million borrowers and 2.3 million depositors with an average client growth rate of 30% per year.  In addition to the involvement of MFIs and NGOs in providing microfinance in eastern Europe, commercial banks also became increasingly interested in downscaling to provide microloans for the poor.  In those years the microfinance sector expanded and became more highly structured.</P>
        <P>In western Europe microfinance is regarded as a tool for economic growth and social cohesion, and many small businesses and families that lack access to financial services, in spite of our banking network, tend to turn to microfinance services.  Micro and small enterprises form the core of the western European economic system, representing 99% of the 2 million start-up enterprises created every year.  Traditionally one third of these enterprises have been launched by the unemployed.  We should take on board that important point as we face into a number of years when we can expect EU unemployment levels to grow considerably.  These businesses have both an economic and a social impact and the ability of the traditional banking system to reach and serve such small entities is vital to the achievement of general socioeconomic improvement.  Exclusion from banking services generally constitutes a major obstacle to the launch of new business activities.</P>
        <P>The European Microfinance Network report 2007 on the status of microfinance in western Europe noted:</P><Col N="383" />
        <P LI="1">Demand for microfinance in western Europe is less strong than in less developed countries.  Yet [this is difficult to understand] the share of micro enterprises &mdash; enterprises with less than ten employees &mdash; amounts to 93% of all European enterprises.  Small and microenterprises account for 65% of the European GDP.  A recent European survey among existing companies noted that sufficient access to capital is still a huge constraint for about 20% of European MSMEs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The European Microfinance Network report 2007 also noted:</P>
        <P LI="1">Microfinance programmes in western Europe are not and possibly will not become profitable, but make economic sense.  The average costs for someone supported within a microfinance scheme &mdash; particularly since the monetary support is interest bearing and repayable &mdash; are often below the cost for one year of support within the traditional social welfare system, where costs thereby incurred are &ldquo;lost&rdquo; subsidies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will give some other significant facts on the microlending sector in western Europe.  It is a relatively young sector and there is plenty of room for it to expand and grow.  Some 70% of the microlending organisations in the then EU 15 have been established since 2000 and 17% of those have begun lending since 2005.  In the EU 25, 41% of micro-loan clients are women, 7% are ethnic minorities, 7% are immigrants, 7% are youth and less than 1% persons with a disability.  Most microfinance institutions focus on start-up business or registered businesses with fewer than five employees.  A significant number also assist businesses in the pre-start up phase by financing feasibility studies and the like.</P>
        <P>In 2005, 27,000 microloans were disbursed in the EU 25.  By country, the greatest coverage was in Poland, France and Finland.  In France and Finland, single organisations disbursed 95% to 100% of all microloans and, similarly, in Poland one organisation made 80% of the loans reported in the new member states.</P>
        <P>In Europe loans worth &euro;25,000 or less are considered to be microloans.  The maximum size of microloans provided ranges from &euro;25,000 to &euro;37,000.  The average loan size across Europe is approximately &euro;7,700.  In the EU 15 the average loan value is &euro;10,240 and in the new member states it is &euro;3,800.  The average maximum interest rate is 10% and the average minimum rate is 4%.  This varies greatly according to the regulations in each country, with the UK having the highest rates in western Europe and Poland having the highest rates in the new member states.</P>
        <P>The provision of support and advice is also a crucial aspect of microfinance in western Europe.  Some 70% of microlenders offer training and counselling on a range of related subjects.  Only 20% of microlenders offer financial services other than loans for microenterprise, development and self-employment.  Those other financial services which are provided include consumer personal loans, savings products, transfer services and insurance.</P>
        <P>The repayment rate on average is 92% and the average portfolio at risk is 11%.  Microlenders have widely varying operational performances across Europe demonstrating a need to agree common performance indicators and a focus on capacity building.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the Green Party believes the model of microfinance needs to be promoted and mainstreamed to a much greater extent in the current economic situation in which we find ourselves.  We will see large numbers of people becoming unemployed over the coming years and the microfinancing model seems to offer an opportunity for those who become unemployed to avoid long-term unemployment, to start up their own enterprises and to promote their social inclusion and also the economic cohesion and stability of member states.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  He and I have a vested interest in this as the founder of the Irish credit union movement, Ms Nora Herlihy, was a member of our trade union.  As a founder member of one of the larger credit unions, the INTO credit union, I feel a certain proprietorial interest in this.</P>
        <P>There is also a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> in that I stood here two years ago trying to put forward a proposal for an independent savings protection scheme for credit unions.  It was opposed by the Government at that time on the basis that talks were going ahead between the Irish League <Col N="385" />of Credit Unions, the regulator and the Department of Finance to do just that.  I was given a commitment that the talks would be concluded and that legislation would be brought forward or at least there would be a conclusion to the negotiations by 31 March last year.  Nothing has happened.</P>
        <P>It is my firm belief, backed up with much information here and there, that the regulator is being stymied in every move he makes by the Department of Finance which takes the view of the Irish League of Credit Unions at every opportunity.  The Irish League of Credit Unions does not agree with the concept of an independent, self-regulated savings protection fund.  The league wants to run it.  It is utterly inappropriate that a representative body should also run the savings protection scheme, and no doubt the Deputy Leader would agree.</P>
        <P>Everybody agrees on the issue of the need to have the legislation amended, which the Deputy Leader raised clearly.  We discussed that also.  It has not happened.  My colleague, Senator Ross, who will speak on this, has raised the question of regulation time and again.  This is a classic example of where people will no doubt eventually blame the regulator, but I want to put on the record that the Department of Finance has refused to implement the views of the regulator on a number of occasions, as I read in recent newspaper articles, which apparently are true, where there was a leaked letter which showed exactly that.  I want to give two examples.  This is crucial.</P>
        <P>I do not have a problem with the proposal on microfinance but I do have a problem with the idea of extending the structures and putting in place new structures of microfinance when we have not got the existing microfinancing system, namely, the credit union movement, properly regulated with proper levels of governance.  I will put this simply.  The regulator has time and again put forward guidelines on the type of prudential investment that would be appropriate to credit unions and sent them out, and they have been ignored by many credit unions.</P>
        <P>Even though it is correct to say, as Senator Boyle did, that the credit union movement has the difficulties I have outlined in the amendment, it is also important to state that a significant number of credit unions are being run properly and prudentially with good governance.  When the people went to form CUDA years ago it is incorrect to state that they left because they wanted to form themselves into banks or a bank.  They left because they wanted to modernise the structures at a time when there were all sorts of allegations that the credit union movement was being used to launder funds of criminals and that proper governance provisions were not in place.  This was why they wanted to put provisions in place.</P>
        <P>The regulator did his job and put forward the guidelines.  Those credit unions which thumbed their noses at him were allowed to continue because we, as legislators, would not give him the authority to make them stick.  That is a matter on which I hope the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs will take strong action.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the regulator also put forward guidelines on governance, dealing particularly with how audit and debt should be dealt with.  My telephone has been ringing in my office for the past two to three years with people telling of the bad practices in badly run credit unions such as the use of tricks.  An example would be people putting tuppence into a loan account of &euro;5,000 once a year to show it was still active and not a bad debt.  This goes on and nobody can stop it.</P>
        <P>We will ask at some stage, like we asked in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, why the auditors did not spot it.  The auditors are watchdogs, not bloodhounds.  They cannot pick up these matters.  The only way to deal with it is for us to give the power to the regulator to insist that what are now guidelines would be rules the credit unions would have to implement on the management of debt, the provision for bad debt, the issue of investment and all the other areas such as accounting, auditing and reporting standards.  Knowing the Deputy Leader as well as I <Col N="386" />do, I cannot believe that he could not accept the need to put that in place.  It is exactly a mirror image at a smaller level of what is going on in the banks and I ask him to look at it carefully.</P>
        <P>What the Deputy Leader stated about microfinance is important because the credit union movement has given a good name to sub-prime lending.  It is the only sector which has managed sub-prime lending.  Well-run credit unions have given loans to people who cannot get them anywhere else knowing that if they gave a loan to a person for painting the front of his or her shop or building a small extension to his or her house, a staff member on their way to the next credit union meeting could see whether anything was happening and if not, could ask whether the credit union gave a loan to that person and what he or she was doing with the money.  The debt is managed all the way through.  Credit unions manage the liability and the debt right through from beginning to end and do not sell it on.  The issue with the banking crisis was not just sub-prime lending.  The selling on of the liability was also a problem.  There are lessons that we can learn from it.</P>
        <P>The credit union is also the only remaining mutual financial institution.  I will acknowledge the EBS and perhaps one or two others.</P>

	<P>There is that other one that has been in the news a great deal lately which is also supposedly mutual.  I make no comment on that.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that one third of all credit unions lost money in the first quarter accounts which were published and sent to the regulator.  One third of credit unions, many of them small in size, were losing between &euro;100,000 and &euro;1.2 million annually.  That is a fact and it is time someone did something about it.  There is an unprecedented combination of bad debt, liquidity problems, investment losses and falling deposits that could create a perfect storm for credit unions where they could collapse and be lost.  Many of them are not run properly and will not be run properly until we have put in place the measures I have outlined.</P>
        <P>The Davy bonds, the perpetual bonds, the treasury funds and the ISTC bonds have all lost huge amounts.  At least one credit union has lost more than &euro;10 million, with others losing millions in perpetual bonds.  They have tried to get some of the money back but cannot get access to it.  They went to the League of Credit Unions, which is supposed to provide liquidity in these situations, but it has refused so there are now credit unions lending money to each other.  It is not illegal and is covered by legislation as long as the regulator approves, but there are things going on that we do not know about.</P>
        <P>Until we deal with these issues, and do what I asked &mdash; ask the Government to provide liquidity while giving additional powers to the regulator &mdash; we are looking at trouble.  I said two years ago that we were looking at problems.  Were it not for the Government decision of 30 September we would have had huge problems.  We are now looking at new problems but they can easily be dealt with through legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the motion.  It is unfortunate for the proposers of this motion that when they put it down, it was bland and innocuous and probably meant to launch them on a crusade that identifies with a movement generally considered to be harmless, successful and socially beneficial.  What happened yesterday and today was tough on them, with events in Mitchelstown particularly unfortunate for Senator Boyle, being that it is his bailiwick.  It was, however, useful for the sake of the debate.</P>
        <P>There is a politically acceptable view of credit unions: they are good, they are involved in social finance, they are not banks in the classic sense and they operate in a way that helps <Col N="387" />those who do not or cannot have bank accounts.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right, in some ways they are the classic sub-prime lenders in that they lend to people banks will not lend to because they might be a greater risk, they lend smaller amounts of money and take fewer risks while doing a certain amount of social good, lending at lower rates and offering higher rates for savings.</P>
        <P>It was a pity, therefore, that the bombshell broke in the newspapers this week that at least one credit union was in big trouble.  We then had the usual obfuscating, with everyone issuing statements saying the credit unions are fine and that there are only one or two things wrong and they will be remedied in the next few days so everything will be okay, to reassure those involved and make sure there is not a run on the credit union.  I do not know if there was a run on the credit union in Mitchelstown but if I had read <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, I would have taken my money out and suggest others would have done the same.</P>
        <P>Credit unions are not well regulated.  Traditionally they are a strange species in that they were founded by a laudable person who is generally respected and they have not been regulated because no one wants to use a big stick on those who appear to be doing good in the community, which they are doubtless doing.  The problem there is that they are frequently seen by others as an accident waiting to happen and sometimes they are an accident that has happened.  It is helpful that Senator O&rsquo;Toole in the amendment has starkly spelled out, at great length &mdash; perhaps he took pleasure in that when drafting it &mdash; the problems that exist for credit unions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact that almost a third of Irish credit unions had first quarter losses on an annualised basis of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;1.2 million is quite worrying.  That they have liquidity problems, with many unable to pay dividends, is a flashing amber light.  That makes one ask if Mitchelstown is a problem today, what will happen tomorrow?  We are offered reassuring statements from the Financial Regulator and others, stating there are only ten out of 400 credit unions in trouble.  That is quite a lot in such a situation and it is only ten out of 400 that have been discovered.</P>
        <P>Credit unions have always been a murky, uninvestigated world.  I do not mean that in a sinister sense, I mean it in the sense that they have not been regulated in any strict way.  The same is true of the banks, although the formalities for regulating the banks were particularly stringent.  They were not, however, applied.  What worries me most about this motion and the state of the credit unions is that the Financial Regulator has his paws on these institutions.  To read about these problems in the last two days and then find out the institution that monitors them is the same institution that has been completely discredited in its monitoring of the banks makes me wonder if they have done anything at all to monitor credit unions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Financial Regulator had a real problem with the banks.  It had a light touch, was principles-based and had targets for inspections but it did not live up to those principles or carry out those inspections.  It fell far short of its own extraordinarily modest targets.  One must wonder if putting the Financial Regulator in charge of the credit unions offers any protection.  I suggest it does not and what happens in cases like this is identical to what happened in the banks: someone discovered what happened, in this case through a letter being leaked to <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Financial Regulator discovers it itself, says it must investigate, claims it will set things right and that it will not happen again.  As a result we must question if the credit unions are really being regulated properly at all.  I doubt that.</P>
        <P>I do not know much about the subject but I am aware that some years ago there was a crisis that the tax liable on depositors was getting special treatment or a blind eye was being turned to those who had deposits, particularly on the DIRT issue.  There was a difficulty that was never properly resolved as to whether people were paying tax gross or net, if they had to declare it and if the credit unions were declaring it.  Social finance is a magnificent idea but it <Col N="388" />must be subject to regulation that is as stringent, if not more so, as that of the banks.  It has been the subject of a large number of accidents and appears to be utterly disorganised in its regulation.  Whereas the aspirations in the motion are laudable, the amendment spells out the truth, which is that there is an enormous need for a far more exacting and forensic examination of these particular groups.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht seans a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an r&uacute;n at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair.  I welcome the opportunity provided by the debate on this motion to outline for Senators the extent and range of initiatives being taken by the Government to increase the flow of credit to the community sector, to small and medium sized enterprises and in the area of social finance.  In light of the extent and range of measures put in place, I will deal with this in three broad areas: measures to get credit flowing to enterprises, credit unions and social finance.</P>
        <P>In acting resolutely to ensure the continued functioning of the banking sector in this economy, the Government has focussed directly on the access to credit by small and medium enterprises.  As part of the recapitalisation package announced in February, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their earlier commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009.  The banks have committed to public campaigns to actively promote their lending to these sectors.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to small and medium enterprises.  Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator.  These banks have also committed to public campaigns actively to promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  The banks will make quarterly reports to the Financial Regulator, with the first report to end March 2009 to be submitted by end April 2009.</P>
        <P>There have been reports that customers with viable business propositions are being refused credit, but there are also reports to suggest that falling demand for credit is the main cause of reduced credit flow.  Notwithstanding these conflicting positions, a perception of limited credit availability can be damaging at this time of fragile business and consumer confidence.  An accurate assessment of the situation is vital and the Government has therefore decided there should be an independent review of bank lending to report within a short timeframe.  The banks have undertaken to co-operate fully with this review and to engage constructively in implementing any recommendations made.  The appointment of independent consultants to conduct this review is imminent.</P>
        <P>The recapitalised banks have also agreed to engage in a clearing group chaired by a Government representative and including representation from business interests and State agencies.  The purpose of this group will be to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.</P>
        <P>In addition, a statutory code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February.  This code will apply to all regulated banks and building societies.  It will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency, and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.  Where a customer gets into difficulty, the banks will give the customer <Col N="389" />reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.</P>
        <P>Accessing seed finance for start-ups is critical for continuous economic development.  Companies developing new products and services tend to make significant expenditure on research and development and have the potential to create significant new employment, particularly for graduates.  Building on the banks&rsquo; commitment to the indigenous venture sector, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland are both committing a further &euro;15 million each to new or existing seed capital funds, in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s seed and venture capital programme.  The banks&rsquo; funding will be matched, as appropriate, by funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s seed and venture capital programme and/or by funding from other national or international investors.</P>
        <P>The recapitalised banks have confirmed they have each established, or are about to introduce, a &euro;100 million fund to support environmentally friendly investment and innovations in clean energy.  One of the recapitalised banks has already launched a &euro;100 million fund to support the financing of Irish based renewable energy projects and plans further initiatives in this area.</P>
        <P>Prompt payment is important to underpin cash flow, particularly for small businesses.  The recapitalised banks have committed to prompt payment arrangements in future customer contracts, which will involve payment within 30 days and a late payment interest charge on any payments made after 30 days.</P>
        <P>The Government is confident the measures I have outlined will support the flow of credit to small and medium enterprises, which is of course critical to continued economic development in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the issue of credit unions.  The Government places immense value on the important role that credit unions play in Ireland.  The continued success and growth of the movement in recent years stand as a testament both to the trust and loyalty felt by its members, and the dedication and commitment of all credit union staff, both professional and volunteer.  Even with an increasingly wider range of financial service providers to choose from, due to their not-for-profit and co-operative nature, credit unions are still seen as the natural choice in many communities for people to save with and borrow from.</P>
        <P>The Credit Union Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions.  Within this framework the registrar of credit unions, within the Office of the Financial Regulator, is responsible for the operation of the regulatory and supervisory regime for credit unions.  The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflected and promoted the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions.</P>
        <P>The Credit Union Act has provided the legal and regulatory framework within which the credit union movement in Ireland has continued to grow and develop over recent years.  The growth in assets of credit unions, largely comprising members&rsquo; savings, highlights the continued success of credit unions in meeting the financial needs of local communities and occupational groups falling within the common bond.</P>
        <P>The rules-based approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their directors and members.  It has helped to support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard members&rsquo; savings during a period of rapid growth.  The Act provides some discretion to the registrar of credit unions to issue regulatory directions to individual credit unions in these matters.</P><Col N="390" />
        <P>The amendment to the motion claims the regulator has no effective power against non-compliance.  As far as the points on regulation in the amendment are concerned, it is important to point out that the registrar of credit unions is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions under the powers of the Credit Union Act 1997.  This rules-based legislation provides extensive powers of direction to the registrar to ensure the financial soundness and safety of credit unions and to protect credit union savers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He cannot safeguard them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>May I finish?  The registrar can also issue regulatory direction and prohibition orders to a credit union concerning a broad range of issues, including investments, raising of funds, loans, assets and liability ratios, and the composition of their assets and liabilities.  The registrar has extensive powers of inspection and investigation of credit unions as well as broad supervisory powers, for example, to appoint, suspend or remove a person as a director of a credit union, or to remove auditors.  A number of offences are also provided for in the 1997 Act.  In view of the extensive powers available to the registrar under the Act, it cannot be said the regulatory system relies on guidance only to credit unions.  The Government, however &mdash; this is an important point for Senator O&rsquo;Toole &mdash; remains open to consider further legislative reform on the basis that proposals are agreed in consultation with the major stakeholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main priority for safeguarding credit unions over recent years has been the reform of the Irish League of Credit Unions savings protection scheme.  The Minister for Finance is considering legislative proposals for the stabilisation in the context of the preparation of the financial services deposit guarantee scheme Bill 2009 which will be ready to be published during this session.  The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to give effect to the Government decision to increase to &euro;100,000, with effect from 20 September 2008, the protection for deposits with banks and building societies and to extend it to credit unions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Recent media reports have highlighted difficulties which the registrar of credit unions is dealing with in a minority of credit unions.  The registrar has highlighted that of the 419 credit unions registered in the Republic, only a handful are affected by these difficulties.  The registrar is continuing to work closely with the boards of these credit unions that are encountering problems.  Very close oversight, monitoring and controls over these credit unions by the registrar of credit unions are intended to assist them in addressing current issues and to ensure their long-term stability and sustainability.</P>
        <P>It must be stressed that, following the Government&rsquo;s decision last September on the extension and increase in protection available under the deposit guarantee scheme, all credit union savers can be reassured that their deposits and shares to the total maximum value of &euro;100,000 are safe and secure.  In addition, the credit union movement as a whole is in a relatively strong financial position with solid liquidity and reserves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It should also be noted that the Irish League of Credit Unions maintains a savings protection fund in excess of &euro;100 million which is available to help stabilise the position of any credit union that encounters problems.</P>
        <P>At the heart of social finance is the concept of repayable loan financing provided at affordable terms for community-based projects and enterprises and local development initiatives.  The objective is to provide access to credit for projects that would not be able to access loan finance from the mainstream financial system.  Social finance encompasses the provision of micro-credit particularly for small enterprises.  The key difference between social finance and commercial <Col N="391" />lending lies in the fact that social finance considers the wider social benefits from a social finance project going ahead.</P>
        <P>Responding to two important reports advocating the development of social finance, Social Finance in Ireland launched by the then Taoiseach in September 2003, and In the Common Interest &mdash; the Case for Social Finance, the then Minister for Finance announced in the 2006 budget a commitment to launch the social finance initiative so as to enhance the availability of loan finance for social and developmental projects in local communities.  The social partnership agreement Towards 2016 endorses the establishment of the Social Finance Foundation.</P>
        <P>The initiative has been implemented through the establishment of an independent wholesale social finance provider, the Social Finance Foundation, which was launched by the then Minister for Finance in February 2007.  The foundation was established on a not-for-profit basis to act as a wholesale supplier of social finance for on-lending by specialist social lending organisations to support social and developmental projects and social enterprise in local communities.  The foundation is a private company established under company law and is governed by its board of directors under its memorandum and articles of association.</P>
        <P>On its launch, the foundation received seed funding of &euro;25 million from the banking sector for distribution to qualifying social lending organisations, SLOs, that on-lend to individual social finance projects.  Several organisations have been accredited by the foundation as SLOs.  As of December 2008, loans totalling &euro;9 million have been approved by the foundation, of which &euro;5.4 million had been drawn down, including a number of micro-credit loans.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the foundation is to use social finance to support social and developmental projects in communities and social enterprise.  The foundation acts as a wholesale finance supplier providing repayable capital to social finance lenders who in turn lend to individual social and community projects.</P>
        <P>By providing loans on a wholesale basis to SLOs that have the capacity and skills to manage lending to individual projects, the foundation will act as a catalyst for the further development of the social finance concept in Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s intention is to stimulate the potential present in our communities to ensure the quality and standard of local social and community infrastructure can be on a par with our level of economic development.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 endorses the establishment of the social finance foundation and provides that it will engage with and support existing providers, agencies and established networks of social finance providers and any new providers emerging from the sector.  The foundation, in conjunction with relevant interests, is also examining ways to progress the investment of capital in social finance providers by charities, private individuals and businesses.</P>
        <P>Several voluntary organisations have been active for some years in the area of social and micro-finance.  For example, Clann Credo and First Step have each supported a wide range of projects with social finance.  First Step has specialised in providing micro-finance to projects that cannot access funding from other sources.</P>
        <P>The foundation is independent of the Government, although the Minister for Finance is responsible, for example, for nominating the chair and must consent to the appointment of directors.  The Government, which has worked to facilitate the development of social finance, intends that the experience gained from the foundation&rsquo;s activities will help to guide the development of social finance in Ireland.  Through the initiatives I have outlined to increase the flow of credit to the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, the actions of the Government are fully consistent with the objectives of this motion.</P>

	<P>When this motion was first put down by the Green Party, it had not expected the events that occurred last weekend which have made this a far more interesting debate.  The two Green Party Members, however, gave us a history of micro-finance across Europe, never addressing any issues raised in Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.  Neither did the Minister of State address these issues.</P>
        <P>There is nothing micro-finance about the credit unions.  They have been a significant player and have large funds.  Micro-loans may be considered micro by the banks but for the individuals with low incomes involved, the sums loaned by the credit unions are hugely significant.  It is important the issues raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole are addressed by the Minister of State.  There is a clear conflict between what he told the House and the concerns raised in the amendment to the motion.  He claimed, &ldquo;the credit union movement as a whole is in a relatively strong financial position with solid liquidity and reserves&rdquo; which has been questioned.  The Minister of State cannot gloss over these concerns.  There is nothing cuddly and sweet about this; it is a serious issue.</P>
        <P>It was also stated,&ldquo;It should also be noted that the Irish League of Credit Unions maintains a savings protection fund in excess of &euro;100 million which is available to help stabilise the position of any credit union that encounters problems&rdquo;.  I do not believe the league is in the position to bail out all the credit unions if they run into financial difficulties.  The Minister of State is also aware that the regulator does not have the powers he claims.  The regulator can give direction but so too can many people.  Even when the regulator has more than just direction, we see matters going wrong.  The Minister of State must respond to this because it is far too serious.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also had plenty of time to study the amendment to the motion.  It is an insult to the House that the amendment was printed well in advance of the debate but that neither Senator from the Green Party referred to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators on the Government side did not refer to the points of concern raised in the amendment.  In addition, the Minister of State appeared to contradict what is stated in the amendment.  Clarification is required in respect of these matters.</P>
        <P>If the problems that beset the banking system are also at play in respect of credit unions, this will have a major impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  I accept that the sums of money involved would not be enormous &mdash; they would certainly not be of the order of the billions required to recapitalise the two main banks &mdash; but millions of euro would still be required.  There is also the fact that a far greater number of people would be affected in an extremely personal way if credit unions began to encounter difficulties.  Members of the Green Party, who are in government after all, must take these matters on board.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca stated that policy decisions must be made.  Those in the Green Party should wake up.  They are in government and are responsible for making such decisions.  If they have good ideas to put forward, we would be delighted to hear them.  Whenever Senator Boyle contributes to the debates on Private Members&rsquo; motions tabled by those on this side of the House, he states that we need to do more, to expand on the points we are making and to put forward proposals.  The ball is now in his court and he should follow his own advice.  When replying to this debate, perhaps Senator Boyle might put forward the policies he would like to see being implemented and the protection he would like to be afforded to people who have saved their money with credit unions and to those institutions themselves in order that ordinary citizens will not suffer if anything goes wrong.</P><Col N="393" />
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole put forward counterpoints to those contained in the original motion which are easily understandable.  These counterpoints must be addressed in a serious manner by the Minister of State in the coming days.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks plc and Bank of Ireland.  A number of weeks ago I made a contribution in respect of that matter but on this occasion I will try to shy away from mentioning the billions of euro we will be obliged to pay to get people out of the mess in which they find themselves.  I will instead focus on what will happen to ordinary people who entered into fixed rate agreements for mortgages and loans with Allied Irish Banks plc or Bank of Ireland.  The individuals to whom I refer are not in a position to break the contracts into which they entered and if they approach their local Deputies, they are informed that they should write to their bank manager.  The reply that is usually received from the latter indicates that it will cost X amount to break the contract.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact that the Government has recapitalised these banks and taken so much action in respect of the banking system, has any of its Ministers raised with senior bank officials the possibility of people breaking fixed rate contracts in order that they will not be penalised?  Given that the Government is now intent on increasing taxes, not being able to break such a contract will have a major effect on many people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Twomey for so generously sharing time.  I cannot understand why the Government could not accept the amendment tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Apart from any other consideration, the Senator possesses quite an amount of knowledge in respect of this matter because he is a founder member of a credit union.  He has placed before the House certain clear facts which are apparently inarguable.  As far as I can see, the Minister of State replied to them with bluster and assertion and I am surprised that he would do so.</P>
        <P>I heard a report on the BBC World Service in respect of an Indian national &mdash; I believe he is a doctor &mdash; who is one of the originators of microfinance within his country.  The immense good that can be done by the spreading of comparatively small loans out into communities is what I have always understood to underpin the notion of credit unions.  I have various friends who are members of the credit unions in RTE and elsewhere and I am aware of the wonderful work these institutions do in supporting ordinary people.  Credit unions provide people with loans to purchase cars, pay for weddings or funerals or fund repairs to their homes.  Such lending is extremely socially constructive in nature.</P>
        <P>When listening to the radio again in recent days, I discovered that the Mitchelstown credit union, which I hope will survive and prosper, has 17,000 members and had got above itself to some degree.  I understand that some of the loans it has extended to people were for amounts up to &euro;250,000.  I would imagine that a loan for this amount represents exactly what is meant by a sub-prime mortgage.  I presume that one would use &euro;250,000 either to support another loan which has gone bad or to finance the purchase of a house.  This matter gives rise to serious cause for concern.</P>
        <P>I was trying to recall the identity of a certain person who was involved in the foundation of the credit union movement in Ireland 50 years ago and I realised that Marian Finucane&rsquo;s aunt was the individual in question.  Ms Finucane often speaks about her aunt with great pride and she is perfectly right in doing so.</P>
        <P>More than 50% of the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution related directly to the amendment tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  One of the points he made, which was extremely instructive, is that the Financial Regulator does not have a very good track record.  Regulators in this country are, in general, under suspicion.  In addition, the Financial Regulator lacks teeth.  When the House debated the legislation relating to libel, I raised a question as to whether the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; <Col N="394" />actually means command.  Those on the Government side stated that it does not mean command and provided legal definitions to support their assertion.  They cannot have it both ways.  Either the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; means that one can command or inform people to implement a particular regime or else its meaning is different.  The Minister of State indicated that the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; does mean to command but Government advisers previously stated that it implies no such meaning.  It seems the Financial Regulator is quite ineffective if it can only exhort institutions to take certain actions but does not possess the means to compel them to do so.</P>
        <P>A clear conflict of fact has arisen in respect of the matter under discussion.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to loan impairments and difficulties relating to liquidity.  I had a brief, whispered conversation with the Senator &mdash; I hope it did not disturb other Members to any great degree &mdash; and I understand the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, has been the subject of appeals from a number of credit unions which are in difficulty and which are seeking funds to improve their liquidity.  The ILCU refused their requests.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  How can the Minister of State assert that their is no problem as regards liquidity?  It simply does not make sense.  I am not stating that the Minister of State is inimical to the truth or even that he is lying, which would be a frightful thing to say.  However, I am stating that he has been ill advised and that the material he has placed on the record of the House should be revised.  I hope he will have an opportunity to make such a revision.  If not, perhaps his colleague, Senator Boyle, or whoever is charged with replying to the debate will address this point.  Those on the Government side are not doing anyone any credit by not correcting the record.</P>
        <P>I could support the Green Party&rsquo;s motion because I completely agree with the concept of microfinance which is extremely positive in social terms.  However, I also strongly support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment.  I would like the opportunity, therefore, to support both in a composite motion.  If the latter is not forthcoming, I shall attempt to gallop back to the House from the micro-reception being held in Trinity College for the pro-chancellor to vote against the motion as tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion, which is extremely positive and which, in light of the position in which we find ourselves, is surprisingly appropriate.  The motion states:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann supports the development of microfinance in this country with greater support of the credit union sector to allow for the creation of local economic initiatives, an important and necessary step towards bringing about national economic recovery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole relates to regulation in banking and would be more appropriate to the debate on a different motion.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the fact that on occasion it takes time for people to recognise a good idea.  The motion is not nebulous in nature; it is positive and extremely realistic.  Proposals that would diminish its impact are unacceptable.  Suggestions from the Opposition to the effect that because the Government has refinanced them, the banks should break legal contracts into which they have entered are nonsensical.  The banks operate on the basis of fixed rates.  Once a person enters into a fixed rate arrangement, a bank can then deal with this by either offsetting the money by paying a lower rate in respect of a long-term investment or by using existing funding.  In other words, it is a fundamental aspect of banking business that once one becomes locked into a fixed rate, a degree of certainty is afforded to the bank and it can then make a <Col N="395" />counter-arrangement to balance that fixed rate.  We could not request the bank to do that.  It would have been wrong and would have broken a legal contract.</P>
        <P>With regard to local developments, 250 years ago a gentleman at the Rock of Cashel in Tipperary developed a type of stout in his back garden.  That stout is Guinness.  We have also seen how the small co-operatives which started&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It was at the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace in Cashel, 250 years ago.  One learns something every day.</P>
        <P>The co-operatives, such as Kerry Co-Op, started as very small enterprises.  They offered a great opportunity for people who had small funding to start something.  I am also conscious of international developments, which show the importance of microfinance.  We can take our lead from the United States.  Let us start with Apple, the company Forrest Gump thought would be a good company to invest in because it was a fruit company.  Of course, he was excellent in choosing his investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he become the Minister for Finance in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>He became the finance spokesman for Fine Gael here.  He knows more about health than he does about finance, that is for sure.</P>
        <P>The Apple corporation was started in a garage by Steve Wozniak.  Coors Brewing Company was started in the 1850s with very small capital and, in more recent times, Michael Dell founded the Dell company in his dormitory room in a Texas university with $1,000.  Electronic Data Systems, EDS, owned by Ross Perot was also started with $1,000.  The toy company, Mattel, was a micro start-up company, as were Wrigleys, Starbucks, e-Bay and so forth.  This is a wonderful opportunity to provide seed capital at micro level to businesses and people who do not currently have a track record.  They can now establish such a track record and, with it, secure further funding.  We do not know what company will emerge successful but the beauty is that it will be an indigenous company.  For that reason, I fully support the prospect of microfinance.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca gave a useful breakdown of microfinance.  The amount at issue is less than &euro;25,000 in the European context.  A total of 2 million enterprises are started every year in Europe and 90% of them are micro enterprises.  A micro enterprise is a company with fewer than five employees.  Worldwide, approximately 70 million individuals are serviced by microfinance institutions.  A total of 93% of the 2.5 million European small and medium enterprises are micro enterprises.  Microfinance offers us an opportunity because local initiatives will be essential for getting us through the severe international crisis we face.</P>
        <P>A number of companies in Ireland provide this type of microfinance but there is room for others.  First Step is an enterprise fund that is co-financed through the private sector and EU seed and venture capital funding.  Bank of Ireland also takes part in this, as does the European Investment Fund loan guarantee scheme.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is involved through the back to work scheme.  A number of companies in this country have already benefited significantly from First Step.  They range from clothing companies to companies producing children&rsquo;s toys.  They got their first step on the business ladder through a small amount of start-up capital.</P>
        <P>Another interesting aspect of microfinance has already been mentioned in connection with the Nobel Peace Prize winner of 2006.  The winner Mohammed Yunus started the Grameen Bank.  He started when he noticed that a Bangladeshi village lady who was making bamboo <Col N="396" />stools learned that she had to borrow the equivalent of 15p to buy raw bamboo for each stool and, after repaying the middleman at interest rates as high as 10% per week, she was left with a 1p profit margin.  That was the incentive for starting the Grameen Bank.  The bank gives loans of less than $100 to individuals.  Approximately 96% of the loans the bank makes are repaid on time, by the poorest of the poor.  The bank has given those people the opportunity to live above subsistence level.  Microfinance in the Third World is bringing people out of poverty.</P>
        <P>I believe there are wonderful opportunities in Ireland for microfinance to develop businesses that otherwise would not have an opportunity to secure finance.  Some people are not good at working through financial institutions and banks, but they might have good ideas and be hard working.</P>
        <P>There has been mention of credit unions.  The Minister said the registrar of credit unions is dealing with issues in a small minority of credit unions, approximately ten out of 419.  Credit unions have deposits of &euro;13 billion.  Deposits in credit unions are secured by the State to the tune of &euro;100,000 for every depositor.  The security credit unions require is already in place through the State guarantee, which some of the Opposition parties voted against.  Had that not been done at the time, we would be in a far worse situation than we are at present.  It is fortunate we had the current Government to deal with that crisis when it arose and it dealt with it correctly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time with my colleague, Senator John Paul Phelan.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s remarks about a combination of the two motions.  While microfinance is very important, especially at this serious time of recession, there must also be proper legislation in place so the regulator can regulate.  That is his job.  What is wrong with this country is that when a regulator is employed, they do not do their job.  We must put the right legislation in place.  The Minister is open to doing that and I welcome his response.  I look forward to hearing his proposals on how to put legislation in place to give the regulator more power.</P>
        <P>Credit unions are there to provide small loans for ordinary people.  It really saddened me in the past couple of days to hear the size of loans that have been given to people and even &mdash; I am sorry to use the &ldquo;D&rdquo; word &mdash; to developers and speculators.  These are now unable to pay back the loans and are causing difficulty for our credit unions.  I resent that.  Mr. Logue was quoted as saying in a letter that there is no contingency plan with regard to Mitchelstown.  Will the Minister explain that?  I accept there is a State guarantee of &euro;100,000 in place for depositors but what would be the regulator&rsquo;s contingency plan if a credit union were to go out of business?</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s and my party&rsquo;s amendment relating to liquidity.  How can the credit union operate if there is no liquidity or capital to lend?  Last year there was a run on a credit union, where moneys were taken out in a hasty manner.  I am concerned that would happen again.  As in the case of the banks, the Government needs to give leadership and reassurance to people that this will not happen.  I strongly support the essence of the motion, that is, to provide microfinance for small and medium size enterprises.  Credit unions are a good means of achieving this objective.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin referred to small community groups.  The Athlone community task force, with which I was involved, was one such organisation that offered small revolving loans.  These were highly beneficial and the group received funding from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and Pobal.  These types of initiatives, most of which were established in the 1980s but became virtually defunct in the past decade, are badly needed again.  Capital needs to be provided to small businesses, those who wish to establish a small company and business start-up courses.  I support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="397" />
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator McFadden for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the motion.</P>
        <P>I find myself in a similar position to Senators McFadden and Norris in that I do not have a problem with the Green Party motion, as worded.  However, it has been overtaken by events and what we have learned in recent days.  Credit unions, including in Thomastown, New Ross and St. Canice&rsquo;s in Kilkenny, are successful and important institutions in the community I represent.  They have done a great deal by providing finance to people who are not in a position to secure a loan from a bank.  The credit union movement deserves great credit for providing funding to meet social requirements, as noted by Senator Norris, and cover the costs of home extensions or new cars.</P>
        <P>There is a danger that the infection which has entered the banking system in recent years will spread to the credit union movement.  The revelations from Mitchelstown resulted in a mini-run on the town&rsquo;s credit union.  We must ensure this is not replicated across the country because credit unions are found in virtually every village in Ireland.  In many cases, they are the only financial institution in the locality.  If disaster befalls credit unions, many people with small savings will be badly affected.  We must ensure the necessary legislation is in place to protect the small savings of ordinary people who have worked hard throughout their lives to build up the credit union movement across the country.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin listed a number of companies which started from a small base.  Virtually every company started small.  Nearly every Irish brand started in someone&rsquo;s house or when a small group of people came together.  Microfinance is a laudable idea and the Government has taken some welcome steps in this area in recent years.  The launch in 2007 of the foundation to which the Minister of State referred, which had funding of &euro;25 million from the banking sector to distribute, was one such initiative.  I note that only &euro;5.4 million of this funding has been drawn down in a number of micro-credit loans in the two years since the fund was established.  While there may be a perfectly legitimate reason for this, I am not aware of it.  Perhaps Senator Boyle will explain.</P>
        <P>The notion, as expressed by Senator Hanafin, that banks will not renegotiate contracts with people who find themselves unable to meet their mortgage repayments is wrong.  Contracts are renegotiated every day of the week and the reality for the 355,000 people who are on the dole, many of whom were made unemployed in the past couple of months, is that they will have to renegotiate with banks and the banks will have to renegotiate with them.  It will not be much good for a bank to reclaim a property which may be worth half the original loan it provided to the mortgage holder.  If that were to happen wholesale across the country, banks would be forced to renegotiate the contracts.  However, given that other types of contract are renegotiated daily, I do not see the reason mortgage contracts could not be renegotiated.</P>
        <P>The Government motion and the amendment tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole do not clash.  In light of the events of recent days, we should move to reassure people that their savings, specifically those held by credit unions, are safe.  I hope we will soon have a further opportunity to introduce the necessary legislation and regulation.</P>
        <P>The public has little confidence in the Financial Regulator.  The Government is considering the possibility of amalgamating the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator and discussions on the issue are ongoing.  Legislation to give effect to this proposal should be introduced in the immediate future.  I join those from outside the House who have called on the Government to seek expertise from outside the country.  For anyone looking in, it is clear that finance in Ireland is a small club.  Developments in the past ten years have shown the incestuous side of the industry.  I would welcome a fresh view from outside the Republic of Ireland on the regulation of the financial sector.</P><Col N="398" />
        <P>We must learn lessons from the past.  I have just finished reading a book on the collapse of the Stock Market in 1929.  At that time, financial institutions were not offered protection and small banks across the United States were put out of business.  The credit unions are in a similar position today.  I hope they will not be put out of business.  We still have time to make legislative provision to help secure these institutions and the savings they hold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank Senator Boyle and the Green Party for tabling the motion.</P>
        <P>This debate gives Senators an opportunity to discuss the important role micro-lending has played in the past 50 years.  It also affords an opportunity to pay tribute to the credit union movement and individuals such as Nora Herlihy, Sean Forde and S&eacute;amus P. MacEoin who founded it 50 years ago.  Credit unions have stood the test of time.  They often made the difference for young fellows in villages who were to serve their time and needed to borrow money to buy the tools they required to do their job, whether as a plumber, carpenter or electrician.  The credit unions provided micro-loans to enable them to do this.  We should maintain and expand this form of lending.</P>
        <P>I expect the credit unions to play a much greater role in our banking system in future.  Many individuals with considerable experience in the financial services sector have lost their jobs and I hope the credit unions will recruit some of them.  While the credit union movement has played an important role in the past 50 years, it must also move ahead.  The Government has a major part to play in this regard.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;13.5 billion is held in credit union funds.  We need to find new ways of using this money, including by way of bond.  I sound a note of caution, however, because some credit unions became involved in unwise commercial investments.  They did not understand what they were getting into.  I do not like to name names, but Davy was one company that advised a number of credit unions on investment issues, and &euro;30 million was paid back to the credit unions because they did not understand the products in question.  They need greater expertise if they are investing.  I would like to see the Government providing a bond in which they could invest, through which a dividend could be paid back to them every year.  This would play a great role in expanding the credit union banking system and putting a stronger emphasis on credit unions.  The Government is guaranteeing savings of up to &euro;100,000 in the credit union so there could be a collaborative role, especially at a time when we need finance.  Credit unions represent finance that is available to us within the country, ensuring that we do not have to go outside the country to obtain credit.</P>
        <P>I also suggest we consider a national bond.  There are people who are still patriotic enough to invest in such a bond to help the country out in a time of need.  We could have bonds as low as &euro;10, which would mean that the ordinary person in the street &mdash; the small person or the old age pensioner &mdash; could invest in the country.  That is what we are talking about tonight.</P>
        <P>It is good that Senator Boyle and the Green Party have tabled this motion as it makes us think outside the box.  Not everybody is looking for &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 to expand a business.  Most businesses are expanded on very small money.  In many cases the ordinary person does not have a track record with banking, and the only way he or she can acquire finance is through the local credit union, to which he or she is known.  That is a problem with banking.  There was a time when one went to a bank for a loan and the manager knew one and would come down to see what one was doing.  That does not happen anymore; one is just a name that goes up to headquarters and if the name does not fit, even with a very good idea for a new business, the banks will not look at one.  That is why they got into trouble.  They did not look at the projects.  They said Joe Bloggs down the road was making money every year and never thought the day <Col N="399" />would come when he would not make money to pay them back.  That is the great thing about small businesses; they will always pay their money back.  I was in business for 35 years and the first person to pay one was the small person for whom one did a job.</P>
        <P>When considering a bigger role for credit unions, we should look at how the &euro;13.5 billion in credit unions could best be used for innovative development and small businesses.  I thank the Green Party again for tabling this extremely good motion.  The Seanad is an excellent place to discuss such issues.  We should be putting forward motions such as this in the House.  We have ideas here and we want them heard.  If a good idea comes from across the floor, so be it.  We are here to discuss all aspects of an issue.  I support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to say a few words on this debate.  Like Senator Phelan, I see merit in both the motion and the amendment.  I do not have any great problem with either because I support aspects of both.  On the issue of credit unions, the credit union in my area, in Castlebar, is very well run and I compliment it on the work it is doing in the Castlebar area and the service it is providing to the community.  All I hear about it is good.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said in his speech:</P>
        <P LI="1">The recapitalised banks have also agreed to engage in a clearing group chaired by a Government representative and including representation from business interests and State agencies.  The purpose of this group will be to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have raised this issue before.  I find it hard to believe what the Minister said because if it is a good business there should not be any great problem with the financial institutions.  The one thing the banks will be looking for from now on is viable businesses and there will be no great need for a clearing group.  How will the clearing group work?  If finance is refused, the issue goes back to the clearing group, but where does it go from there?  Does it make a recommendation to the bank or another financial institution, or will the Government give funding to viable businesses?  It is the bank&rsquo;s business to lend money and it must have a certain amount of discretion with regard to giving and refusing loans.  Thus, I question the concept of the clearing group.</P>
        <P>Credit unions have provided a great service over the years.  I know from small shopkeepers and business people that were it not for credit unions in particular, they would never have got off the ground.  In many cases they raised money from the credit union so they could go to the banks and show they had funds in place for their business plans.  However, I urge the Minister to ensure that county enterprise boards are also properly funded, because they are not currently.  As we have seen, many county enterprise boards are doing great work and in every county the enterprise board is producing 50, 60, 70 or 80 jobs year-on-year.  In my county, the enterprise board created 60 or 70 jobs last year with a budget of &euro;500,000.   Does this mean if it had another &euro;500,000 it could have created another 50 to 60 jobs?  We are creating many jobs with little money.  This is an area that should be properly financed.  It is one of the most important areas for small businesses.  We are talking this evening about small businesses, many of which cannot get funding and must start with credit unions.  In some cases they are refused by banks and must go back to clearing groups.</P>
        <P>In the area of small business, the county enterprise board and the credit union are essential.  They can work hand-in-hand with the banks, which are to make available a package of &euro;100 million in seed and venture capital for small and medium-sized businesses.  This is an issue that should be considered in more detail.  I have great respect for the county enterprise board in Mayo, which is doing a wonderful job.  If it was better funded it would create more jobs.  In the <Col N="400" />past ten years, which were the best in the history of the State, a mere ten jobs were created in County Mayo by Enterprise Ireland, whereas the county enterprise board is generating 60 or 70 jobs annually with little funding.  That is an area that should be examined.</P>
        <P>I am saddened by what has happened in some credit unions which attempted to enter the commercial lending market despite having no experience of this area.  The local credit union in Castlebar does a great job and has developed a solid base in the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the motion on the development of microfinance.  It is important, particularly at this point in our history, that we focus on all areas of finance that might assist the development of enterprise and new initiatives.  Small businesses suffer from many disadvantages but they also have a lot going for them.  One of the greatest challenges facing small and medium enterprises is the availability of finance. </P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Hanafin, mentioned a figure of &euro;25,000 in regard to microfinance.  That amount of money is undoubtedly a help but I would not like to see it become the maximum available under microfinancing rules.</P>
        <P>Small and medium enterprises play a significant role in our communities.  They are usually more flexible and responsive to economic challenges and their size allows them to make a major contribution in terms of providing job opportunities, particularly in the context of rising unemployment.  If we can support businesses through new initiatives which address the disadvantages they face, we should not hesitate in doing so.</P>
        <P>The motion and its amendment focus on one sector, namely, the credit union movement.  I support the development of the credit union movement, as I do all other forms of financial institutions.  If microfinance is to function properly, competition will be required among financial institutions.  Limiting the number of institutions might limit the potential for developing microfinance.  Equally, it might result in a singular approach to microfinance projects.  These two issues jump out at me in terms of developing in one area.  I acknowledge that credit unions operate in a competitive manner but there would be more competition if other players were involved.</P>
        <P>We have come through a traumatic chapter in the history of our financial institutions.  I will not join the chorus of bashing everyone in the financial sector because many fine people work in banks and other institutions.  Others have retired from institutions after serving their employers and the country to the best of their abilities.  I hope the thousands who still work in the sector will honour our expectations of them by promoting their companies while also supporting communities and small and medium enterprises.  The transactions carried out by a small number of people will probably be addressed with a sledgehammer because of the anxiety and upset they have caused.  I have every confidence that the Financial Regulator and others in authority are addressing the issues that have been brought to their attention.</P>
        <P>In regard to microfinance, the challenges we face in economic recovery and development and support for employment opportunities, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s focus on the smart economy.  This comprises everything from the needle to the haystack.  Microfinance will be important in terms of creating opportunities in the smart economy.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the &euro;100 million fund for enterprise stabilisation and the new central bank commission, which will address many of the issues raised by previous speakers.  However, in addition to the enterprise stabilisation fund&rsquo;s focus on vulnerable exporters, we need to support enterprises by developing an accident and emergency department that can assist them with all the challenges they face.  Unfortunately, they are faced at present with an array of telephone numbers and people who can offer varying levels of support.  While I wholeheartedly support <Col N="401" />the enterprise stabilisation fund, we must also support new initiatives and small and medium enterprises.  In this challenging international economy, many businesses are encountering difficulties.</P>
        <P>The code of conduct introduced in a mandatory fashion on small and medium enterprises is to be welcomed.  I would encourage all financial institutions dealing with business people on a daily basis to display it in lights in their premises.  Some of our financial institutions have a great deal to answer for in respect of the pressures they are putting on people who have helped fuel this economy and whom they assisted in getting into the positions they are in.  I attended a tragic and sad occasion last weekend.  The pressures which some entrepreneurs are being put under by financial institutions for relatively small amounts of money is an absolute disgrace.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to state on the record of this House that when focusing on finance, mechanisms, new initiatives and various codes of conduct, we must ensure everybody is aware of the fashion in which they should be applied.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gComhaontas Glas as ucht an r&uacute;n seo a chur roimh an tSeanad anocht.</P>
        <P>I welcome the motion which was tabled by the Green Party and which has drawn focus on the need to support microfinance.  Equally, I welcome the amendment to the motion, put forward by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, other Independent Senators and Fine Gael, which broadens the original motion in terms of what needs to be done to support credit unions in particular.  We need to discuss not alone credit unions but microfinance.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt but that the growth of the credit union movement throughout Ireland during the past 30 to 40 years has been great, with people living in economically deprived communities and areas of social disadvantage enabled, for the first time, through the establishment of credit unions, to access financial services which until then were unattainable to them.  We all know the reasons we support the credit union, namely, it is community based, is open to anyone irrespective of economic circumstances or whether they have assets and is widely referred to as the people&rsquo;s bank which offers a life-line to those not eligible for a bank loan.  As it becomes more difficult to make day-to-day financial transactions without a bank account, all restrictions on credit unions in offering a wider range of financial services to meet customer needs should be removed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is essential that people have access to the most competitive rates for savings and borrowings given the recent downturn in the financial climate.  The credit union is a community based institution and its funds are an additional income from expanded services and should be available to be invested in the social economy for the benefits of the community to which the credit union belongs.  Last week, we debated a report produced by me as rapporteur of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The issue of microfinance is one on which we focused as it is an alternative initiative to the credit unions, which can and should encourage enterprise development.</P>
        <P>Every year, there are 2 million business start-ups in Europe, of which 90% employ fewer than five people.  Micro-firms play a significant role in the development of rural economies.  Given that they are flexible in responding to the changes in the global economy, greater focus <Col N="402" />should be placed on supporting microfinance institutions.  For this reason, I welcome the motion tabled by the Green Party.</P>
        <P>As stated, microfinance is the provision of finance of less than &euro;25,000 to individuals wishing to start up and develop their own business.  It is evident from studies that businesses which start up with less than &euro;25,000 are often very successful.  First Step is Ireland&rsquo;s only microfinance institution.  To date, it has assisted more than 1,500 projects which have created 3,000 job opportunities, and that is to be welcomed.  The report which I produced on the west of Ireland examined the success of First Step, the majority of whose customers are located in the greater Dublin area.  There is a need to support microfinance on a larger scale than heretofore.  Consideration should be given to enabling this type of support in the western seaboard areas, the north west and other areas which could benefit directly from the availability of such institutions to those communities suffering as a result of the economic downturn in terms of inaccessibility to funding.</P>
        <P>I would have preferred that a compromise motion had been tabled.  While what is contained in the amendment is warranted, unfortunately it deals only with credit unions, not microfinance.  What Ireland needs now is a job creation strategy to stem the financial crisis.  While public sector savings and public finances must be examined, what is glaringly absent from Government is a job creation strategy, as highlighted by the live register figures released today by the Central Statistics Office.  The Government needs to cop on that Ireland urgently needs this type of strategy.  It needs a job creation strategy as this financial crisis grows day by day.  The failure of Government to bring forth such a strategy in last October&rsquo;s budget has propelled this State into its worst unemployment crisis in history, as evidenced by the figures released today by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While we need to examine public sector savings and reform of taxation and to address wastage and the gap in our public finances, the number one priority for all of us and of Government at this time must be to get Ireland back to work.  We must introduce a strategy to recreate the 1,000 jobs a day currently being lost.  We need to fast-track business start-ups and to create a sales Ireland strategy that maximises our existing indigenous export market and develops growth prospects in the medium to longer term.  We need to foster and develop a real innovation culture.  While success is possible, it will not happen until such plan is developed and delivered by Government.  If the Government fails to deliver this plan, perhaps it is time for it to go and to allow someone else to deliver it.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I welcome the motion although I would have liked to see a compromise motion.  While more needs to be done to support credit unions, more also needs to be done to support microfinance which could assist in our job creation strategy.  However, this of itself will not put people back to work.  We need an overall strategy.  I welcome the motion but will be voting for the amendment.  I reiterate I would rather have seen a more comprehensive amendment that includes support for microfinance as indicated in the original motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this evening&rsquo;s debate.  The motion was structured in such a way as to provoke a debate and I am glad it did so.  It was particularly notable that Senators focused on the wider issue of microfinance and how it might be progressed and concentrated on the role of the credit union movement, which I will address as I conclude the debate this evening.</P>
      
        <P>The script for the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution was supplied by the Department of Finance in its indomitable and inscrutable style and included a couple of important points that will help to progress the debate.  First was the admission that the Credit Union Act 1997 will require to be amended &mdash; a review of the Act is necessary &mdash; and second was the announcement by the <Col N="403" />Minister of State that legislative proposals are being developed to bring about a legislative vehicle to extend the financial services deposit guarantee scheme Bill to credit unions.  The Bill will be published during the forthcoming session.  When that debate takes place it will address many of the points in the amendment.  There are difficulties and the credit union movement is experiencing the problems being felt by financial institutions and the credit market in general.  There are structural problems that need to be overcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the comments about the level of regulation or the ability of the credit union movement to regulate itself were somewhat unfair.  Legislation constrains the Registrar of Credit Unions but credit is due to the office and the sole officeholder&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is arguing with that.  He is held in the highest regard. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to contributions in general that referred to the level of regulation.  Within those legislative constraints there is a marked contrast between the work done in that part of the financial services and the work in commercial financial institutions.  As we look towards the setting up of a central banking commission we can learn lessons from that individual and the regulatory structure for the credit union movement as we try to improve regulation of financial institutions. </P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for pointing out an element of Government policy that is in place, the social finance initiative.  When I was an Opposition spokesperson on finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Those were the days. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to admit that I had a degree of cynicism about the establishment of the initiative and the foundation which still, to an extent, holds true.  The initiative was set up on the removal of the bank levy which was introduced in 2002 and operated for several years.  In the general election that year the Green Party was the only one to suggest a bank levy which operated for a short time.  On its replacement the sop to the idea of social finance was the social finance initiative to which the banks gave the very large sum of &euro;25 million, whereas the levy generated only a small sum.  The major banks at the time were earning profits of between &euro;4 million and &euro;6 million a day.  That was profit, not turnover.  We now know that some of those profits were wrongly calculated because of the way they dealt with bad debt provision.</P>
        <P>The scale on which the commercial institutions can help in the wider area of social finance has been subsequently addressed by the creation in some recent legislation of identifiable funds for green lending, small businesses and social protection measures.  I welcome that development.  It is disappointing that of that small sum the social lending organisations have drawn down only &euro;9 million and comment has been made on the work of Clann Credo and First Step.  The money available is a drop in the ocean, only &euro;5 million is available for microfinance loans.  I hope that tonight&rsquo;s debate opens the wider aspect of this subject.  Its intention was to acknowledge how microfinance operates through the credit union sector, to promote the wider idea of microfinance as it exists in other European countries and to strengthen the social finance initiative of recent years.  They are all vehicles that we can and should use to a greater extent.  I hope tonight&rsquo;s debate brings about greater awareness.</P>
        <P>While I share many of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s views in moving the amendment, it is prescriptive in terms of a general motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle should carry on.  He is in charge tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that was intended only to provoke a debate, which has been useful.  The contents of the amendment will be better addressed in a debate to be held in the very near future on specific legislation, as will the questions raised about extending a guarantee <Col N="404" />scheme to the credit union sector and the need for a proper SPS scheme.  The Minister of State repeated the <i>status quo </i>and did not confirm what the Senator has been told in recent years in this House.  That too can be examined in that debate.  I hope that the House supports the original motion and I thank Members for their contributions to this debate.</P>

        <P>On 25 April 2006, the then Minister for Education and Science gave approval to the school board of management to allow the project proceed to tender and construction for six full-size classrooms and ancillary accommodation.  However, this has not materialised.  The school applied for new mechanical and electrical services in 1997 but was advised by the Department of Education and Science that it would be better value for money to apply for a rebuild or extension.  Planning permission has been obtained for the project, costings have been done and it is waiting for approval from the Department to proceed to tender and construction even though initial approval had been given in 2006.</P>
        <P>The board of management met with the Minister for Education and Science on 17 December last and discussed the urgency of this project and outlined the options for work and a number of cost saving measures for the Department and taxpayer.  For example the board of management outlined that by choosing, while the school was under construction, to move from the proposed alternative accommodation to other accommodation in the parish, a saving of &euro;320,000 could be obtained.  If this project does not go ahead this year, approximately &euro;250,000 would have to be spent on the mechanical and electrical services to make them safe.  The total is over &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The alternative proposal would make the school safe.  An engineer&rsquo;s report by Mr. Paul A. Roarty, an electrical contractor, has outlined a number of shortcomings.  The electrics are more than 50 years old, the circuit board is completely out of date and there is no proper tripping protection, earth rod or earthing system.  The socket circuits are overloaded and not protected from mechanical damage in places and the list goes on.  That information has been sent to the Department of Education and Science and was highlighted in the meeting with the Minister just before Christmas.</P>
        <P>In addition to the cost saving of &euro;320,000 on rent for alternative accommodation during construction and &euro;250,000 on emergency works if the project proceeds this year, there could be a cost saving due to the economic situation.  Anecdotally, the engineer the school has employed has advised there may be a saving of approximately &euro;300,000.  This brings the overall saving to approximately &euro;850,000 and a net cost of approximately &euro;1.2 million for the project.</P>
        <P>This evening I seek an update.  I raised this issue on 8 October and on a number of occasions with the Minister.  I am glad the Minister met with the board of management on 17 December but we need to take this project over the line.  The pupils, teachers and parish of Gweedore are waiting for this approval.  The project is ready to go.  There is a cost saving associated with it and in the current climate we should take that cost saving and provide the approval for this project in 2009.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the position in relation to Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg, County Donegal.</P><Col N="406" />
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of my Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P>There are four band ratings, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist, but there is a high demand for pupil places, while band four projects include provision of desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential, facilities such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>The brief for the extension-refurbishment project at Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg is to provide accommodation for a long term projected staffing of a principal and four mainstream class teachers plus ancillary staff.  The project, which has been assigned a band rating of 2.1, is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, and planning permission has been received.  Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe met with a deputation from Scoil Chonaill, Bunbeg in December 2008.  A new cost-saving proposal for the decanting of pupils for the duration of the project was presented at the meeting and was welcomed by the Minister.  However, given the competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to be precise about when this project will go to construction.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under my Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  The project for Scoil Chonaill Naofa will continue to be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is &euro;656 million including the additional &euro;75 million allocated under the recovery plan announced recently by the Taoiseach.  This represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the real commitment of the Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding the school building projects for Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for accepting this important matter for my area on the Adjournment and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.</P>
        <P>Kinsale community school was born out of the amalgamation of the Convent of Mercy and the vocational school.  It was sanctioned as a new school by the rainbow Government of which my party was a strong participant, with Niamh Bhreathnach, the former Minister for Education, making that decision.  At the time one would not have predicted that we would be back here so soon looking for an extension to the school.</P><Col N="407" />
        <P>Kinsale community school is an important education provider because it is the only second level school in the wider Kinsale area.  The alternative for families with students in that area would be Cork city and that does not make any great travel or economic sense.</P>
        <P>The enrolment, as of September last, was almost 700 pupils and information available to me suggests it would be nearer 750 in September 2009.  The school has a dedicated team of staff, teachers and parents and a dedicated board of management.  The principal, Sr. Mary, has been looking for this extension for a long number of years because it is necessary and urgent.</P>
        <P>This school is no different to many others in the greater south Cork or west Cork areas in that it is paying almost &euro;20,000 a year for prefabricated buildings.  Like many locally, I believe the situation has reached crisis point.  I say that because the board of management is considering taking the following radical steps: limiting the choice of practical subjects from September next and limiting the enrolment from September of next year.  The board has no choice but to seriously consider those two options.  Not alone will that affect the educational curriculum available to students, it also spells out quite clearly the pressure that people in that school are under.</P>
        <P>The decision to limit the subject choice and enrolment will have considerable ramifications on the local community.  The provision of that large extension is urgently needed.  I attended a public meeting organised by the board of management and the parents in the school on 6 October last with a colleague, Councillor Tom&aacute;s O&rsquo;Brien, a former mayor of Kinsale, and I witnessed at first hand the pressure people were under and I heard parents speak of the real urgency.</P>
        <P>When one sees pupils and parents and one hears that at first hand, it revisits for us the importance of investing in education and providing that extension.  I say that for two reasons, apart from the obvious.  We need to invest in education now more than ever.  We need to ensure that students in the Kinsale area have a decent educational infrastructure available so Kinsale community school can provide the education that is needed with a decent physical building.  That is imperative.</P>
        <P>Second, surely it makes sense that the Government would stop spending money on prefabs and instead divert that money into building the extensions that are needed, not just in Kinsale &mdash; I would throw Clonakilty community college into that mix as well.  We are wasting money every year on renting prefabricated buildings without providing the much needed capital to build those extensions.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, will be aware, Kinsale community school boasts three winners of the Young Scientist award.  The most recent winners were John O&rsquo;Callaghan and Liam McCarthy and a number years ago Aisling Judge was a winner.  That, in itself, is indicative of the standard of education in the local school and, indeed, the opportunities presented to its pupils.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to provide urgently the funding needed to build the extension for Kinsale community school.  It is needed for the present generation of students and will be needed in the future to ensure the people of Kinsale have a decent second-level school available to them.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank Senator McCarthy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on Kinsale community school in particular.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in the existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge and is one of the priorities of the Minister for Education and Science.  This Government has dramatically <Col N="408" />increased investment in the school building programme to &euro;656 million this year.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of my Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project, in other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P>There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision of desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential, facilities such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>On Kinsale community school, the brief for this extension-refurbishment project is to provide accommodation for a long term projected enrolment of 850 pupils.  The project, which has been assigned a band rating of 2.1, is currently awaiting the appointment of a design team.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  However, as the Senator will understand, it is not possible to progress all projects to construction at the same time.  This project will continue to be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  However, in light of current demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.</P>
        <P>The allocation for school buildings in 2009 of &euro;656 million represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding the school building project for Kinsale community school.</P>

T&aacute; an conradh sin le hathnuachan roimh i bhfad.</P>
        <P>I am raising the need for the Minister of State to outline the progress being made in the provision of a satellite radiotherapy centre for the north west.  There has been a long campaign in Donegal, led by cancer patients, that brought 15,000 on to the streets and which enjoys the support of politicians from all sides.  The campaign looks at the critical mass on both sides of the Border to ensure a safe service is provided for the people of the north west, be they from Derry or from Donegal.  Progress has been made in the campaign, which I welcome, and the Government has entered an agreement with the Executive in the Six Counties and the Minister for Health, Social Services and Personal Safety there, Michael McGimpsey, to agree to develop a satellite radiotherapy centre in Altnagelvin Hospital.  The date given for the establishment of that centre is 2014.</P>
        <P>What progress has been made?  What discussions have taken place between both Ministers and Departments?  Is Professor Keane, who is in charge of the cancer strategy, central to the process?  Are we sure this is not just buying the service from Altnagelvin for Donegal patients or is co-operation integral between Letterkenny General Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital?  That is the necessary arrangement; this cannot be seen as a service on one side of the Border with the other side buying it up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As an interim measure, patients from Donegal can avail of cancer services in Belfast City Hospital under an agreement the Minister for Health and Children signed in 2006, with up to 50 patients able to access the hospital for treatment each year.  The number of patients has increased steadily since the contract was entered into.  The contract is up for renewal and there is a fear in Donegal that the patients might be seen as a soft target when the Government is trying to curtail spending.  That would be wrong.  The campaign has been fought, the argument won and the service is being bought in Belfast City Hospital as an interim measure.  There is also a real fear that the satellite radiotherapy centre that is to be developed in the north west will also be put on the long finger.</P>
        <P>I am asking about this on behalf of those who took to the streets and on behalf of cancer patients and those who have not yet been diagnosed but will need these services in the future.  We want to be reassured that come 2014, people will not have to leave Gaoth Dobhair to travel five hours to Dublin and that they will be able to go to a centre in the north west where the service will be available as agreed by the two Governments, North and South.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>One in three people in this country will be diagnosed with some form of cancer at some stage in their lives.  There are approximately 22,000 new cases each year.  Overall, the number of newly diagnosed cancers is increasing by 6% to 7% annually and unless major reversal of trends occur in the near future, the number is likely to double in the next 20 years.</P>
        <P>It is against this background that the national cancer control programme is being implemented.  Its goals are better cancer prevention, detection and survival through a national service based on evidence and best practice.  Part of the programme is the implementation of the national plan for radiation oncology, originally agreed by Government in July 2005.</P>
        <P>A key objective of the national plan for radiation oncology is that radiotherapy services should be provided as part of integrated cancer care service on single large teaching hospital sites.  This does not mean that all centres providing cancer services should have radiotherapy services but it does mean that where radiotherapy is provided, it should be fully integrated with surgical and medical oncology.</P>
        <P>The plan provides for a network of radiation oncology centres nationwide to be fully in place by 2014.  The network will include four large centres for radiation oncology, two in Dublin at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals, one at Cork University Hospital and one at Galway Uni<Col N="410" />versity Hospital.  There will also be two satellite radiotherapy centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.</P>
        <P>For patients in the north west, however, it is recognised that there are particular geographic concerns that need to be addressed.  For that reason, the Government also decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access to radiation oncology services for patients in the north west was through North-South co-operation.  Therefore, it was decided to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital for patients needing radiation oncology treatment and a service level agreement has been in place with Belfast City Hospital for the provision of radiation oncology services to patients from Donegal since 2006.  The Government also decided that over the medium term it would progress the consideration of a joint venture between North and South for the provision of services from a satellite centre in the north west linked to Belfast City Hospital.</P>
        <P>In 2008, the Minister the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland, Michael McGimpsey, announced that a new satellite radiotherapy centre is to be established at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, linked to Belfast City Hospital, as part of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s plans for provision of radiotherapy services beyond 2015.  The Minister for Health and Children has agreed to explore fully the opportunity presented for further collaboration in the delivery of these services.  She has agreed in principle to make a capital contribution towards the cost of this development, together with meeting the costs of patients from the Republic availing of the service.</P>
        <P>In planning the facility at Altnagelvin, it will be important to take full account of both the infrastructural and service implications of providing services to patients from the Republic of Ireland and discussions between the two Departments continue in this regard.  The Department of Health and Children awaits a business case setting out the overall costs and timeline for the development of this facility.</P>
        <P>About half of cancer patients will require radiotherapy at some point in their illness and the aim is to ensure best outcomes for these patients regardless of location.  In this context, the Minister continues to be a strong supporter of North-South co-operation in radiotherapy services, building further on the arrangements already in place for Donegal patients between the Health Service Executive and Belfast City Hospital, and warmly welcomes the proposed radiotherapy facility at Altnagelvin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his positive response.  I wish to raise two points with him that I outlined in my original contribution.  First, the date of 2015 is to be welcomed, but we need to ensure we meet it.  I am not convinced or satisfied that we will have to buy this service again.  It should be integral and jointly funded for the north west, rather than something the people of Donegal buy off Altnagelvin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer did not deal with the service level agreement for patients from Donegal to access Belfast City Hospital, which I believe is up for renewal.  Is there any threat of that not being renewed, given the economic climate?  I note from the Minister of State&rsquo;s response that the Minister wants to enhance further the arrangements already in place.  I take it therefore that it is probably not under threat, but can he clarify that?  I also intend to have this matter raised in the Northern Ireland Assembly directly with the Minister, Mr. McGimpsey.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could forward his replies to me concerning those questions.</P>
