	<P>Yesterday we had somewhat of a rarity in this House when we had a flock of Ministers or, as Senator Norris described it, a whirligig of Ministers, coming in and out to debate the NAMA legislation.  Despite the presence of all these Ministers, however, they failed to convince the majority of Members on this side of the House on the merits of setting up the National Asset Management Agency.  We had an interesting discussion about long-term economic value but those of us on this side of the House remain to be convinced that this is the proper approach and that it will protect taxpayers.  It is clear from the NAMA legislation that bond holders are being bailed out but I raise the issue of mortgage holders, which is topical given that people are falling into arrears and the difficulties in which families find themselves.  The Irish Banking Federation appeared before the committee and made statements on this.  Today&rsquo;s headlines include, for example, that the &ldquo;Banks&rsquo; pledge to home owners is &lsquo;useless&rsquo;&rdquo;.  I want to raise with the Leader this question of the Government approach to mortgage holders and whether there can be any legislative basis to this.  Perhaps there cannot <Col N="168"/>be and if so, I want to know what approach the Government will take to monitor the situation and ensure that the banks reach out to mortgage holders as much as possible in the current crisis.  That is what ordinary persons facing these arrears are seeking.  They see &euro;54 billion being given to save the banks, and yet for the individuals struggling there is no sense of any underpinning, certainly of a statutory nature, to any support that they might get.  This is a critical question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last night Fine Gael sought to include in the purposes of the Bill &mdash; if, a Chathaoirligh, I could just revisit that for a moment &mdash; that there would be lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.  We sought this as a purpose or goal of the Bill and we were told that this could not be put into the legislation.  Everyone&rsquo;s understanding of NAMA is that it would increase liquidity and help business, but we cannot put it into the purposes of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Likewise, is the pledge to homeowners hopeless or does the Government intend to take action, whether in the form of statute or guidelines, to ensure that there is some meaning behind what the federation is stating?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator can raise that matter later with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We will probably return to this question during the debate on NAMA today, but it is a critical one for the thousands of families in negative equity and for families facing arrears and worried about how the banks will deal with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>A significant fundamental issue has been raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  It is interesting to listen to her.  Whereas I pointed out all day yesterday that there are things that cannot be done, Senator Fitzgerald is bemoaning the free market, and I welcome her to the club.  To get what she is trying to achieve, she must move from Christian democracy, to social democracy and maybe all the way across to socialism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a time not that long ago when we had these things in Ireland, but this goes back to the point made by Senator Harris yesterday.  These are the issues.  In all seriousness, the issue raised by Senator Fitzgerald is crucial.  It has to do with the philosophical structure for political vision of the country.  There was a time not that long ago when there were mutual societies, commonly referred to as building societies, which were not-for-profit organisations which looked after their members and which set out to do all of the things for which Senator Fitzgerald asked.  Ten years ago a few of us here tried to hold back the tide against anti-mutualisation when Mr. Fingleton was in the bar every Wednesday night telling us to get rid &mdash; I will scratch that comment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Too late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when a well known leader of a building society was in the bar every Wednesday night trying to get us to remove the section in the building societies Bill to allow it to be easier to become public limited companies.  Once they become public limited companies they are into the trap outlined by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>We need mutual societies.  We tried to stop the change here; we could not get support.  We did the same in the case of credit unions.  The Leader will recall I introduced a Bill to allow credit unions extend in order to provide mortgages and to amend the 1997 Credit Union Act, and everybody on the Government side, including then Senator Mansergh, led the charge against touching that Act.  These are issues that need to be addressed.</P><Col N="169"/>
        <P Just="Left">There are structural changes in the economy and we need to look at them.  The same issue arose today on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; when representatives from the banks and Fine Gael argued about whether it is a matter of rules or structure.  It goes back to the point raised yesterday by Senator Healy Eames about a certain well known banker walking free.  In point of fact, that well-known banker &mdash; people might not know this &mdash; is under investigation by the Garda, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, his own accountancy body and the oversight body for auditing and accounting, and is also likely to hear from the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It moves slowly, but it is wrong to state that the person is walking free.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem is this.  If we go to a rules-based structure people will walk free unless one has precisely anticipated the breach of the rules.  What we need is principles-based structures, which existed before there was any company legislation, where persons must act honourably and properly, and on top of that a rules-based system of internationally accepted accounting standards and auditing standards.  That is not in place.</P>
        <P>The UK, the US and Europe have different views.  In fairness, the UK and Europe have finally almost come together on this and the US recognises this.  Enron would happen again tomorrow morning in the US.  They brought in legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which is rules-based and not worth the paper it is written on.</P>
        <P>We need to debate that idea raised yesterday by Senator Harris.  There are fundamental issues here and it might make people in some of the more centrist parties take a look at the kind of a country we need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about the Department which appears to block graduates from claiming social welfare payments.  We have had the benefit of having interns in this House from DIT over several years.  They provide a terrific service in helping us in our functions and duties by conducting research and doing other various vital work that allows us do our business in a clear and concise way.  Perfectly good claims from them are being refused for no good reason.  It is well hidden within the website, that if somebody needs to claim, they should claim on a VW form.  This is an archaic way of dealing with this.  It is up to the discretion of the social welfare officer.  This must be addressed.  There must be much more clarity on the entitlement of interns or graduates when they are seeking work and doing internships.  They are involved in what would be termed voluntary work.  It is, in fact, providing a service for which they do not get paid.  It is a valuable service and they should be entitled to claim their benefits without having to go to this convoluted means to get it.</P>
        <P>My second point relates to the swine &lsquo;flu vaccination programme.  I was amazed to find that even though I qualified as a nurse in 1981, I cannot volunteer my services to help with the administration of the vaccine, if I wish to do so, unless I have done a course.  This is in accordance with rules of the HSE.  I checked this with An Bord Altranais this morning and it appears that if I wanted to volunteer my services as a registered nurse and midwife, I cannot do so even though I have been giving injections since 1978.  This is just more of the kind of carry-on where the HSE imposes convoluted tactics.</P>
        <P>It would appear that in certain areas of the country vital service providers to day-care centres and Alzheimer&rsquo;s units will be redeployed to help with the vaccination programme.  I wonder if the HSE is once more in the process of taking away or cutting back on vital services under the guise of this pandemic and crisis, and we are not addressing it in a meaningful way.  It seems sad.  I am making the point, not that I was willing to give me time for free but that there are some situations where we must go beyond what seems stupid policy.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="170"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two matters.  Senator Fitzgerald touched on the matter of improving liquidity.  We all want to improve the flow of credit.  As I stated yesterday at the committee to which she referred, and perhaps here too when we debated NAMA,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator can do the same later today.  Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all are vitally interested in the question Senator Fitzgerald raised.  It will not happen until NAMA is in being.  At this stage, the sooner NAMA is in being and up and running, the better for the sake of our economy.  We want it to work properly and well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite what doubts we may have had, we all must act in the national interest when NAMA is in place.</P>
        <P>We should not go hard on the Irish Banking Federation.  We must remember it is merely a trade body, not the regulator.  We must get matters right in this regard.</P>
        <P>The guidelines the Minister is introducing separate to the Bill will, in effect, be merely window-dressing because the banks will still make their own decisions &mdash; perhaps that is what they should do, as they must assess the situation, gauge the level of risk and so on.  While we want things to happen, we had better aim our shots at the right targets.</P>
        <P>I want to raise another issue, that of transport and CIE, on which we are greatly indebted to our colleague, Senator Ross.  Will the Leader bring the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to the House?  It is scandalous that a State body kept from a Minister a report it had for a long time.  A view is being given credence, rightly or wrongly, that what we have heard merely scratches the surface.  We do not know if we have another F&Aacute;S on our hands but the sooner this matter is unearthed and the stones turned over, the better.  I would be grateful if the Leader could arrange such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on education?  It is interesting and, in some ways, very positive that there has been an 8% rise in the number of successful applicants for university.  However, this has to be funded.  I am very concerned at how education, particularly research and teaching, will be funded in the absence of fees.  This issue needs to be discussed.</P>
        <P>I also ask that we contact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ask for a full explanation of what is happening with the Ryan report.  While I know there are difficulties, it is worrying that this very significant report is being delayed yet again.  It was delivered to the Government authorities, including the Director of Public Prosecution, in July.  In October we found there was another problem with it and that more would have to be blanked out.  One woman was a victim 50 years ago.  How long more do the people concerned have to wait for justice?  Why was this issue not properly examined and scrutinised and why were the perpetrators not prosecuted earlier?  Will we ever receive the report and in what mutilated form will we receive it?</P>
        <P>While I do not often mention sport, it has been very interesting to listen to reports on the fate of Derry City Football Club, an issue which has some political implications.  As a constituent of mine pointed out in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, Derry City has some difficulties.  There was financial malpractice which apparently is widespread and Derry City is not the only football club affected.  Its future is greatly threatened and I am concerned because Derry has a large population of young men interested in football.  If the club hits difficulties, they will be available for other opportunities and other occupations in a city where the dissident republican groups are growing.  I would hate to think a lack of resources provided by a football club in <Col N="171"/>the city would lead to the involvement of young men in a horrible revisiting of the worst periods of the past 20 years.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to highlight two issues in regard to the NAMA debate and put a question to the Leader.  While we are none the wiser with regard to much of the detail of the Bill, the presence of various Ministers in the House yesterday showed up some extraordinary differences of views within the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>And varying levels of competence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Regan is well able to contribute on his own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We had an answer indicating that NAMA would not make a profit.  When I challenged the Minister in question on that point by noting that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was proud to project that it would make a net profit of &euro;4.8 billion over the ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Under certain conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;he said it was not definite it would make a profit.  I find this extraordinary and believe it shows up the unreality of the business plan which the Government brought forward only weeks ago.  I ask the Leader to clarify the point.  Is it the view of the Government that NAMA will not make a profit over the ten-year period or is it that it will make this extraordinary projected net profit of &euro;4.8 billion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can debate that matter later when dealing with the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I welcome one thing that has emerged from the debate, namely, the clarification from the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that whatever we decide has to be formally notified to the European Commission.  All of the assumptions, valuations and haircuts will be examined and vetted by the Commission under its state aid rules and nothing can happen or go ahead until the European Union formally approves the project and all its details.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think anybody in the House is in favour of capital punishment.  I find it extremely offensive that one of our closest allies, the United States of America, last night once again in a high profile case barbarically executed yet another person for a crime which he undoubtedly, or probably, committed, although that is irrelevant.  I heard on radio this morning that some 400 people had been executed there this year in a savage fashion.  It is imperative that we send a message to the United States that the Irish people and Government, as well as both Houses of the Oireachtas, do not approve of this behaviour.  We have made appeals from these benches and others for perhaps 25 years since capital punishment was officially abolished in this country.  I do not believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs is conveying this message to our friends overseas, particularly across the Atlantic.  It is particularly disappointing, in view of the fact that President Obama, when he came to office, made it clear he was not in favour of the death penalty, yet it is continuing under his Presidency, particularly in Texas and West Virginia.  It would be a worthy move, representative of everybody in this and the other House, if we took the opportunity presented by the savage execution last night to convey our utter disapproval of this activity in the United States.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="172"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for the Leader to make known the view of the House that the death penalty is not acceptable, even for the most heinous crimes.  The state must be seen, in whatever circumstances, to act in a proper manner.  Life is sacred, even in cases where the most heinous acts have been committed.</P>
        <P>On another matter, I ask that we vary the debate on the pre-budget statements this year.  It is clear, having considered the budget, that there will be certain cuts.  A Minister only has so much room to manoeuvre.  It seems that in every obvious case where the cuts will be made the leader of the Opposition says, &ldquo;We will not make that cut.&rdquo;  To ensure the public does not become too cynical about politics, could we have an opportunity in the pre-budget statements for the Opposition to outline where it would make the cuts?  Perhaps the Leader would consider an open-ended debate in order that, if the Opposition wanted to go through the night explaining where and how they would make the cuts, they would have an opportunity to do so.</P>

	<P>We have made countless suggestions but none of them has been taken up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hanafin keeps making that call and I do not know whether to laugh or cry when I hear it.  I am sure the Government will at some stage come forward with its proposals because, of course, it is running the country.  Let us see what it has to propose and we will then have to make a response.  Let the Senator be assured that we will do so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In respect of the NAMA legislation, to which we will be returning following the Order of Business, I do not wish to dwell on the point raised by other colleagues about the constant changing of the guard yesterday in regard to the ministerial presence to deal with the legislation.  I know there is a difficulty and if the Bill is being taken all through the day, it is not possible to have the Minister for Finance here all the time, which we all appreciate.  However, to put it as delicately as I can, this legislation is so important that Ministers dealing with it in the House should be reasonably <i>au fait</i> with it.  They should have not just an ability to read the legislation, but also an understanding of its key aspects.  We were faced with a serious difficulty last night.  I will certainly not direct my comments at any individual, but there appeared to be either an inability or an unwillingness to face up to the fundamental issues in the legislation that we were attempting to debate with him.  That is the problem we had and that is why the temperature rose for that period last night.</P>
        <P>I heard the beginnings of a debate earlier on the question of Christian democracy and social democracy.  I have no problem with having such a debate, but was it suggested that the NAMA project is consistent with a social democratic vision of society?  I am not sure that was suggested, but I thought I heard that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was not suggested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In so far as it was suggested by Senator O&rsquo;Toole that support for the NAMA project was consistent with social democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said that.  Absolutely not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want a debate now, please.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The NAMA Bill will be before us immediately after the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="173"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Following up on the position taken by Senator Fitzgerald and the Fine Gael Party, it was described as Christian democracy, but they then said one should turn to social democracy.  Social democracy is a vision of society to which I very much adhere but the NAMA project is not part of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senator Ross on capital punishment.  It is important for us to make our views known on an issue such as this, even though the executions in question are outside our jurisdiction.  First, history contains many cases of innocent people being executed and subsequently exonerated.  The mere fact that that can happen should alert us to the dangers involved.  Second, capital punishment dehumanises society.  It should not be necessary for us to start by saying that we condemn and are outraged by the crimes in question.  However, once we go down the road of revenge, which is what capital punishment is, it sends out the wrong message concerning the type of society we want to develop.  The views expressed in this Chamber should be communicated to our friends in America.  Very often capital punishment may give short-term alleviation to the loved ones of victims who have been murdered, but that is not the case in the long term.  We are forgetting that grief does not go by a single act of revenge.  Even though the bereaved may turn up to witness an execution, I do not genuinely believe that it is good for them or for society at large.</P>
        <P>Europe has expressed a general view against capital punishment.  There is always a knee-jerk reaction, but the death penalty is not a deterrent.  I do not believe that executing a human being necessarily prevents somebody else committing the same type of crime.  That is why what Senator Ross said is particularly important.  We should not ignore capital punishment because it takes place at a distance.  We are talking about humanity and the fraternity of nations.  I strongly urge the Leader to seek a response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to see what reaction he got when he brought the views of this House forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader arrange a pre-budget debate on social welfare and child benefit in particular?  Does the Leader agree with the leader of Fine Gael that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs should not touch child benefit?  A cut in child benefit is an attack on the women and children of this country.  Does the Leader support it?</P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on yesterday&rsquo;s pledge by the Irish Banking Federation regarding the protection of home owners.  It appears that there is confusion about this matter.  The free legal advice centres, FLAC, have revealed that many sub-prime lenders are not signed up to this pledge.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, NAMA provides for protection of bondholders, but when will we protect the most vulnerable home owners who did not create the current catastrophe?  When will we go after the people who caused this trouble?</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator Coghlan in that the banking fraternity and those who made the decisions were not acting in the interests of the ordinary person.  They acted out of greed for profits and had no consideration for people.  It can be Christian democracy or social democracy, but it is called greed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If there is a need for a legislative approach, the Minister for Finance should set it out in this House.  We have a bailout of the bankers through NAMA, but the Minister refused to accept a Fine Gael amendment to protect home owners.  If we are serious about getting credit flowing and protecting small and medium enterprises and home owners, we need a meaningful legislative approach.  Otherwise, we are heading towards Armageddon part two.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>The three main components of the current crisis, or the long war as I call it, are the collapse in bank credit, the collapse in jobs and, perhaps most importantly, the collapse in the personal ability of people to discharge their debts.  It is a pity that the debate initiated by Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole should have been diverted into a sort of proto-<Col N="174"/>NAMA debate.  Time is precious so we should be dealing with current issues on the Order of Business.  NAMA can come later.</P>
        <P>Personal debt is now a major problem.  It touches on what Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Fitzgerald and Alex White said about the role of the State.  I am one of the few people in this House who can speak with some authority on this since, 20 years ago, the only impact the collapse of Communism had on Irish politics was a split in the Workers&rsquo; Party on foot of a pamphlet I wrote about the collapse of Communism and the future of the left.  Against a background of the worst recessionary crisis we have ever had, I am struck by the fact that nobody has seriously demanded a socialist solution, in other words a total state solution.  Nationalisation of the banks has been called for on a temporary basis, but people have learned the hard lesson of history that a return to socialism will not do this and neither will a return to naked capitalism.</P>

	<P>Twenty years ago, I defined social democracy as the free market mediated by the state.  In other words, the state was like a tough referee trying to let the match run as freely as possible and only interfering when there were some serious professional fouls.  That is roughly what social democracy means in practice.</P>
        <P>The reason I complain so much about party politics here is because I fear the role of anger.  On Monday night, I saw the nasty side of it on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s television programme &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo;.  There is a lot of that anger there.  I warn the Opposition, although I am not specifying the party, that they may be in Government soon and if so, they will have to deal with that anger too.  They should be careful of what they foment therefore.  Fomenting that kind of anarchy, which is going nowhere, is very bad news.  We need a lot of light, which was one of the great roles of the Seanad.  It stood slightly back from partisan politics and addressed itself rationally to the problems that needed to be solved.</P>
        <P>We need to deal with the problems of personal debt, of which the largest component part is a mortgage.  The problem of negative equity is the largest component in private debt.  It is ridiculous to pretend that NAMA can solve that.  The Minister rightly said that we do not want to NAMA-ise that because NAMA will come after the defaulters.  However, we need a system of State agencies to assess each individual mortgage and then lean on the banks to create lifetime mortgages.  They could be pitched so that people will end up paying a market rent, so that their mortgage becomes a rent and is passed on to their nearest relatives.  Otherwise, 300,000 people, which is equivalent to the size of the public sector, will never be out of debt.  It is corroding their marriages and private lives, as well as leaving a weeping wound in Irish society.  We must address that now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I was impressed when many contributors spoke about the need for this House to discuss solutions to people&rsquo;s current problems.  In that regard, it is wrong for the Government to try to fill the three vacant Seanad seats at a time when we are faced with unprecedented cuts, including child benefit, and are trying to find savings.  I understand that, sadly, these vacancies have occurred through natural causes.  It is absolutely wrong not to use this opportunity to show the people we are in touch and will make changes in our own House.</P>
        <P>What is the timeframe for the Student Support Bill?  I have asked the Leader about this previously.  We learned this morning that there are more students in the country than farmers.  As Senator Norris asked, how will we continue to fund third level education unless we have a framework?  When will the Bill be before the House?</P><Col N="175"/>
        <P Just="Left">In light of what Senator Coghlan said about the role of the Irish Banking Federation versus the role of the banks, what exactly are the obligations of Irish banks to the people given the &euro;54 billion bailout by the taxpayer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senators Ross, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Hanafin and others on raising the issue of capital punishment.  It is horrendous to think that such punishments can occur in the civilised world.  It raises the question as to how Ireland can, as a nation, courteously but insistently disagree with other countries when they abuse human rights in various ways.  During the Jubilee year, there was a beautiful symbolic gesture every time a person was freed from the death penalty or had his sentence commuted or when a country changed its laws for the better in that the lights were turned on around the Colosseum, that great symbolic place where so many innocents lost their lives in past millennia.</P>
        <P>It is important that a country such as Ireland, which is small but which can be influential, make its voice heard.  Sometimes this will have to be an uncomfortable voice.  I regard Britain&rsquo;s abortion laws as barbaric.  They should be a matter for discussion.  Last year we spoke about human rights abuses in China and asked what our response should have been in the context of the Olympic Games in Beijing.  It is important for small countries to have the courage to be awkward and recognise that the fact of their being small does not mean they cannot be influential.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Harris on his remarks.  We really need to consider the economic crisis and issues relating to banking and debt through the lens of human dignity.  This is why I very much welcomed the debate this morning on the nature of social democracy and what it has to contribute.  The great traditions of Christian democracy, with their emphasis on the dignity of the human person and the importance of family life, have very much to say on the current crisis in which families are at their wits&rsquo; end dealing with debt.</P>
        <P>In so far as the discussion between Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell and Mr. Pat Farrell on the rules-based approach to banking is concerned, it is very clear that we need rules.  This goes back to Saint Thomas Aquinas and even Aristotle in that coercion was sometimes believed to be required while people were acquiring an appreciation for virtue.  However, unless we accompany a rules system with the cultivation of civic virtue, we will be faced constantly with the problem of people getting around the rules.  We need both a rules-based approach and a principle-based approach founded on a culture of civic virtue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Harris&rsquo;s remark that the level of personal debt is very serious.  Why can we not put pressure on the banks to extend mortgage terms to 50 years or 60 years?  In some countries, 40-year or 45-year mortgages are offered.  I do not understand why we cannot offer them here.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated the Government, when formulating the budget, will consider areas it would not normally consider.  There is talk about cutting child welfare payments.  This Government never learns.  Today Ernst &amp; Young is examining Irish Nationwide Building Society which will be either wound up, nationalised or taken under the wing of another financial institution.  A senior accountant in Ernst &amp; Young is being paid &euro;3,000 per day and a junior accountant is being paid &euro;800 per day.  It is outrageous that such fees are being commanded by such companies in this day and age.</P>

	<P>Not only are the fees being charged but the Government is paying Ernst &amp; Young to analyse a banking institution that is defunct.  The Leader should bring this to the attention of the Minister for Finance as a matter of urgency because the nation cannot <Col N="176"/>afford such fees.  The subject of fees arose in the past in respect of tribunals but yet again we are overpaying fat cats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two trends in medicine and health care that deserve attention.  It is trite to use terms such as &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; but these trends relate to practices that offer good value for money.  The first is the trend towards prevention rather than cure.  Much can be done in this regard and we really should find time to debate the matter.</P>
        <P>The second trend is towards new technology and the phenomenon is known as &ldquo;e-health&rdquo;.  A report last week by COSTEFF in Brussels referred to telemedicine, which I had not heard of.  It is well worth debating and paying attention to because it is suggested that we can look after our own health from home.</P>
        <P>I attended the Carers Association briefing on the budget this morning and in this regard I noted that telemedicine serves as a reminder of the good value for money we can achieve if we concentrate on prevention rather than cure and on treatment at home using such techniques as telemedicine.  An example given was that people can look after their weight through using their mobile phones.</P>
        <P>The diabetes check all of us in the Oireachtas have been offered is an example of real prevention rather than cure.  Those who had the chance to be tested will receive advice as to what they should do.  When I, given my height, was told I would benefit from losing a little weight, I offered to put on height rather than drop weight.  I did not actually achieve anything, however.  We must consider medical treatment at home rather than in hospital and the concept of prevention rather than cure.  We must find time to debate these because they will offer value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support other Senators in expressing their condemnation of the imposition of the death penalty in the high profile case in the United States.  We would do well to remember that Ireland, as a member of the Council of Europe, is part of a group of states that have happily turned their backs on the death penalty and now regard it has barbaric.  I welcome calls on the Leader to determine how best we can put pressure on countries such as the Untied States, China and Saudi Arabia, which are still imposing the death penalty far too much.  Clearly, any imposition of the penalty is wrong and barbaric.  I agree entirely with the other Senators in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to contribute to the debate on democracy by asking the Leader for a debate on religion in schools and the place of religion in education.  If we live in a democracy rather than a theocracy or Christian democracy, we must be concerned about the very prominent role the churches, especially the Catholic church, continue to play in the provision of primary and secondary education.  I speak in light of the decision by the European Court of Human Rights last week in the case of Lautsi <i>v</i>. Italy, in which the court held that the presence of crucifixes and religious symbols in the classroom was in breach of the rights, established in the European Convention on Human Rights, of the applicant and her children who wished to be educated in a secular way and not to be exposed to the symbols of one particular religion.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a member of the Council of Europe and must have regard to the fundamental principles of the Council, the European Convention on Human Rights and the need for tolerance and respect for those of other religions and of none.  Just because one religion is dominant in this country does not mean it should have a near monopoly on the provision of primary education.  The Catholic church still controls 91% of primary schools in Ireland, depriving parents of choice.  Parents may themselves be Catholic but may wish their children to receive <Col N="177"/>education in a much more rounded way and in a way that does not include instruction in a particular faith.</P>
        <P>I ask that we debate this, in particular the role of the integrated curriculum, whereby children are still receiving religious instruction during school hours in breach, I would say, of their rights under Article 44 of the Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Article 44 says children have a right to attend publicly funded schools without receiving religious instruction in those schools against their parents&rsquo; wishes.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on this urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>As with Senator Quinn, I attended this morning&rsquo;s meeting with representatives of the Carers Association.  I was struck by the dedicated work the association does under very difficult circumstances.  I was particularly struck by the need to ensure there are no cuts to respite care which provides carers with an opportunity to do other things in their lives besides spend 24 hours a day in their home.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the near future on the issue of respite care.</P>
        <P>I also attended this morning&rsquo;s meeting with the Union of Students in Ireland and was shocked to hear that 50 students are dropping out of the education system every year because grants are not being paid on time.  Some VECs say it will be next January before the backlog of grant payments is cleared.  This is largely due to the fact that we have not enacted the Student Support Bill 2008, which is stuck in committee.  I believe the reason it remains stuck in committee is because the McCarthy report recommends rationalisation and a reduction in the number of VECs.  I met with the chief executive of Meath VEC and see no reason the number of VECs should be reduced.  I believe such a move would be counter-productive.  I am disappointed that the Student Support Bill 2008 is held up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Government is considering a proposal as daft as the rationalisation of the VECs.

It is then up to the Member involved to decide if a comment needs to be withdrawn.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Prendergast, Coghlan, Regan, Alex White, Burke and Walsh called for the a discussion on the issues raised yesterday in regard to NAMA, in particular in respect of mortgage holders and how the Government can assist them in this difficult time.  I agree fully with all the sentiments expressed by colleagues who can put their questions to the Minister or Minister of State present in the House today for completion of Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald quite correctly stated, in regard to support for small and medium enterprises, that alarmingly 80% of businesses are SMEs.  This is a critical area to which the Government must provide assistance.  During our pre-budget debate, we will have to come up with a formula and ideas to assist the Minister and the Government on how SMEs can be kept going to retain the current 800,000 jobs they provide.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast referred to social welfare payments and to those who are providing the important service.  I fully agree with her sentiments, which I will pass on to the Minister.  It is difficult to believe that the Health Service Executive will not allow qualified nurses to administer the swine flu vaccination on a voluntary basis.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health and Children must inform me, as Leader, before the Order of Business tomorrow morning as to why that carry-on is being allowed.  It does not make sense.  I will take up the matter with the Minister immediately after the Order of Business today and report back to this House in the morning.  I thank Senator Prendergast for bringing the matter to the attention of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan called for a debate on the CIE report.  I have no difficulty with such a debate taking place.  Senators Norris, Healy Eames, Bacik and Hannigan called for a debate on education in the context of the Ryan report.  I join Senator Walsh in complimenting the Catholic Church on all it has done for education and the good work it has done through the years.  We are proud of what it has done.  No other organisation took on the responsibility when no funding whatsoever was available, for example, in the 1920s and 1930s and all those years when not one penny was available to assist the underprivileged.  I compliment the church and acknowledge its work.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about the Derry City football team.  We certainly do want to see that opportunity lost.  Much good work has been done by the team in that city.  It provided a release valve, pride and a taste of success to men who so richly deserved it but who had been denied it for generations.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan called for a business plan and spoke especially about matters pertaining to NAMA.  Further clarification can be sought when the Minister is in the House today.  I know the Senator will avail of that opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senators Ross, Hanafin, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Mullen, Bacik and Walsh condemned capital punishment and supported this country&rsquo;s opposition to it.  Capital punishment exists in some states in America, but one state is one state too many.  I fully support the sentiments that have been expressed by colleagues this morning.  I will pass on their views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin, Buttimer and Hannigan spoke about the pre-budget debate.  All parties should come to the House to give it the benefit of their proposals, on which the Minister can then adjudicate.  The strength of having a pre-budget debate is that party proposals can be considered by the Minister.  When the budget is published parties can then agree or disagree <Col N="184"/>on an individual basis.  This is a wonderful opportunity when the Minister will be present and all parties can make their proposals to assist him and the Government with the challenging budget that is facing the country.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer referred to the Irish Banking Federation, IBF, pledge to home owners, which we all fully support and welcome.  The former Senator, Pat Farrell, is in charge of the IBF.  Everything and anything that can be done to assist the plight of the home owner should be done.</P>
        <P>Senators Harris, Mullen and Burke raised the issue of bank credit.  Senator Harris correctly pointed out that the major challenges facing families and individuals are the lack of bank credit, the loss of jobs and personal debt.  To say the least, that puts it all in a nutshell.  We must give all the assistance we possibly can to the 300,000 people in difficulty or worrying about mortgage repayments.  The expertise and experience we have gained through life will be called upon in the coming months to assist those people.  The day has come when we might have to consider two-generation mortgages.  The system works extremely well in other countries.  Such a change would take much of the financial burden from those with mortgages who are perhaps trying to achieve too much too quickly in the current climate.  Things were great for ten or 12 years but the financial challenge that everyone is facing now has to be considered in a different light.  That is one possibility we could consider.</P>
        <P>On the various expressions of socialism, being left, right and centre of parties, and where colleagues on the opposite side of the House see themselves; it is interesting to note the background of some colleagues and how many parties they were a member of, especially one or two, before they finally rested where they are today.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised the filling of the vacant seats in the Seanad by-elections.  I listened to her views with interest.  It is a constitutional requirement that the Seanad has 60 Members.  I look forward to welcoming each and every one of the three new Seanad colleagues who will be with us at the start of business shortly after Christmas.  Two new Senators will attend in the last week of the current session.  I look forward to welcoming them to the House.</P>

	<P>We are dealing with section 208(11).  We had a lawyer speak in the House this morning who put words in my mouth as well as Fianna F&aacute;il could ever do it.  NAMA is a market-driven plan.  The idea that someone might interpret it as a social democratic plan or form the view that something I said in support of NAMA was the same as my saying this is a social democracy-based plan, is anything but the case.  This is market driven all the way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>If I suggested anywhere that it is social democratic, I will buy him dinner in the most expensive restaurant in Dublin and we will argue it further.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister has a legal background, I invite him and Members of the House to listen with an open mind to what is in the provision: &ldquo;The Minister shall not approve a restructuring plan or business plan that does not comply with the law of the State and of the European Communities...&rdquo;.  We are passing a law which tells the Minister not to break the law.  What are we doing?  This is creating clover for lawyers, who will argue some day in a court about some other section of the legislation and that if in fact they meant the Minister not to break the law in the application of this aspect of NAMA, would they not have said it in the legislation given it is in this section of the legislation.  This is tautology.  As a legislator, I find it offensive.  I assume social democratic, socialist, Christian democratic legislators and theocratic legislators, as there apparently are such legislators&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There are clearly a few of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;would share my view.  I urge the Minister to take a realistic and practical view on this.  I will not push the amendment to a vote.  This is about tidying up legislation, which is the business of the House.</P>
        <P>Including this provision begs the question as to why it is there.  Does it mean a Minister could approve a plan which did not comply with the law of the State or of the European Union?  It is nonsensical to suggest that might happen.  If a Minister did that, he would be in breach of the law.  There is an implication here that a Minister might in some situations do things that would be in breach of the law but because he is a Minister and is implementing another piece of law, it will be okay.  The provision is unnecessary.  In all fairness, we know we must keep within the law.  Otherwise, we must ask ourselves what we are doing here.  To insert a provision to provide that Ministers, too, must obey the law of the land might have been necessary in the old communist regimes where Ministers had to look after each other and give each other special areas of consideration in working life, including special traffic lanes.  In a modern democracy, however, we take it for granted that a Minister is as amenable to the law of the land as the rest of us and that legislators are no more above the law than anybody else.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to accept the proposal and remove those lines from the Bill.  It will do nothing to NAMA.  In fact, removing the provision gives credibility and respectability to the legislation.  There is no need for it.  It implies that we are unsure of and lack trust in our <Col N="186"/>Ministers and that we cannot allow them to do what they are elected to do.  We are saying: &ldquo;You must keep the law, Minister.&rdquo;  Think about that.  I appeal to the Minister to be sensible about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened carefully to Senator O&rsquo;Toole and, as usual, he makes a great deal of sense.  However, we are seeking EU approval for NAMA and, in doing so, it is important to make what is already implicit in the legislation absolutely explicit and state in clear and unambiguous language that we will not approve any restructuring plan that contravenes EU law.  The amendment proposes to delete subsection (11) of section 208, which provides that the Minister for Finance, after consulting the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, may direct a participating institution to draw up or amend within a specified period a restructuring plan for the purposes of the Bill.  The section also makes provision for related matters, including business plans.  It is not clear why we would wish to propose the deletion of this subsection, although Senator O&rsquo;Toole partly explained it, which provides that the Minister shall not approve a restructuring or business plan that fails to comply with domestic law and with European Communities law relating to competition and state aid.</P>
        <P>People might consider the provision unnecessary.  However, it is a very necessary provision as we must make it explicitly clear that we will respect EU requirements on state aid, in particular.  Furthermore, the Seanad will be aware that we have been in close contact with the European authorities on every step of the process to date.  The European authorities have already seen that this provision is included in the Bill.  Its removal at this stage will serve no purpose other than to create difficulties or potential difficulties with the European Commission.  For those reasons, I am reluctant to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The last point might be the most telling.  It suggests the provision is there to send a reassuring signal to the European Commission.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct.  It reads as something that should go without saying.  How could it be otherwise?  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is not saying it should be removed so that the Minister could approve a restructuring plan that did not comply with the law, and the Minister understands that.  He is querying its inclusion and saying there should be a presumption that this would be the case.  There is no need to spend long on this provision but I am curious about other legislation where such a provision is not included.  Are we setting up different types of commitments that the State will make to comply with European legislation?  In other words, if that provision is included, it means we really, really will comply with EU law but if it is not in the legislation, perhaps we might not.  The Minister might have a problem accepting Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment providing for its deletion because, having had his attention drawn to it, it might give rise to other problems if he removes it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand the Minister&rsquo;s point.  It is a belt and braces measure because the chaps in Brussels are watching too much television and they know that nobody in Ireland obeys the law.  We must ensure the Minister does.  This confirms what Senator Regan has been saying in the last couple of days &mdash; I have been arguing against him but I have been incorrect &mdash; that we must shape up for Brussels and assure the European authorities we are doing this the right way.  We can now point to the legislation and tell them that even if we wanted to break the law, we cannot.  Incidentally, remember those words because my next amendment reflects precisely that view, although in a different context.</P>
        <P>I will not press the amendment.  I can understand that we are not trusted in Brussels and that we must be seen to be keeping the law and be able to point to it.  I have no wish to lessen the strength of the Minister&rsquo;s hand when he goes there, but I will be amazed if Senator Regan <Col N="187"/>does not have something to say.  This confirms his worries all along that we still have to impress the Brussels crowd.  The Minister is really feeding his paranoia on this issue.</P>

	<P>One is always in favour of being in harmony with the laws of both the State and the European Union but it is a little fatuous to state the Government will not engage in criminal activity.  What a relief for the Irish people.  Is the Minister contemplating another section stating that he undertakes not to throw stones through the windows of the Seanad Chamber?  It is really daft.  I do not anticipate that it will do huge damage but it certainly will not make us appear terribly intelligent.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 210.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 63:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 126, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall cause a copy of guidelines issued under <i>subsection (1) </i>to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the debate on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il on the need for transparency in respect of guidelines issued with regard to lending practices of participating institutions, the Minister for Finance tabled this amendment to require that guidelines relating to lending practices that will be issued under this section would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 63 and section 210 are very important.  Everyone is glad that guidelines may be issued in respect of lending practices and procedures and that, under the amendment, these guidelines will be laid each House of the Oireachtas as soon as is practicable.  I reiterate what I said on Second Stage and Committee Stage, namely, that guidelines may not be sufficient to ensure an adequate flow of credit to small businesses.  The Minister for Finance accepted what I said in this regard and stated he would examine the idea of going further and perhaps facilitate the creation of a post similar to that of credit mediator in France.  Senators on the Government benches supported this proposal.  The French credit <Col N="188"/>mediator, a position established by Christine Lagarde, that country&rsquo;s Minister for Economic Affairs, is in effect a sort of ombudsman who has the power to intervene where it appears that loans are not being made to viable businesses.  In such circumstances, he or she can name and shame banks that are not lending.  According to recent reports, the credit mediator has managed to facilitate the lending of money to approximately 10,000 businesses.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the amendment, especially as it will strengthen the oversight and accountability aspect of the guidelines relating to lending practices and procedures, I ask that the Minister for Finance go further, either in section 210 or some other section, and provide for the appointment of a credit mediator who could intervene where lending practices are not facilitating the availability of credit.  I am concerned that we should strengthen the principle that is already expressed in section 210.  This principle will be augmented by the amendment but I am of the view that it could be strengthened further.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement to the effect that he would review this model, that he was not averse to it and that he recognised its merit.  I accept it may not be appropriate to accommodate it in this section.  However, this is the key section which deals with the overriding public interest &mdash; the need to ensure the availability of credit to borrowers, including small and medium enterprises &mdash; with which NAMA is really concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  I also support the general concept of establishing a credit mediator.  However, I do not know whether it will be possible to allow for the setting up of such an entity under this legislation.  In the section, the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than that of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used in respect of the Minister issuing guidelines.  It is clear that an amendment will not be tabled in respect of replacing the former word with the latter.  However, I hope the Minister will take some action in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We engaged in an interesting debate in respect of an earlier amendment in respect of how much power the Minister or the Government will have in the context of compelling institutions to lend money to small and medium enterprises and to extend credit to individuals.  We have not yet seen the guidelines and, therefore, we do not know if they will work.  I am of the view that they should be produced quite quickly.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be aware that two years ago the criteria used by the banks in respect of applications for overdrafts made obtaining such overdrafts relatively easy.  However, the banks have changed those criteria and are trying to bring to an end the overdraft facilities available to a huge number of businesses.  I do not know if it will be possible to compel the banks to restore those criteria to the way they were two years ago when the market was more favourable.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael put forward a proposal in this regard which would involve the establishment of a wholesale bank which could employ the criteria that were previously used and thereby facilitate lending to the type of companies to which I refer.  I accept that there would be a greater risk involved but it would certainly facilitate the restoration of credit flows.  What Fine Gael proposed would be much cheaper, the State would have control over it and everyone would know the number of loans involved and the value thereof because the wholesale bank would operate in a real-time market scenario rather than on the basis of the model relating to long-term economic value.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance should either produce the guidelines or provide further information with regard to how they will be used to oblige banks to lend in a difficult economic environment.  The banks are restricting overdraft and lending facilities to small and medium enterprises for two reasons.  First, in difficult recessionary times, banks restrict their lending. <Col N="189"/> The second reason is that because they overextended themselves and simply do not have the requisite money, the banks are trying to reduce the number of loans on their balance sheets.  If we are going to compel the banks to lend, then we are going to require something more concrete.</P>
        <P>The Minister should indicate what will be the content of the guidelines.  If such information is not forthcoming, we should revert to Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals to the effect that a wholesale good bank be established.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  I also welcome the amendment for all the reasons outlined by colleagues.  We previously engaged in a debate on trying to amend the objectives and purposes of NAMA to include the provision of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises as one such objective.  The Government did not accept the proposal that emanated from this side of the House in that regard.</P>
        <P>Section 210 is welcome because it provides NAMA with the capacity and statutory ability to do what we all believe it should do, namely, facilitate the flow of credit.  If, however, one compares the section with Part 8, which relates to the relationship between NAMA and participating institutions, one discovers a marked difference with regard to the relationships envisaged under both.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>My point relates to the amendment.  Section 130 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A participating institution that fails to comply with any obligation under this Act is liable to NAMA and any NAMA group entity concerned in damages in addition to any other consequence of the failure under this Act.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The section provides clear guidance with regard to what will be the relationship between NAMA and participating institutions, in this case the banks.  However, that fact is neither laid down nor implied in section 210.  What will happen if the banks decide to disregard the guidelines laid down in that section?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>How will the guidelines be evaluated or monitored?  Will the Minister of State provide additional details in that regard and indicate when the guidelines will be published?  Banks and lending institutions ignored regulation and authority for many years and that is why we are experiencing our current difficulties.  What can be done to ensure the guidelines will be effective?  We were not allowed to include in the objectives and purposes of NAMA the key point that the agency&rsquo;s primary function should be the freeing up of credit flows.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendment in that regard was rejected.  It is suggested that guidelines which will have less of an impact than what was proposed by Fine Gael will assist us in dealing with these matters.</P>
        <P>If the guidelines are not adhered to, what action can be taken?  Who will be responsible for taking such action to ensure that what we all desire will come to pass?  This goes to the heart of our earlier discussion regarding the role of the State in respect of banking and the level of direction that can be given.  This matter also arises in the context of mortgage holders and those in negative equity.  Are we shifting the balance at all in the context of intervention?</P>
      
        <P>We are engaging in a major intervention to save the banks.  Are we, however, placing any further obligation on them?  Senator Harris referred on the Order of Business to the position in which people find themselves as a result of their debts.  Are we taking action in that regard?  Are we doing anything effective to address that issue by what we are doing with the guidelines?  This is a key question.  Will the Government consider whether there are other interim steps <Col N="190"/>that could be taken?  Senator Bacik suggested a credit mediator.  Are there other innovations that could be brought into the legislation to deal more effectively with the issues it hopes to address, whether credit flow or mortgages?  Are there other interim initiatives that could be taken that would be stronger than guidelines and might deal with the problems we seek to address?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking on the section and the amendment.  There is a crucial issue in question here and there is a great need for clarity.  Last night, when I said this could not work, it was interpreted as meaning I was opposed to it.  I completely agree with the objectives of the points being made by Senator Fitzgerald.  However, I am also saying &mdash; I will brook no contradiction on this &mdash; it cannot be implemented. </P>

	<P>Let us not pretend it can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a free market economy.  I do not like it, but that is the way it is.  When I was looking for a mortgage for my house in 1971, the idea of going to a bank never crossed my mind.  There was no such thing as bank mortgages; people went to a building society.  In 1933, six men who could not get credit anywhere sat in the Teachers&rsquo; Club in Dublin.  They borrowed from each other and lived off the recognition of their IOUs.  Eventually, they decided there was a better way to do things and they formed the Educational Building Society.  That society is still the only real mutual society and financial institution of its type left in the country, although Irish Nationwide is still reluctantly in that category.</P>
        <P>We need to be clear about this section.  Senator White misunderstood me earlier.  What I said about what Senator Fitzgerald was trying to achieve is that it is something that cannot be done under NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Except for Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am raising the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have dealt with this issue previously since the foundation of the State.  Emerging from that, I have given one example, namely, the mutual building societies, which were non-profit making, committed to their members and which had a soft, reasonable and humane approach to debt.  Similarly, another member of my union established the Irish credit union movement, which similarly dealt with sub-prime lending in a controlled and regulated environment that maintained control of the liability.  For example, each night going to the credit union meeting the manager would pass the shop of the man who had borrowed money to paint his shop-front.  Then, if it had not been painted with the money that had been borrowed two weeks earlier, questions would be asked.  </P>
        <P>Similarly, in more recent times the State had two banks, the ACC and the ICC, which did exactly what Senator Fitzgerald was talking about.  I have spoken here previously about the changes in all these areas.  At some point during the past year the Leader has also bemoaned the loss of the ACC and the ICC.  What happened when the boom took place was that every building society wanted to be a bank and every bank wanted to be a building society and it <Col N="191"/>became impossible to distinguish between the different financial institutions.  We have had this debate here.</P>
        <P>I introduced a credit union Bill.  I do not know how many years ago it was, but both I and Maurice Manning stood and argued when the building society legislation was going through.  We resisted attempts by Government Members who had been put under pressure by a well-known figure in the building society movement to try to get the legislation on mutuality changed so that they could become public limited companies.  Once a building society becomes a PLC, as all banks are, it cannot be controlled by Government, unless one is in a command economy.  A command economy is communist or socialist and that is the point I was making.</P>
        <P>This is a circle that cannot be squared in this context.  However, and this is the point Senator Fitzgerald was making, while the Minister can issue all the guidelines he wants, he cannot make them stick.  He can exert moral authority, but as Senator Harris asks, since when did banks respond to moral pressure, that is not how they operate.</P>
        <P>Another crucial issue in this area is companies legislation, which requires limited companies to act in the interests of all their shareholders, which leaves them in breach of the law if they take action not in the best interest of increased shareholder value.  Even if the Government owned a huge share of the banks, it would still be in breach of the law if it tried to make stick something that would give money where it would earn less than giving it elsewhere.  The problem here is both a societal and economic structural problem and it will not be dealt with by NAMA.</P>
        <P>The issue raised by Senator Fitzgerald is extraordinarily important.  We should deal with it here and should look at the different instruments to do that.  There are ways to do that within society, everything from tontine societies to mutual societies.  There are all sorts of ways to deal with the issue.  The State could encourage, support and develop this area.  The way proposed in the Bill is not the way.  It is a sop to the Opposition, but it cannot be made stick.  It is a nice thing and people can say &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo;  However, if one goes to the courts or Bank of Ireland and flashes the guidelines, they will only laugh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always refreshing and stimulating to listen to Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  It is a long time since I heard the word &ldquo;tontine&rdquo;.  The Dublin Tontine Society used to reside around the corner from me and from Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s distinguished union, whose history in this area I had not realised until now.  It is very impressive.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s argument is very persuasive.  Directors of banks would be in breach of their obligations to their investors if they acted in any other way than according to strict rules of capitalism.  That is why I advocated full nationalisation of the banks.  If the banks were nationalised, the Government could direct them to do whatever it wanted them to do.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In some countries it is, but in New Zealand where the Government has done that, it is not the case.  It needs more.  That has to do with the articles of association.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>One learns more and more.  However, it could be done and would not be in conflict with the kind of principles we spoke about earlier.  Regrettable though it may be, I think Senator O&rsquo;Toole has won this argument intellectually, game, set and match.  I would prefer to see the banks nationalised, but that is not going to happen and we must live with that.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 63 and 64 seem to me to be clearly related, yet they have not been grouped together.  Why is that and why are we not discussing both together?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 64 has already been discussed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="192"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As it has been discussed, it would be completely wrong for me to revisit it, but since I am a very naughty boy, that is what I propose to do.  Even though I do not agree with the amendment, I suggest it would be better if the wording was changed.  It states: &ldquo;Guidelines issued under this section shall be approved by the Oireachtas . . .&rdquo;.  That is telling the Oireachtas it must approve them.  What would happen if the guidelines were a <?oasys _dc18- ?>complete load of rubbish?  Could they be thrown out?  The amendment should read: &ldquo;Guidelines<?oasys _dc0- ?> issued under this section must be approved by the Oireachtas commission on NAMA before issuance&rdquo;.  In other words, they could not be issued until they were approved.  The logic behind this amendment seems to be that the commission must approve everything.  However, I suppose this is an academic point because the amendment is not going to get anywhere.  However, as a retired academic, I like making these points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Defence to the House.  The Government amendment is an excellent amendment.  However, section 210(1) states, &ldquo;The Minister may issue guidelines&rdquo;.  I think this should use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and I ask the Minister to consider that for Report Stage, because &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is more definite.  We have had concerns about the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; previously and as Senator MacSharry has said, the Bill would be stronger if we used the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, which is more definitive.  The Government amendment inserting subsection (2) uses the phrase &ldquo;shall cause a copy of guidelines&rdquo; and does not use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about lending agencies and I would like to mention something of which he may not have been aware because he would not have been in the same position I was in 1971.  I did not have access to a bank or building society for a loan and could only approach the local authority for a loan.  My local authority was effective and well organised and gave loans to people with very little income, but got the money back.  That is another side of the loan issue.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the ACC and the ICC, I remember that in Newtowngore one time a former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister intervened with the ACC bank to ensure a company was assisted in some way.  There was, therefore, much direct political involvement in the ACC and the ICC, positive involvement as far as enterprise was concerned.  There were excellent banks and it is a shame they were removed because they would be of great assistance now.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether Anglo Irish Bank will be so compliant with Government directives or requests.  There is a another section in the Bill on representations which we will go into further.  However, there are other ways to raise money and most people in rural Ireland actually received their first loans from local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The very last thing of which I would accuse Senator O&rsquo;Toole would be copping out of this discussion because he has been closely involved in it throughout.  The consequence of what he is saying, however, risks a cop-out from the issue we are trying to address.  I do not believe the argument he has made wins through in the end for the following reasons.</P>
        <P>This discussion is raging all over the world and the extent to which governments can intervene in relation to financial institutions and seek to have their lending strategies focused on the productive part of the economy, is not peculiar to Ireland.  I accept the first thing that must be addressed, regardless of whether the banks are in public or private ownership, is the capitalisation issue.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that very little can happen unless the basic capital requirements are in place.  It is the stated intention of the NAMA legislation to ensure this can be fixed and sorted out.  For the purposes of what I am saying now I accept absolutely that this is the intention of the NAMA project.</P><Col N="193"/>
        <P>However, I do not accept that when this is achieved, however it is to be done, that there is not a role for State intervention.  It is not a question of the Minister determining whether Alex White or Joe O&rsquo;Toole should get a loan.  I am talking about something that is much more strategic and structural in terms of the configuration of lending and touching on the regulatory point made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  How should banks be required and expected to configure their lending in terms of the overall proportions of loans going to productive activity as opposed to what I described last night as the casino-type venture.?  One of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues last night thought I was referring to a casino, meaning a physical place where people go to play games, when in fact I was talking  about the type of activity the banks have engaged in for so many years.  I do not accept there cannot be a role for the State to intervene by directing the strategies of the banks and communicating to them not just a guideline but an expectation of promoting lending to the productive part of the economy.  To that extent I do not agree with the fatalistic approach.</P>
        <P>I understand where Senator O&rsquo;Toole is coming from and it is an attractive argument on one level to say that the State cannot intervene and it has to be either one thing or the other.  I probably agree more with what the Government is trying to achieve with section 210 to the effect that there must be a role for the State in this question.  Otherwise this entire project could not conceivably be sold to the public or to future generations.  I do not go along with that point at all, but I accept it is not so simple either in so far as it is being indicated that this can be done or directed overnight.  To that extent I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, although I believe he carried the argument too far.</P>
        <P>To pick up on the point made by Senators MacSharry and Leyden about the guidelines contemplated in 2010, I remind everybody that there may not be guidelines.  When one reads the section one finds that the third word is &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and that is the most important word in the section.  If one does not get past &ldquo;may&rdquo;, there are no guidelines.  In other words, the Minister does not have to issue guidelines.  Senators MacSharry and Leyden are absolutely right and the Minister should consider changing that on Report State.  I hope I shall be permitted to table an amendment on Report Stage to replace &ldquo;The Minister may issue guidelines&rdquo; with &ldquo;The Minister shall issue guidelines&rdquo;.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s amendment absolutely to the effect that they should be laid before the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of direction is at the core of the legislation if it is to achieve what we hope it will as soon as possible.  The contributions made so far are all very worthy.  Mine would probably be somewhere between the contributions made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Alex White.  Of the five financial institutions we shall have 100% direct ownership of two and substantial, close to dominant, ownership of the other three.   In those circumstances, if maximum influence cannot be exerted, then we need to question our role as an organ of State in controlling the economy in any manner.</P>
        <P>It is more important philosophically, I believe, to decide on the role of Government in taking over a commercial entity and in determining, for instance, the extent of such involvement.  That is why guidelines are important.  There is still some uncertainty in the Bill notwithstanding the acceptance of the amendment that the guidelines, when they come into being, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is the big question whether there will be guidelines in the first instance.  I believe that guidelines are useful and necessary.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White that the guidelines should specify the areas rather than the amount of lending.  We have had some experience in the recapitalisation legislation last year of setting up particular funds which to date have been very poorly accessed in terms of the two largest banks.  A &euro;100 million fund was established on foot of that legislation for green enterprise which was meant to be the centre point of the Government&rsquo;s Smart Economy docu<Col N="194"/>ment, yet there has been only a tiny drawdown on those funds to date.  When we specify in legislation that particular types of lending should be made available, we need to ask why this is not being put into practice.  We know the future of lending in the short-term for the financial institutions cannot and will not be in property.  We have over-extended ourselves there and there must be new forms of lending to promote better and more sustainable economic activity.  Much of the debate so far has focused on small and medium-sized enterprises.  While we need to promote that type of business structure, it is more important that as a Legislature we are more directive about the type of economic activities we want to see rather than the vehicles we want to see them being promoted in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is where the vacuum is.  We are bringing in legislation to deal with the effect of an economy that was over-reliant on property and construction.  We need economic activity that replaces that and which is more sustainable in the medium and long term.  Rather than talking about the existence of credit and the vehicles through which it should be provided, there should be more discussion about the type of economic activities we would like to see.  That is where the direction should be given to the financial institutions.</P>

	<P>He is right, of course.  I have described this as being comparable to a match where the State is the referee, only intervening when a professional foul is committed.  It conjures up a scene where the referee is going to be stopping the game continually and instructing the players while the object of the capitalist exercise in game terms is to score as many goals as possible.  The referee might start to decide how many goals should be scored or that first aid should be given to a worthy youth group visiting the match which would stop so that players can talk to such people.  It is hard to say this and maintain any level of popularity in this society but the function of the State at the moment is to return the banks to their perceived norm as being red in tooth and claw.  Banks that are functioning normally tend to give people money where they believe a return will be yielded on their investment and to withhold money from enterprises they believe will fold.</P>
        <P>By and large, it is the least worst system in the world.  There is no better one since we have tried command economies and they do not work.  I agree with Senator Boyle, so what is to be done about maintaining State objectives?  The answer as Senators Boyle and Alex White have suggested is to move into the higher regulatory areas of fiscal policy, not to direct specific credit policies but to introduce tax regimes that make it attractive to banks and investors to move into areas such as telecommunications to develop them and create employment.  Direct interference is not a good idea.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One great advantage of this recession is that we have had a reality check throughout the system on the use of language, and on how banks and the economy function.  The Irish are probably one of the best educated peoples in the world on the functioning of the capitalist system.  We are trying to get back to capitalist health and the State is doing its best to intervene where appropriate.  We should not abuse language while doing so.  It is ridiculous to give sops to people by saying that it will return the banks to normal, which is capitalist trading, and at the same time that it will keep on interfering with them.  There must be other instruments and ways for the State to do that through taxation, fiscal policy or systems of regulation.  Meanwhile, <Col N="195"/>we should try to restrain our use of language and tell the truth when the people are in the mood to hear it.</P>
        <P>Professor Stiglitz has been quoted again and again in the course of this debate as saying that what is being done here is criminal.  Anybody who abuses language like that and uses the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in that context cannot be trusted to use language or think straight in any other way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>When I spoke earlier I was speaking on the amendment but as this has now developed into a debate on the section I am not clear whether Senator Harris favours or opposes the section.  He seems to express doubt about the working of section 210.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We are agnostic on it.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That explains everything.  </P>
        <P>In answer to Senator Harris, this envisages a system of regulation.  A consensus is emerging across the House that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be altered to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and that the Minister must introduce these guidelines to regulate the participating institutions.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s critique of the workability of the section, this applies only to participating institutions, credit institutions so designated under section 67 by the Minister.  They have already been bought into a system that is different from the normal free market run which has failed us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Bacik&rsquo;s hopes. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to hear it.  It is imperative that the Minister issues these guidelines.  That is reflected in the word &ldquo;shall&ldquo; in the Minister&rsquo;s amendment and in the important subsection (2) that requires participating institutions to comply with the guidelines issued.  It states &ldquo;A participating institution shall comply with any guidelines issued under <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;  We will table an amendment if the Government does not accept this one.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s willingness to consider my point about the credit mediator relates to his existing provision in section 210(1)(<i>b</i>) which describes the guidelines as relating not only to lending practices but also to the review of decisions of participating institutions to refuse credit facilities.  The objective of the credit mediator model is to intervene where credit facilities have been refused and to ensure that they are granted where businesses are viable, and to name and shame where banks refuse to lend to viable businesses.  That is the provision under which a credit mediator model might well be introduced.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 64 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 210, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad the amendment is acceptable to all sides of the House.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to the purposes of the Bill.  These are dealt with in section 2.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes but we are trying to amend that section to include our points.  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="196"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand that but I am trying to explain to the Senator that section 2 sets out the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the Bill.  Section 2(<i>b</i>)(i) states, &ldquo;to facilitate the availability of credit in the economy of the State&rdquo;.  That adequately covers what the Senator is trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>Under section 210(1)(<i>b</i>) the guidelines will include a review of decisions about participating institutions to refuse credit facilities.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the usual way this sort of thing is done.  The Minister for Finance has reassured the D&aacute;il that he intends to introduce guidelines.  I reiterate that commitment here.  There has been an interesting debate on what those guidelines should be or what they can achieve.  The purpose of the legislation is not just to set guidelines or decide how much the Government can intervene here or there.  The basic problem was to deal with lending institutions, on which we were depending to provide credit for the economy, whose balance sheets were effectively trashed.</P>
        <P>In the first instance the legislation will restore liquidity to these institutions and repair their balance sheets by taking the bad loans off the balance sheets and allow them to focus on their real business, lending.  As Senator Harris has said, the days are gone when the Irish banks&rsquo; main activity is borrowing money cheaply on the wholesale credit markets and getting involved in all sorts of property scams and speculation.  The banks will return to their core business, lending, which will increase shareholder value in the interest of the institutions.  They will lend to get a return that will exceed what it costs to give the money.  That is what the banks must get back to doing and the legislation enables them to do so.</P>
        <P>The Government cannot tell a bank that it must lend to certain people even though it is obvious they cannot repay the loans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not obvious. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the legislation is to put the banks in a certain position and we do not want to do something now that will reverse that.  We can, as Senator Alex White says, provide that certain sectors of the economy must receive a certain percentage.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel to do that because there is a precedent for it in the initial deal with the banks on recapitalisation.  The Minister is holding discussions with the banks.  They know that the legislation exists to enable the Minister to introduce guidelines, which he has said he will do.  </P>
        <P>In response to Senator Bacik, what has been done in France is very interesting but I would guess that will not happen under these guidelines although it may.  It is possible that under subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) something similar would be set up here.  The Government has not gone through all the hassle, pressure and torture of coming up with the idea of NAMA, getting it off the ground and working out its exact details in order to arrive at a situation this time next year where credit is not flowing to the economy.  If the guidelines and the legislation are not working, the Government will have to take action to deal with it.  The Seanad can rest assured that it will.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems as if we are just going to have to wait for the guidelines.</P>
        <P>The purpose of NAMA is to sort out the banks.  However, the scale of the problem must be examined from the people&rsquo;s view.  Loans in this country total approximately &euro;390 billion, many of which were backed by interbank loans made by Irish banks with their international counterparts.  The feeling is that when the Government gives the &euro;54 billion worth of bonds to the Irish banks, they will exchange them for cash from the European Central Bank.  In turn, they will replace their interbank loans with these ECB loans to tidy up their balance sheets.</P><Col N="197"/>
        <P>Some argue we should leave the banks on their own as this is a free market.  The market dictates what happens.  However, this is not a normal recession.  In such a recession, banks change their lending criteria, restrict lending and reduce their exposure to bad debts.  However, the added factor in the Irish banking problem is that the banks do not have access to cash, meaning there are greater restrictions than there were in past recessions.</P>
        <P>The banks are not just evaluating the risks of the businesses they are dealing with but actually reducing their exposure to any type of lending, both good or bad.  I know, and I am sure the Minister does too, of good businesses with full order books but the banks are trying to reduce their overdraft facilities.  This factor is not typical of the free market.  The Irish banks simply have no access to cash.</P>
        <P>The Government hopes that pouring &euro;54 billion into the banking sector will solve this problem, allowing the banks to go back to how they work in a recession, simply evaluating risk, and ensuring credit flows.  If that does not work, however, some pressure will have to be put on the banks to lend.  This could be through the guidelines in question or Fine Gael&rsquo;s option of a good bank.  The latter would be a wholesale bank that would simply back new loans while the banks would be left to deal with their old loans.  It would allow new money into the economy to let businesses work.</P>
        <P>The Government may end up having to back this Fine Gael proposal because next year it will have to pour between &euro;10 billion and &euro;15 billion into the banks to recapitalise them.  That is after paying &euro;54 billion for these toxic loans.  When the Government is discussing the guidelines with the Oireachtas, it should not blind itself to the good bank concept just because it came from Fine Gael.  If the banks are keeping their lending criteria strict and running the risk of putting good businesses out of work, the Fine Gael option may need to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct that the NAMA model is wrong, we must take account of where we stand.  We are having this debate in the context of a &euro;54 billion investment in the banks&rsquo; balance sheets and a State guarantee potentially worth &euro;410 billion.  We are beginning to accept there is no ability to direct the banks to put credit into the economy, which is after all the main objective of this legislation.  This must give us pause for thought about the design and role of NAMA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two aspects to this debate.  First, as the Minister said we are looking at cleaning up the banks&rsquo; balance sheets and ensuring that credit flows again.  The second aspect is how we achieve this.  Section 210 states the Minister may issue guidelines to the banks but we are not sure how they will respond to this.  The question again arises as to whether the NAMA vehicle is the solution.  This is somewhat like last night&rsquo;s debate about long-term economic value.</P>
        <P>The flow of credit is one of the two foundations upon which the whole NAMA model rests.  After all the investment made by the taxpayer, the Minister may issue guidelines to the banks on lending but we are not sure they will be implemented.  The Minister is correct that next year if credit is not flowing, then NAMA will have to be revisited and alternative models examined.  That is not acceptable.  Up to &euro;54 billion is involved in NAMA and &euro;410 billion in the State guarantee but the Minister may issue guidelines for credit.</P>
        <P>My ideological journey to all this was probably much shorter than it was for those who started off with Marxism and socialism.  Like all young men, I was once attracted to and dabbled in socialism, as well as young women, for quite a while.  After all the investment made, the legislation&rsquo;s objective is not to clean up the banks&rsquo; balance sheets but to get credit flowing again.  The use of word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this section means that we have to have a relentless dissatis<Col N="198"/>faction with how credit flow is working and be open at all times to considering new ways of doing it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We are reassured the Minister intends to issue guidelines on credit flow.  In that case there is no reason why &ldquo;may&rdquo; cannot be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It would secure the Minister&rsquo;s contention.  As Senator Donohoe and others said, it would underline the seriousness of this section and the core purpose of this enormous risk-taking mechanism &mdash; that credit needs to be made available.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister is open to the French credit mediator model.  On Second Stage, he said an independent appeal mechanism is planned where credit is refused by a bank.  It is precisely because the banks cannot be directed to lend to a particular individual that some form of independent mechanism is necessary.  In France, the credit mediator was introduced to ensure a business, which believed it was wrongly refused credit, has a form of mediation and appeal.  The sanctions and mediation process in France which we could adopt here is that banks which wrongly refuse to lend to viable businesses are named and shamed.  It is a constructive suggestion from this side of the House to ensure the key purpose of NAMA is achieved.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to strengthen the wording by substituting &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in section 210(1) and also to strengthen the vague idea in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of that subsection which states the guidelines shall relate &ldquo;to the review of decisions of participating institutions to refuse credit facilities&rdquo;.  We need to see something a little stronger to ensure there will be an independent mechanism to which people can go when they are wrongly refused credit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s desire to see the framing of the Bill made stronger, but it seems from this discussion that we need to see the guidelines to assess whether they will address some of the issues raised in the debate.  For example, Senator Boyle spoke about strategies to direct investment or fiscal policy in particular areas, while Senator Harris wondered whether it was higher areas of fiscal policy that needed to address this issue.  We need answers to these questions.  Within the NAMA structure will we be able to deal with the issues of those in negative equity who are experiencing major difficulties with their repayments?  I am not suggesting we direct banks in the minutiae of their lending, but I am <Col N="199"/>questioning whether a direction can be given, influence can be exerted and policies developed in dealing with this problem facing thousands of people throughout the country.  If we are not able to impact on lending policies or have mechanisms put in place to help them via the guidelines in NAMA, let us be honest about it and identify where the Government needs to develop fiscal policy, bring forward further regulation and go for the credit mediator.  This has not been done in the debate on NAMA.  What will be the impact of the guidelines?  Do we need to move somewhere else outside NAMA to address these issues?  These are critical questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 63 states the Minister &ldquo;shall cause a copy of guidelines issued under <i>subsection (1) </i>to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  I hope that will be done very soon because today the banks are down a further 9%, which marks a further collapse.  This is desperately serious and we need to act with the greatest possible speed.</P>
        <P>On a technical drafting matter, it is obvious that the Minister should accept the change from the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but I would like to have the power to say he must accept that change.  Otherwise, his own amendment is a nonsense because he includes the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the amendment.  He cannot force himself to issue a copy of something; therefore, he must include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  This is a partisan but partly a grammatical point.  The world will not fall apart if he does this and it would have the added advantage of making him look intelligent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important debate.  Section 210 forms the core of the Bill.  Very significant contributions have been made and there is a solution.  The Government has not examined the Fine Gael good bank proposal, even though it should have done so, but it was cast aside because it was a proposal made from elsewhere.  Section 210 is all about risk and risk takers.  If a bank loans money, it has to take a risk.  The person looking for the money is also taking a risk.</P>

	<P>Yes, it is the core of the Bill.  If money does not start flowing to businesses, there will be no money to meet the &euro;54 billion that the Bill is all about.  If NAMA makes a loss, the Minister has said there will be a surcharge on the banks.  We could alter the section to state the surcharge would be lower on those banks willing to lend to those who put a business plan in place and take risks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that light is being thrown on the realities of the banks during this debate.  It is good that we are now facing the fact that NAMA is more of a process than a product.  It is tedious and nit-picking &mdash; I have always personally disliked it &mdash; when people like Senator Regan ask whether we are going to make a profit.  I do not know how we could pin anything like that down in the case of any human enterprise.  The Minister is entitled to say we hope and intend to make a profit, that we have made the calculations as well as human beings can do but that we are still at the mercy of history, time and circumstance.  I do not understand such platonic thinking; I just do not get it.  This is a process, not a product.  It is a process in history and the Minister is doing the best he can.  We should be more concerned about the readiness of Ministers to admit that this is contingent and that they can make mistakes.  I am glad the Minister has said the Government will review the position continually.  Senator Donohoe has emphasised the need to review continually, re-examine and reopen and adopt new methods.</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>I am not a lawyer and might need assistance from Senators Regan and White or anybody else on the following query.   Enormous expertise will be built from the Bill in the assessment of loans and creditworthiness.  We will need to access that expertise at some stage if we are to deal with the mountain of personal debt and negative equity problems, as Senator Fitzgerald pointed.  I cannot see how we will get away from a position where a State agency will have to be set up to assess the situation of some 300,000 people in negative equity and solve their difficulties.  Otherwise, the State will not be able to function as a society.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>To do this, we need access to NAMA.  I trust the Minister and his officials will be able to confirm that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent NAMA from making its expertise available to any such State agencies or in any assessment of personal mortgages.  I suspect that in the coming five to six years up to 300,000 people will need to have their mortgages reassessed by a neutral agency and then have some policy to sort out the matter.  We cannot make banks do this, as it would be another bailout.  Let us think of the ethical consequences of asking people who made provident decisions when buying a house to carry those who made improvident decisions in the past few years.  Let us think of the ethical and financial morass, in which the one guiding light will be the staff of NAMA.  They are the only people with the expertise to make those hard decisions, as well as the compassionate ones.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the views of Senator Harris, and other speakers, on this section.  On Monday night the Minister stated clearly that we could not put the mortgage section &mdash; people who have mortgages &mdash; into NAMA because it was structured to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is protected as much as possible in this legislation.  We will go after developers, builders and whoever else owes money to the banks to ensure that the taxpayer will not suffer and therefore special legislation will have to be introduced.  I covered that issue on the first day I spoke in the debate.  The special legislation could provide for a moratorium of 12 months whereby the lender and the borrower could come together and there would be no penalty clause for the borrower if he or she got into trouble.  If the borrower got his or her job back or his circumstances improved, the extra year allowed could be added on to the end of the mortgage.  That is one way of doing it.  If two people lost their jobs and were unable to meet their mortgage commitments we would have to examine the possibility of the bank having a rental scheme to suit people like that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Harris is right.  This will have to be done because if we do not do it we will wind up with another agency to deal with this aspect.  We should ensure that the legislation covers all banks in this State, not just the six banks we guaranteed.  We have sub-prime lenders who are bringing their clients to court.  They are the people outside of the system who are the hardest to deal with and we should bring in legislation to deal with that but it must be separate legislation.  The Minister said he is looking at that question.  We can spend all day here talking about the other problem.  Let us deal with this problem.  This is the hand we have been dealt.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was some confusion in the debate last night on the &euro;54 billion.  That is an estimated value.  We may have to review downwards that valuation when due diligence takes place.  That is the reality.  With the best will in the world, and we do not all have a crystal ball to look into to get the answers we want, this is the best guesstimate we can come up with.  It is important that we pass good legislation to ensure this Bill works well when it is put to the test.  There has <Col N="201"/>been very good debate on the Bill and no guillotine has been imposed.  We had a late night last night, and I must say I work better early in the day.  One does not do as well at night-time.</P>
        <P>This is a business Bill.  There are three arms to this Bill: the special purpose vehicle, the credit system that will create, and the business sector.  The first objective is to get credit flowing, and that is where our valuation and our bond system comes in.  That goes back in to ensure the banks have money to lend.  We then have the special purpose vehicle which will have an investment sector.  That will kick in and then we have NAMA, which is the main agency to ensure that we have a working relationship with all three.  On the basis of that, and the legislation we are drawing up here, we should have a reasonable prospect of ensuring we get lending back into the banking system again.  Our banking system will be much healthier after this measure but it is our job, as public representatives, to ensure that the taxpayer is not exposed.  We have covered that in the Bill by ensuring that if there is a shortfall the banks will have to pick up the Bill.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the time given.  We should not spend too much time considering what might happen in terms of the ordinary mortgage holder.  We must now bring in legislation urgently to deal with that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We dress up the defence of the Government but I must take issue with the criticism Senator Harris made of the business plan.  In the debate last night a Minister said that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, never said that NAMA would definitely make a profit, yet we have a business plan which suggests a net profit of &euro;5.48 billion over the ten years. <Col N="202"/> Senator Harris is saying it is not relevant whether it is or is not a profit.  Are we serious about the business we do in this House?  This plan was sold to the country as the financial underpinning of the NAMA legislation.  We are not dealing with figures in this Bill but this is the background document on which we must rely.  Senator Harris is suggesting we do not refer to that document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in a Bill can mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but in this instance it does not.  I suggest the Minister could cut short the debate on this entire section by changing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I understood this was part of the undertaking given to the Green Party and part of the Government-Green Party new deal that there were to be commitments on lending.  This was a watered down version of that commitment, a bit like the levy, but I would have thought that a commitment that the Minister shall issue guidelines was the minimum that would be expected in that context but since the Minister has indicated that it is the intention to issue guidelines, we could cut this debate short by simply changing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>In January last I proposed to this House the establishment of something I called the national property management agency.  I will not rehearse all of that, but I just want to signal it.  I returned to the matter four times.  At that very early point I suggested something that chimes with what was stated by Senator Harris, who went to the heart of the issue, on the experiences of the estimated 200,000 or 300,000 people who may find themselves in negative equity and in difficulty.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to take this up.  At that stage I suggested the creation of a portfolio of Minister of State for home security &mdash; not homeland security like that of the idiot Bush &mdash; because we have a primary responsibility to the people of this country.</P><Col N="203"/>

        <P>Because I went through it the last time, I really empathise with people who are in this position.  We must move as rapidly as possible and get something done.  Once again, I throw out this suggestion of a portfolio to deal specifically and urgently with this question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the qualifying eligible assets, there are some serious situations arising here and without naming it, I wish to come to one specific matter of which the Minister has been made personally aware.  In the case of a company in the renewable energy field, probably employing in the region of 500 persons and which had, say, &euro;100 million in security and maybe &euro;50 million in loans, because of the definition NAMA has clarified that all of that has been taken in, even though they are performing loans.  The company has a contract to complete by Friday, say, for another &euro;11 million, which, on the existing security, the bank is more than willing to lend because the company is good for it, but because all of the existing security is being proposed to be transferred to NAMA, the bank now finds that it cannot advance the &euro;11 million on the alternative security.  This is a crazy situation where this company could be liquidated by court order for something that has been sanctioned because of a nonsensical rule within the NAMA proposal.  The financial institution concerned is comfortable to lend.</P>
        <P>This is pertinent to what we are dealing with on section 210, on the guidelines.  I would plead that in all such cases NAMA not be allowed take an excess, especially where these are performing loans.  This is not something that is non-performing.  I refer to performing loans that NAMA is taking because they are related under the guidelines, under the definition section, as a qualifying eligible asset.</P>
        <P>This is nonsensical.  We must free this up for the sake of our economy and for the sake of companies.  I refer to a specific company, with 500 persons employed in the south, which is facing completion of a contract on Friday for &euro;11 million, where the bank had sanctioned it but NAMA is taking the existing security, which it does not need at all.  One would understand it in the case of a non-performing loan.  These are performing loans but, because of the definitions, this is all being taken in.</P>
        <P>I will follow this up with the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, afterwards.  I raise the matter here on this section because it is sensible that the Government amend this, in all our interests and in the interests of the economy, so that NAMA not be allowed take all of the existing security in the case of performing loans that are being transferred because of the definitions in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not familiar with the case to which Senator Coghlan refers but I certainly will be happy to talk to him about it later.  It is not in the interests of anybody that, <Col N="204"/>unintentionally, a good company employing several hundred persons is forced into liquidation, and I would not like to see such a situation.</P>
        <P>All I would say to Senator Coghlan on the performing loans is that NAMA deals with certain categories of loans.  Whether loans be performing or non-performing, if they fall within the category they come into NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe this issue can be sorted out.  I will talk to Senator Coghlan about it.</P>
        <P>On the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, I reiterate the commitment the Minister gave in the lower House that he will introduce guidelines.  He may well introduce a number of sets of guidelines.  For example, he intends to introduce guidelines from time to time to respond to sectoral credit problems as they arise.  In that case, in view of the fact that the Minister wants to take on himself the right to introduce guidelines from time to time, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, I am advised by the parliamentary draftsman, is the appropriate word to use.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives the Minister a power, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; creates an obligation.</P>
        <P>Section 22(1) of the Interpretation Act 2005 provides &ldquo;A power conferred by an enactment may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires.&rdquo;  We have sought the advice of the Attorney General in view of the points made here this morning and he has reiterated that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the appropriate terminology in this case, in view of what the Minister wants to do.</P>
        <P>I listened to various Senators outlining what the banks might do with the money.  Let us assume it is &euro;54 billion.  As Senator Butler stated, we still must work out the exact amount.  It might be more, it might be less &mdash; I would say, probably less.  Is it seriously being suggested, as some have appeared to suggest, that putting all of these billions of euros together with the billions of euros we are putting in to recapitalise the banks into the Irish financial institutions, whilst at the same time taking the problem loans out of the banks, will make no difference?  That is not sustainable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated that people appeared to suggest it.  If that is not what they meant, it is fine, but that is the way it came across to me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  However, I am just saying if anyone is under that impression, it is an illusion.</P>
        <P>On the Department or the Minister for Finance intervening in the banks to ensure that credit flows, if the thing is not working as we intend it to work, if that fundamental first purpose set out in the purposes section of the legislation is not being achieved, of course we will have to intervene again.  If we must intervene again, we will not necessarily have to use a different vehicle.  A bank, if it is to stay in existence for any time at all, must act as a bank whether one calls it a good bank, a bad bank or an indifferent bank.  That is the reality of life.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris and other Senators mentioned the question of those who, unfortunately, are running into arrears with their mortgages.  The Government is conscious of that situation and <Col N="205"/>has discussed it at the Cabinet table.  The Government has already announced that it is taking measures to deal with that and in the measures we are taking and in the way we will implement those measures, we will have recourse to the expertise of NAMA and the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reiterate that the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel is that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the appropriate terminology here because the Minister intends to introduce guidelines but he may want to introduce guidelines at different times to deal with different sectoral credit problems as they arise.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister explain why, if NAMA at some future stage is very successful, it is exempt?  I accept it is a State organisation and all profits accrue to the State but why exclude it from all normal taxation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is because it is a State body.  As the income accruing to NAMA accrues to the State, what we would be doing by taxing the income from NAMA is to have the State apply income tax on its own income to hand back to itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The SPV is a private company, not a public company.  NAMA is a public company.  I had this discussion yesterday with the Minister involved.  It seems strange that a private company which is not a charity is exempt from all taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The SPV is not exempt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The SPV is managing all of these&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>NAMA is exempt but the SPV is not exempt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We were told that all of the bonds it is handling for the State are exempt, although the investors and whatever dividend they are paid are not exempt.  I understand this because this involves income for these individuals.  The Minister is suggesting that any profits made on handling these bonds and in dealing with them on behalf of the State, which are being handled by the SPV on behalf of NAMA, which is still a private company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that the income&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It would seem the Minister is suggesting a private company will not pay income tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>No tax is paid on the money which the SPV pays to NAMA.  NAMA has a special purpose vehicle which operates as a separate legal entity at arm&rsquo;s length from NAMA itself.  For example, NAMA might decide there is a certain element of rental income which it will securitise and put a price on, and that is made available in a special purpose vehicle.  The reasons it is done this way is so that the ordinary investors can put money into it without fear of being dragged down by anything that might happen to NAMA.  Those investors <Col N="206"/>will pay tax in the normal way.  The money they pay to NAMA will come into NAMA, and it would be ridiculous to suggest that the Government would tax itself to collect money that will go to it in any case.</P>
        <P>The important point the Minister should reassure us about is that the investors in the special purpose vehicle would be like investors in anything else, namely, they would have the normal levels of risk and taxation.  Let us be clear about this.  What they are doing is taking some of the impaired assets from NAMA and we are getting rid of them.  This is part of the process of which we are in favour.  However, nobody will get away tax free.  The only one that will not pay is the State, for the simple reason that the tax would come to it anyway.  No individuals will get away tax free on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question which is perhaps based on my inability to understand maths.  I understand NAMA will not pay tax because the State will not tax itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister explained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole explained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That was it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>However, if the SPV makes a profit, and 51% of it is privately owned, is the SPV subject to corporation tax before it splits up the dividend?  In effect, will the State tax its 49% before it then hands on the profits to NAMA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>NAMA is a State body not subject to tax.  The SPV will be subject to tax because it will be in possession of a great deal of property and it is the SPV which is the property owner and the entity holding the title to the properties.  If there was one major, dominant player in the property market which was not subject to tax, this would seriously distort the market.  My understanding is that the profits made by the SPV will be subject to tax in the normal way.  If it pays a dividend to NAMA, that will not be taxable.  That is the position, as I understand it.</P>

	<P>I raise a point I referred to on the Order of Business this morning on accountants working in Ernst &amp; Young, which is carrying out work in the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Its charges are &euro;3,000 a day for a senior accountant and &euro;800 a day for a junior.  As we have gone down the route of paying this type of fee in the tribunals, it is an issue the Minister must immediately take on board, not when the matter is over and done with.  The winding up and amalgamation of financial institutions will happen.  If we are not prepared to say what the fees will be at the very outset, we will end up with the same situation we have seen in the tribunals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>On the role of public representatives &mdash; Deputies, Senators and councillors &mdash; in making representations to NAMA, this section is pretty strong with regard to a person communicating on behalf of another person, providing advice and so on, and it refers to the initiation of legal proceedings.  What is the role of the public representative as far as NAMA is concerned?  The Minister stated NAMA would be subject to parliamentary questions, which are very important, and subject to debate in the House, hopefully.  What about the representations made by councillors, Deputies and Senators if there is a problem with a particular property?  What would my role be if I contacted NAMA in regard to a person owning an adjoining property, for example, and tried to influence NAMA not to proceed with the project?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan raised an important issue with the Minister.  If this Bill is enacted before Senator Coghlan speaks to the Minister about the issue he raised, will he commit an offence?  It would seem that any type of lobbying would be an offence under section 221.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this section.  It is about time we had governance concerning lobbying.  I do not believe Senator Coghlan is in the slightest difficulty because section 221(3) states it is not an offence if the communication is made in public.  It could not be more public when it is in the arena of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the position afterwards to which I referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan has been absolutely clear about it.  Section 221(3)(<i>b</i>) refers to a situation where the communication is made &ldquo;without an intention to benefit, or confer an advantage on, any specific person&rdquo; and section 221(3)(<i>c</i>) refers to where the communication &ldquo;is made in the public interest&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Most of the Members who spoke on this issue are present again today, although one Member on the Government side who spoke is not here.  I indicated there is a specific case for each provision included.  Why not?  They are all covered and protected.  I would hate to see us adopt the model of professional lobbying that exists in the United States, whereby large multinational corporations lobby extensively.  Consider what has happened to President Obama&rsquo;s health Bill.  Events unfolded as they did in this regard because corrupt corporations are spending millions of dollars lobbying politicians.  There are people at Capitol Hill who do nothing else, which is obscene.  Providing information and making attempts to represent the interests of one&rsquo;s constituents, save jobs and create employment in one&rsquo;s constituency are marvellous and to be <Col N="208"/>applauded.  When this is done in the public forum of the Oireachtas, there is nothing underhand about it.  It is about time we had lobbying legislation.</P>
        <P>It is a pity our legislative provision on lobbying extends only to one section of the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009.  I hope the Government will consider introducing full legislation on lobbying, not with a view to outlawing it completely but to ensuring it is above board, can be held up to scrutiny and is carried out honestly and fairly.  I am all in favour of that.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not disagree with Senator Norris, I contend we need to differentiate clearly between public representatives lobbying and making representations.  People are happy with how the political system operates in Ireland as it gives them access to public representatives to make their case on any given subject.  Provided people meet the appropriate criteria pertaining to getting whatever they are making representations on, I do not see a difficulty.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White has withdrawn his amendment to section 221.  I ask the Minister to consider the issue because it relates to an employee of NAMA or a NAMA entity or somebody acting on behalf of NAMA who is approached or lobbied to make a certain decision in favour of a person, issue or valuation.  The provision compels the employee to report the fact that they have been communicated with.  Subsection (6) makes it an offence for the employee not to report the communication.  While one may be ill-advised not to communicate the information to the Garda or one&rsquo;s superiors, one&rsquo;s not doing so should not be an offence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to all these questions, as Senator Norris indicated, is in subsection (3).  The key phrase concerns whether the communication &ldquo;is made in the public interest&rdquo;.  This is the line of which we must be on the right side.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan gave an excellent example of how it should be done.  Regardless of whether the public interest is served in the Oireachtas or in a meeting with another politician and some of his officials, if a communication is made in the public interest rather than in the name of professional or personal gain, it is clearly in the spirit of what is mandated in the legislation.  If it is not, one is fined or one goes to jail.  That is exactly how it should be given how important the agency will be.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will be happy if, as politicians, we will all be free to continue to act in the public interest.  It would be wrong if politicians could not talk to each other, as we do, in the public interest, be it in respect of a specific case or a general one.  It is very important that our ability to do so be protected.  From what Senator Donohoe and others have stated, it is protected and we should be happy with that.</P>
        <P>We are not professional lobbyists but we are guarding the public interest in a general way and sometimes in specific cases.  The Minister&rsquo;s offer to talk to me is a case in point.  I do not want to put on record the name of the firm I have in mind.  There could be multiple cases of this kind because of the way the legislation is framed.  We must get the economy moving again and free up credit.  In the case to which I refer, the bank is prepared to advance the additional &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million but is being prevented by NAMA from having the security needed to cover the loan.  Although everything is performing, all the security, which is way over the top, is going to NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This discussion goes two ways.  Senator Coghlan is absolutely correct in stating that if an issue requiring public representation arises, one puts it on the record and <Col N="209"/>deals with it.  Let us not get carried away in deciding where this takes us.  In this regard, one should consider what occurs if one goes across the line and discusses making decisions on tendering, the sale of property or legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>We should have a discussion in this House on governance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Plenty of people were prepared to make comments on how F&Aacute;S worked.  F&Aacute;S was characterised by an absence of governance.</P>
        <P>Yesterday we approved an audit committee for NAMA.  An audit committee will be operating next year and it will consider four or five issues of importance in connection with NAMA&rsquo;s business.  Let us consider four: the purchase or sale of property; a tender; the engagement of the services of and payment of an expert adviser; and legal proceedings.  The committee will bring in external auditors who will stress test the process from start to finish.  They will consider a few tenders and determine how they were granted.  If in the middle of doing so they find some note that a public representative made a private phone call to a person in charge of the tender, the tender will be challengeable.  In this regard, one should consider the issue of phone licences.</P>
        <P>That there is some doubt in our minds as to what we can and cannot do is disgraceful.  That anybody should have such a doubt is disgraceful.  We should close the door and have a discussion on how we should proceed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White is correct that one must include the proposed measure.  That Senator Coghlan has a doubt about what he can do is bad.  There should be no doubt whatsoever.  We represent, speak out, put information on the record and put forward the agenda.  That is what we do.  The days of lifting the telephone to ask a Minister to make a telephone call to somebody else are gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The sooner, the better.  The Minister should issue a guidance chart.  The Department of Finance has issued three or four in recent years.  One is Welcome to the Board, a document for people on semi-State bodies.  Another concerns governance issues.  Recently the Department issued a third, an update on how governance should operate.  Anybody who does not know how it operates should not be in the Oireachtas.  There is no question that this is crucial to how we do our business and to the importance we attach to ourselves.  We should not have to hold back on issues of importance to us and what we believe to be solutions that must be made work.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear about what the Minister was saying about asking questions.  He will answer questions in the Houses on the operational issues but not on how or why a tender is granted, or on why legal action is taken.  There are boards all over Dublin city and if they heard a Member say we could intervene in the sale or purchase of land or in the issuing of a tender &mdash; in fairness, no Member has &mdash; they would find it outrageous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a full lobbying Bill.  The Minister should put that to the Cabinet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>My party has called for such legislation on a number of occasions.  I am in complete agreement with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Perhaps it is good that this matter was raised, precisely for the purpose of having it knocked on the head so sharply in this context.</P><Col N="210"/>
        <P>There is an interesting cultural exchange across the floor between the Opposition and Senator Leyden.  He is making it very clear that he believes we are being too extreme or adopting a politically correct position.  I have heard this before but it is part of the reason we are where we are in this country.  Senator Leyden may smile, laugh and joke about it all he wants.  While we have resisted partisan comments for most of this debate, I must say the system he is defending is part of the problem in this country and it is associated mainly with his party.  This is the difficulty we are in.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct that there should be no question at all of this issue arising.  I do not care if I sound politically correct or holier than thou.  Section 221 is one of the most important in the Bill.  I believed it was one of the most uncontroversial and such is its importance that I am amazed it is receiving even two minutes&rsquo; attention.  Anybody who believes politicians are covered under subsection (4), which refers to one acting in a professional capacity, had better think again because politicians certainly are not.</P>

	<P>And in the public interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there is nothing in this provision which we should fear.  This provision is being included because there is a sense that we got to where we are, in terms of how dealt with issues like this in the past, because of a tendency to be furtive, clandestine and conspiratorial, which has been to the loss of our political system.  The best way of addressing how this will be done in the future and how we can prevent this from happening again is by having recourse to these provisions.</P>

	<P>I am the longest serving Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  However, I do not mind if I am a minority of one.  When I served in the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs and Transport, I received representations from public representatives from all <Col N="211"/>sides.

	<P>I am making the point that there is something wrong if public representatives, be they Deputies, Senators or councillors, cannot communicate their constituents&rsquo; concerns.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have a job getting around this.  Paragraph (3)(<i>a</i>) states: &ldquo;is to be made public at the time of communication&rdquo;.  Will Senator Coghlan make public the person on behalf of whom he is raising an issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, if the person so wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If making a point of behalf of a constituent or somebody else, he will have to make all communications in that regard public.  Paragraph (3)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;is made without any intention to benefit, or confer an advantage on, any specific person, or&rdquo;, which is fair enough.  This would mean that a widow with a small site adjoining another with which problems have arisen cannot make representations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Paragraph (3)(<i>c</i>) states: &ldquo;is made in the public interest&rdquo;.  It is obvious the representation would be in the public interest.  </P>
        <P>When one communicates with a person, he or she must note the communication and report it straight away to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This means if one picks up the phone and contacts an official of NAMA in regard to an issue on behalf of a constituent one could end up being fined &euro;1,000, sentenced to six months in prison, or both.</P>

	<P>Doing so is part of one&rsquo;s life.  One might as well give up altogether and close the D&aacute;il and Seanad and not have any public representatives because they will not be needed.  I never heard such righteousness in all my life.  I do not mind if I am a minority of one in this House explaining my point, as did people, who in the parliamentary party in 1970s, said that when we set up Eircom and An Post there would be no more communication with them and they would ignore people and public representatives.  I believe NAMA should respond.  </P>
        <P>I spoke on this issue on Second Stage.  I have been a Member of this House for a long time and frequently raise issues on the Order of Business and by way of the Adjournment debate.

	<P>There is nothing to stop Senator Leyden or any other Senator or Deputy raising in the Seanad or D&aacute;il general or, even specific, issues in regard to NAMA.

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;with the intention of influencing the making of a decision in relation to the performance of the functions of NAMA.  The function of NAMA will be to get <Col N="214"/>credit flowing in the country again.  NAMA has an obligation.  The people are making a huge investment in NAMA, whose obligation it is to recoup that money on their behalf.  It cannot be subject to secret lobbying.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reality.  On the defences a person will have in terms of how far he or she can go, I agree with Senator White that subsection (4) does not cover Deputies and Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>No, it does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It provides an exemption to a person who is acting in his or her professional capacity or in the course of his or her employment.  I would not like to chance that one.     </P>
        <P>If one is charged under subsection (3) of the offence of approaching NAMA one can defend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a defence.  That is exactly what I said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>One can defend oneself on the grounds that such an approach is made public at the time of the communication, is made without an intention to benefit, or confer an advantage on, any specific person, or is made in the public interest.  These are three standalone provisions any one of which will get a person off the hook.  It would be wrong to say that if Senator Coghlan wants to speak with me at a later stage he must publicise that if it is in the national interest.</P>

	<P>Wrongdoing can take place in any organisation regardless of whether it is in the public or private sector and even where proper internal financial control structures are put in place.  Unfortunately, there have been several examples of this in recent times.</P>
        <P>The Minister has included several sections in the Bill relating to the disclosure of information to the various authorities, where appropriate.  On reflection, and arising from the D&aacute;il debate, the Minister has further decided to add specific provisions into the Bill which will protect bona fide whistleblowers if they report wrongdoing.  This whistleblower protection extends to officers of NAMA and participating institution employees, regardless of their position within the organisation, which is correct.  It can be difficult to legislate for whistleblower protection.  It is important to strike a balance between providing protection for the individual and the need to deter people from making false allegations.  The proposed amendment is framed in such a manner as to ensure this balance is struck.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendments are largely based on the amendments to the F&Aacute;S legislation recently introduced by the T&aacute;naiste.  The proposed sections provide protection from civil liability for employees of participating institutions and officers of NAMA who make a bona fide report of offences being committed under any enactment or serious wrongdoing in regard to NAMA.  The individual can make the report to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a member of the NAMA board.  The proposed sections also provide that it is an offence for an employee of a participating institution or an officer of NAMA to make reports in bad faith to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the board of NAMA or the Minister for Finance.  That provision is included to discourage persons from making false accusations of misbehaviour.  It is important that persons are responsible for their actions and do not abuse the whistleblower protection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important section relating to the whistleblower&rsquo;s charter.  I urge the Minister to introduce broad legislation covering the rights of persons who make such disclosures.  I am aware of a number of examples.  I know of one in a health facility where an employee saw mistreatment of disadvantaged people who were vulnerable.  They made an anonymous telephone call and discussed the issue with agencies of the health arm of the State. <Col N="216"/> Eventually that intervention was divulged to the employers.  Others who had witnessed the behaviour had confirmed and discussed it but subsequently denied it.  The job of the person concerned was placed in considerable jeopardy.  Anything that protects whistleblowers is good, but it has to be balanced.  The Minister has done this through the second amendment covering false accusations which can be devastating and should not be entertained.</P>
        <P>The one thing that concerns me &mdash; I would like the Minister to re-examine the matter &mdash; is that the fines and penalties are considerably more severe than for the offence we have just been discussing.  It would be appropriate for these two offences to be harmonised.  Attempting to interfere illegally with the operation of NAMA should be treated at exactly the same level of seriousness as an individual making a false accusation against someone.  In the case of a corrupt intervention or lobbying offence, the fine is not to exceed &euro;1,000, or imprisonment for six months, but in the case of somebody who makes a false accusation, it is &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for 12 months.  I do not understand the discrepancy in the fines, as they are equally serious offences.  If anything, the offence under section 221 is more serious; therefore, I do not think it should attract a lighter penalty.  I urge the Minister to re-examine the issue.</P>

	<P>I indicated last night when the Labour Party whistleblower amendment was moved that I was prepared to withdraw it on the basis that the Government&rsquo;s amendment was progressive.  I welcome it.  The Minister has acknowledged that the amendment is a response to concerns raised by my party and others in the Lower House in respect of this issue.  Therefore, I welcome the amendment he has tabled in response.</P>
        <P>I drew some distinctions between what we had proposed and what the Minister was proposing.  One issue I overlooked last night but that has now come to my attention is that there is protection from civil liability but no protection from criminal liability which was contemplated in the Labour Party amendment.  What is the thinking behind the Minister&rsquo;s decision that it would not constitute a civil wrong but that criminal liability could arise?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been evident in recent years that it is not always possible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or even a member of the board to instil confidence in a whistleblower that he or she will be protected.  The Minister is aware of cases in which persons who have acted as whistleblowers have had their names released, either directly or indirectly, to their employers, which has had a detrimental effect on their career.  One of the changes that could be introduced would be to allow complaints to be made to a Member of the Oireachtas or a member of the board of NAMA, in addition to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a person were to give information to me on wrongdoing in regard to NAMA, I would make the best possible effort to clarify the information and ascertain it was correct.  I might check with the Minister on whether it was true before I would say anything publicly.  That would give protection to the individual concerned, as he or she would be one step removed from people finding out who they were.</P>
        <P>Complaints made to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have to be written down in report books and a detailed file must be compiled, which could be accessed by someone else.  The PULSE system has been accessed by individuals who were paid by criminals to do so.  The board of NAMA would be deeply involved with people in NAMA, which could give rise to a conflict of interests.  I urge the Minister to consider making a change to the effect that com<Col N="217"/>plaints could also be made to Members of the Oireachtas.  There are only 226 Members and most of us could be trusted not to do something that would be detrimental to NAMA, or that would in any way be wrong.  We do not abuse parliamentary privilege.  That would be a useful change.  The Minister has seen cases in which members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have made information available and their names find their way into the public domain eventually.  I propose that Members of the Oireachtas and members of the board be included in the provision, with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Twomey whose contribution is significant.  The House should bear this specifically in mind because of the recent case involving former Senator Jim Higgins and Deputy Brendan Howlin who found themselves in some legal difficulty in regard to their sources.  That is a good point.  The more I think about it the more strongly I believe the Minister should harmonise the penalties in section 221 between whistleblowers and persons who act corruptly because the potential gain and sums of money involved are astronomical.  There is potential for criminal, deliberate and perverse corruption of the system, which is very serious.  In many cases a person who makes a false statement to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does so not just out of malice but because he or she is a little unbalanced.  At least the fines and terms of imprisonment should be the same for both offences.  If I was a corrupt business person and saw the possibility of securing a contract for myself or an ally that would reward me in terms of millions, I do not think I would be deterred by a slap on the wrist or a &euro;1,000 fine.  I would not be that much more deterred by a &euro;5,000 fine but it would make the point that the offences were at least at the same level.  I have thought about the matter since I first raised it and will be tabling an amendment straightaway.  I believe my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, will be prepared to second it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">With regard to synchronising the offences with the offences under section 210, I am advised the whistleblower provision is modelled on a similar provision in the F&Aacute;S legislation; therefore, the same penalties are applied.  The Deputy has a point and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
        <P>On Senator Twomey&rsquo;s point about being able to report to Members of the Oireachtas, I believe that if a Member of the Oireachtas receives a report of serious wrongdoing in this regard, they will bring it to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will mention the Deputy&rsquo;s point to the Minister as to whether it is possible to extend the protection where the report is given to Members of the Oireachtas.  As regards Senator Alex White&rsquo;s point about criminal liability, it is not a crime.  The whistleblower is not committing a crime, even if he or she is wrong.  The only possible exposure he or she has is to civil liability, which is why he or she is only protected from civil liability.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 132, subsection (4), lines 23 to 27, to delete paragraph (<i>b</i>) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) shall be apportioned to each participating institution on the basis of any loss incurred by NAMA on the assets acquired by NAMA under this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This relates to the levy that will be applied if NAMA does not make a profit.  The levy will be applied to the institutions according to the loans they submit to NAMA, not according to the losses the loans made.  Let us assume that 30% of the loans are from Allied Irish Banks and that of the total losses made by NAMA at the end of the decade, 15% relate to the Allied Irish Banks loans.  One would assume that the levy applied to Allied Irish Banks would relate to 15% of the losses made.  However, it appears from the way this provision is structured that 30% of the levy will be applied to Allied Irish Banks because it submitted 30% of the initial loans.  That is my interpretation of the provision.  I believe that is wrong.  If 15% of the losses result from AIB loans, 15% of the levy should apply to that bank.</P>
        <P>I discussed this previously with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I suggested that the levies be applied from the start but he said that would be counterproductive to what we are trying to do, which is give stability to the banking sector and confidence to investors that we will get the banks up and running.  However, investors know that in ten years an undefined amount of losses could be made and that Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland could be penalised for Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s losses, as it appears that Anglo Irish Bank will account for the majority of the losses from these loans.  Furthermore, Anglo Irish Bank might not even exist in ten years.  From the investors&rsquo; point of view, there is much insecurity about what this means for Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  There is not just a sense of unfairness about this provision but it could also cause instability and lack of confidence regarding the two major banks ten years hence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am conscious that the officials and the Minister are probably concerned about spooking the market in terms of how specific or prescriptive they are on the surcharge, but further clarity is required.  I do not support the amendment but how will the surcharge be calculated?  As Senator Twomey said, if one were to predict now the least likely to make a profit, it would be Anglo Irish Bank and it would also be the most likely contender in terms of any losses that might be sustained.  It is not clear how the level of surcharge will be apportioned to each institution.  We need more detail on that aspect.  Apart from Anglo Irish Bank it is theoretically possible that some of the institutions will make profits while others will not.  Does that mean we lose because we are only in a position to apportion whatever percentage of surcharge on the profits made versus the percentage of loans originally taken over by NAMA?  That is a concern and I believe the public would like us to be a little more definite about potential losses.  We are all very hopeful, if not confident, that it will be in a break even, if not a profitable, position and that this will not arise.  However, as with section 210 and<?oasys _jy ?>the valuations issue, this is a key issue for me.  It would be good if we could get more detail<?oasys _jy ?>on it.</P><Col N="220"/>
        <P Just="Left">I am conscious of spooking the markets unnecessarily but it would be reasonable if banks were to pay into a fund a percentage, to be determined by the officials and the Minister, from any profits made per annum in the next ten years in anticipation of any prospective loss.  It is prudent to put it aside notwithstanding that we are hopeful, if not confident, that NAMA will be in a profitable or at least break even position.  It would give further comfort to the public if an amount of any prospective profits in the next ten years were put aside by the participating institutions.</P>
        <P>To recap, how will the surcharge be split in the event of a loss, as some will be profitable and some will not?  Can we put provisions in place whereby profitable institutions would put funds aside?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 222 provides for a future surcharge on the participating institutions in the unlikely event of NAMA making a loss.  This section has been carefully drafted to strike the necessary balance between, first, affording the taxpayer maximum protection against the possibility, however unlikely, that a loss might eventually arise and, second, the risk that the application of a statutory surcharge could result in the participating institution having to provide for a future liability in its accounts in line with international accounting standards.  It strikes the balance by providing for an effective statement of intent that a surcharge may be imposed by way of a Finance Act provision at a specific point in the future in the event of NAMA having made an aggregate loss at that time.  The loss will have to be certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General, based on his or her auditing of the accounts of NAMA from its establishment to the date on which the surcharge is to be applied.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The proposed surcharge will have the following characteristics.  No surcharge will apply until at least ten years after the passing of the NAMA Bill.  The aggregate surcharge to be imposed will not exceed the loss incurred by NAMA.  The surcharge will be apportioned among the participating institutions according to the book value of the assets transferred to NAMA.  In other words, the aggregate book value of all the assets transferred from the different institutions will be examined and the proportion of the surcharge for which any one institution will be liable will be the percentage of assets it transferred to NAMA.  The other characteristic is that the surcharge imposed on any institution will not exceed the amount of corporation tax due in that period.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment provides another way of calculating the participating institutions&rsquo; contribution to the surcharge.  We believe the way proposed in the Bill strikes the balance better than what the Senator proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The way it is structured in the Bill means that Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland must try to put funds aside for Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s losses.  Anglo Irish Bank is more likely to have the larger losses in the loan book that is transferred to NAMA.  If a surcharge is imposed in ten years, it appears AIB and Bank of Ireland will have to make allowances for that.</P>

	<P>When I brought forward a proposal that the levy should be introduced from the outset, I was ridiculed by the Minister for Finance on the basis that what I was <Col N="221"/>suggesting would spook the markets.  What will be the effect of the proposal that in ten years&rsquo; time some of the participating banks will be responsible for the undefined losses incurred by Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide and any other institutions which have unbelievably bad loans?</P>
        <P>No one will take any pleasure from NAMA failing.  If, as time passes, a significant level of losses build up and if Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide disappear, the remaining participating institutions, which are dealing in a smaller and less profitable market, will be obliged to shoulder the losses to which I refer.  We are not discussing the fairness of what is being done, rather we are concerned with the effect on the financial sector of that to which I refer, which sector, as already stated, may be obliged to take a further hit in ten years&rsquo; time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what Senator Twomey says.  The question that arises is, in the event of NAMA making a loss &mdash; I hope it will not do so &mdash; whether the taxpayer or the participating institutions should bear that loss.  Either one believes it should be the those institutions or one does not.  If there is going to be a future liability, I accept that this will overhang the successful participating institutions.  However, we have tried to avoid creating a situation whereby these institutions will be obliged to provide for this on their balance sheets by way of a contingent liability because this would have a detrimental effect.  We are trying to repair those balance sheets rather than do something which would have further adverse effects on them.</P>
        <P>We have tried to ensure the banks will not be obliged to put money aside.  There could be a surcharge in ten years&rsquo; time.  The most effective way to assess the percentage each participating institution will contribute to the surcharge is that laid out in the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that in three years&rsquo; time, when it is hoped matters in the financial sector will have improved, international investors will again become interested in our banking sector.  It will then be pointed out to them that a surcharge may have to be paid in the future.  NAMA may be showing good potential at that stage but if it is not, then we are only making more trouble for ourselves.  What we are discussing revolves around achieving a balance between the taxpayer and the financial sector.  There are those of us who believe taxpayers are receiving a raw deal in respect of the &euro;54 billion they are investing, that the problems we are setting out to resolve may not go away and that the banks will be the ultimate beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>We appear to be at cross-purposes with regard to what we are trying to achieve.  We have already taken a hit and I am of the view that we should probably reconsider this matter in the context of how the financial sector might be affected in years to come.  Since the Minister disagreed with me with regard to imposing the levy from the outset, perhaps we should leave out the entire sector until we see how NAMA&rsquo;s work is progressing.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Is five years too long a timeframe in this regard?  If a decision is going to be made under this section with regard to whether the continuation of NAMA is necessary, surely the position should be reviewed annually or perhaps every two years.</P>
        <P>Section 224(3)(<i>a</i>) goes to the heart of the matter.  Under it, the Minister will be obliged to assess whether NAMA is working and make public the findings in that regard.

	<P>Would it not then make sense to have a review period that is shorter than five years?  I may be missing something and perhaps the Minister will indicate if that is the case.  It may be the case that by 2012 we will discover that there is a case for winding up NAMA.  However, this is extremely unlikely.  In such circumstances, therefore, after 2012 should we not review its activities more often than every five years?  The Minister indicated that the Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out a review every three years.  I am of the view that three years is a reasonable timeframe and I did not, therefore, make this point in respect of section 223.  If we are stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be carrying out his review every three years after 2012, then surely that which is envisaged in section 224 should be performed more often than every five years.  Perhaps it should be done every three years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of judgment.  The review by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be carried out every three years.  The ministerial review <Col N="223"/>relates to the broader policy aspects of the legislation, the state of the property market and the evolution of the banking sector.  These are wider matters and a longer period will be required for their consideration.  That is why it was decided that the ministerial review should be carried out every five years.</P>
        <P>Stating that there will be a ministerial debate every five years will not exclude NAMA from public debate.  The legislation simply indicates that the Minister of the day will be obliged to carry out a review every five years.  It would be undesirable for the reviews of the Minister and Comptroller and Auditor General to run parallel to each other because matters would become confused.  That is the thinking behind the section.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Molaim leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBille ag an bpointe seo.  Section 227 states: &ldquo;Section 7 of the Official Languages Act 2003 does not apply in relation to this Act.&rdquo;  An rud at&aacute; sa ph&iacute;osa sin den Acht sin, I will read into the record, &ldquo;As soon as may be after the enactment of any Act of the Oireachtas, the text thereof shall be printed and published in each of the official languages simultaneously&rdquo;.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; sa Teach seo ar 8 Aibre&aacute;n 2003, nuair a bh&iacute; an tAire, an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, ag t&oacute;gaint an reachta&iacute;ocht sin &mdash; Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2002 &mdash; tr&iacute;d an Oireachtas.  Ag an uair sin, nuair a bh&iacute; an tAire &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ag tabhairt an Official Languages Act 2003 tr&iacute;d an Teach, bh&iacute; leas&uacute; curtha ag an Seanad&oacute;&iacute;r Joe McHugh, at&aacute; anois ina Theachta.  Thug mise taca&iacute;ocht don leas&uacute;, ach chuir an tAire ina gcoinne.  T&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sin ar fad anseo agam, ach n&iacute; l&eacute;ifidh m&eacute; ach an abairt dheireanach.  D&uacute;irt an tAire:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">T&aacute; an rud sa Bhille ioml&aacute;n sl&aacute;n agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir &eacute;al&uacute; uaidh.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir Acht ar bith a fhoilsi&uacute; gan &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh go comhuaineach i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla as seo amach ...</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, he said the Bill was completely safe and there was no escape from it.  No Act could be published from then on except in Irish and in English, provided the legislation was passed.  The Minister did not understand the cleverness of the Department of Finance.  It took one look at the provision and brought in legislation to the effect that in that one sense, section 7 of the Act does not apply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tuigim, nuair at&aacute; moladh &aacute; thabhairt agamsa don Aire &mdash; agus phl&eacute;igh m&eacute; &eacute; seo leis c&uacute;pla m&iacute; &oacute; shin &mdash; nach f&eacute;idir liom aon rud a mholadh that will add to the costs etc. agus tuigim go maith d&aacute; mba rud &eacute; go raibh m&eacute; ag moladh go mbeadh seo cl&oacute;bhuailte agus foilsithe i gc&oacute;ip chrua that there would be costs attached to that.  Nuair a bh&iacute; an rud seo &aacute; phl&eacute; sa Teach seo s&eacute; bhliain &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; mise go m&oacute;r den tuairim an uair sin that we should not have got into all the costs of printing annual reports in gloss and hard copy.  I suggested to the Minister at that stage, that as long as these documents were published on the Internet, anybody who wanted them could print them off.  However, that would not do the Minister, purist and virginal as he <Col N="224"/>is.  Such a thing would undermine the true Gael approach to matters.  Of course, he was better off changing the name of my town and doing other things.</P>

	<P Just="Left">C&uacute;pla bliain ina dhiaidh sin bh&iacute; an tAire s&aacute;sta go mbeadh doicim&eacute;id foilsithe ar an Idirl&iacute;on.  That satisfied everybody.  Bh&iacute; mise an-s&aacute;sta leis sin.</P>
        <P>Ag f&eacute;achaint ar an reachta&iacute;ocht os &aacute;r gcomhair anseo, chuir s&eacute; an-d&iacute;om&aacute; orm nuair a thuig m&eacute; go rabhamar chun &eacute;al&uacute; &oacute;n Acht chomh tapaidh sin agus gan focal &oacute;n Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta who should, rather than I, watch these things agus gan focal ar bith ach oiread &oacute; aon ceann de na heagrais Gaeilge who would queue outside my door if I wanted to protect the name of my town.  There is no word from them nuair at&aacute; muid ag cur reachta&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il, gan &eacute; a bheith ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tuigeann an tAire an motivation at&aacute; agam ag an bpointe seo.  Creidim, &oacute; thaobh dearcadh mhuintir na Gaeltachta de, go bhfuil seo scannalach agus n&aacute;ireach d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d.  I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, t&aacute; s&eacute; maslach chucu nach mbeadh an Bille n&oacute; an reachta&iacute;ocht ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.  Fi&uacute; &oacute;n taobh praitici&uacute;il de, some of the assets of NAMA will be lodged in Gaeltacht areas.  Gaeltacht lands and assets will be involved in this.  Aon uair a bh&iacute;onn aon ag&oacute;id n&oacute; consp&oacute;id sna Gaeltachta&iacute; faoi ruda&iacute; mar seo, m&aacute; th&eacute;ann s&eacute; go dt&iacute; na c&uacute;irteanna &mdash; as it well may do &mdash; ba mhaith an rud &eacute; go mbeadh an reachta&iacute;ocht ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.

An rud at&aacute; &aacute; mholadh agamsa n&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfar an leas&uacute; ar seo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is as Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, an Daingean, Dingle m&eacute;.

Anyway, n&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n saibhris ar imeall iarthar na t&iacute;re seo.  My area, is d&oacute;cha, is not the richest place.  N&iacute;l aon r&oacute;-shaibhreas ann.  Ach is tobar na Gaeilge i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re &eacute;.  Chomh maith le sin, is &aacute;it &eacute; ina nd&eacute;anann saor&aacute;naigh na t&iacute;re seo, muintir na Gaeltachta&iacute;, caomhn&uacute; ar chult&uacute;r, teanga agus sean n&oacute;sanna na t&iacute;re.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, n&iacute;l aon r&oacute;-shaibhreas acu.  N&iacute;l acu ach saibhreas a gcult&uacute;r agus a dteanga.  T&aacute; siad ag brath orainne go m&oacute;r.  Tuigim go n-aont&oacute;idh an tAire liomsa sa mh&eacute;id seo; t&aacute; s&eacute; de fhreagracht orainne gach seans agus gach deis a th&oacute;gaint agus gach iarracht a dh&eacute;anamh caomhn&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar chult&uacute;r na Gaeltachta&iacute;, an Teanga &mdash; m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir sin a dh&eacute;anamh &mdash; agus muintir na Gaeltachta&iacute;.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because I want people to recognise the situation.  I do not want people to see this as if coming from one of the kind of fascist groupings that often support the Irish language.  I make this plea on a practical level.  I want the people I went to school with and with whom I grew up to be able to do their business tr&iacute; Gaeilge if that is what they want to do.  I do not propose anything that will bring a huge cost to the Exchequer.  There are no costs involved except translation costs, which would be involved at some stage anyway.  Effectively, what I propose allows the Official Languages Act to be implemented, without the costs associated with it.  In that sense, I am heartened to think the Minister will accept the amendment.  That would make us all feel a bit better and would add to &aacute;illeacht na t&iacute;re.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; an Ghaeilge go fl&uacute;irseach agam agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar TG4 c&uacute;pla o&iacute;che &oacute; shin.  Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don leas&uacute; seo a mhol mo chara, an Seanad&oacute;ir Seosamh &Oacute; Tuathail.  This is a good amendment for several reasons.  First, it caters for people <Col N="225"/>in the Gaeltacht.  It also addresses the situation in a modern way.  We are catching up with the electronic world.  Also, and importantly, it involves only a small cost.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole was right to mention that some planning documents were printed in Irish and put on library shelves, but not one copy was ever bought or borrowed.  Given the considerable costs involved, people have a reason to begrudge the money spent.  However, publication in Irish is a constitutional requirement, but it is satisfied at minimal cost through this amendment, which makes appropriate provision for people who speak our own language.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator O&rsquo;Toole on his fluency and on his wonderful blas.  It is a long time since I heard the word &ldquo;n&aacute;ireach&rdquo;.  I think I am correct in thinking it means shameful.  Scannalach agus n&aacute;ireach.  I do not think the Minister can withstand that blistering.</P>

	<P>I support Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris.  It seems quite likely that in a few short years we will no longer print papers and annual reports in hard copy.  Everything will be done electronically, although that may threaten An Post and others who expect people to send letters.  Someone who spoke after me the other day mentioned he had received a letter in the post and found that unusual, because all of his mail generally came by e-mail.  I believe we are not looking forward enough.  The amendment makes great sense from the point of view of cost, but also from the point of view of modernity and of recognising where we are going.  This is the way of the future.</P>

The Minister will recall that the Government was very successful in getting Gaeilge recognised as one of the official languages of the European Union.  There is a great opportunity to stress test how well that is working.  I suggest the Minister first sends them a copy of the leagan Gaeilge den Bhille seo.  See how they translate it and compare like with like.  That will show how well they are doing their job.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask about the changes the Minister proposes to make to the Planning and Development Act 2000.  It is about extending planning for NAMA.  When this is being extended, are any changes to planning permission being contemplated which might improve the overall environment and the green agenda when applications come up for renewal?  This might not be directly connected, but are there any proposals concerning other planning where changes might be in train, even where they do not come up for renewal?  If a person decides to improve his or her planning by adding solar energy or heat recovery units, will this entail an additional fee because it means changing the original planning application or will this fee be waived if such alterations improve the environment?   That is not directly covered here.  What is directly covered is that where the planning permission is extended in projects taken over by NAMA, efforts should be made to promote a green agenda, thus improving the environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall certainly draw Senator Twomey&rsquo;s observations to the attention of the incoming board.  In fact, there is an amendment tabled to the Schedule, which will be addressed, I take it, when we discuss the Schedule, to ensure the capacity NAMA has to apply for or extend a planning permission will be harmonised with the proposal contained in legislation in connection with planning and development which I understand is before this House.  The wording &ldquo;at present&rdquo; in the Schedule is somewhat different from that in the other legislation before the House so there will be a harmonisation of the legislation.</P>
        <P>There has had to be one material difference, however.  When a planning permission lapses NAMA will have a short time period within which to reapply for permission.  There is a danger with an insolvent developer or builder that such a person could neglect to extend the permission.  That provision is to protect the taxpayer, but other than that the scheme I am proposing under this section is the same as the one being proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the planning Bill before this House.  Essentially, it means someone can apply to extend the permission.  Such an application is subject to the decision of the local authority.  It is open to the local authority to insert up-to-date planning conditions in the context of the application.</P>

	<P>I am sure the windfall tax issue has been discussed in-depth with the Minister.  This does not apply to one-off housing in rural areas.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with, say, a family that wants to sell a small site for a house to one of its members or someone else in the community.</P>

	<P>This is the amendment to ensure the provision in this Act mirrors the equivalent provision in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 which is being revised.  The Bill, as approved by the D&aacute;il, permitted a period of extension of planning permission from five to seven years in exceptional circumstances.  The amendment reduces the maximum period of extension to five years.  This will bring the period of the extension for planning permission into line with what it is intended to do generally on the enactment of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009.  The test for the granting of an extension is amended to reflect amendments proposed in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.  This incorporates an additional requirement so that the extension will be refused where changes in the development plan or development guidelines needing permission would not be granted were they applied for at a time the extension is sought.</P><Col N="231"/>
        <P>The amendment further requires that in considering an application under the provision referred to, the planning authority will have regard to the guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The amendment also clarifies that an application can be made by the agency before or after a previous planning permission has expired where the planning permission expires in the years 2009, 2010 or 2011.  Persons other than NAMA will not be entitled to seek an extension after permission has expired.  The differentiation is justified because in certain circumstances the agency might acquire property after the permission has expired and so will not be in a position to make an application for extension within the normal time limit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder will that apply to an individual who, for example, had planning permission in the countryside for a house and allowed it to lapse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister on the section.  It has been very carefully drafted to ensure the Bill going through the Seanad which might not come into law until next year will apply to NAMA.  The Minister is making provisions to ensure that if permissions lapse, there is protection for the State.  That is a very shrewd move in this regard.</P>
        <P>A different approach could possibly have been taken, however.  Local authorities have section 80 which differs slightly from the normal planning permission.  It is up to the county councils to grant planning permission on different grounds.  It is a fast-tracking approach, but as far as this Bill is concerned, this is a very shrewd move which protects the State&rsquo;s interests.  It deals with both sides of the coin in terms of the current situation in which some of them will lapse between now and Christmas and may be extended for a period of time and in terms of the new Act under which they can apply to the local authority and get an extension in the normal manner.  Well done.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 145, line 41, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the issue we have just been discussing in part 8 of the Schedule to which the Minister referred.  I understand and agree with the rationale for what is being proposed in the round.  It may be, however, that I have not followed the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill as closely as I ought and I undertake to rectify that but I am curious about the mandatory provision in respect of the planning authority that it &ldquo;shall&rdquo; extend the appropriate period.  It appears to override the planning authority because it removes any discretion from the authority.  We are entitled to be nervous if the authority&rsquo;s discretion is to be so bluntly overridden.  There are very good reasons for the expiration of planning permission after five years.  To say that the planning authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; seems like a blunt instrument.  I would appreciate further elucidation on the thinking behind this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that one is empowered to apply and the decision is taken on a set of criteria different from the original planning application, and to that extent NAMA has an element of entitlement to obtain the permission but it is not unrestricted.  My amendment is in the same sense as the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment to harmonise with the new legislation.  The authority must be satisfied:</P>
        <P LI="1">(I) there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission</P><Col N="232"/>
        <P LI="1">and</P>
        <P LI="1">(II) there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the regional planning guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the authority would not, as a result of those changes, grant an application for permission for the development as being in material contravention of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the authority&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is a threshold that must be satisfied before the agency can obtain a planning permission under this provision.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This relates to the windfall tax.  A total of six amendments have been proposed on the definition of rezoning.  For a word that is used commonly in political discourse it is extraordinarily difficult to give it an exact legal definition.</P>
        <P>The amendments have been made to remove any possible doubt about what is encompassed by the definition of rezoning in the sections.  The proposed changes in the definitions provide that a rezoning decision covers two different positions.  First, a change in rezoning of land from agricultural open space, recreational or amenity use to residential, commercial or industrial use or any mixture of such uses, and second, rezoning changes within these development land uses of residential, commercial or industrial, including a mixture of such uses.  It can cover changes from residential, commercial or industrial use or any mixture of such uses to agricultural, open space, recreational or amenity use but as can be appreciated such changes are unlikely to occur in reality.</P>
        <P>The proposed changes to the definition of rezoning necessitated the inclusion of two new definitions to cover development and non-development land uses.  Development land use covers residential, commercial or industrial, including a mixture of such uses where non-<Col N="234"/>development land use includes agricultural, open space, recreational or amenity use.  In the provision as originally published the definition of rezoning included these land uses and covered various types of change.  The amendments will ensure that there is no doubt about what a rezoning is within the development land use concept.</P>
        <P>There are also several drafting amendments included in the technical amendments.  They correct typographical errors and inadvertent exclusions.  It is also proposed to make a related amendment to the definition of a qualifying land for capital gains tax treatment purposes.</P>

	<P>I was involved in drafting a development plan for Dublin when I was on Dublin City Council and became quite familiar with all the definitions of land use.  One of the main definitions was institutional land.  Within the Dublin City Council area there is a great deal of land so classed.  This, however, is not mentioned in any of the Minister&rsquo;s definitions of land, particularly the non-development land.  Is there a reason for that?  Is the Minister happy that it is captured under the definitions?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know there was considerable controversy within Dublin City Council on this subject and I do not want to enter into that controversy.  I am not satisfied that institutional land use is a recognised legal land use category because the way land use is branded for legal categorical purposes is developed land, whether it is industrial, commercial, residential or for other uses such as agriculture.  In legal terms &ldquo;institutional&rdquo; is not a use, because it could be applied for example to a residential or a commercial institution. </P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P><Col N="237"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;Where NAMA proposes to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle to purchase, manage or dispose of assets , it shall do so only in accord with regulations published by the Minister and approved by the Oireachtas which shall include, but are not</P>
        <P LI="2">limited to:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the suitability of investors,</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the suitability and behaviours of members of the Board,</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) the finance, planning accountability and reporting,</P>

        <P LI="3">(<i>f</i>) its consistency with the statutory objectives of NAMA under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I am only moving this amendment on Report Stage because we felt it was a good amendment that the Minister would not accept on Committee Stage.  The Minister said he thought that the proposal to get the Irish people involved in the ownership of the private part of the SPV was not such a bad idea.  I decided I would table this amendment on Report Stage to see if the Minister had any further comments on that.  Making the people the owners of the private part of the SPV would help to legitimise this whole project in the next few years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EUROSTAT position on the balance sheet treatment of NAMA and the SPV took account of the balance between State and private engagement in the proposed organisation structure.  The proposed amendment could result in EUROSTAT changing its preliminary decision on the treatment of NAMA operations in the national accounts.  The amendment also runs the risk of making the SPV so unattractive to any investor that no suitable investor can be found.</P>
        <P>I have repeatedly explained that we should welcome the EUROSTAT preliminary decision, as a result of which the acquisition of the assets from the institutions by NAMA will have no effect on our general Government debt ratio or our general Government balance.  This puts the Irish asset protection scheme on an equivalent footing with bank support schemes in other member states that are also being recorded off balance sheet.  The main advantage of this is that it minimises the danger of the markets and international investors misinterpreting our headline debt or budget balance ratios when comparing us against other EU member states.  However, I have also repeatedly stated that the statistical treatment does not change the basic fact that the operations of NAMA will lead to an increase in the amount of the State&rsquo;s potential liabilities.  Neither should it be overlooked that these liabilities will be met by a countervailing asset holding.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the master SPV will be established by the NAMA board to conduct the purchase, management and disposal of loan assets identified and valued by NAMA.  The legislation provides a robust process for the appointment of board members, requiring that they have senior level experience and expertise in relevant areas.  I have indicated that I would consult the Opposition leaders on the appointments to the board in the interests of creating <Col N="238"/>all-party confidence in the board.  I have already received a letter in that respect today from the leader of the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>It is an executive matter for the expert board to allow NAMA to carry out its business in the most efficient and effective manner.  We must be careful that in creating a board to carry out a complex commercial task, for which the members will be accountable, we do not then undermine their ability to carry out their duties and functions by the imposition of statutory regulations and restrictive rules which prevent them acting in a commercial manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A detailed legal shareholder agreement is being drawn up, and that will be put in place to ensure that at all times, the NAMA board has a veto over any master SPV actions or decisions.  This will protect the NAMA board itself, which has significant responsibilities, and it will also be in the interests of citizens.  I intend to issue a direction to the board of NAMA that not a single decision should be made or allowed to be pursued by the master SPV which will not be in the best interests of achieving the objectives and purposes of the NAMA legislation.  Following the D&aacute;il debate, a number of amendments were made to reflect the role of the master SPV in the NAMA group entities.  As I outlined these amendments on Committee Stage, I will not reiterate them now.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;(1) There shall be established a &ldquo;Register of Derivatives&rdquo; on the commencement of this Act, which shall include information on derivatives obtained under this Act and shall be detailed in the annual accounts of NAMA.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) Information to be recorded under <i>subsection 1 </i>shall include, but is not limited to:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the market value of the derivative,</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the name of the counter party to the derivative, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) the date of maturity of the derivative,</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) such other information as the Minister from time to time directs.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This arises from some points that I made on Second Stage and during the discussion in this House a few weeks ago about the NAMA business plan.  The majority of the discussion that we have had on the assets for which NAMA will be responsible has focused on the loans for the properties in question.  The NAMA business plan also makes clear that when this organisation is set up, it will be taking on responsibility for a huge amount of derivative contracts in respect of the properties for which loans were given.  The value of these particular contracts is between &euro;16 billion and &euro;18 billion, according to the business plan.</P>
        <P>This is a gigantic amount of money and is also based on derivatives, some of which have been at the heart of the difficulty faced by banks all over the world.  These instruments had complicated interrelationships as one bank would own a certain amount while the counterparty would be another bank.  Nobody really understood their value and how they would perform in light of a change in market conditions.</P>
        <P>Given the amount of money involved and given the difficult recent track record that these tools have, the Bill as set out does not have too much to say about them.  The word &ldquo;derivative&rdquo; <Col N="239"/>is only mentioned twice in the entire Bill.  It is mentioned as part of the definition of a credit facility at the beginning of the Bill, and the examination of derivative contracts to allow NAMA to place a market value on a bank asset is mentioned in the section dealing with long-term economic value.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My proposal is an attempt to shed more light on the value of the derivative contracts for which the State will be responsible.  The business plan mentions the currency breakdown of the derivatives and it makes the point that the derivatives are mostly in respect of currency hedging for property acquisitions.  The plan mentions little about their content and what could happen in the future. This proposal is to establish a register of derivatives on the commencement of this Bill.  This document would contain four pieces of information.  First, it would indicate the market value of the derivative contract, something that is easy to establish.  One only has to look at a computer screen to get the answer to that.  Second, it would name the counterparty to the derivative.  That is particularly important because in the past 18 months quite a few hedge funds have gone out of business for reasons with which we are familiar.  It is worth knowing with whom we will have those counter deals.  It would also be worth establishing how many of the &euro;16 billion of these positions are between Irish banks.  Third, it would indicate the date of maturity of those and when they will expire.  Fourth, it will indicate any information the Minister will want to provide on those contracts.</P>
        <P>Speakers from all sides of the House have frequently said we cannot have too little transparency in this area and that the lack of transparency, information and clarity was a contributing factor to the difficulty in which we find ourselves.  The misuse and lack of understanding of those very tools have caused massive difficulty and I am proposing an amendment that will allow us understand the State&rsquo;s exposure to them, the contracts and with whom we have that exposure.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>An interesting amendment.  NAMA, like the National Treasury Management Agency annual report or any bank annual report, will publish the type of derivative, the nominal value of the derivative, the mark to market value of the derivative and all of those values as of the financial account reporting date.  NAMA will also publish the maturity date of derivatives by calendar year, for example, 2010, 2011, 2012.  All that information will require to be published in the annual report, which is the current practice with the NTMA, but it is not appropriate to publish the name of the counterparty to the agency, whether the counterparty is categorised as a borrower or a lender, in sharing this particular risk in regard to money.  It is not appropriate to publish the name of the counterparty as that will be the name of the underlying counterparty.  The information will be subject to the approval of the form of the NAMA accounts and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The information in the amendment &mdash; the market value, the date of maturity and other information &mdash; will be contained in the annual report but the identity of the counterparty to the derivative is not disclosed under current NTMA practice.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(viii) to ensure that the measures taken in this Act restore confidence in the banking sector are reciprocated by lending by the participating institutions to members of the public generally in their private capacity and to small and medium enterprise in particular,</P>
        <P LI="2">(ix) to ensure an orderly property management strategy over a ten year period following the enactment of this Act,</P>
        <P LI="2">(x) to recover the maximum funds for taxpayers by ensuring that the principal and exclusive purpose of NAMA is to recover the maximum funds possible for the assets acquired by NAMA under this Act, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(xi) to take all necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that brought about the financial crisis.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We discussed this issue on Committee Stage and the proposals are self-explanatory.  Does the Minister have any plans to publish a ten-year strategy on how NAMA will work out and how it will dispose of its property?  The concern is the size of NAMA.  NAMA is massive.  It will be the biggest property company, and probably the biggest development company, in the country.  It will control significant assets for a number of years.  Once this legislation has been passed I would like to know the Minister&rsquo;s plans to provide more information on the future of NAMA in the next decade.  The purpose of this amendment is to insert a requirement in the legislation seeking that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I support what Senator Twomey said in regard to the amendment.  One of the points made in the discussion on Committee Stage was that while everybody here is emphasising that the NAMA institution must take all steps possible to ensure this does not happen again, this amendment proposes that it be put on a statutory footing as part of the purpose of the organisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second point I would emphasise, which Senator Twomey has touched on, is that paragraph (viii) gets to the heart of our discussion in terms of needing to find a way of providing all the guidance we can for the institution and that the huge investment going in from the taxpayer leads directly to greater liquidity and lending to small and medium-sized businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to paragraph (xi) which states: &ldquo;to take all necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that brought about the financial crisis&rdquo;.  The Minister has a letter from the Frontline Alliance.  I have just come from the streets.  I walked passed them, and most of them recognised me.  I am one of their strongest critics but what struck me was the lack of rancour, the discipline and the decency with which they conducted that march.</P>
        <P>The Minister has spoken eloquently to me in the past about his admiration for the public sector.  In terms of the least we might do out of this crisis, we are now having to ask the front line people in the public sector to give back some of the inflated benchmarking agreements that were made in the bubble for which they were not responsible.  That is a hard task.  It has to be done, and I am not in any way reneguing from it.  The public sector will have to take a cut but I believe the Minister and the House would join me in expressing the wish that the <Col N="241"/>reward for this cut should be that we determine to reform the public sector, make it fit for purpose and create conditions which inspire enthusiasm, energy and a sense of career purpose in those who will work in a renewed and enthused public sector.  I know this is the bottom of the well, so to speak, but out of all periods of recession come great reforms.  I hope the Minister will consider, in his other capacity later, on foot of trying to ensure these conditions do not recur, what Senator Norris said this morning about the need to look after the people in the public sector and the private sector whose backs are against the wall and who are terrified in regard to negative equity, and to look after them in the workplace as well as those out of work.  I do not want to do a Pollyanna on it but I believe the public sector is now having to carry some of the consequences from which its workers benefited but of which they were not the authors.  The least we might do is give them a reformed public service that is fit for purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment but want to raise questions on paragraphs (ix) and (xi).  Paragraph (ix) states: &ldquo;to ensure an orderly property management strategy over a ten year period ....&rdquo;.  Paragraph (xi) states: &ldquo;to take all the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that brought about the financial crisis&rdquo;.  I raised this issue on Committee Stage yesterday and, unfortunately, the Minister was not present at the time but the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, was present.  </P>
        <P>The issue I raise is not unrelated to amendment No. 29 by my colleague, Senator Coghlan, who also raised it on Committee Stage.  It concerns property acquired by NAMA.  Obviously, such property will be taken in for a reason, say, if there are over &euro;5 million in borrowings and they are related to housing, land and so forth.  There are quite a number of developers and house builders in that bracket.  I heard a house builder say on a radio programme that they could end up in NAMA; I speak about the likes of McInerney, which specialises mainly in house building.  I put the question to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, yesterday, that if that company has a performing asset on which equity has built up, it would be unable to use that equity as collateral for a further development.  The Minister of State replied that it could use the equity but it would not be for housing.  If it is not for housing then it must be for commercial use and there is probably an over-supply of commercial property in the State also.  The main business of the likes of McInerney is house building and if what the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated is correct, then McInerney and companies like it will not be able to go forward in the business of building houses unless they can borrow from NAMA, which will have funding of up to &euro;5 billion available for such work.  I want the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to clarify this important point.  It is the kernel of all of this.  What we will have, in effect, is the State controlling house building and housing right throughout the length and breadth of the State, if a company which may be in NAMA cannot use its built-up equity for the purposes in which it specialises, namely building houses.  It is an issue at which the Minister must look.</P>
        <P>I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on it.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to contribute subsequently as this is Report Stage.  However, I draw his attention to the remarks made by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, that the company would be able to use the equity, but not for housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is like a mission statement.  I do not see it doing the slightest damage, but it is really rather exhortatory.</P>
        <P>I want to take up what my distinguished colleague, Senator Harris, had to say, and welcome it strongly.  He has been a harsh and trenchant critic of the Frontline Alliance for clear and idealistic reasons.  There was no nastiness in it.  He felt it passionately.  Having seen these people <Col N="242"/>and their response, he feels these are not dangerous Jacobins; these are ordinary and decent people.</P>
        <P>I also saw that march and I was impressed by them.  They asked would I be with them on the 24th and I replied that I sincerely hope it will not be necessary for them to be there.  I hope they can be persuaded and that their plight can be looked at because Frontline Alliance services are at the delivery point of the most important services to the average citizen.</P>
        <P>Frontline Alliance, in its little leaflet, gives a couple of examples, such as the present position in health.  I am sure the Minister will be aware of this.  This is why it is so important to get this thing done properly.  I agree with the idea that we must take all necessary steps to prevent this because what is already happening is so awful, and there is more to come.  In health, gone are 6,000 staff, 4,000 hospital beds and 300 front-line posts, and there is the cutting of patient transport and ambulance services, the increasing of accident and emergency fees to &euro;125, the increasing of thresholds for medical cards and drug refund schemes, and the means testing of home care.</P>
        <P>I am all in favour of means testing everything, but it is all a question of where the bar is set.  It could be devilishly unfair if it is set wrong, but I have no difficulty with means testing.  I realise that would exclude me from many services.  I do not care a damn; it never bothered me.</P>
        <P>On crime, 350 Garda stations are closing.  My local police station, Fitzgibbon Street, is being closed.  It is unbelievable that with a serious crime problem this major station in the heart of the city of Dublin is being closed.  The Garda states the station is closing for redecoration, but I did not come down the Liffey in a bubble.  The leaflet also refers to such matters as 800 front-line Garda posts gone, the shelving of the new urban CCTV, the closing of 40% of the courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I doubt if NAMA will be involved in Garda stations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Of course, it is.  It is part of the problem.  It is exactly related to paragraph (xi) in the amendment, and I am taking up from what Senator Harris stated.</P>
        <P>I just want to state the following three sets of figures on the deduction since the April budget.  On a salary of &euro;31,500 per annum, for the average PAYE worker the deduction is &euro;945 per annum, but for the front-line workers it is &euro;3,345 per annum or &euro;195 per month, which is what most of us used pay on a mortgage.  On a salary of &euro;45,000, for the average PAYE worker the deduction is &euro;1,350 per annum or &euro;112 per month, but for a front-line worker &mdash; these are nurses, fire brigade staff, garda&iacute;, ambulance workers &mdash; it is &euro;4,100 per annum or &euro;342 per month.  That is real pressure.  That is why I so much agree with Senator Harris and why I feel strongly that we must never allow this to happen again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing amendment No. 3.  Senator Callely will understand Senators are allowed contribute only once on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his work to date and on his endeavours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the purpose of the Bill, we all are aware this is a complex area.  I spoke following Senator Burke on the same issue yesterday.  The language we all are getting to know about performing and non-performing assets, loans and transfers, SPVs and other stuff is quite complex.</P>
        <P>In amendment No. 3, on restoring confidence in the banking sector, orderly property management strategy, maximising funds and steps to prevent recurrence, will the Minister clarify <Col N="243"/>the position on a loan transferred in light of what has been stated about any equity value in a performing asset, or even in a non-performing asset depending on when it was purchased?  Will the Minister simply clarify that it is the loan rather than the asset that is being transferred, the management of the loan continues with the financial institution, the conditions associated with that &mdash; unless a new agreement has been reached &mdash; remain in place, and the asset, or the portfolio, depending on the value and the size &mdash; is managed as it was prior to NAMA?</P>
        <P>We are in a complex area, uncharted waters.  As Senator Harris said, there is concern among certain groups in society who feel they are carrying the can.  There are other groups within the financial institutions who are pointing the figure at NAMA and stating that the rules are being changed because of the transfer to NAMA.</P>
        <P>I say this equally for the benefit of the Minister.  My understanding is that there are a number of accountancy practices which are not able to grapple with what I stated here on where what is and who deals with what.  Some state &mdash; this might come from some of the financial institutions along with the accountancy practices &mdash; one&rsquo;s loan and portfolio has been transferred.  That is not my understanding and the Minister might bring clarity to that.</P>
        <P>Maybe people are using this new tool as a vehicle to get out of a particular position or to change what has been prior to the birth of NAMA.  When we get into the other amendments the position can become somewhat confusing.  Will the Minister clarify that where people have a loan, it is the loan that is transferred, the management remains with the financial institution, and that the benefits, if any, arising from the portfolio, the performing asset or the non-performing asset can be utilised by the promoters behind the portfolio or the asset base.  Will he clarify that NAMA will only deal with the financial institutions from which it takes the loans and there will be no direct contact with the customers of the financial institutions whose loans are being transferred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>To take up the point dealt with by Senator Burke, I understood that until this legislation is completed, NAMA is not a functioning body.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>A point was made earlier today that the banks did not intend to honour an &euro;11 million cheque paid out by a certain company for a contract because of the NAMA commitment.  If NAMA is not a working body at present, how can the banks make that statement?  The lending institutions must be careful about what they are doing at this time.  It is not right to use legislation that has not yet left the House and for institutions to make excuses that they cannot do this or that because of NAMA.  However, the Minister has just cleared up this point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, Senator Burke referred to McInerney Homes, which is a house building company.  It will have to make a business plan, which it will presumably put to NAMA.  The main reason NAMA might hold up some of its developments is because it would not be able to sell some of the houses on the market.  That is the reality and why we have NAMA in the first place.  We cannot blame NAMA for the fact there is no market.  In fact, NAMA is to achieve the opposite in that no fire sales will take place because NAMA will control most of the property market.  This is a good thing in a way, because property will increase in value much more quickly because of NAMA.  When there is a scarce commodity, which property will be, the market certainly moves more quickly.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that Senator Burke&rsquo;s point is correct.  If whatever company goes into NAMA has a good business plan, it will be able to continue to work within NAMA.  However, such companies will have to have liquidity and credit through NAMA.  It will be critical that NAMA <Col N="244"/>deals with business plans quickly because, if it was not to deal with them on an urgent basis, we could find that we would be putting many companies that could stay in business out of business.  That is a key point.</P>
        <P>The three arms of NAMA &mdash; business, credit and the special purpose vehicle &mdash; must work very closely together.  If they do not, we would certainly have a problem.  I ask the Minister to clarify what kind of mechanism would be put in place to deal with the business plan and make sure it is not being frustrated in the system, as we find with regard to red tape in legislation whereby business cannot function.  I hope the Minister can deal with those questions.</P>

	<P>What the Minister is trying to do through NAMA is restore confidence in the banking system and, through that, in the economy.  With that in mind, I want to ask about his response to material linked to this amendment concerning confidence in the Minister&rsquo;s projections that has been put in the public arena by Mr. Peter Mathews &mdash; I know the Minister has looked at this material.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to what Mr. Mathews says in regard to the assumptions underlying NAMA.  He suggests that the assumption there would be 100% recovery on the &euro;30.8 billion of performing loans is completely wishful thinking, bordering on fanciful, and the assumption that there will be 50% recovery on the &euro;46.2 billion of non-performing loans is equally fanciful.  He goes on to quote what the Minister&rsquo;s adviser, Dr. Alan Ahearne, said last year in regard to the banks, namely, that they should sell these loans at fair market value.</P>
        <P>I raise this point simply because it is very much in the public domain and has been circulated to all Senators and Deputies.  I am genuinely interested in this.  We were talking about whether NAMA would make a profit, and there was also some discussion on this point earlier.  On Mr. Mathews&rsquo;s figures, he suggests NAMA will make a loss of between &euro;12 billion and &euro;18 billion, and that the assumptions the Minister is putting forward in the business plan and elsewhere are quite fanciful.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to that today.  Quite a number of papers have been presented to all of us by this gentleman.  The question is linked to this issue of confidence and the desire to achieve confidence in this plan.  Will the Minister address the House in regard to the points that have been made about the potential losses of between &euro;12 billion and &euro;18 billion?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I record my appreciation and admiration for the Minister for being so attentive to this legislation.  I have listened to almost all the contributions.  Although the members of the largest Opposition party, Fine Gael, have strong reservations about the Bill, they have endeavoured to improve it to the best of their ability.  I commend them and the Labour Party for their efforts.  They could have ignored it and walked out, saying they were not going to participate in the legislation.   They have done better than that because they have given the opportunity to the Minister to consider aspects of the Bill, which has been very worthwhile.  I compliment all our colleagues in the Seanad on what has been an extremely good and very informative debate.  I am sure the Minister would agree we have done the State some service in this regard.</P>

	<P>I wanted to clarify the situation referred to by Senator Harris.  The Minister kindly received and read the letter.  The point made very clearly to me by the people involved was that they hope the Minister acts on the letter.  I sent a text back to them on that issue.</P>
        <P>I know the difficulties, as we all do.  Some young people in the public service are not on the maximum income and have committed themselves to very expensive loans through the activities of the banks, which the Minister is now resolving.  They are landed with negative equity and the danger that they will have a reduction in their pay, which will make it difficult to repay the loans.  The Minister understands and appreciates that.  This was one of the points they made to me.  Another point they submitted to the Minister is that a reduction in overall salary has an effect in regard to the long-term pensions for retired members.  These were the issues, although I know the Minister is burdened with many issues.</P>
        <P>The guarantee scheme which the Minister introduced in September 2008 will extend to September 2010.  I ask the Minister when summing up to clarify the situation.  Concern has been expressed to me by ordinary savers who have funds which are guaranteed under the scheme.  I was asked recently where it was best to put money, whether in the post office or another institution which would really guarantee future deposits.  While I know there is no danger to deposits because the guarantee is in place, I ask the Minister to state clearly that the guarantee will be extended continuously with regard to deposits.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This issue is linked to NAMA as it is all linked to the banking situation.  Without the Minister&rsquo;s quick action last year, we would have been in dire straits and the banking system would have collapsed due to a run on funds.  The banks know that, and know the Minister responded extremely efficiently.  To my knowledge, it has not cost the State.  The charge to the banks for the guarantee introduced last year has resulted in some funds accruing to the Government.  The only group in the House that opposed the guarantee was the Labour Party.  Will the Minister clarify the points I have raised?</P>
        <P>With regard to a point I made on Second Stage, there is a role for the OPW in carrying out the work of NAMA.  The Minister&rsquo;s Department has direct responsibility for the OPW.  It is the largest architectural practice in Ireland and has done most extraordinary work for the country.  It has been decentralised to Trim.  It has the capacity to manage estates and properties of architectural and heritage value.  There is no need for any amendment to facilitate the OPW because the Minister has full power over the organisation.  The OPW has a role to play and it would be worthwhile investigating where it could be of assistance to NAMA in carrying out its responsibilities.</P>
        <P>I received very good advice on this matter.  I will not read it because I was asked not to.  The country needs a solution and NAMA is the only one available currently.  The legislation establishing it needs to be implemented.  The United States took a similar approach in the 1980s, as the Minister knows, and it proved successful and paid off.  The US taxpayer actually won because of the decision taken at the time.</P>
        <P>To some extent, the issue whether NAMA will pay more than the current market price is not the most important.  Whatever excess it might pay will be more than recouped once economic activity resumes.  The State will generate an additional return in the form of an equity return on its shareholdings in the banks.  To my mind, it could be a win-win situation.  The Minister would not have gone down this road in the first instance if he could have avoided it or if the banks could have solved the problem.</P>
        <P>The banks will attract more funds. There is considerable funding available, irrespective of whether one believes this.  Those who made money on the sale of properties and land, including <Col N="246"/>builders, have money.  Some of this money is still available and if the Minister could make it attractive for it to be invested, be it in Anglo Irish Bank or a bond, it would be tremendous.  I have been made aware that, through the special purpose vehicles, funds from private sources can be raised.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill.  It is receiving tremendous support from the public which is impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s handing, command and knowledge of the issues involved.  I compliment him and his officials who have done tremendous work on NAMA.  I have been a Member since 1977, although I had a break for ten years, and in that time I never dealt with a more important Bill than this one.  All we can do is wish it success.  It will be successful in the longer term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a long series of interventions.  Senator Twomey, who moved the amendment, inquired into the nature of the business plan.  The interim business plan that was discussed is simply an interim draft plan.  The final plan, which will be a ten-year plan, will have to be approved by the board of the agency when it is appointed.</P>
        <P>The interim business plan is a draft and an indication of the character of the final business plan.  The final one will be prepared and submitted to the board of NAMA for approval.  This is the position on the business plan of NAMA and its strategic direction.</P>
        <P>Very little was said about the amendment.  I will deal with the various points raised.  Quite a number of the amendments proposed are already encompassed by various objectives or functions of the legislation or else they are surplus to legal requirements.  A proposed purpose of the legislation that caught Senator Harris&rsquo;s eye is, &ldquo;to take all necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that brought about the financial crisis&rdquo;.  While it is not appropriate to include this in legislation, it is entirely appropriate that this should be an objective, not just through NAMA but through the reform of the regulatory system and public financial system and the restructuring of the banking system.  There is a wide range of action points.</P>
        <P>The mandate of NAMA is very clear.  I do not want to reiterate the argument on estimating and fixing the long-term economic value based on appreciation of 10% or 15% if one takes the subordinated bonds into account.  We will not agree on this but, on any view, it is fair to say modest assumptions are being made.  What is envisaged through NAMA is a sustainable construction industry rather than the bubble-driven one we witnessed in recent years.  We can agree on that.</P>
        <P>The objective of national economic and social development is written in as a compelling need that NAMA must address.  This accommodates the Senators.  This matter was raised by the Labour Party in the D&aacute;il and it is covered by the legislation.  It is important that it is stipulated within the legislation that the board of NAMA should have regard to the social and economic development of the country.</P>
        <P>The amendment deals with the question of lending.  We have included in the Bill specific powers to give guidelines on lending and to police them.  The compelling need NAMA must address is the need to facilitate lending.  Clearly, NAMA is not a lender.  Reference is made in the amendment to an orderly property management strategy.  The business plan will address this.</P>
        <P>The debate covered more than the amendment.  Senator Harris stated he was discussing the current economic position with a number of public sector workers who are engaged in front-line operations and a day of action today.  It is important to record, because it has not been part of the debate, that public servants have been subject to a substantial reduction or adjustment in their salaries already.  I have been very struck by this since the supplementary budget in April. <Col N="247"/> The average reduction is approximately 6.9%.  It was a little over that in the initial measure announced in March but it was adjusted in the supplementary budget in April.  The average deduction among all public servants has been 6.9%.  It is higher for those further up the income scale and a little lower for those further down.  That is a substantial adjustment.  The argument will be made that many in the private sector have been subject to similar adjustments.  This is true but not all have.</P>
        <P>I deeply appreciate the services provided by public servants.  It is important to note this in the debate but this does not absolve us from the need to ensure our public services are delivered in an efficient way that is cost-effective for the taxpayer.  While the costs of many goods and services have been falling during the crisis, the cost of public goods and services has not.  This has become an increasing burden on the rest of the community.  There is a responsibility, not just on the central Government but also on all parties concerned with local government, to address the excessive cost structure in the public sector.  The economy cannot sustain it.  This is all I want to say in reply to Senator Harris.  I agree with him on the importance of and the work done by garda&iacute;, nurses, firemen and many others in the emergency services.  I am glad he was able to report to the House that the debate was conducted in a civilised way.  There is growing public awareness that we must make a very substantial adjustment.  We will be debating this in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
        <P>Senator Paddy Burke was concerned with the question of equity and the builder who has equity left in a property and who may find it difficult to obtain a loan.  If the builder has equity remaining, he should be able to obtain facilities from the banks.  If the builder wishes to obtain facilities from NAMA, there is provision under the legislation for &euro;5 billion which will be concentrated on incomplete developments.</P>
        <P>That a loan will be transferred to NAMA does not mean a bank will not be able to extend credit to a reliable borrower in that context.  It is important to make that point.  Again, this relates to the working out of the loan and this operation.  Let us be clear: the current financial model for construction and development in Ireland is broken.  One of the reasons for this &mdash; this is not the fault of builders or developers &mdash; is that it is built on the enterprise and industry of the individuals or the companies they incorporated as private companies and dependent upon one development to fund the next.  That is not a structured financial model that will ensure the construction industry will revive to a sustainable level.  The reason for the drop in asset prices is this is an unsustainable financial model to restart the construction sector.  It is worth noting that in other jurisdictions there are available a far wider range of financial models to fund the construction sector.  In many countries the sector does not depend on one development to fund the next.  Many construction companies in the United Kingdom, for example, have gone to the market and raised the funds which form their capital base.  This allows for a more structured investment in a company over time.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke referred to a particular company.  I do not wish to go into the difficulties of an individual company but that company is organised as a public limited company, PLC.  Many of the UK building companies are organised as public liability companies.  What has happened in the course of this crisis is that the banks have taken their shares and taken on responsibility for working out the management of companies.  It is not possible to do that in this jurisdiction because the bulk of the building and construction activity here covering two third of the NAMA loans located in Ireland was undertaken by private individuals or private individuals who incorporated small companies in which the corporate equity contribution is uncertain.</P>
        <P>We need more flexible models.  NAMA, in amassing this land bank and the amount of loans it will amass, will, when it enforces securities, undoubtedly, be in a position to attract funding into the sector.  I have heard many CIF representatives and individual builders and developers <Col N="248"/>make the point made by Senator Burke, namely, that they are concerned they will not receive credit under this system.  However, the reality is that they are not receiving any credit under the current system which for funding the construction sector in Ireland is a broken model.  It is entirely dependent on the equity of the last development.  This will not fund a return to sustainability in the building sector.  We are all aware the number of houses that will be constructed here this year and next could be as low as 10,000.  The vast majority of these houses will be accounted for by once-off developments rather than systematic estate-type developments.</P>
        <P>I have been at pains throughout this debate to make it clear that I am not advocating a return to the conditions where we were constructing approximately 70,000 or 80,000 houses a year.  Most of the data on this subject in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government suggest we have an ongoing need for 30,000 to 40,000 house units a year, which we will have to meet.  This will require a sustainable construction industry.  The current financial condition of the sector and its financial model will not secure this objective, which is a separate argument for the agency, on which I have not yet embarked upon much in public debate, although I mentioned it at a committee meeting in August.  Naturally, there were other topics of greater interest to members, in particular, protection of the taxpayer which should be a legitimate and proper concern for public representatives.  I thank Senator Burke for raising the issue, as it raises many important points on this legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris echoed the views of Senator Harris on the economic crisis.  While I have commented on the matter, I would make the point that we have three distinct problems: we have our difficulties with the public finances &mdash; our receipts are far lower than what we spend; we have a problem generally with our cost structures which allowed us to become uncompetitive &mdash; by 2007 our unit labour costs were the highest in the eurozone, while our third problem is that we have a banking crisis.  Unfortunately, each of these problems, although distinct, is related and must be tackled to put this country on the road to economic recovery.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callely raised a number of specific questions which are important.  Like Senator Burke, he is also reflecting, not so much on what builders and developers are saying as builders and developers but on what they are saying as customers of financial institutions.  As Senator Butler correctly stated, NAMA does not yet exist.  It has assumed an existence in the public mind which it does not yet have.  It does not exist for a legal or any other purpose.  </P>
        <P>Senator Callely sought clarification in regard to what was being transferred to NAMA.  The asset which is transferred is the bank loan, not the collateral.  If NAMA has to take enforcement action, action will be taken to secure the collateral and eventually sell it.  What is transferred initially under the legislation is a bank loan.  The bank loan agreement remains in place.  NAMA steps into the shoes of the banks and has the same rights and duties as the bank in regard to the loan.  That is the position of the customer as against NAMA.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely asked if the management would remain in place.  It will not remain in place.  I am glad the Senator raised that issue as it is not a topic that has come up in this debate.  Clearly, if we buy the asset, we must manage it.  NAMA will manage the assets.  As regards the larger exposures &mdash; of which there are a number, as Members will be aware, some of which have been mentioned in the debate &mdash; these will be centrally managed by the agency.  They will <Col N="249"/>not be managed by individual banks.  The banks will lose all responsibility in the management of large exposures which run to substantial amounts of money.  Typically their loans can be located in a number of financial institutions.  The particular arrangements surrounding them are &mdash; I do not like this verb, although it is used by my officials &mdash; bespoke, namely, they are distinctive to the borrower in question.  As such, they require careful centralised management.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that NAMA will take direct responsibility for a block of loans owed by the most substantial borrowers whose loans are being transferred.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to establish the agency was influenced by the existence of this block of borrowers who cross the financial institutions.  I am sure many Senators have heard in the public debate the argument that a separate vehicle should be established in each bank and that each bank should be forced to work out its own loans in isolation from the other banks.  However, the litigation referred to in this and the other House illustrates that a large number of financial institutions are involved with the more substantial borrowers.  It will be impossible to manage and work out the position if one does not have a single agency managing the problems, taking a collective view on the loan portfolio right across the institutions, taking the necessary enforcement action and managing it in one parcel.  That was one of the arguments, although not the only one, for the single agency approach.  In response to Senator Callely, that is the position on the larger exposures.  The board of NAMA will determine at what level this will happen and clearly will have regard to the degree of cross-collateralisation within the system.</P>
        <P>In regard to the majority, in number, if not in value, of loans, NAMA will take a management role in respect of them but the actual loans will be managed by the original banks in which they originated.  The bank, in respect of these loans, will be working for NAMA.  Under the relevant EU rules, the State will be obliged to pay a management fee to the financial institution in respect of that loan.  Senators might legitimately inquire about the reason we took this route.  Reference was made by Senator Callely and others to the experience of the United States.  While, in respect of the United States Savings and Loan crisis, there was a successful outcome in financial terms, a huge staff and bureaucracy were retained to manage the loans in question.  That made the working out of the loans very expensive.  We are back to the argument we had about professional fees.  No matter how one structures it, there is a cost.</P>
        <P>In his evidence to the committee, Dr. Somers rightly warned us all about the dangers of establishing a huge bureaucracy and turning NAMA into a huge bureaucracy.  I have been conscious of that from the start.  Therefore, the view was taken that the banks should continue to manage the smaller loans, but on behalf of NAMA.  That is one of the advantages of the subordinated debt, risk sharing arrangement to which I would like to draw attention.  Several Senators suggested I did not follow the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank on risk sharing.  In fact when the Governor of the Central Bank was a private citizen he was very free with his advice, both to me and to many others.  He had a correspondence with me about NAMA in which he gave much valuable advice.  His suggestion was that it was the shareholders who should bear the risk, whereas in fact it is the bank itself that shares the risk under the subordinated bond arrangement.  The reason I was anxious for that is that it creates an incentive for the bank to perform in the management of those assets which remain as an agent of NAMA in regard to the management of the loans.  They stand to lose if they do not work out the loans correctly.  I felt it was important to put the mechanism in place that the bank itself would be at a direct loss so its employees would be incentivised to make that extra &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion, which the subordinated debt arrangement gives them the opportunity to earn over time.  That is the reason it was structured in that way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To answer Senator Callely&rsquo;s question on management, NAMA manages but the lesser exposures are managed by the institution on behalf of NAMA.  He said there was much con<Col N="250"/>fusion due to some accountancy practices.  I cannot assist him on that aspect.  I belong to a different profession and the mysteries of my profession have always astonished the outside world.  One of the things I have learned as Minister for Finance is that the mysteries of the accountancy profession are equally bewildering to the outside world because they seem to make money appear and disappear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;amount to something and not amount to something with great ease.  I have always followed the maxim in regard to banks that cash is king.  If one can find out where the cash is, one will generally find the answers.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler made a point on the entity.  It is the case that NAMA has a commercial mandate.  That must be the case, as that is how we protect the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald inquired about Peter Matthews.  I had an opportunity of meeting him recently and he submitted to me the papers I am sure he submitted to Senators.  I wish to make a number of points on them.  I could be here a very long time if I were to do a detailed analysis.  An assumption he makes in his papers is that he is not restricting himself to the assets to which NAMA is restricted.  He is looking right across all the banks&rsquo; assets.  He is looking at mortgages, consumer debt and other miscellaneous borrowings.  He is giving a picture of an entire bank rather than part of a bank.  I do not mean to criticise him but he is doing it without the benefit of having looked at the loan quality in the banks.  Since the guarantee was introduced we have had that benefit in the past year of going into the banks and looking at the quality of the loan books and doing the due diligence on the different institutions.</P>
        <P>I salute the fact that he has done all of that work off his own bat and put it into the public domain.  It is still under examination in my Department.  We do not always agree with him but it is valuable that a public spirited citizen would take that interest.  He also makes certain assumptions about the loan books, which again are not in accordance with the assumptions we are making on the evidence we have available to us.</P>
        <P>The other point, which I mentioned to him when I met him, is an interesting one.  Essentially, he is arguing that what we need to do for the banks is give them massive capital injections.  In other words he wants us to build up their capital base and not concentrate so much on liquidity and exchanging assets for bonds that will give the banks cash.  There is a balance to be struck.  There is no doubt that when the NAMA exercise is complete it will accelerate capital requirements in the banking system and there will have to be an increase in capital.  However, one of the difficulties about putting in capital without doing the kind of detailed examination of the loan books we are doing is that I do not think one would create the same international confidence in the institutions if one did not come up front and look at the weakest loan books, carry out an individual evaluation of them and then see what is the exact capital requirement.</P>
        <P>I dealt with Japan the other night.  What they did was to make repeated capital injections, but I do not think that approach on its own will solve the problem.  There is a balance to be struck between liquidity and capital.  If Peter Matthews falls on one side of that equation, Dermot Desmond falls decisively on the other.  The latter essentially argued we should not buy any assets; we should just put the &euro;54 billion straight into the banking system as a float and come back in ten years and see what happens.  We need to strike a balance between capital, liquidity and funding.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden was engaged in canvassing his nominator for his panel.  I have dealt with that already.  He did it, as he always does in these matters, in a very admirable way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes sense that it should be grouped with the other amendment.  I made the point last night to one of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues that I take the view, I am not sure whether it is shared by the Minister, that the Freedom of Information Act is vitally important legislation that applies right across the public service and that a strong and compelling case needs to be made where it is proposed it should not apply to a public body rather than a case having to be made that it should apply.  In other words, the default position across our system should be that the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act apply.  I can anticipate what the Minister might say in response, and it was argued last night.  Briefly, it is that commercial confidentiality is at the heart of the NAMA legislation.</P>
        <P>I accept that we are discussing commercial matters of a high degree of sensitivity and that in many cases there is need for confidentiality to be observed.  However, the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended in 2003, already contemplates many instances in which information cannot and will not be released.  Part 3 of that Act, which deals with exempt records, excludes, for example, information obtained in confidence, under section 26; commercially sensitive information, under section 27; financial and economic interests of the State and public bodies, under section 31; and enactments relating to non-disclosure of records, under section 32.  I did not have a copy of the Act with me last night but what I suspected to be the case is the case.  That Act already excludes from disclosure a considerable range of data and information.  It is not possible for applicants to obtain it.  The blanket argument that commercial sensitivity is involved with regard to the matters covered by NAMA is not a persuasive argument by itself.  The House should be told in more detail why it was considered necessary to exclude this body from the coverage of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>We debated this morning the culture here over the decades in respect of the transactions that have occurred and the lack of transparency and so forth about them, the risk of abuse and the sense the public has that it should be able to understand and have information about what will occur in its name in the coming years.  I am not naive enough to claim that everything should be open and that there is a case for every book, document and transaction to be available immediately to somebody who simply asks for it.  In any case the Act and the further restrictions of 2003 would put the kibosh on many such frivolous applications because they are already excluded very considerably from the operation of the Act.  The basic question is why exclude, rather than ask those of us on the other side of the argument to make the opposite case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  It is in keeping with the general theme we have pressed on Second and Committee Stages, that the operation of NAMA should be carried out in as transparent a manner as possible in the public interest and that there should be sufficient scrutiny and accountability to ensure there is public trust and confidence in it.  We tabled amendments on Committee Stage that were designed to achieve that.  This is another such amendment.  It seeks to add the NAMA group entity and the valuation panel to the definition of public bodies under the Freedom of Information Acts.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the valuation panel.  Amendment No. 7 should be read in conjunction with amendment No. 21 which specifically relates to the valuation panel and proposes that it &ldquo;shall operate in a transparent fashion and in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 2007&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 7 seeks to add the panel to the category of bodies under the freedom of information regime.  That is particularly important when one considers the provisions relating to the valuation panel in section 119 and succeeding sections in the Bill.  The method of appoint<Col N="253"/>ment of a valuation panel is left to the Minister.  I accept a Government amendment was tabled on Committee Stage to specify levels of knowledge and expertise, and there was some debate on that.  However, there is a lack of transparency as to who will be on the valuation panel and the method of appointment.  This was discussed on Committee Stage.  Given the lack of transparency in the provisions relating to the establishment of the valuation panel, it is especially important that the valuation panel be covered by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>As Senator Alex White said, plenty of exemptions are provided for in Part 3 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended in 2003.  Section 27 refers specifically to commercial sensitivity as a ground for exempting matters from having to be disclosed.  There are plenty of safeguards to ensure the danger the Minister identified on Committee Stage is not a problem if these entities are included under the Freedom of Information Act.  This is about transparency and ensuring greater public trust in the workings of NAMA.  We all agree that public trust is critical in this enterprise.  Other speakers when discussing amendment No. 3, and departing somewhat from its terms, referred at length to the Frontline marchers outside the gate of Leinster House.  All of us are very conscious of the people who are suffering the brunt of the recession and in whose interests we are hoping NAMA will work.  Even Members who are opposed to NAMA very much hope it will be effective in protecting the interests of members of the public, ordinary working people and especially vulnerable people.</P>
        <P>In those interests, we require a level of transparency about the operations of NAMA.  Some of our amendments seeking to ensure transparency were defeated.  This is a critical amendment which seeks to include NAMA as a public body covered by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the valuation panel, there has been a robust application process in NAMA that has been very difficult.  No valuers have yet been appointed but short-lists and so forth have been compiled.  The review of valuations is probably what interests Senator Bacik and perhaps there is scope for the Minister to allow an application process to exist there, similar to that which was carried out for NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agreed in the Lower House to advertise for the board of NAMA and I have received 500 applications to date.  I will examine Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s suggestion, which might be appropriate in this context.</P>
        <P>On the merits of this amendment, a great deal has been inserted into the legislation to ensure that this body is far more transparent and accountable than any other body we have established.  The direct link of accountability to the Minister is there through the ministerial power to give directions.  I was struck during the debate in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad by how little criticism that power has received.  When the proposed legislation was tabled, there was a great deal of criticism that the Minister had dictatorial powers and could tell NAMA what to do.  There was further criticism along those lines when the Bill was initiated.  As the debate progressed, however, many Members on both sides of both Houses realised how important it is to retain a line of ministerial accountability for the operation of bodies such as this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am encouraged by that because it represents a change in the attitude of both Houses towards corporate governance.  In the past decade the attitude has been that one can set up an agency, divorce it from the Government, prescribe a corporate governance standard for it and leave it entirely apart from the political system, because the political system is presumptively wicked in its intentions or any expressions of policy it might wish to give to these bodies.  We seem to have moved away from that and I am glad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to note that it appears to be an all-party drift away from it.  I was struck when the Bill was introduced by the amount of criticism to the effect that the Minister has too much power and how that vanished during the debates.</P>
        <P>There is a high degree of transparency in the legislation.  The National Treasury Management Agency is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White made a fair point when he stated that commercial information does not have to be disclosed under the freedom of information legislation.  In light of the nature of NAMA, the processing of such confidential commercial information and of freedom of information requests would constitute a burden on the agency.  For these reasons, I am not able to accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s observation that it would be a burden on NAMA is neither acceptable nor adequate.  Of course it would be a burden.  The Minister is obliged to shoulder certain burdens but these are legitimately carried by him and shared by others.  It would be extraordinary if the fact that something might be a burden were the only reason for its exclusion.  I have sympathy for the civil servants and others who are charged with unearthing information and making it available.  The line of argument offered by the Minister is extremely thin, particularly in the context of the many and varied comments he has made in this and the Lower House in respect of this legislation.  His response to the effect that we should accept that this should not be done because the processing of applications would constitute a burden is extremely disappointing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the bulk of the information is commercially sensitive, being obliged to prove that in individual cases will, of course, constitute an administrative burden.  Virtually all of the information at the disposal of the agency will be exempt.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 25, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) facilitating specified service providers in the fields of the provision of emergency housing, transitional housing and related areas to have preferential purchasing rights in relation to the purchasing of such housing units, particularly where there are housing problems as defined by the local authorities.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">F&aacute;ilte ar ais roimh an Aire.  I thank him for his very illuminating contributions this afternoon.  I was reminded of the character Fabrice from the French novel, <i>La Chartreuse de Parme,</i> who after a distinguished career went on to become a much sought-after preacher.  People would crowd the house to hear him speak.  I thought the Minister had great potential in that regard.</P>
        <P>This amendment proposes an addition to the purposes of NAMA, namely, the facilitation of specified service providers in the fields of the provision of emergency housing, transitional housing and related areas to have preferential purchasing rights in relation to the purchasing of such housing units, particularly where there are housing problems as defined by the local authorities.  This issue was discussed extensively on Committee Stage last night and some excellent contributions were made by my colleague Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Labour Party Senators on the issue in the context of similar amendments of their own.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In the Minister&rsquo;s dealings in the D&aacute;il with Deputy Burton, she proposed an amendment to include among the aims of the Bill to contribute to the social and economic development of the State and the Minister accepted that amendment.  His response on that provides a rationale for this proposal which seeks that in addition to the commercial mandate of NAMA, we would also strive for a social dividend.  I mentioned on Second Stage that we are obliged to seek this social dividend and not just a commercial dividend and suggested the allocation of land for amenities and sheltered housing should be specifically included as part of NAMA&rsquo;s remit.  It is clear that NAMA&rsquo;s mandate must be to maximise its returns by disposing of assets for as much money as possible.  However, it is also clear that this crisis provides an opportunity to obtain desperately needed low cost housing for those worst affected by the current economic crisis.  Therefore, instead of just bequeathing to the next generation a social and economic millstone, we should also seek to bequeath a social legacy.</P><Col N="256"/>
      
        <P>In the course of last night&rsquo;s debate we had some illuminating contributions from some Senators.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in particular, brought forward an amendment which proposed the addition of certain words to the power specified for NAMA, namely, its power to distribute assets <i>in specie</i> to the Minister.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole proposed that this would be included to facilitate the development of infrastructure and public services for communities recovering from the financial crisis.  He also asked a very relevant question about what that proposed power for the Minister was intended to achieve.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan spoke eloquently to a similar amendment from the Labour Party which focused on appropriate assets being made available for public, community or social use, either free or at a non-commercial cost, or assets being transferred to appropriate statutory agencies to facilitate such use.</P>
        <P>The reason I mention the other contributions is to underline the point that I believe there is general agreement to the effect that there must be some kind of social dividend specified in the NAMA legislation, not just envisaged.  I appreciate that the purposes of NAMA have been amended to provide for it being required to contribute to the social and economic development of the State, and ministerial powers are so specified in section 14.  The Minister intends, in effect, for this social goal to be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, said last night that the Government was not opposed to giving Ministers and State agencies first refusal, in effect, when it came to NAMA assets where this was important for social developments in their particular areas.  I note Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s contribution in particular about surveys he had carried out in communities where young people were very much in need of social facilities.  I am thinking of such things as youth caf&eacute;s and other services, and the importance of achieving that if we are to deal with some of the social problems that face us in the very areas where there are properties that may not be capable of being sold for anything like a reasonable market value.</P>
        <P>In accepting that NAMA must seek to maximise the financial return, I believe nonetheless a case can be made for a specific named or included purpose for the agency, namely, to facilitate the specialised services providers in the provision of emergency transitional housing and related areas.  I have been more general than the Labour Party and others in that regard, but I ask the Minister to consider this amendment because of the need for specificity.  I do not deny that NAMA must seek to make the best financial return in all cases, but nobody denies that there will be assets which are not capable of a meaningful financial return, and it is to those properties we are now directing our attention.</P>
        <P>I also submit that there is a need for legislation that will enable such socially minded action by the Government and it should be specified as a stated purpose.  In doing this, it would in no way frustrate the central focus of NAMA to maximise the financial return on the assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  This is a core part of what the Bill is about, namely, giving a balance in the form of a community add-on facility and a sense of ownership among ordinary people and communities.</P>
        <P>In the Minister&rsquo;s absence last night I had tabled another amendment to the legislation and to the section where it says that NAMA may &ldquo;distribute assets<i> in specie</i> to the Minister&rdquo;.  I added a very generalised non-binding amendment with levels of choices within it.  The words, as I recall were  to the effect of facilitating, <i>inter alia</i>, the transfer of assets to the community.  I only tabled it to establish what was meant because this single line that NAMA would &ldquo;distribute assets<i> in specie</i> to the Minister&rdquo; was puzzling.  It was there on its own and as such allowed the transfer of finished or unfinished assets, fields, half-built buildings or whatever to the Minister. <Col N="257"/> I could not find the reason for it anywhere in the legislation, and it was there from the very beginning.  I had looked at the early part of the legislation in section 2, which deals with the objectives and purposes of NAMA and had assumed the line was included to allow for the insertion of section 2(<i>b</i>)(viii), which was added on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and which says: &ldquo;to contribute to the social and economic development of the State&rdquo;, but it was there from the beginning.  We need to know what was intended in tabling this.</P>
        <P>We were doing all right in terms of the debate, Senator MacSharry was giving me a half-reasonable explanation and then the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, got involved.  He started to change position and began to duck and dive and weave.  I was less informed at the end of the debate than at the beginning.  I told the Minister I would read the Official Report to see whether I could come up with something different for Report Stage today.</P>
        <P>In the meantime my colleague, Senator Mullen, said he was tabling this amendment.  While I am not exactly enthusiastic about Senator Mullen&rsquo;s form of words, he and I have an agreement on what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>

	<P>The Senator should not worry.  I understand it perfectly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator might just be wrong on this one, however.  The issue is that the Minister was quoted in his absence last night by his ministerial colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, who said a number of things.  I gave examples such as the fact one might be left with 50 houses in Tulsk or a cinema somewhere else which might be used for social and affordable housing or as a community hall, respectively.  The Minister for Defence said, in effect, that in the event these could be transferred <i>in specie</i> to the Minister who could then offer them to the highest bidder from the local authorities.  I was completely winded by this because I had read the legislation very carefully, as the Minister knows because I discussed it with him many times over recent months.  I said the Minister was going to be buying and selling and was going to be a trader, auctioneer, agent, operator, shopkeeper or whatever.  When I challenged the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, on this point, he quickly changed his position and came up with a new explanation to the effect that were the Minister to try to take control of assets, he or she would want to pass them on to some aspect of his or her area, and the only way in which this could be done in many cases, without specifying, would be if it could be vested in the Minister.</P>
        <P>When I read it first, I tried to do what a legislator should do.  I asked what it meant, and while the words were clear enough, the meaning escaped me.  I wanted to know how this fitted into the business plan.  Obviously NAMA would not make money by transferring stuff for buckshee to the Minister, so it did not fit in with the making money end of things one way or another in terms of transfer rather than purchase.</P>
        <P>I then thought I had the answer.  It seemed akin to Grattan&rsquo;s Parliament with NAMA eventually voting itself out of existence.  Senator Mullen might appreciate it that I have recommended to some of my children that they join remote orders so that they could be there for the share out at the end, the last man standing, so to speak.  I had this view that at the end of NAMA one could be left with a couple of rocks or houses or housing estates.  What would be done with them?  All that could be done would be to transfer them, <i>in specie</i>, to the Minister, in order that at least they would be owned by the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is nodding, and I know it is an attractive proposition, but it does not fulfil all our problems.  It is a logical answer which is why the Minister finds it attractive.  However, I still had to ask how the Minister was going to fulfil the sop he gave to the Green Party in section 2(<i>b</i>)(viii) of a community aspect to all this.  I thought this would be one way to do it.  I am waiting for a reasonable explanation from the Minister as to how this works.  What was the intention of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Minister and what would he do with a couple more buildings or half-built houses or 50 houses?  I will listen closely to the Minister&rsquo;s answer because as Senator Donohoe said, much depends on this. </P>

	<P>Our amendment proposes that the Minister &ldquo;make appropriate assets available for public, community or social use either free or at a non-commercial cost, or transfer assets to appropriate statutory agencies to facilitate such use&rdquo;.  We aired this idea last night when the Minister for Defence was present.  We pushed it to a vote because we were not satisfied with his answer.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance can provide a more satisfactory answer.  </P>
        <P>In the commuter belt and across the country many teenagers have no place to go and are at a loss for something to do for lack of facilities and money to rent or purchase premises to use as youth clubs, etc.  We want to use NAMA to provide a social dividend for the people concerned.  Is it possible to lease vacant properties for three or five years at peppercorn rents to youth clubs?</P>
        <P>Such properties are likely to remain vacant for the next five years because of the absence of demand in the market.  Will the Minister think about that, and if NAMA is not the appropriate vehicle to make these facilities available, what would he say to young people in Ashbourne or Drogheda or Dundalk?  They have nowhere to go so they hang out on street corners and sometimes get into trouble for anti-social behaviour.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s solution for that generation?  Where should they go and how should they access facilities if the money is not available for them to rent or purchase premises?</P>

In respect of amendment No. 8, the local authorities will be first in the queue for any housing around the country.  This amendment would undermine NAMA&rsquo;s ability to give the ultimate social dividend, to get the country moving again in order that we can have resources for sports capital or youth caf&eacute; programmes and the kind of infrastructure we require.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that, under the workings of NAMA, the Minister could suggest to the board that if any properties in its control are lying idle it could take a nominal rent for them.  NAMA must get the maximum value it can, whether through rent or sales, otherwise the process will be undermined.  Maybe at some stage the Minister could ring-fence prospective NAMA profits for a sports capital programme or other such infrastructural projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support both amendments.  I am particularly looking forward to having the opportunity to vote on the amendment tabled by Senators Mullen and O&rsquo;Toole.  They are interesting amendments.  If the Government is to be serious about tackling this problem amendment No. 9 achieves that because it does not use the phrase &ldquo;preferential purchasing rights&rdquo;.  Most of the specified service providers for housing are broke.  Local authorities do not have the money to purchase houses.  I am aware of at least one that is approaching an intensely difficult budget process, as many others will.  If the Bill proposed fixing that problem by offering properties at preferential purchase prices to local authorities it will not work because they will not have the money to buy them for the foreseeable future. </P><Col N="259"/>
        <P>It is crucial that we address this objective.  In my area of Dublin Central I see people who have been on housing lists for between seven and nine years.  They could not afford the house prices of recent years.  They will pass vacant, derelict properties.  We should find some creative way to use land and these properties to address this problem.  Many speakers have mentioned how explosive the issue of housing and related personal debt could be.  There is no greater symbol of this than a couple who have been waiting on a housing list for eight or nine years with a local authority that will not have the money to give them anything for another eight or nine years, walking past derelict apartment blocks and vacant plots of land.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have learned during the years in business that one gets the greatest sense of achievement from doing something profitable that is also good for the community.  Many companies work to do that because of the benefits they get from it.  Therefore I can understand exactly what Senators Mullen and O&rsquo;Toole are doing in setting this worthy objective but I am not going to support their amendment because in this matter we must be totally focused.  We must focus on getting the economy and NAMA right and bring order to our situation.  It is not possible to achieve several objectives at once.  The objective here is to get our finances in order and we do not have the freedom to add these good, worthy things to that process.  I would love to support the amendment but I am unable to do so. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn should not feel so strongly about not supporting this amendment because when one considers the amount of assets that NAMA will control, there will be plenty of opportunity for the Minister to look after the sort of organisations we are discussing.  The Minister will deal with property worth &euro;54 billion and there is more than ample scope for him to use a small proportion of that in this way.  We will spend 0.1% of that sum to set up a special purpose vehicle to run NAMA.  If the same sum was invested in the organisations covered by these amendments it would make a significant difference.  Senator Quinn could support this proposal because it does not require giving a large amount of the NAMA assets to these organisations but rather a small percentage of the total assets which would have a disproportionately positive impact on the affected communities.  </P>
        <P>We should all support this amendment.  Senators Mullen and O&rsquo;Toole may experience some personal embarrassment if this amendment is pushed to a vote and they have to vote with this side of the House, if Senator Quinn also stayed with us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Because the Government would lose which would be difficult for the individuals involved.  Aside from the politics of the House and the fact that we might derive some pleasure from that vote, the proposal has significant merit.  The amount of the assets to be transferred would not disproportionately affect the outcome of NAMA.  We should consider it in a positive way.  We have wasted many millions of euro in the past few years but this would not be a waste. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators MacSharry and Quinn that the focus of this legislation is to ensure a lift-off in the economy.  While I commend the amendment, in the past ten years local authorities have made great strides in providing community services, not just in Dublin but across the country.  The problem with putting individual groups into community centres is that they tend not to last.  Community groups now join forces.  For example, most GAA centres share with the local soccer club and other groups in the community.  This is what we want to encourage.  A small individual group on its own may falter, the centre would become derelict and the county council would have to become responsible for it.  I do not believe that is the way forward.</P><Col N="260"/>
        <P Just="Left">We could not include a mechanism for dealing with mortgage arrears in the legislation.  It would do the Bill an injustice to introduce any other measure at this point.  The Bill is essentially a business plan to regenerate the country and recapitalise the banks.  Putting bits and pieces of other legislation into it will only send out the wrong message.  No one has more experience than Senator Quinn in how to run a successful business and I agree with his view on this amendment.  The Minister is sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment but including it in this legislation will only divert from the main focus of dealing with the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the thrust of these amendments and the Minister has indicated he is keen there will be some civic benefit from NAMA.  However, as Senator Quinn already said, accepting these amendments would be contrary to the purpose of the NAMA legislation.  If accepted, they would dilute the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency to operate with a sole purpose.</P>
        <P>That raises another contradiction which Senator Donohoe spoke about earlier.  This legislation is all about a civic purpose in bringing about a strong banking sector in the national interest.  It is also, as Senator Donohoe said, a purpose of Government to provide houses for the people.  When we had plenty of money, we still had housing lists which tended to lengthen because of costs.  In a declining market, the State has an opportunity to purchase houses cheaply.  In a roundabout way, the Bill&rsquo;s civic purpose is still there.  In one sense it provides the country with a good, strong economic basis.  Its civic benefit is being able to provide housing for local authorities at much reduced rates.</P>
        <P>While accepting these amendments would tie up NAMA&rsquo;s singular purpose, we need to see some way in which the public will benefit from NAMA in other legislation.  It is easier for the community to buy into the NAMA model if there is a clear way as to how it will benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been many contributions on this amendment.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole introduced the concept of the distribution of assets <i>in specie</i>.  I should eliminate that from the debate before dealing with the amendments&rsquo; merits.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is of course quite right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Why thank you, Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I said I was going to eliminate him before I addressed the merits of the amendment.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly pointed out, section 12(2)(<i>h</i>) creates a specific power in NAMA to distribute assets <i>in specie</i> to the Minister.  I am grateful to Senator MacSharry for providing a good translation of the term; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;as is&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole was quite correct on the provenance of this provision.  It stems from the provisions of section 60 which describes what happens at the end of NAMA.  Having attended at the birth, it is very interesting to study what will happen at the end.  Section 60(2) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">NAMA may, from time to time, after consultation with the Minister&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) use any surplus funds of NAMA to redeem and cancel debt securities issued under this Act, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) transfer any surplus funds remaining after that redemption to the Central Fund.</P><Col N="261"/>
        <P LI="1">(3) The assets of NAMA and of any NAMA group entity at the eventual dissolution of NAMA will be transferred to the Minister or paid into the Exchequer as the Minister directs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Parliamentary Counsel considered the term &ldquo;assets&rdquo; as lacking sufficient precision to cover the transfer of all of the assets which NAMA will have at that time.  Clearly, the provisions are wide enough to cover money because there is a specific reference to funds.  The Parliamentary Counsel thought it desirable to insert an additional power to distribute assets <i>in specie</i>.</P>
        <P>For example, NAMA might happen to have items of collateral such as some fields in Claremorris, bank shares which carry with them the right to collect a dividend or a racehorse or two stabled around the country.</P>

	<P>That would be one hell of an asset.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This section enables NAMA during the termination of its existence to transfer these assets <i>in specie</i> to the Minister.  The Minister will hardly put the racehorse into the Exchequer but can decide what to do with it.  That is the provenance of this particular power and has nothing to do with social purpose or a social dividend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister explain that to the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, as he was a bit confused about this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the issue Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised.  I am grateful to him for raising this interesting question about the provision.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment provides for making appropriate assets available for public, community or social use, either free or at a non-commercial cost, or transferring assets to appropriate statutory agencies to facilitate such use.  Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment is somewhat narrower in that it provides for facilitating specified service providers in the fields of the provision of emergency housing, transitional housing and related areas and having preferential purchasing rights in the purchasing of such housing units, particularly where there are housing problems as defined by the local authorities.</P>
        <P>I agree with these worthy sentiments.  They are policies which we hope to implement in the context of the operation of NAMA.  The section in which Senator Mullen wishes to insert his amendment, however, states the purposes of NAMA are to acquire bank assets, deal expeditiously with them and to protect or otherwise enhance the value of the assets.  NAMA has a commercial mandate.  While that does not mean it cannot have a social mandate, the bulk of the debate about its purpose has been devoted to how essential it is that it breaks even or makes a profit.  If we were simply to give land away for nothing &mdash; as proposed in Senator White&rsquo;s amendment &mdash; clearly that commercial mandate would be entirely cancelled out.  That would not be appropriate because, if we were to accept the Labour Party amendment to section 12, we would be disposing of assets for nothing in a way that would not be expressed on the balance sheet.  Clearly, the agency should not be empowered by the Oireachtas to do this.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen formulated his amendment in a narrower format, as he said the area of preferential purchasing rights should be accorded.  The interim chief executive has met a number of agencies involved in connection with the provision of emergency accommodation and it will be the policy of the agency to engage with such bodies and provide for preferential access.  I intend to direct NAMA to give State agencies the first opportunity to purchase certain assets where this is important to social developments within their remits.  There has been a difficulty with the acquisition of school sites, playground sites and sites for community devel<Col N="262"/>opments where the developers have effectively ransomed the community in respect of the purchase price.  In the context of the social and economic development of the State, NAMA can give a first option on the acquisition of a particular site to the appropriate authority, be it a local authority, school authority or health authority.  Far from being opposed to this idea, I support it.  However, we should not mix it up with the statutory purposes of the agency.</P>
        <P>It seems the correct way to deal with this matter is by way of ministerial direction.  The powers of ministerial direction are very explicit on the issue.  The compelling needs identified for the establishment of NAMA include the need to contribute to the social and economic development of the State, as set out in section 2.  In sections 13 and 14 the Minister is given the power to issue guidelines on these matters.  Section 13(2) and section 14(2) both provide that, without prejudice to the general power of the Minister to issue guidelines, he or she may issue guidelines that relate to the purposes of the social and economic development of the State.  The ministerial power to issue guidelines in the Bill enables the securing of what Senator Mullen wishes to secure with his amendment.  The Minister is in a position to issue guidelines and give a direction.  I am not sure whether the issue was explored on Committee Stage, but there is a distinction made in the Bill between guidelines and a direction.  Guidelines are abstract in character and clearly would cover all developments.  One of the difficulties with them is that they would inhibit NAMA&rsquo;s capacity to realise commercial gain when disposing of property.  Let us say NAMA had a good buyer and I had issued guidelines which obliged the agency to offer every item of property as a first option to the local authority.  That would be a very inflexible arrangement.  On the other hand, the guidelines I intend to draw up may deal with cases where there are certain essential community facilities, be they health centres, community centres or schools.  In my own county schools are being built with community centres, which is a marvellous initiative.  All of this can be done under the Bill, but we must be clear on what we are doing.  We are giving people first refusal, but they still have to pay&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Do they have to pay the market value or another value?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They still have to pay market value.  Market values have fallen, but they will not be required to pay the ransom values which we witnessed in connection with some sites in recent years.  That will be a substantial advance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no change in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, there is a substantial change.  Market values have fallen dramatically; the values of the lands required for these purposes are often very low.  Extortionate demands were placed on the Department of Education and Science for the acquisition of lands for school sites.  That will not apply in this Bill because NAMA will be in a position to give a first opportunity to the relevant school patron.  The power of direction is more powerful in this context.  There are particular parts of the State such as east Meath and west Dublin where there has been very rapid housing development without the immediate provision of the essential primary education facilities.  Were I to discover that NAMA was about to dispose of a large amount of land with housing built on it in the absence of school facilities, the powers conferred on the Minister are wide enough to require NAMA to make a school site available on that land at a reasonable charge to the relevant authority.  There is a substantial amount for which the agency will be able to secure a social dividend.</P>
        <P>We cannot put all this off balance sheet and write it off as a loss to the taxpayer in some discreet way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Or hand it to the so-called community activists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be done in a transparent and up-front way.  The different public authorities must pay a reasonable price for whatever is being required in order that the NAMA operation proceeds with its correct commercial purposes.  There is ample power under the Bill to deal with the specific issue raised by Senator Mullen, that of emergency housing, transitional housing and the acquisition of property.  This is an issue which will have to be dealt with by NAMA and the relevant local authorities.  There is no question about this.  </P>
        <P>Several Senators have mentioned the fact that private purchasers are not in funds, but the cost of housing for private purchasers has fallen dramatically in recent times.  That fall makes it easier to buy housing.  When we repair and restore the banking system, greater finance will be available for first-time buyers to acquire properties.  Aside from this, there are large blocks of property which will be at the disposal of the agency and in respect of which it can enter into arrangements with the local authority or voluntary group for their occupation.  The interim chief executive has engaged with many voluntary groups which provide social and emergency accommodation.  This will have to be done on a transparent financial basis.</P>
        <P>There are financial mechanisms available to the State such as the Housing Finance Agency which can seek to construct the necessary financial mechanism.  However, NAMA cannot be the financial mechanism to do it because were it to be such a mechanism, it would make a loss.  That is something we do not want to visit on it, which is not to say its establishment will not facilitate many social objectives; it will.  When institutions such as this were formed in other jurisdictions, one experience was that a large amount of social and affordable housing was relocated within a particular area.  As we know from the Irish experience, many of the properties we have are located in the wrong place.  There is demand again in Dublin for semi-detached properties, but there is a large surplus of properties in counties Leitrim and Longford.  The local authorities may have a part in actually resettling people in these areas.  That has been the experience in other countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his very illuminating response which is worthy of Stendhal&rsquo;s character, as I said earlier.  When I saw the phrase &ldquo;<i>in specie</i>&rdquo;, I thought I was reading the phrase &ldquo;in species&rdquo;.  I thought that might have been a mechanism for the eventual transfer of certain white elephants back to the Minister that had not been disposed of.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not heard any intellectual disagreement with any aspect of my amendment and the Minister has not pointed to any specific problem with the proposed wording.  He went on to embrace both the spirit of the proposed amendment but he also expressed his intention to achieve, using other powers in other sections of the Bill, what the amendment specifies.  It is important to specify this information.  Senator Butler spoke about business plans but as I said on Second Stage, it was business plans devoid of social conscience that led us to this crisis.  There is an appropriateness about getting specific information on the social intent, particularly in circumstances where I have drafted it in such a way so as not to frustrate in any way NAMA&rsquo;s commercial or financial objectives or to involve any lack of transparency.  I do not believe there is anything in the amendment that undermines NAMA&rsquo;s commercial or financial objectives.</P>
        <P>I agree it is not unknown for legislation to aspire to and set out aims and objectives without unduly tying the Minister&rsquo;s hands.  I think of the directive principles of social policy in our Constitution, for example, which, without being strictly binding in the sense of other amendments, have the effect of shaping the environment of the rights to be protected and enjoyed <Col N="264"/>and setting out what should be the general direction.  It is because we have between 50,000 and 60,000 people on housing waiting lists, and many more on rent supplement, that I considered it appropriate to focus in large measure in my amendment on the area of housing.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe is incorrect in suggesting that it would not work because I believe there will be assets that will be capable of being disposed of and which could be obtained by those in the business of addressing in particular our housing problem but also the related problem of amenities as discussed by others and by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is saying that the social dividend in the Bill is the elimination of ransom strips and the provision of better planning, which I respectfully suggest is something that could be achieved through existing planning laws and through changes in planning laws if necessary.  However, there is nothing in the Bill to redress the imbalance in terms of the lack of youth facilities and the lack of funding for youth facilities.</P>
        <P>The social dividend that the Green Party in particular was claiming from this Bill has not been achieved.  We pressed our amendment yesterday and therefore we cannot press it again today but we know Senator Mullen is a man of principle and commitment and that he will press his amendment, on which we will support him.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 39, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) the avoidance of conflict of interest by any expert adviser or service providers to NAMA and the participating institutions,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>g</i>) the orderly property management strategy over a ten year period,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>h</i>) for issuing loans, or for allowing security over which it has a charge be used as collateral for loans by other institutions by persons whose loans with NAMA are functional and not in arrears&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I agree with the Cathaoirleach.  I note that so far we have taken approximately half an hour per amendment on Report Stage.  I thought this might be over quicker for Members but if we keep going at this rate, it looks like we might be here until 6.30 a.m. tomorrow.  I will make this fairly quick.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This relates to section 35, the codes of practice.  The Minister listed a number of areas where he wants to see a code of practice issued by NAMA.  We are simply adding three paragraphs to the subsection.  It does not change the section.  It simply asks for three more codes of practice to deal with conflict of interest, to deal with the ten year management strategy which the Minister previously stated is more or less coming anyway, and to deal with loans and securities of loans which is more or less part of what NAMA is anyway.  I see no reason the Minister cannot agree to this.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to state why we cannot have codes of practice on these, which also are fundamental parts of what the NAMA legislation is about.  It changes nothing else.</P>
        <P>The last paragraph of the subsection, which states &ldquo;any other matter in relation to which the Minister directs NAMA to prepare a code of practice.&rdquo;, still remains in the Bill and I cannot see why this is in any way contentious.  If the Minister of State wants to reply, I will say no more on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point I raised earlier about the purpose of the Bill, and moving on to the code of practice which is before us, will the Minister of State confirm there will be no practices applied that would be different to the original business practice entered into by the loan applicant and the financial institution?  I understand new terms may be agreed mutually but I ask that there would be no practice whereby the financial institution, especially NAMA, would be able to apply a new code or term in reference to the original loan.</P>
        <P>I asked the Minister earlier whether the asset or the management was being taken over by NAMA.  My understanding was that it was not.  However, the Minister later indicated that there were going to be a number of cases &mdash; the information available to me is that there will be as many as 20 &mdash; that will be taken over and managed by NAMA.  If that is so and given whatever code of practice applies to those cases, especially if not only the loan but also the asset is to be managed by NAMA, what practice applies to ensure the person whose loans and assets are being incorporated into NAMA is not being disenfranchised in any form?</P>
        <P>I am concerned about a number of issues.  It is now likely there will be a group of people who will be treated slightly differently from the majority.  I am asking for clarity as to what will apply in their cases.  I understand some of this work has already commenced and that there has been application of certain procedures and codes of practice.  I would like to have clarity on that point.</P>
        <P>It is not just coming from the NAMA side.  This issue was touched on earlier but I did not have the opportunity to contribute at that stage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State and his officials to be on guard with respect to the other players involved.  The mechanism we are putting place can be used as a tool by various players participating in this regardless of what capacity they may be playing at.  For example, it may be purposely beneficial for valuations to come in at a particular level.  If we take the 30% that is within the body of NAMA itself, the percentage could be far greater than that, even if we go according to the old mantra of location, location, location, which I have mentioned before when participating.  There could be a prime site in a prime location, although I recognise the variances that might appear throughout the country and there can be variances in valuations.  I am concerned there could be game playing, allowing for the fact there is a new tool which permits some of the financial institutions perhaps to use valuations which may be in their best interests and not necessarily in the interests of either NAMA, the Government or the original applicant.  There seems to be a shifting of the ground and a shifting of what one might expect to be in a code of practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We will get the Minister of State to clarify that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>We may see further developments in this area.  I do not want to put the Minister of State on the spot.  I do not believe he will be able to clarify these issues.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Senator.  I call the Minister of State.  Has he a brief response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to the points made as briefly as I can.  To respond to Senator Callely&rsquo;s point, which is not strictly on the amendment, there will be no change in the rights and obligations of the debtor under NAMA than had been the case with the participating institution.</P>
        <P>Section 35 provides that NAMA, within three months of the establishment day, is to prepare codes of practice for approval by the Minister for Finance.  It is normal that codes of practice of a State agency are approved by the Minister with responsibility for that agency.  Section 35(1)(<i>f</i>) allows the Minister to make codes of practice in regard to any other matter he considers necessary.  The general power of direction to make codes of practice is sufficient and it is not necessary to add to the list of codes of practice as purposed.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to the provisions of section 45, which states: &ldquo;NAMA shall seek to ensure that each expert adviser or service provider ... makes every effort to avoid or manage conflicts of interest and to declare any such conflict (actual or potential) to NAMA&rdquo;.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 50, line 30, to delete &ldquo;&Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;, and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;&Eacute;ireann,</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p11- ?><?oasys _ix ?>save that such evidence shall not include questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a proposed amendment to section 58.  The matter was ventilated in the House last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>At great length.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It concerned the issue of the chairperson and chief executive officer of NAMA and the extent to which they ought to be restricted or constrained in what they say before the Committee of Public Accounts and what type of evidence they are entitled to give, as well as the level, basis or extent of the nature of the questioning that is entitled to be <Col N="268"/>permitted.  The Minister for Finance last night made a number of points, chief among which was that essentially this was a protection for the chairperson and-or the chief executive officer.  He noted the fact, which is interesting, that the Standing Orders of the Committee of Public Accounts already provide for a restriction on the members of that committee and the type of questions they can put to persons appearing before that body.  However, he felt he needed to go further with this formulation.</P>
        <P>The position I outlined last night was that it is odd that something that purports to be a protection of an officer should be expressed in terms of prohibition on that person.  If one wants to protect a person from something, why does this translate into a prohibition on that person?</P>
        <P>There was some debate on this question last night and the Minister said he would leave over the matter to Report Stage.  We had hoped he might come to the House with something in this line.  He has not done so, although I note there are two amendments before the House, one of which is the Labour Party&rsquo;s.  It carves out of the evidence to be given by the officers concerned on the questioning or expression of an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or the Minister or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  It would meet the Minister&rsquo;s objective in subsection (3) but without being as restrictive or draconian.  In the circumstances and given what the Minister said, the amendment would provide for the protection of the chief executive officer and chairman.  There is a list of items that constitute the evidence that may or should be given and there is an exception, namely, that the evidence to be given or the questioning to be allowed should not include the expression of &ldquo;an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy&rdquo;.  The amendment would meet the policy objective without being as draconian as the formulation included in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I will speak to amendments Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, which include an amendment in the names of Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole.  Theirs has a slightly different nuance, although it addresses the same point as that of the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>Sections 58(3) and 59(2), both of which we propose to delete and replace, are very prescriptive and impose extreme restrictions on the chairperson and chief executive officer.  The alternative wording in amendment No. 11 provides a somewhat more nuanced approach to the giving of evidence, while still meeting Government objectives, as Senator White stated.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 13 would have a somewhat different effect in that it would give more scope to the chairperson and chief executive officer to question or express an opinion on the merits of Government policy.  It would simply allow them to decline to express or question an opinion.  There is a difference between the amendments.  If amendment No. 11 is rejected, amendment No. 13 can be put separately.  I am not sure all the amendments should be grouped together.  While I know we can vote on them separately, it must be noted there is a difference in their effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment is in the same area but different.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment would go quite a way in the direction of that of the Government because it still states &ldquo;evidence shall not include questioning or expressing an opinion&rdquo; in other areas and in certain ways.  Mine would simply replace the words &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; with &ldquo;may decline to&rdquo;.  This meets the requirement the Minister stated last night he wished to defend, that is, to protect the rights of the chairperson giving evidence.  He stated last night that he was very attracted to my amendment and I was very hopeful I would see a little asterisk indicating this like a token of affection.  However, I do not see the asterisk and feel rather jilted.  On the other hand, we made our point and it lodged with the Minister.  He indicated he would seek further advice and place <Col N="269"/>that advice before the House.  I am not sure whether he was referring to the Attorney General or the Parliamentary Counsel but I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will have reply for us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the amendments together.  It is standard practice to include a provision requiring the chief executive officer and chairman of a State agency to refrain from inquiring into or commenting on the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policy or policies.  Therefore, this legislation is no different in that respect.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting the orders of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In that regard, paragraph 7(<i>b</i>) of Standing Order 158(i) of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann states the committee shall refrain from &ldquo;enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a member of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies&rdquo;.  The proposed amendment in the names of Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole would put the CEO and chairperson in a very difficult position.  It provides that they might answer questions or decline to do so.  They would be under pressure from the committee to do so and might find it difficult not to do so.  They should not be in a different position from other public servants<i> vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Committee of Public Accounts.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>The Minister deleted a proposed subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) which would have prevented the chief executive officer and chairman from commenting on policy in any document or report.  He accepted that was excessive.</P>
        <P>The Minister examined the Senators&rsquo; proposed amendments and consulted the Office of the Attorney General on the issue.  I am certain he did not promise to lay the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion before the House because Ministers never do so.  A trained lawyer such as the Minister would be least liable to make such a commitment.  However, it is his view and that of those from whom he sought advice that the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment is not necessary.  Its intention is captured in subsection (3).</P>
        <P>I have a general comment on the notion that the provision under discussion comprises gagging or censorship.  Within the framework of Government policy, it is possible to give a great deal of opinion, make assessments, etc.  I know this from experience.  I did a a lot of public speaking as an adviser.  I did not depart from Government policy but noted there were many supplementary points one could make to help to explain in detail what was occurring.  Therefore, the provision will not be a significant restriction.  There is a clear division of roles.  Governments decide on policy and it is normally set out in broad terms.  Agencies are responsible for its detailed implementation.  It is proper that the interest of any committee be in how the policy is being implemented.  If one wants to debate the policy, there are adequate fora for doing so, namely, the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very disappointing response and it is not convincing.  With regard to the contention that the provision represents standard practice, it emerged in the debate last night that provisions such as this appear in some Acts but not in others.  It is clear it is not a universal provision affecting the types of officeholders in question.  I accept the provision is included in some legislation but it seems perfectly clear that it is not contained in others.</P>
        <P>I am not sure whether I misunderstand something.  I certainly believed I understood the issue last night but now the debate has been reopened.  Far from necessitating this amendment, the Standing Order, as read by the Minister of State, actually obviates the need for it.  I would like an explanation.  If the Standing Order states the committee is to refrain from asking the questions at issue, this is surely an argument not to prevent an individual from answering them.  If <Col N="270"/>the committee is not going to ask the questions, one does not have to legislate to stop somebody answering them.  That is the point I was making.  Unless I have missed something, I believe I am correct in that basic proposition which has not been addressed by the Minister of State.  If I am correct in what I am saying, this helps rather than hinders our argument.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed by the response from the Minister of State.  The Minister for Finance, when in the House last night, appeared somewhat more open to addressing this particular objection.  On the general question of gagging and so on, I do not know if this provision represents a wish to gag public officials, although I am suspicious it does.  I believe people would be entitled to hold that view.</P>
        <P>A controversy arose earlier this year in regard to the appearance of Dr. Somers at a committee of this House.  At the very minimum, there was embarrassment, if not fury, on the part of Government when Dr. Somers delivered himself of the opinion that the National Treasury Management Agency had no experience of bank restructuring and was not adequately staffed to deal with it.  The furore in regard to his relatively innocent remarks in that regard was extraordinary.  I do not believe the response in this regard is unconnected to the attitude being taken by the Minister of State in regard to this amendment.  That is my, not unreasonable, view.</P>

        <P>I would like to finish the point I was making in regard to Dr. Somers.  I note RTE has stated that Dr. Somers is to leave his post next month.  This was confirmed on the airwaves this evening.  Dr. Somers has served the State well.

        <P>Amendment No. 14 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 56, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) It shall be an obligation of a participating institution not to commence or pursue proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence unless the arrears of any mortgage are in excess of 24 months, provided the mortgagor provides reasonable co-operation within his or her means and ability with the participating institution.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to place on obligation on participating institutions not to commence proceedings for repossession of principal private residences unless the mortgage arrears are in excess of 24 months.  This matter was discussed at length on Committee Stage.  In the context of Government policy, the principle underpinning the amendment is already accepted, particularly when one considers that an agreement is already in place that the two largest banks will not pursue proceedings for repossession for a period of 12 months.</P>
        <P>In the light of the high levels of personal debt and the increasing number of repossessions taking place, it is important to create a higher level of public confidence in the banking system in order that people might rest assured that their homes will not be repossessed.  As the level of negative equity grows and the number of repossessions increases, there are major concerns <Col N="274"/>that people&rsquo;s homes will be on the line.  These concerns arise at a time when jobs are at risk or when serious pay cuts are being contemplated.</P>
        <P>For all of the reasons of which the Minister of State is well aware, we ask that this amendment be accepted in order to place Government policy on a statutory footing.  Participating institutions should be required to hold off on attempting to repossess people&rsquo;s homes for a period of two years.  This is a fair amendment, to which the Minister of State is probably sympathetic, in principle.  Let us place this matter on a statutory footing and provide people with a level of security in respect of their homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators are aware, I have done quite an amount of work on this subject and prepared a series of recommendations which were presented to the Minister in August.  It is clear that the amendment is not going to be accepted.  However, the Irish Banking Federation, IBF, indicated yesterday that a committee involving itself and MABS would be established and oversee the application of its statement of intent not to pursue people willing to pay their mortgages.  The statement of intent to which I refer covers some but not all of the mainstream institutions.  For example, it does not cover Start Mortgages, Springboard Mortgages and others.</P>
        <P>It is clear that action on this matter will not be taken in this Bill.  However, perhaps the Government will, in line with its commitment under the renewed programme for Government, consider legislating in this area in order to provide a safety net for families.  As stated on Second and Committee Stages, perhaps the most appropriate way to proceed would be to amend the Enforcement of Court Orders Act.  People are a good medium-term bet and must be able to avail of the options outlined in the code of conduct issued by the Financial Regulator and in the IBF protocol which has been further strengthened by yesterday&rsquo;s statement of intent.  Like Senator Bacik and others, I am of the view that we must legislate for this matter.  However, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has already been debated extensively in connection with this Bill and otherwise.  The issue is not one of ends &mdash; there is a fair degree of consensus in that regard &mdash; it simply is one of means.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is opposed to the amendment.  I will not rehearse all of the relevant material in that regard; I will merely summarise the key points.  Including a provision such as that outlined in the amendment could have a detrimental funding and ratings impact on participating institutions.  There is no evidence of an avalanche of repossessions to date, nor is one expected in the near future.  We have undertaken significant work in this area, with the introduction of a code of conduct in respect of mortgage arrears.  As Senator Bacik stated, there is also an agreement with Bank of Ireland and AIB to extend the period before which they will apply to the courts to commence enforcement of legal action for repossessions to 12 months.  In addition, the renewed programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce<?oasys _jy ?>new measures to protect families experiencing difficulties with their home mortgage repayments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I anticipated the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and I am glad Senator MacSharry put the case in favour of the amendment so eloquently.  I do not understand why it is not possible to deal with this matter in the legislation before us, particularly when the Minister of State and Senator MacSharry expressed support, in principle, that there should be a moratorium on repossessions.  The Minister of State has indicated that there is no evidence of <Col N="275"/>an avalanche of repossessions.  However, we know that the number of repossessions is increasing and that there is major concern that people&rsquo;s homes will become liable to repossession.  As Senator MacSharry stated, there is a need to address these issues by means of a statutory formula.  However, I do not believe the Court and Court Officers Bill would be the appropriate vehicle to use in this regard.</P>

However, I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to the fact that we have something to say on section 210 and have tabled amendments to it.</P>

While it was a lengthy debate, it was very productive, but in my respectful opinion I think the Government won the vote but lost the argument.  That is the case with regard to what has been described variously as the fiction of long-term economic value.  We have all made our views very clear and they are on the record.  Sadly, I see nothing to be gained by rehearsing those arguments again.  However, that is not to be taken for one moment as resiling from what was said and what is on the record on the issue at the core of this legislation.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 126, line 23, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments arise from Committee proceedings but were not amendments we had tabled on Committee Stage.  There was extensive debate on this question last night and we proposed these amendments to reflect that debate.  Amendment No. 26 would substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The current section 210 provides that the Minister may issue guidelines.  We have proposed instead that he shall issue guidelines.  As we said last night, section 210 is very significant section and was added very late during the D&aacute;il debate.  Therefore, it required full debate here in the Seanad.  It is core to the purpose of the Bill as stated in section 2 to free up credit and as the states, &ldquo;to facilitate the availability of credit in the economy of the State&rdquo;.  This is core to the Bill because it enables the Minister to issue guidelines regarding lending practices and procedures to facilitate the availability of credit.  As I said last night, it specifically mentions small and medium-sized enterprises, which we know are suffering currently owing to the lack of credit.  It was accepted on all sides last night that this was a welcome provision and that the Minister should issue guidelines.  Senator MacSharry and others on the Government side of the House also expressed the view that the Minister should issue guidelines.</P>
        <P>I am not sure which Minister was in the House at the time &mdash; Senator Norris referred earlier to the whirligig of Ministers we have had &mdash; but whichever Minister was in the House said the Minister for Finance had expressed his intention to issue guidelines, but that he wished to issue a number of extra guidelines from time to time and felt that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would facilitate him in doing so more than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  On reflection, we did not see that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would give him any greater flexibility than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;shall issue guidelines&rdquo; require him to introduce them.  Everybody agrees he should issue them.  Therefore, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be a more accurate word to use.  That is the reason we want to include the phrase &ldquo;shall issue guidelines&rdquo;.  This is very important.  If there was to be a change of Minister, then any promise given by the current Minister would not hold.  Therefore, it is important that in the interest of certainty we provide in statute that &ldquo;the Minister shall issue guidelines&rdquo;.  This is what we want from amendment No. 26 which we feel is vital to ensure the guidelines are made.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 27 also arises from Committee Stage.  It relates to an intervention I made initially on Second Stage where I referred to the French model of the credit mediator, the entity established by Christine Lagarde, the French economy Minister.  This is a mediator who will intervene where viable businesses are being refused credit by banks.  Such a mediator can intervene to ensure business are helped through the issue of credit and can name and shame <Col N="277"/>banks which fail to do so.  On Second Stage, the Minister referred to my suggestion and said he was aware of the French model and that he intended to introduce an independent appeal mechanism.  In last night&rsquo;s debate, we ventilated this issue.  I said, and I think the Minister accepted, that section 210(1)(<i>b</i>) facilitates the Minister establishing an independent review mechanism relating to the review of decisions of participating institutions to refuse credit facilities.  However, this provision is very vague.</P>
        <P>What amendment No. 27 does is insert a new subsection (<i>c</i>) specifying that the guidelines to be issued by the Minister would relate to the establishment of a credit mediator who may intervene to ensure that participating institutions are facilitating the availability of credit to borrowers or potential borrowers, including small and medium-sized enterprises.  Therefore, the amendment reiterates the stated intention of the Minister.  It specifies his stated intention and fleshes out the provision already in section 210(1)(<i>b</i>) that allows the Minister to issue guidelines relating to the review of decisions.  It provides for a mechanism which has been tried and tested in another jurisdiction within the European Union &mdash; France &mdash; which has enabled there the flow of credit to more than 10,000 businesses, according to recent reports.  It is up to the Minister to decide on the exact formula for the credit mediator, but in principle there should be some form of credit mediator process available.  This amendment, in an assistive and constructive spirit, strengthens the provisions of section 210.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I promise not to be repetitive because last night I was asking whether it could be &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  On the basis that the Minister clarified it is the custom of the parliamentary draftsman to put in &ldquo;may&rdquo; to allow for a number of different guidelines, I do not have a difficulty with it.  I express hope and anticipation as regards the appeals mechanism the Minister is suggesting.  Presumably that will cater for the type of French model I am also attracted to, the credit mediator.  However, presumably the appeals mediator the Minister is going to put in place will cater for it.</P>

	<P>No, I shall resist that temptation, and also to refer, as Senator Bacik has, to the fact that people take the opportunity to make extensive Second Stage speeches and then finish by criticising others for allegedly taking up time, when all they are doing is the job they have been sent here to do. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us focus on the amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sorry, but I must take exception to one observation made by the Acting Chairman in relation to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s contribution to the effect that while she had an entitlement, it really should be done quickly, since we had all this yesterday.  We did not have all this yesterday.  This is something that has arisen anew on Report Stage.  If the Acting Chairman looks at the amendment, she will see this is a new matter.  Not only are we entitled, but we have a duty to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two aspects to this.  The proposal by Senator MacSharry yesterday is now before the House in the form of a Labour Party amendment; therefore, I invite people to support it on that basis.  I congratulate Senator Bacik for doing the job that she is sent here to do, namely, to do her homework and prepare an innovative and thoughtful amendment to put before the House.  It should commend itself to the House and in those circumstances I second it and seek the support of colleagues for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe Senator Harris&rsquo;s outrage was justified, but the target was wrong.  Senator Bacik was clear, concise and so on and I really do not believe we should become involved in these spats.  They just make things more tedious and as this goes on the more fractious we are going to get. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the first amendment appeared to be to ensure that guidelines would be published in respect of lending practices.  This is an unnecessary amendment.  This section was inserted into the Bill by the Minister in order to enable such guidelines to be issued and the Minister has already stated he intends to do so.  There is no need to amend the legislation to impose a statutory duty on the Minister to issue such guidelines.  The standard statutory provision in respect of the exercise of such a power uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  There is a natural assumption that where legislation departs from the standard phrasing there is an attempt to do something different from the normal practice, and this can affect the interpretation given to the phrase by the courts. </P>
        <P>Section 210 is concerned with how a power to issue guidelines is exercised.  Section 22(1) of the Interpretation Act 2005 provides that a power conferred by an enactment may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires.  The impact of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is that the Minister may from time to time, as needs of different sectors require intervention, issue mandatory guidelines.  In the context of a power guideline, it can be argued that the guidelines must deal with all aspects enabled under the provision and cannot deal only with one aspect.  This could impact <Col N="279"/>on the flexibility of response to credit problems which the current wording allows.  The Minister wishes to assure the House that he intends to issue such guidelines at an early stage.</P>
        <P>To sum up, this issue was discussed at length on Committee Stage.  A power may be exercised from time to time and the Attorney General advises that this is appropriate and in accordance with the Interpretation Act.</P>
        <P>In relation to the second amendment, which is constructive, section 210 of the NAMA Bill permits the issuing of guidelines on the lending practices and procedures as regards the review of decisions relating to the participating institutions refusing credit.  Participating institutions are required to comply with any guidelines issued and the Minister, as I have just said as regards the first amendment, has stated his intention to publish guidelines under this section.</P>
        <P>As he stated on Committee Stage, the Minister is open to the idea of an independent person who will provide oversight at the implementation of any guidelines issued under section 210.  However, the section as drafted is broad enough to allow for the appointment of such an oversight person without requiring any amendment.  Therefore we are not accepting the amendment, as we believe it is unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important we require the Minister to issue guidelines, and we will be pressing that amendment.  I will not press the second amendment because I am glad to hear again that the Minister is very much open to the idea of an independent oversight mechanism.  That is now accepted across the House.  I am glad the Minister of State views my proposed amendment as constructive.  The credit mediator model is one that could very usefully be adopted here.  I will not press amendment No. 27 to a vote because I am very hopeful the Minister will take up that idea and introduce a credit mediator.  It would provide a very important mechanism for individuals and businesses who are being refused credit at present. </P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister has accepted it, in principle.</P>

        <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 126, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) Guidelines made under this section shall ensure that where NAMA holds the security on acquired bank assets, and those bank assets are performing and not in arrears, the participating institutions shall not be precluded from relying on that security to issue a new and commercially sound loan to an individual or body corporate, particularly in circumstances where to prevent a participating institutions from relying on that security would be unjustly prejudicial in all the circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This matter on qualifying eligible assets had an airing on Committee Stage this morning.  I had a word with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, about it earlier and he was sympathetic, to the say the least.  I have encountered some cases and know other Members in both Houses who are aware of this problem too.</P>
        <P>The amendment addresses those performing loans that meet the qualifying eligibility test and are transferred to NAMA regardless.  It will be a travesty of bureaucracy if some successful companies with performing loans will be put into liquidation and jobs lost because of the definition used in the legislation.  A case I was made aware of involves a company in the renewable energy field, employing approximately 500 persons.  It had, say, &euro;100 million in security and perhaps &euro;50 million in loans.  Because of the definition NAMA has clarified all of this money has been taken in, even though they are performing loans.  The company has a contract to complete by Friday, say, worth another &euro;11 million which, with the existing security, the bank is more than willing to lend because the company is good for it.  However, because all the existing security is to be transferred to NAMA, the bank now finds that it cannot advance the &euro;11 million on the alternative security.  The company in question is viable and in a position to repay the loan over the required time.  In 2008 it contributed in excess of &euro;14 million in tax revenue to the Exchequer.  If it cannot be agreed as to how credit flow can be accommodated, the company will be forced into court for non-performance of the contract and consequently forced into liquidation with the loss of over 370 jobs.  A meeting should be arranged between departmental officials, the company and the bank to find a solution to break the impasse and prevent a catastrophe occurring to this viable group of companies.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="281"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
        <P>I raised a similar matter concerning equity in companies taken over by NAMA.  If NAMA takes over a loan, naturally it will take the deeds and whatever goes with them.  Many of these companies will require overdraft and working capital facilities which are provided by the banks.  I cannot envisage how NAMA will provide these facilities for companies, particularly for those which have performing loans.  This needs to be teased out as further complications will arise.  Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s amendment would address some of these problems.</P>
        <P>The last thing we need is to more jobs losses as enough have been lost already.  We need to get credit flowing.  This would be a worthwhile amendment if it helped banks to take a risk in providing working capital or an overdraft for a company with performing assets which might be taken over by NAMA.  I hope the Minister will examine the amendment as we need to save every job we can.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was inevitable from day one that some businesses would be adversely affected by the legislation, particularly as it involved participatory and non-participatory banks and problems with taking in good and bad assets.  The agency&rsquo;s interim business plan indicates it will take the first ten developers with the largest exposure, averaging &euro;1 billion each.  Instead, will the Government instruct the new NAMA board to deal with cases such as that mentioned by Senator Coghlan first?  There is a risk of viable businesses being pulled down because one of their arms has had to have dealings with NAMA.  The problem is essentially if banks give loans now, they will not be covered by the NAMA provisions.  I hope the Minister of State has the wisdom of Solomon to resolve this matter.  If he does not, some urgent provision will have to be rapidly introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>While I appreciate the concerns expressed by Senator Coghlan and his colleagues, reflected in this amendment and in a few underlying cases, I regret I cannot accept the amendment.  If NAMA has bought a loan, NAMA has first charge.  Banks can issue funds as a second or subsequent charge as they wish, if they think the risk is appropriate.  NAMA or any other bank will not share primary security, that is, a first charge, without compensation.  If the guidelines were to be adopted, NAMA would have to pay substantially less for the loan, which would result in bigger losses for the selling bank.</P>
        <P>This type of matter is a commercial question for NAMA, which will have every incentive to ensure viable companies remain viable.  Matters like this should not be put in legislation, but if NAMA does not behave as one would expect, then the Minister has power to issue guidelines or a direction to NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In this case, the bank has sanctioned the increased facility on the basis of the security it still has, but that security is all going to NAMA.  As the security is going to NAMA and will be outside the reach of the bank, it has withdrawn the facility.  As I said, &euro;14 million was paid in tax last year and up to 500 jobs in the companies are involved.  If they are sued for non-performance on the signed contract &mdash; that is imminent &mdash; they could be facing liquidation.  It will be a frightful tragedy.  I know the Minister of State is aware of this specific case as I discussed it with the Minister earlier.  We should save jobs, revenue for the Exchequer and generally do this for the good of the economy, as all loans of these companies are performing.  I hope that officials in the Department will be able to negotiate between NAMA and the bank to allow this facility go through, on the basis of the security that is there, to protect everybody concerned.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;In page 131, line 15, to delete &ldquo;&euro;1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&euro;5,000&rdquo;.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment tries to deal with the lack of consistency in the fines.  Where there is illicit interference with the processes of lending money, initiation of legal proceedings, legal proceedings in being, purchases for the sale for property and so on, then the penalty under section 221 is a fine of &euro;1,000 or a prison term not exceeding six months, or both, yet in much less serious situations outlined in the Bill, the individual is subject to higher fines.  In other words, there is a serious discrepancy in the fines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I pointed this out earlier to the Minister, he seemed to be sympathetic to it.  In particular, he felt that the possible fine for somebody who made a malicious allegation might be a little bit severe.  There should be a systematic application of a fine.  A fine for a much more damaging offence that could be damaging to the economy should be at least on the level of the other matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of these amendments appears to be to increase the penalty in respect of the offence of lobbying NAMA from &euro;1,000 to &euro;5,000 and to increase the maximum prison sentence from six months to 12 months.  On Committee Stage, Senators compared the lobbying offence with the offence under the whistleblower&rsquo;s provisions, and suggested that the penalty in respect of the lobbying offence is too low in comparison.</P>
        <P>In the ordinary course of events, it is not an offence to proffer honest advice, make suggestions, or lobby a person or organisation as to how they should conduct their affairs.  A special provision has been inserted to make an exception in respect of NAMA.  The penalties for lobbying are rightly lower than that which would apply where a person knowingly, deliberately and in bad faith makes a false accusation of wrong doing.  If an untruthful or misleading representation were made to NAMA by a developer, businessman or credit institution seeking to gain an advantage for themselves, then that could potentially be a far more serious offence.  However, that scenario is catered for by section 7(2) and section 7(4) of this Bill.  The maximum penalty in that situation is a fine of &euro;5 million, or a sentence of five years imprisonment.  In the case of a credit institution, that maximum fine is increased to &euro;20 million.  In these circumstances, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about serious matters here.  The Minister talks about honesty and good faith, but I do not see it.  There was a very serious debate earlier in the day about section 221, and several Senators were very concerned.</P>

	<P>This amendment appears to be intended to broaden the scope of the whistleblower&rsquo;s provisions introduced on Committee Stage in this House to extend protection to reports made to Members of the Oireachtas.  It is not appropriate that the protection be extended in this manner.  In the event that a wrongdoing is to be reported, it is appropriate that it be reported to the board which is responsible for the conduct of NAMA and for the oversight of the agency or to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is the appropriate law enforcement agency to investigate criminal misbehaviour.  There is no purpose to requiring that it be reported to a Member of the Oireachtas and the appropriate course for such a Member in that event would be to report it to the board or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any case.  For these reasons, I do not support the amendment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I share Senator Alex White&rsquo;s reservations.  It seems the Attorney General is being spectacularly nitpicking about language, about which he appears to know singularly little in terms of its felicities and beauties.  Otherwise he would never have used a word such as &ldquo;disapplication&rdquo;, which is horrendously ugly.  Senator Alex White is quite right, however, that the deletion of &ldquo;However&rdquo; does slightly confuse the matter; therefore, the amendment does not actually clarify an awful lot, with the exception of demonstrating that the Attorney General appears to believe that, by using the word &ldquo;publishing&rdquo;, one is affecting other legislation.  &ldquo;Publishing&rdquo; has been defined in other legislation and might have a knock-on effect.  He feels his stance is necessary because of the electronic implications.  I rather doubt it because, on the basis of my knowledge of language rather than law, &ldquo;electronic publishing&rdquo; is a well known phrase in common usage.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to tell us this is a case where the language of the law differs from the language of the ordinary person.</P>

	<P>The Attorney General has raised an issue in respect of the wording of the provision and is of the view that the use of the word &ldquo;published&rdquo; in the context of an electronic publication such as is envisaged by the inserted provision could have implications for other statutes.  The word &ldquo;published&rdquo; has a specific meaning in a different context and should be avoided in this statute in this context.</P>

	<P>I thank the staff of the Seanad for all their hard work in recent days and the officials from the Department of Finance.  I thank the senior Minister, all the other Ministers who came to the House and my Seanad colleagues who participated in the debate in the past three days.</P>
        <P>Even though we voted against the legislation and have serious reservations about it, we will get no pleasure whatsoever if NAMA fails.  We will be praying that this measure will get credit flowing in the economy because the taxpayer is taking a massive gamble on the legislation to the tune of &euro;54 billion.  Many concerns have been expressed about the sort of creative accounting that has been used to some degree to get the measure approved by the European Commission.  Who knows, if it works out, it might not be such a bad idea.</P>
        <P>I regret to say that there are two other issues we failed to address in the legislation.  First, we failed to put into legislation any sense of a social dividend.  Any amendments with that intention were not accepted by the Government.  Second, we have not included the level of strong oversight we wished to see in the legislation, not just in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General but in terms of having a dedicated Oireachtas committee to examine NAMA and to have the Freedom of Information Act apply to it.</P>
        <P>I proposed the inclusion of Members of the Oireachtas on the list of people to whom whistleblowers&rsquo; complaints could be made.  That should be a core part of all whistleblowers legislation.  We are elected by the people and it is wrong for Members to vote against a proposal that we would be considered suitable individuals to whom people could come with concerns about any aspects of the State&rsquo;s service.  Members on the Government side should have had the courage to support that proposal and stand up for it.  Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas should be considered suitable persons for people to come to under any circumstances in respect of oversight on any aspect of what the Government does.  Those issues will come back to haunt us at a later stage.</P>
        <P>I regret the lack of success we had in terms of transparency and accountability and those issues that are so important to such legislation.  I mentioned on Second Stage that I was in the Lower House when we debated the legislation to establish the Health Service Executive.  I heard all the concerns about the health boards and how the HSE would be so different.  I heard that there would be accountability, transparency and communication with Members of the <Col N="289"/>Oireachtas.  History will show that in the five years since that legislation was passed, we did not achieve those aims.  I hope the same does not happen with this legislation as well.  NAMA is as fundamental to the financial services area as the HSE is to the health service.  I hope NAMA works.  We will do our best in whatever way we can to hold the Government to account and to ensure the best outcome is secured for the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>I endorse most of what Senator Twomey said.  This was an outstanding series of debates, one rolling into the next, with some fine and passionate speeches on Second Stage, followed by Committee Stage where the arguments for the various amendments were clearly put forth.  The Minister accepted a small number of those amendments.  I take this opportunity to express my admiration for my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in terms of his political astuteness as well as his capacity to reason.  In particular, the amendment concerning the establishment of a finance committee is a highly significant provision for which the people may well thank this House.  I was honoured to be in this Chamber to argue the case with Senator O&rsquo;Toole and to lend my name as seconder to those amendments.</P>
        <P>I disagree with certain aspects of the National Asset Management Agency.  I have had ideas on this issue for a long time and would have taken a different approach.  I would unrepentantly have nationalised the banks and unrepentantly have allowed Anglo Irish Bank to sink.  It was clear as the Minister explained the situation that he understood that certain of the measures which many of us on this side of the House proposed could only come about as a consequence of nationalisation, but he chose not to go down that path.  If anything gave me confidence, it was the performance, bearing and capacity of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a remarkable virtuoso performance and he showed himself to be fully in command of the brief.  He was not deterred.  He did not appear to be afraid to face the situation but showed himself to be a man of courage, integrity, decency and considerable intellectual resource.  It always impresses me if a Minister can take the comments on his or her feet and give an appropriate, accurate answer.  Time and again that was true of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The other Ministers always performed well, but in varying degrees.  We were extremely lucky to have Senator Marc MacSharry leading the fight for the Government side.  He was extraordinary.  We all get confused on certain occasions, and I gave a good example of it this evening when I could not find the document I was seeking.  Ministers also get confused.  We are all human.  I was terribly impressed on several occasions when Senator MacSharry intervened and like the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and perhaps also an echo of his father, was able to direct the intellectual inquiry, although I did not always agree with him.</P>
        <P>Many of us share concerns and worries about this Bill.  Like Senator Twomey, I have fears, but they are just fears and I hope they are unjustified.  I wish the Bill well and I hope, from the core of my heart, that it does what is intended and starts to resolve this problem because it has a really serious human impact.  That impact was remarkably illuminated by our colleague, Senator Eoghan Harris, when he spoke so passionately and from the heart.</P>
        <P>I should hand bouquets out to everybody but it is not really appropriate or timely.  However, without demeaning anybody else who takes the Chair from time to time, Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley was a remarkable Chairman for a number of sessions.  We all get a little silly and it is good to have fun but people became extremely repetitive and it could be very aggravating.  People played their little games but Senator O&rsquo;Malley moved the debate on with resolute determination.  If there was a free vote and not the usual party fix-up, many Members of <Col N="290"/>the House, having witnessed that performance, would vote for Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley as Cathaoirleach of this Chamber.  That is without disrespect to any of the others who are all talented people.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley would definitely have my vote.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister of State for his attention and courtesy throughout the debate and his colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence, who were here for extended periods over the last couple of days.  However, as we remarked yesterday and without offence to any individual Minister, there was a period when if one looked down to one&rsquo;s notes for assistance on a particular point, when one looked up again there was a different Minister in the chair.  That was a little confusing but we managed to get through it.</P>
        <P>The central plank of the legislation is the so-called long-term economic value.  The time has passed for political point scoring because we have finished the debate but I genuinely do not believe the Government won the argument about long-term economic value.  It lost the argument but won the vote.  I respect that.  I agree with Senator Twomey that this Bill will shortly become an Act and we will have to recognise that it is the law of the land and must be implemented.  It should be implemented in a responsible manner.  It might fall to be implemented at some point by Members who currently sit on the Opposition benches.  That might occur sooner rather than later; we do not know.  It is important to recognise that.</P>
        <P>It has been a good debate.  I am sometimes a little sceptical of the point that is made repeatedly, that the debate is always better in the Seanad than in the D&aacute;il.  I do not always agree with that but it absolutely was the case in this debate.  Unquestionably, the debate was careful and people were conscientious.  That very much stands to the House and its approach.</P>
        <P>A number of things happened in the course of the debate in recent months.  The social dividend came and went.  We thought there would be a social dividend but there is no such thing in the Bill, notwithstanding claims there would be.  The Bill is passed and will become an Act.  The Government has persuaded a majority of the Members of this House.  Obviously and not surprisingly, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Green Party have been persuaded.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has also been persuaded and he gave unflinching support to the Government&rsquo;s proposed NAMA project.  That should be recognised.</P>
        <P>I am sorry this is the option the Government chose but I respect the decision the Houses have made.  Like Senator Twomey, I want it to succeed and to have a properly functioning banking system in this country.  I thank the officials in the Department of Finance and in other Departments as well as in the Office of the Attorney General for demonstrating how dedicated and professional civil servants do such an important job for us and the country.  They and the Minister responded, often under some pressure from our side, about the issues, particularly from the D&aacute;il.  New amendments were introduced, and my colleague, Senator Bacik, had considerable success in persuading the Minister that her French mediator proposal should be considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We find ourselves involved in an exercise where the circumstances are not of our choosing and involved in a debate where how we go about solving the issue is still a matter of discussion among Members of this House.  I congratulate Members of the Opposition.  The debate in this House was conducted differently from the debate in the Lower House.  There was a sense that whatever misgivings people have about the overall concept and elements of the Bill, the nature of democracy means that in the lifespan of this agency different Governments will take shape over the ten years and those who are helping to shape this Bill wish to make it the most effective vehicle it can be.  That is the spirit in which this debate has been conducted.  It is something in which we can take considerable pride.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I believe we have got most things right.  It has been an exercise of repairing the dam without accounting for those who put the hole in the dam in the first instance.  Few of us believe there will be immediate or even any changes in the culture which brought this economic devastation to our country.  However, there is an onus on us to put something in place to ensure recovery is possible and can be achieved.  I and my party have been convinced, through the changes that have been undergone through this process.  I believe there is a social dividend.  It will be apparent and will be defined by regulation.  There must be.  We are not only dealing with the accountancy of bad economics in our financial systems but also with the effects of an appalling planning system in this country.  If we are to avoid returning to this position it will not only be through an agency such as NAMA but must also involve a change in our political culture.  In that context, we must restore the openness, transparency and accountability our political system has lacked for too long.  This will not be achieved by means of legislation; it will only be brought about by winning back public confidence.  We must all accept that the latter has been badly dented by the events of the past two years.  I am an optimist by nature and now that the Houses have made their decision, we can show that this new entity can work and win back the trust that has been lost.  If, by better planning and an adherence to the principles of sustainability, we can move away from the culture which obtained in our financial institutions, a better Ireland, incorporating a more just and equitable society, may be created.  I hope the built environment we try to develop will be better as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>In an ideal world none of us would wish to be in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  However, nothing can be done about that now.  We have achieved a balance in this legislation which will provide the ideal template for the rehabilitation of the banking system but which will also bestow adequate protection upon taxpayers.</P>
        <P>The most significant aspect of the past three days was not the 40 hours we spent discussing the legislation but rather the quality of the debate in which we engaged.  Many Government amendments have been made to the legislation and some Opposition amendments were also accepted.  I am sure all Members will agree that various powers will now be vested in the Minister who, under section 210, will be in a position to introduce guidelines, if he so desires.  Even though he did not accede to the amendments tabled in respect of those guidelines, he had sympathy with the sentiments behind many of them.  I am confident he will achieve a great deal in using the powers granted to him.</P>
        <P>There has been many references to the social dividend and the various things Members would like to see happen.  In the context of this legislation, the ultimate social dividends for <Col N="292"/>which we all yearn are the rehabilitation of the banking sector, the restoration of credit flows, a return to economic growth and a return to work for those who are unemployed.  The allocation of additional resources will ensure that some of the other things Senators sought during the debate will come to pass.</P>
        <P>I express my thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh; the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea; the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, and, in particular, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who all came before the House to deal with the debate on the Bill.  The Minister for Finance has displayed a level of authority in respect of his brief which I have not seen matched during my time as a Member of the House.  I venture to suggest that at no time in the history of the State has another holder of his office been obliged to deal with and try to overcome the economic challenges we currently face.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Clerk and the staff of the House and the officials from the Department of Finance for their assistance in respect of this debate during the past three days.  I pay special tribute to all the members of the Opposition with regard to the spirit in which the debate proceeded.  It has been an exceptionally good debate and certain of the points made by various Senators have made an impression on the Minister for Finance.  I have no doubt their views will inform the ongoing process relating to NAMA.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the remarks made by Senators on all sides.  I thank all the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann for the exceptional commitment they have shown in the debate on what is probably the most important legislation to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas during the past decade.  While the debate was robust, it was also constructive in nature.  Despite strong opposition to certain aspects of the Bill, there was no attempt to filibuster.  The debate on the legislation which took place over three days and involved long sitting hours and exceptionally concentrated work does great credit to the House.</P>
        <P>I join previous speakers in thanking the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the staff of the House and the officials from the Department of Finance who provided invaluable support for the various Ministers.  I endorse every word Senator Alex White said on that subject.</P>
        <P>I pay a warm tribute to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who over many months has shown an exceptional grasp of what has been an extraordinarily complex and difficult issue which, as many argue, involves a number of high risks.  However, the risks would be even higher if nothing had been done.  It is likely that this legislation will obtain for a six to ten-year period and I am confident that, regardless of the reservations they may have expressed during its gestation, those who serve in future Governments will seek to make a success of it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter which relates to the Kino cinema in Cork &mdash; at this point the only independent arthouse cinema located outside Dublin.  The cinema is a cultural gem.  In the light of the fact that Cork recently enjoyed an extremely successful year as European capital of culture and which was last week voted one of the top destinations to visit by the Lonely Planet guide, it is important that the city should remain at the centre of the arts world.</P>
        <P>While we are in a recession, we should not discard our culture or alternative forms of entertainment at the expense of penny-pinching or cost cutting.  The fact is that the important cinema in Cork city to which this matter relates is threatened with closure.  I am sure Senator Boyle will indicate that the appeal of the Kino stretches beyond Cork city.  It is a pivotal venue for the Cork film festival which has just ended.  It attracts people to the city and encourages them to view a different type of film.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, and the Arts Council to intervene, either to protect the grant investment or to secure the future of one of the cultural highlights of this city.  One should praise Mick Hannigan and all others involved in the Kino project.  Without setting Cork against Galway, I would point out that the Solas project in Galway was offered twice as much in grant aid as Cork, &euro;1.5 million.  I accept a grant offer of &euro;750,000 was made to the Kino.  However, in addition to the &euro;1.5 million it received, the Solas project in Galway was grant aided by the Irish Film Board.  What was good for Galway, should also be provided to Cork.  In fairness to Mick Hannigan and the others involved, an investment offer for the Kino property is on the table.  There is also an offer of capital investment.  I know from talking to people that Cork City Council will meet tomorrow with the people involved and there is, I hope, potential for the Kino there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This motion is a cross-party motion and is not meant to be adversarial.  It has been raised to try to protect the Kino and to provide Cork with the vital funding it needs for this project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for sharing time.  Members will be aware of the passion both of us, as men from Cork invest in our different views of the world.  However, when issues concerning the cultural life of our city are concerned, we do not find ourselves too much in disagreement.  Senator Buttimer has already articulated the fact that the Kino cinema is an important part of the arts infrastructure of Cork which has developed over the years, <Col N="294"/>partly through the European year of culture a number of years ago and partly as a result of the Cork International Film Festival, which is one of the longest standing cultural festivals here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that some degree of State support would be offered to sustain what cannot be seen as an ordinary commercial venture.  During the 1980s, during several periods of unemployment, the film festival week offered me some pleasant diversions that economic opportunity did not offer at the time.  Cork has developed over the years through programmes like the ACCESS programme which has helped it have facilities such as the Kino.  It helps Cork&rsquo;s status also that Lonely Planet commended Cork and I hope we will see it receive many more visitors due to its accolade.  On these grounds, I hope the Minister, if not in a position to articulate this evening particular measures that can be offered, will talk with the Minister, Deputy Cullen or other Cabinet members with regard to how their Departments or appropriate State agencies can ensure this important part of Cork cultural life can be maintained and sustained into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I make an official reply I would like to say that although I am not familiar with the Kino cinema, I appreciate and respect the cultural contribution of Cork, which was highlighted by it being a European city of culture.  My brother who lives and works in Cork has often spoken to me about the Cork film festival and I have benefited over the years from what one might call arthouse cinema in other parts of the country.</P>
        <P>I am responding to this debate on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen.  He wishes to clarify that responsibility for the operation of non-State sponsored venues, such as the venue in question, does not fall within the remit of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism or any of its agencies.</P>
        <P>The House may be interested to know that in 2001, a strategic partnership called the cultural cinema consortium was formed between Bord Scann&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann &mdash; the Irish Film Board &mdash; and the Arts Council.  The aim of the consortium was to develop arthouse cinema and expand the audience for this art form.  The capital funding awarded by the partnership was designed to improve opportunities for regional cinema operators to develop multi-screen operations and to enhance and expand the range of cinema available around Ireland.  To date, the consortium has invested in two major capital build programmes.  The first, the Light House cinema here in Dublin opened its doors to the public in May 2008 and has a wide and diverse programming schedule.  The second, Solas in Galway, commenced in 2008 and has received strong support from Galway City Council and is also funded from the ACCESS programme administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that any business or venue finds itself in financial difficulty in these difficult times but unfortunately, as I have outlined to the House, there is no Government funding available in this instance.</P>
        <P>Given that I am attached to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism as Minister of State, and now that my attention has been drawn to the matter, I will take an interest in it and discuss the matter further with officials and others familiar with the situation.  I agree with the general proposition put by Senators Buttimer and Boyle that the loss of such a cinema providing such a service would be a serious blow to the artistic and cultural life of Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his personal remarks.  It is important that we explore the idea of a non-profit private partnership of some type that will help us retain this cinema.  It will not survive without private or public funding.  I accept the response the Minister of State has given, but if it can be done in Galway with the Solas project, I see no reason it cannot be done in Cork, particularly with Cork City Council, those involved in the <Col N="295"/>Kino and the Arts Council or the Department to buy into it.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments and hope he will take an active part in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his personal interest.  In following through that interest he should be aware there is significant public support for securing a future for the Kino.  The degree and level of Government support may not be the traditional type of support.  Just showing a personal interest is an important first indication as to how the future of this cinema may be secured.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his indulgence and apologise for keeping him here this late, but this is a very important issue.  It was brought to my attention this week that maternity services in Portiuncula hospital in Ballinasloe could be terminated.  Through the rumour grapevine it transpires that a national overview of maternity services has been completed and that this report recommends the closure of maternity services at Portiuncula.  When will this report be published or is there a report?  I use this opportunity to seek clarification.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Portiuncula provides excellent services for a huge catchment area in the midlands, Galway, Longford, Westmeath, Roscommon, Offaly and Tipperary.  There were 2,000 births in the hospital last year and the hospital is on target to deliver the same number of babies this year.  The facilities are state of the art and just recently a neonatal special baby care unit was opened.  The hospital has three excellent obstetricians, an amazing midwife team and lactation services.  The hospital has also won awards, for example, best hospital in 2007 and best maternity hospital, better than the Coombe, Holles Street and University College Hospital Galway.</P>
        <P>It would be an absolute tragedy for Portiuncula and the midlands if there was to be downgrading or closure of maternity services in Portiuncula hospital.  We all accept there are and must be centres of excellence.  However, when it comes to delivering a baby it is not an illness and one needs to be close to a good centre where one can give birth to one&rsquo;s baby in safe, comfortable surroundings.  Portiuncula is a flagship hospital for such maternity services.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I am aware of the importance attached by people to local and regional maternity hospitals that have a certain critical mass of throughput.  I am glad to be able, for once, to give the Senator what I believe she will find to be a reassuring reply.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery and maintenance of the best quality health service possible and in providing the highest standard of patient care in an effective and efficient way within the resources allocated.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance so that people can have confidence in their health services and the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has no plans to withdraw or scale down maternity services at Portiuncula Hospital.  The Minister is confident that Portiuncula will continue to play a key role in the provision of acute hospital services for the population which it serves.  Portiuncula is an acute general and maternity hospital which operates as a constituent part of the HSE&rsquo;s western region.  It provides a comprehensive range of acute, diagnostic and support services for adults and children in the catchment areas of east Galway, Roscommon, north Tipperary, Offaly and Westmeath.  The hospital has a total of 210 beds &mdash; specifically, 196 inpatient and 14 day care beds.  Portiuncula has a budget allocation of &euro;47.8 million for 2009.  It benefits from a committed workforce that, throughout this year, is projected to treat 11,000 inpatients, 6,700 day patients, 21,200 emer<Col N="296"/>gency department attendances and manage 2,320 deliveries in the maternity unit.  In addition, this year the hospital will deal with just under 40,000 outpatient attendances.  The hospital has strong partnerships with colleagues in the primary, community and continuing care sectors and aims to provide patients with fully integrated services.</P>
        <P>The number of births at Portiuncula up to the end of September 2009 was 1,678, up by 2.9% on the 1,631 figure in the equivalent period in 2008.  A number of capital developments have taken place or are in train in maternity hospitals and units in recent years, including Portiuncula.  The HSE recently invested &euro;2 million in that hospital&rsquo;s maternity services with the development of a new special care baby unit which opened in October 2009 to provide additional intensive care cot and high dependency cots.  The hospital has just established a dedicated early pregnancy unit in the outpatient department.  This provides direct access for women who require intervention in the early stages of pregnancy.  Previously, these patients would have had to attend the emergency department.  This service is of direct benefit to these vulnerable patients and has helped to alleviate pressure in this department.</P>
        <P>These developments come on top of funding that the HSE committed to upgrade the hospital&rsquo;s emergency department in the summer of 2009 and to overhaul the oncology day unit and the physiotherapy department in 2007.  They serve to illustrate the commitment consistently shown by the Government to the strengthening of appropriate services at Portiuncula.  I am happy to reiterate that there are no plans to close or scale down maternity services and that the Government continues to see a very important role for the hospital as part of a high quality service to the population of the region.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for such a positive reply.  However, there are rumours about the national report on maternity services and I wonder whether it is to be published.  Perhaps he might ask the Minister about this, at his convenience.</P>

	<P>I am not in a position, obviously, to answer the question directly.  However, from my experience of giving replies on behalf of various Departments on occasions such as this, it seems to me that the response is extraordinarily emphatic.  Therefore, it effectively is ruling out that some report might change the picture completely in the short term.  I am familiar from other regions of the country with similar types of debates relating to hospitals.  Certainly, from the figures cited it seems to me that Portiuncula Hospital is in a very strong position to retain its maternity services.</P>
