	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the issue of male cancers is highlighted and to outline the efforts being made towards introducing male screening programmes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to outline the compensation measures available to the residents of Cork city&rsquo;s middle parish and the Mardyke affected by the recent flooding.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion re postponement of elections to the regional fisheries boards, to be referred to committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, statements on pre-budget outlook, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and conclude not later than 8 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of statements for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons and leaders; and No. 3, Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2. </P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the appalling and traumatic circumstances facing so many individuals, families and communities as a result of the flooding, I ask that the Order of Business be amended to enable the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be invited to come to the House today to give a report on the up-to-date position.  Significant questions arise about delays in making insurance payments, when aid will be given to families and the response of the European Union.  I know that Members on all sides want to hear from the Minister on a range of issues.  Unfortunately, this will be an ongoing crisis.  </P><Col N="718"/>
        <P>Judge Yvonne Murphy is to be congratulated on her report and the clarity with which she presented her findings.  The report should be regarded as a defining moment in the relationship between the church and State.  Anyone who by their actions or inaction created a situation where children were raped and molested should not continue in their position and the report states clearly that this was the case.  Condemnation is not enough.  We must look to see whether children are now safe and whether audits are required in other dioceses also.  The State needs to consider this question seriously, particularly in view of the audit undertaken recently by the HSE which showed that the State was not receiving the co-operation it had sought in the first instance and which had to be dragged from people at the time.  Has the position changed?</P>
        <P>People are stunned and appalled by the information contained in the Murphy report and we must ask if the State is now protecting children.  I refer to the report of the Ombudsman for Children on young, unsupervised children arriving in the country who in many cases become fodder for the sex industry.  Is this the way to protect children?  This is what is happening to such children.  I refer to the many examples where the HSE is unable to provide a 24-hour service when needed for children who are the victims of abuse and is unable to assign social workers or respond to children who need help.  Assessment lists in child and family centres throughout the country are closed.  What action will be taken by the State on behalf of children?  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Ministers who will come to the House on Thursday to list the actions being taken by them, starting with the constitutional amendment on children and detailing the response to the other issues I have raised today.  We have to start talking in realistic terms.  This is not about pious hopes in looking after children but rather the action the State is taking to protect children at risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Three or four months ago I raised the issue of the Vatican&rsquo;s non-co-operation with the Ryan report and the fact that the role of the Vatican ambassador and the Vatican embassy should be called into question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the up-front contempt with which the Murphy report was treated by the ambassador and the Vatican State at the very least calls for a re-examination of our relationship with the Vatican.  The Vatican&rsquo;s ambassador to Ireland should be called to account.  He should be called in by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to explain himself on this situation.  It is the least we need.</P>
        <P>I very much support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments about the removal of people from office who were responsible, either through omission or commission, for the abuse of children.  However, I have no time whatsoever for the calls by party leaders for the sacking of a bishop.  It is not the business of politicians to interfere in the operations of a church.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have witnessed enough of that in communist China with the Falun Gong and in communist Russia&rsquo;s refusal to allow Christians to practise their religion.  We reached the giddy limit this week in Switzerland where a referendum was held on whether minarets could be put on top of mosques.  That is where such calls lead and it is not our business.</P>
        <P>However, we need to examine our republican principles and where we stand.  The problem of child abuse cannot and should not be cordoned off as a problem with one bishop.  This is a systemic issue and, as politicians, our function and duty is to safeguard children and to make <Col N="719"/>sure every religious and lay person is amenable to and subject to the law of the land.  That is our job and if there is anything wrong with the law, we amend it to make sure that happens.</P>
        <P>Scapegoating a bishop is not the answer.  The religious hierarchy intersects with the structures of child protection in the education system.  For instance, if a pupil makes an allegation of abuse against a priest, the matter is eventually dealt with by the school patron who in 95% of cases, and more than 3,000 primary schools, is the local bishop.  The bishop with responsibility for the investigation of an alleged abuse of a pupil finds himself, therefore, in the conflicted position of being the line manager of the priest and the patron of the child.  That cannot continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The first response to the Murphy report should be to ensure the hierarchy and bishops are removed as school patrons.  That will not have an impact on Catholic education.  Let Catholics elect their own people if they want to establish their own schools.  If they want to appoint the local bishop or parish priest, that is their own business but the notion of a structure where systemically the local bishop is the patron of all the schools when he is also responsible for managing the priests of the diocese is not acceptable.  We need to remove responsibility for the welfare of our children from the religious hierarchy.</P>
        <P>I always notice when the participants come close to an agreement, as is the case in Government Buildings currently, others start outlining the difficulties of implementation.  A few months ago, it was said a deal could not be done and agreement on savings could not be reached.  This is on the point of being done.  Let people sort out the implementation problems at structural level.  These deals can be done and they can be made work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole regarding the Murphy report.  It is a shame we are not debating the report today when the rest of the country is but I am glad it will be debated in the House next Friday.  The report makes for distressing reading.  It has exposed the appalling inadequacy of responses to horrific rape and sexual abuse of children by both church and State authorities.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that our debate should focus on the actions that need to be taken.  As politicians, we need to examine legislation to ensure soft information on child sex abuse can be shared and to ensure mandatory reporting of suspicions of sex abuse.  We have dodged that for a long time.  The law on misprison of a felony has been amended in such a way that it seems bishops responsible for allowing and facilitating abuse to continue over many years and for children&rsquo;s lives to be destroyed in the process will not be capable of being prosecuted for any crime and that is a failing of ours, as legislators.</P>
        <P>However, I take issue with Senator O&rsquo;Toole because it is proper and acceptable when bishops have such an enormous role in the secular and civic institutions of the State for politicians to say whether they should resign where they have been found guilty of inexcusable behaviour in the cover up of priests who abused and continued to abuse.  The language of cover-up and the language of mental reservation is the language of lying and deceit by any other name.  We are entitled to call for resignations, particularly when bishops are still patrons in schools and still responsible in many cases for the running of hospitals, as pointed out by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Let us not forget that two chaplains of hospitals were named in the report as having been directly involved in abuse.  There are children of all religions and none in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  It is absolutely inexcusable that we allow children of any religion to be victimised in this way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must also focus on the role of the papal nuncio.  I go further than Senator O&rsquo;Toole in saying that it is time for the Minister, who has expressed doubts about the behaviour of the <Col N="720"/>papal nuncio in treating the commission with contempt, to call in the papal nuncio and expel him if he cannot give a reason for the contempt with which he treated the commission&rsquo;s call for information.  The bishops must wake up and smell the coffee.  This is not a case of looking for heads on the plate, it is about seeking accountability and acceptance of responsibility for heinous crimes against children committed for many decades.  It is not good enough that the bishops defend their own; they have missed the point.  This is particularly true when they are so involved in secular society and when there are reports this week, as the D&aacute;il is about to debate the Civil Partnership Bill, that the Catholic Church is lobbying against the legislation.  That is inexcusable behaviour from a religious institution.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.  It is disgraceful.</P>

	<P>In a week when the public service is coming under attack, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights I visited the new criminal courts complex on Parkgate Street.  We must commend the Courts Service in particular and the public service in general for bringing on stream such an impressive building with a great improvement in facilities for victims of crime, the accused and members of the public.  They are to be commended for this excellent building.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is a significant day because the Lisbon treaty comes into force.  We should mark the occasion because the campaign was very successful and the vote on 2 October led the way as far as Europe is concerned to have 27 countries join the Union.  I congratulate our Commissioner designate, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, on being appointed to the post of research and innovation, an important portfolio and one in which she is capable of achieving great results.  She will benefit the country and as a Commissioner she will never forget her roots in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to come to the House to discuss the crisis in the legal profession.  Today is the deadline for obtaining right to practise insurance, which has increased from approximately &euro;8,000 per year to &euro;24,000.  This will put many companies and individual practitioners in great difficulty.  There are 2,227 practising solicitors in Ireland and over 1,027 are sole practitioners.  They will find it very difficult in the current climate to rise to the suggestion made, which has been commented on by the Law Society director general Mr. Ken Murphy.  Deep concern has been expressed by the industry today, the deadline, and many companies will not have professional indemnity insurance by today.  There must be an extension.  There have been difficulties in the profession because of the lack of transfers at the moment and the legal situation with buildings, to the extent that 800 of the 9,000 qualified solicitors are currently unemployed.  A solicitor said to me today that this is a crisis for solicitors.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must intervene because conveyancing has been reduced to nil and solicitors find it difficult to survive in this climate.  They are paying high interest or high rent.  I have no direct or indirect involvement in this regard but solicitors provide a great service and we should intervene in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House to discuss the matter of the training of junior doctors in our acute hospitals.  A recent report shows that the vast majority of negligence cases in our hospitals are the responsibility of the most junior doctors in our health care system.  They do not receive adequate training and supervision.  I seek a debate on this, especially in light of the fact there has been a massive drop in the number of applications for junior doctor posts.  There is a risk that the level of expertise and <Col N="721"/>experience of junior doctors could drop even further, leading to more adverse outcomes for patients in our health care system.  I seek a debate on the issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>On the clerical abuse of children, an issue about which everybody is talking, we should have a debate on what is happening in Irish society, in which children are still being abused.  They are being abused in their homes, in some cases by their parents.  The abuse is not always sexual; it can be physical or take the form of neglect.  Social workers and others in the health service are unable to deal with the crisis.  We will read of incidents of abuse in the next few years similar to those about which we read in the British print media of children dying at the hands of their parents or those of a partner of a parent because of neglect.  We may look back at what happened during the past 30 or 40 years and the church&rsquo;s role in it, but what is happening in some houses today is equally as horrific and vicious and we are not facing up to such abuse.  We are not putting in place the necessary resources to address it or give the necessary support to HSE staff who deal with such cases.  We should have a debate on the issue as a matter of urgency, as otherwise we will be reading reports from retired social workers and public health doctors and nurses on the horrific abuses which happened in Ireland in 2009 and 2010, while we talked about something else.  We need to debate the two issues together &mdash; what happened in the past and what is happening now &mdash; as they are equally important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support many of the points raised, starting with that raised by Senator Fitzgerald on the outcome of the Murphy report.  I do not have answers, nor does anybody else.  It is a pity institutions are being destroyed when it is individuals within them who should be targeted.  We should have a debate on the issue when the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, should advise us on where we stand in this respect, how children are being protected in the education system, in schools and sports centres, and the issue of human trafficking.  As there are many aspects involved, I would welcome a debate on the issue and an opportunity to be updated on how children are being protected.  </P>
        <P>An interesting study, the Sl&aacute;n lifestyle study, was carried out last week.  It researched the topic of binge drinking, particularly among those under the age of 18 years.  Such behaviour is becoming more prevalent as a result of high unemployment, stress and strain in families and abuse.  A question that must be asked is whether we have a national alcohol policy?  Do we have a national substance misuse strategy.  These are the questions being asked.  A debate on them would be welcome.  I refer to high unemployment, stress and strain in families, how we protect children and family life, and the awful increase in the volume of alcohol consumption, particularly among those under the age of 18 years, referred to as binge drinking.  I call for two debates: one on the how we protect children and the other on whether we should introduce a national alcohol policy.  Such a policy should be covered in our schools.  While there is a civics course, the education children receive in school is not transferred to broader society when they go home in the evening.  I call for the introduction of a high level national awareness campaign on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important in the light of the Murphy report and at this time of Advent to state clearly that the Christian message, with its gospel values of tolerance, compassion and love, is still vital and relevant, but it needs a visionary church or churches to implement it.  We do not have this, rather we have a series of decaying bureaucracies.  All of Christendom has been shamed by the behaviour of the hierarchy and priests.  There is no doubt that the position of the papal nuncio must be called into question.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="722"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Any person who puts the niceties of diplomatic etiquette above the welfare, safety and protection from rape of children has no place in this country as a representative of a Christian church.  I say this because he is supposed to be a diplomat.  I agree with my colleagues, some of whom have said there is a separation of church and State.  It is not up to me to tell any bishop to resign, rather it is up to the people in the church to do so.  However, as they act politically they must be challenged and the audit must be national.  Every dioceses must be examined, out of decency for the suffering children.  Are we to say we have done enough here and that children in this dioceses are not entitled to have their story recorded and their situation vindicated?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to call the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to account too.  It is all very well for him to say that no church can be above the law, but the churches are above the law.  This House placed them above the law in the particularly sensitive area of children in education.  We gave them exemptions from the operation of equality legislation, something no Christian church in conscience should ever have asked for.  It was a disgrace at the time and only Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole and myself opposed it in this House, which is also reprehensible.</P>
        <P>I do not simply blame the Irish hierarchy; this goes right to the top.  I refer to successive Heads of State in the Vatican State, the various Popes, including this one, who protected a serial abuser of his own seminarians in Mexico by giving him sanctuary in the Vatican, his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, who when Cardinal Groer had to leave his position expressed compassion for Cardinal Groer and studiously ignored the victims.  This is the leadership they got.  The one note of hope over the weekend was the comments from right wing commentators.  I heard them on every radio station rowing as fast as hell to get away from the body of the decaying ecclesiastical system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the words spoken on the Murphy report.  I believe structural damage has been done to the whole church.  I welcome the full day debate organised for Thursday.  It is a shocking report and following from the Ryan report, I do not believe this is the end of it.  Other dioceses must be properly examined.</P>
        <P>I put on record that I hold a deep feeling of sadness for the hundreds, possibly thousands, of priests and other religious who are damaged by this report.  In my home parish, my local priest broke down and cried on Sunday because he was so hurt and pained.  Although what took place was inexcusable and criminal, there are hundreds and thousands of good people, priests and nuns who are seriously damaged by these reports and I feel sorry for them.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the area of the rights of children.  Almost five years ago, while I was Chairman of the Committee on the Constitution, we came to the unanimous conclusion that the rights of the child as enshrined within the family clause of the Constitution were not adequate. We should hold a referendum or if that is not necessary, fast-track legislation.  Never before has the need been so acute arising from the Murphy report and the rights of children throughout our society must be fully protected.  The level of support within our Constitution must be upgraded one way or another.</P>
        <P>I raise the old chestnut of a debate on the fishing industry.  Shortly, our Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries will go to Brussels on his annual visit to try to protect the Hague preferences and to get quota for our fishermen.  This is an annual event, somewhat like going with a begging bowl.  Thanks to the Leader, it was planned to hold the debate in the House on the week our former colleague and Senator, Peter Callinan died.  The debate was postponed.  I do not seek to reschedule it before Christmas because time is too short.  However, I urge the Leader to arrange for a debate on the whole fishing industry at the earliest opportunity in 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a terrible time for the people.  I have reflected on the matter and there is a link between the flooding crisis that has befallen the people in the past week and the thousands of Irish children that have been abused by the church throughout the generations.  The link is denial and neglect.  The attitude was that if we do not talk about it, it might go away.  In both cases, the Government has failed to put adequate solutions in place to prevent either occurrence from taking place again.  With regard to child abuse, as of yet there has been no debate on the implementation plan for the Ryan report.  There is no mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse yet.  The child protection guidelines are still not on a statutory footing.  This means that children remain at risk.  There is a story in today&rsquo;s<i> Irish Independent</i> which appears under the headline &ldquo;Cover-up clergymen to get off the hook&rdquo;.  Is the Murphy report adequate in the context of its being used to convict those named as having abused children and individuals identified as having colluded in the cover-up of such abuse?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In recent days I witnessed the misery, despair and shock experienced by those affected by flooding.  Many of these individuals fought against the floods on their own because State services were not adequate.  Last week I asked the Leader the reason the Taoiseach had not mobilised the Army, which contains 8,000 people trained to provide assistance when natural disasters occur.  However, I did not receive an answer.  Why has the Taoiseach failed to mobilise the Army?  Why was the fire service in Galway not utilised, particularly when it was used in other counties?  What is going on?  Do people not realise that abject misery and financial distress are affecting many?</P>
        <P>How are individuals to access financial support, other than through the means-tested route or by seeking assistance from community welfare officers?  What is being done is simply not adequate.  The roads in front of people&rsquo;s homes have been completely destroyed.  I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s answers to my questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader has allocated time for a debate later this week on the Murphy report.  It will give us an opportunity to deal with the matter in more detail.  It is evident that there is a great deal of anger and confusion.  As a Roman Catholic, I must state this is not the church I know.  My experience has been that it is a compassionate institution.  We must focus on the victims and survivors.  We will not do them justice if we become distracted.  It is horrifying to think little children were molested in the way in which they were and to realise that their lives were completely ruined.</P>
        <P>Anybody who subscribes to the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church will be aware of what Christ said about the concept of scandalising children.  I do not wish to sound sanctimonious but it is on this tenet that the church is based.  The church must embark on a mission of renewal.  This would provide everyone with an opportunity to witness the terrible damage done by certain individuals, particularly those who occupied positions of trust.  It would also provide an opportunity to show that it is not acceptable for such persons to hold such positions, either now or in the future.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole who made a good point on furthering the concept of fairness and balance.  Calls for the resignation of an individual bishop do not in any way help the victims or survivors.  In the long term such calls will only distract attention from other matters.  Even though everyone feels hurt at present, it is important to remember the great work done by so many church people in the past, not only in Ireland but also throughout the world.  When Pope John Paul ll died, there was an outpouring of admiration and when Fr. Michael Sinnott was held captive in the Philippines, it touched a nerve with everyone.  It is important that a balance is struck.  I do not accept that we, as public representatives, should call for the resignation of any bishop.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by colleagues about the startling revelations and the shocking and sickening litany of abuses outlined in the Murphy report.  Many of the revelations to which I refer would have previously been in the public domain.  However, their being catalogued together highlights a system of abuse that reaches into not just the church authorities but also those of the State.  It appears certain individuals within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na turned a blind eye to allegations of abuse.  Any discussion we have on the report should focus on that aspect as well as on the culpability of members of the hierarchy, and undoubtedly some culpability rests with them.</P>
        <P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business that we have a discussion on flooding today.  Last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not hear the movement of an amendment to the Order of Business.  Perhaps Fine Gael is opposing the Order of Business but I did not hear an amendment to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael is opposing the Order of Business.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to have a discussion on flooding today.  Last week, the Leader indicated we would have a daily discussion on flooding.  I do not know whether a daily discussion is necessary but to have a discussion on Friday while people&rsquo;s homes are under water today is not a sufficient reaction by the Seanad.  Perhaps when the rest of today&rsquo;s business has concluded we can have a discussion on flooding.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames mentioned Dr. Clonan&rsquo;s comments in her contribution.  The Government failed to enact its own disaster management plan.  Last year, a booklet was produced and sent to each house in the country which clearly outlined what strategy the Government would put in place and gave the example of flooding when describing how the Government would react to a major disaster.  It failed to have a Cabinet meeting and to implement many aspects of its plan.  We should discuss this as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I was shocked to learn from a programme on RTE last night that one Department proposed a pilot project for dredging and cleaning rivers in the west while the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated it could not go ahead.  Over the past 60 or 70 years we have failed to do anything to clean up rivers; bar work done by angling clubs and some landowners nothing is being done.  We should undertake that work immediately.</P>

	<P>I call for a series of debates in the House so that at least once a year we debate the protection and nurturing of children and that we have a regular debate on the economy.  These would be features we would all get used to and we would all have a chance to prepare for them and speak.  In speaking about the very sad Murphy report in particular and the litany of terrible events committed by the few over many decades I suggest that we all be mindful that the State also turned a blind eye in many instances.  In the past, the State had a very mature relationship with the church and many aspects of it have matured further in recent times.  Notwithstanding that, we must deal with this difficulty and reiterate what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated, that a collar is no protection in this State against anybody being held liable for criminal prosecution and nor should it ever be.</P>
        <P>In recognising the fact that very few clergy are involved, I understand how many of the majority are severely embarrassed by this.  However, it is no harm to remind them that they still have a duty.  They must preach the gospel and they should not be afraid of the unpopular aspects of it either.  A message should go out from the discussion on the Order of Business that we expect the clergy, the vast majority of whom are good decent people, to continue to preach the gospel in full.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I sympathise with the Cathaoirleach and the people of Banagher and Shannon Harbour who have endured extraordinary pain and devastation over recent days.  I second Senator John Paul Phelan&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  The Minister should be here today to discuss this very serious issue.  This day last week, representatives of the public service unions stated on national radio that there was no emergency in Athlone.  What constitutes an emergency?  Last night on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; they could not answer that either.  I want a definition that clarifies what constitutes an emergency.  If the River Tolka burst its banks in Dublin, a state of emergency would be declared.  As a consequence of this Government&rsquo;s inertia in declaring a state of emergency, the unions announced there was no emergency in the Athlone area.  Much to their embarrassment, our fantastic local authority employees were not able to work on Tuesday because of this union directive.  The director of services asked the unions to lift the directive but they refused to do so.  We in this House and the people of the midlands appreciate the local authority workers in Athlone and County Westmeath but their unions let them down badly.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate on flood insurance.  People who are fully insured against flooding will have to wait until their houses have been assessed before they can get a single cent.  What will they do in the meantime?  They cannot apply for social welfare because they are not entitled to money for alternative accommodation.  I am aware of one lady who will receive a mere &euro;409 per month in social welfare benefits.  That is a joke.</P>

We will not have closure until we conduct a nationwide audit of every diocese in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the desire to hold a balanced debate.  I accept what Senator Norris has to say about right-wing commentators scurrying away.  Equally unseemly, however, are the people who have never been friends of the Catholic church and who are <Col N="726"/>gleefully taking the opportunity to stick their boots into an organisation which has done much more good than most.</P>

Turning to good news for change, I remind Senators that I have on several occasions spoken about the introduction of the go safe programme for introducing speed cameras nationally, a matter on which I have received the full support of Senators, especially the Leader.  I am glad to report that contracts for the programme were signed last week.  The tender was won by a Kerry-based company with foreign support and will create 120 jobs, including 50 in County Kerry, 50 in County Tipperary and a number in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s constituency.  The principals behind the programme asked me to convey their gratitude to the Leader and other Senators for raising the issue in this House and expediting its introduction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question has been raised of whether we face a national emergency or disaster because of the flooding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, indicated that as Dublin was not affected, a national emergency was not being declared.  Given that the car of the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, has since been submerged in water along the Strawberry Beds, perhaps we can now declare a national disaster.  This is relevant in light of today&rsquo;s entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, which includes a solidarity clause obliging member states and European institutions to assist a member state affected by a national disaster.  I do not understand why the Government has not invoked this clause.  What has the Government done about raising this matter with the European Commission?  I refer not to being in touch, as the Taoiseach indicated, but to a formal application for assistance invoking the provisions of the Lisbon treaty and seeking the aid of the European institutions and the Commission to assist the country when infrastructure, homes, farms and businesses have been so badly affected.  There is a European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December at which the Government will have an opportunity to act expeditiously to ensure the Council makes a decision on assisting this country in this matter.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that we are going to debate the report on child abuse and the flooding later in the week.  There are many reasons for failure but there are no excuses.  I hope that the debate will focus on how best to go from here and how to help the many who have suffered as a result of the abuse and the floods.</P>
        <P>I hope that these debates can be constructive.  I am not sure the television programme &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; serves us well.

        <P>I welcome the fact that we will have an opportunity today to comment on the budget.  It is appropriate that we do this in advance of discussing the Murphy report and the flooding because the budget will be announced tomorrow week.  For the legitimacy of this House it is important that its Members have their opportunity to feed into that process.  I hope that as many as possible will participate in this afternoon&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of us not to acknowledge and pay tribute to the unions and others in Government Buildings for making substantial progress over the past long days and nights.  I am hopeful that the postponement of the strike on Thursday means that a deal is imminent and I hope that the outstanding health issues can be dealt with.  If we are to overcome the economic difficulties facing us it is critical to move forward together with the support of workers, employers and all sectors of our community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe it is very important that we debate the Murphy report on Thursday.  These are heavy days for people of goodwill at all levels of the Catholic church and outside it because of the abuse and the fact that the handling of these cases was characterised by massive incompetence, and sometimes more than that, and ineptitude farther back in the past.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, I have had the impression in recent days that people who had very little concern about child protection issues were acting as though they had won an All-Ireland final and taking the opportunity to pursue separate agendas.  I hope the Church would not fear a national audit.  I believe in the maxim &ldquo;the truth will set you free&rdquo;.  When we hear the full story of abuse in the church, this will be a better society for it and we will, I hope, continue to examine abuses across society.  The 96% of cases outside the church context should be of as much interest to us.</P>
        <P>I have great respect for Senator O&rsquo;Toole but, with the best will in the world, he may have caused a misunderstanding about a possible conflict of interest in respect of the role of bishops.  There is a designated liaison person in each school who must contact the HSE where an allegation is made.  By the time the patron is notified, the train of accountability has left the station.  It is interesting to know that if a chaplain is involved, we find that diocesan guidelines are generally even more strict.  If the person against whom an allegation is made is a chaplain, that person is gone straightaway and much quicker than if he was a lay teacher.  The Catholic Primary School Management Association has been pushing for a review of the Children First <Col N="728"/>guidelines, published nine years ago and for which the Ferns report called, but this has still not happened.  This must be part of the debate also.</P>
        <P>In recent days I have been talking to people involved in education management.  It is a fact that voluntary schools are receiving on average &euro;200 less per child than VEC schools and &euro;90 less per child than secondary schools that are community schools.  This is not cherishing the children of the nation equally.  We have a situation where 30% of their budgets has to be raised through fundraising activities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we will be having a discussion on the Murphy report.  All abuse is wrong, horrendous and ruins the lives of those abused.  We must focus on the persons who have been abused, but we also have to protect children such as those in the Visitors Gallery, as well as young people in different age groups.  If they suffer clerical or any other form of abuse, they should feel confident enough to come forward and talk to somebody.  Many victims carry the burden for some time before they feel confident to tell somebody about it.  No matter how high a position in society an abuser holds, victims should have the confidence to come forward and be sure their allegations will be treated seriously.  There have been allegations against priests in my constituency in the past, some of which have been malicious.  The evidence in the Murphy report is very clear, but we also have the other side of the coin where allegations that are not substantiated can cause as much difficulty for the persons accused.  I welcome the fact that we will debate the issue.</P>
        <P>Translink and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann operate the Enterprise train service which was out of commission for a few months due to a breakdown in the infrastructure at Malahide.  It is now back in action, but the companies in question are back to their old trick of exploiting those who pay in euro.  I can buy a return ticket from Belfast for &pound;20 and take the return journey at any time within one month, but a single journey from Dublin costs &euro;38.  A cup of coffee costs &pound;1.60 or &euro;2.40.  This exploitation by a joint operation must be addressed.  I ask the Leader to again bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in welcoming the debate that will take place on the Murphy report and its conclusions.  In the last two weeks the Ombudsman for Children published a report on the number of separated children in the country and the way in which they are being cared for.  While I hope none of those children has been subject to the abuse documented in the Murphy report, it is very clear they are being treated in a way that is not in keeping with the standards and attitudes we are looking to achieve, particularly in light of the report and the discussion we are having.  I hope we can keep this in mind in any debate we have on this issue.</P>
        <P>My second point concerns the role of State authorities, which my colleagues have pointed to already.  To find at best incompetence and, worse, the appearance of collusion with State authorities and the church, if anything, makes the evil and disgrace we are talking about of a greater order.  I welcome the fact the Garda Commissioner has ordered that one of his assistant commissioners will immediately investigate this and prepare a report for the DPP to ascertain whether there is any case for criminal liability that can be acted upon.</P>
        <P>I conclude by making reference to the discussions on social partnership taking place in Government Buildings.  As others have done, I welcome the huge endeavour and labour from <Col N="729"/>both sides.  One concern I have is the apparent plan to reduce the number of hours worked in return for agreement to wage reductions.  If one considers the issues we raise each day, such as the length of the school year, the delays in medical card applications and delays in social welfare cases being dealt with, we have to ask whether those problems will get better or whether they will get worse if such an agreement is implemented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Leader on ordering the debate on the Murphy report for Thursday.  It is essential that the voices of these Houses are heard in this regard.  I agree with Senator John Paul Phelan that while much of the information was in the public domain previously, its compilation in one document sends shockwaves through reasonable people everywhere, who are appalled by it.</P>
        <P>This underlines the need for the State to have robust and effective measures in place.  In that regard, as a Christian and a Catholic, I believe in the whole tenet of penance and atonement.  In such a capacity, I find myself in agreement with Senator Bacik about people in high places taking responsibility for either actions or inaction.  However, as a politician, I am inclined to the view of Senator O&rsquo;Toole that is not really for us to call on people to resign.  We are not particularly good at it ourselves either, as a profession.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>My views are well known with regard to the right to life, which is the most fundamental of all human rights.  Nobody has the right to interfere with it in any shape or form.  However, a very close second to that crime would be the defilement and destruction of the innocence of people.  There is a very short period in people&rsquo;s lives, up to adolescence and perhaps a little beyond, where the joy and innocence of that era should not be defiled or stolen from children.  Unfortunately, we have found in the past that this did happen.  Therefore, it is essential that people take responsibility.</P>
        <P>I hope that we can broaden Thursday&rsquo;s debate beyond the percentage of victims who are subjected to abusive people in the clergy to the broader issue of sexual abuse right across society, from other organisations and within the family.  It is important we do not lose sight of the need for protective measures to be in place throughout society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator John Paul Phelan in regard to the amendment to the Order of Business in bringing forward the flooding debate, which is essential at the present time because flooding is a national disaster.  Each local authority was to agree a framework document by the end of September 2008, and that document was to be reappraised at the end of each following year.  What has happened to towns like Clonmel, which had previous flooding?  What happened to the appraisals?  Has the Minister taken this into account because, if he did, nothing happened and no funding was put in place to alleviate future flooding.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate with regard to public private partnerships, a request I have made before.  I heard the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government state on radio recently that he had to write a cheque for &euro;30 million for the Ringsend plant.  At the time this project was put in place, the then Minister, Deputy Cullen, said it was the bees knees of all waste water treatment units and a state of the art centre of excellence.  It did not work properly and there were problems.  Annual inflation charges are being put in place as they were agreed within the public private partnerships.  As we are in a deflationary position, what can be done about these?  We need a debate on those public private partnerships.</P>

If there could be proper management, it might help to alleviate some of the problems we have seen up and down the country for the past week or ten days.  I appeal to the Leader to arrange for that as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>We can debate what has happened but we must also look to the future.  We can do nothing about yesterday but we might be able to ensure the hardship suffered by people up and down the country as a result of these problems will not be inflicted on a future generation.  If that means walking on the toes of some of the so-called protective organisations, it will have to be done.  Will we protect our population or will we protect birds, flowers and fauna?</P>

We have seen this right across the country over the past week.  I commend the Civil Defence, the Army, the IFA, the GAA, the Garda and all the emergency services for the great work they have done.</P>
        <P>Many organisations did not see this coming but we heard on radio this morning the rainfall which fell in November, or even the past three or six months.  It is unprecedented in the previous 150 years.  As Senator Ellis, one of the longest-serving Members of the Oireachtas, has said, we must look for solutions.  I have left all day aside next Friday for colleagues to come to the House to debate the matter.</P>
        <P>I hope much will emerge over the next two or three days and that the report published at a high cost to the State in 1995 can be discussed.  That report took in three previous reports so there is much hard work, experience and expertise available in the Oireachtas Library or in electronic form.  I assured the House it would be available and I thank the librarian and all the staff for the hard work done over the weekend to make it available to us.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the many contributions that will be made next Friday.  Our hearts go out to the hundreds of displaced families who had to move to other accommodation.  The hardship and suffering that families are experiencing is unbelievable.  This is only 1 December and I hope the winter will not be as inclement as November has been.  As Senators we will do anything we can to help and as Members have said, we will need substantial EU funding.</P>
        <P>I commend the Taoiseach, his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, who visited every area as days went by.  I hope we can take on board the experience of Kilkenny, where successful work has taken place.  Much investment is needed in the area and it will take time.  We should start the work and continue with our support.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;50 million has been put in by the Government this year but in the case of Cork, for example, there were difficulties which led to 80,000 people having no running water.  These are unprecedented problems and there are new challenges which we must meet as an island nation.  The will exists on all sides of the House and substantial funding from the EU will have to be made available.</P>
        <P>All Senators expressed their concerns, shock and horror at the findings of the Murphy report, which will be debated in the House all afternoon and evening on Thursday.  If the debate must be rolled over for another week, I have no difficulty in doing so.  There will be as many debating <Col N="731"/>opportunities as is required for Members to make submissions and see what can be done.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in noting that thousands of men and women have given their lives down through the years to help in the mission fields or Ireland as priests and nuns.  However, there is never a wrong time to say the right thing.  A big wrong has been done and we are here to protect our children.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, the safeguarding of our children is paramount as far as we are concerned.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Senators Twomey, MacSharry and O&rsquo;Donohoe all expressed wishes that the talks will bear fruit and the strike will be called off on Thursday.  I join Senator MacSharry in hoping the proposed strike will be deferred, postponed or cancelled and that a solution can be found.  It is around the table that partners must agree the formula on the &euro;4 billion in savings and there is only one more week to go.  The possibility of having a strike on Thursday should not interfere with the serious work that is needed in the long term.  The issue must be tackled and efforts must bear fruit.  I hope the talks will be successful and I wish them well.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan spoke on the rights of the child.  He held a role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Constitution and excelled in that position as a Deputy.  I agree with the sentiments he has expressed and there will be a debate here in the new year, if required, on the matters he raised in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik congratulated all concerned on the opening of the Courts Service building on Parkgate Street.  It is a magnificent building and I agree fully with the Senator&rsquo;s expressions.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden, Regan and MacSharry commented on the Lisbon treaty coming into effect from today.  I congratulate our new Commissioner, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, on receiving a very senior portfolio dealing with innovation.  Mr. Barroso has said he is looking forward to her playing the leading role that Europe needs on the cutting edge, particularly with competition from India, China and other countries.  We all wish the Commissioner well.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden expressed serious concerns on the high insurance costs for the legal profession.  I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s expressions and we will keep a close eye on the matter.  I hope the closing date will be extended as the contribution by the legal professions in this country has been second to none.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey sought an urgent debate on junior doctors and I have no difficulty in having a debate on the issues outlined by him.  Senator Ann Ormonde sought a debate on binge drinking and mentioned a proposal for a national alcohol policy.  She commented on the challenges facing society, particularly those people under 18.  As I have said before I have no difficulty with it taking place, although it will not happen until after the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin sought a debate on the economy and colleagues will have a chance to discuss such issues in the House this afternoon when there will be pre-budget outlook statements.  I welcome all colleagues who have been so interested and have made such a contribution here on the economy over the years to participate in the debate this afternoon.  Senator Hanafin has already indicated he will make his contribution on the issue today.  With just eight days to go before the budget, this is an ideal opportunity to have the Minister present so Senators can make their views known before the final touches are added to the budget.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan called for a debate on the fishing industry.  I agreed to that previously as a matter of urgency, but it was postponed due to the untimely death of Senator Peter Callanan as the debate was to take place during the week of his funeral.  I will ensure we have that debate early in the next session.  Senator McFadden expressed strong views on the emergency services and the good work done by many organisations, particularly in the Athlone area.  I will pass her views on to the Minister.  I agree with most of what she said.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan welcomed the allocation and signing of the contract for speed cameras.  I am pleased it was a local Kerry company that received the contract.  I know this programme will save many thousands of lives and many people from injury.  I thank the Senator for his <Col N="732"/>kind words on my support for the speed camera programme when I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business when we were working on insurance reform.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan seeks support from the European Council with regard to funding for the flooding problem.  I have covered that issue already and agree with seeking support.  Senator Keaveney brought to our attention the huge difference in costs between rail charges in Belfast and Dublin.  I will pass her views on to the Minister for Transport.  I am sure he will be as shocked and surprised as I am by the significant difference brought to our attention by the Senator for services from Belfast to Dublin and Dublin to Belfast.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe spoke about the appointment by the Garda Commissioner of the assistant Garda commissioner to investigate the allegations made in the Murphy report.  I agree with the Senator and welcome the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke called for a debate on public private partnership.  I suggest the Senator should bring this issue to the attention of the Minister today during the budget debate.  It would be timely.</P>

    <Title>Pre-Budget Outlook: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Last month, the Department of Finance published the pre-budget outlook, which set out the economic and fiscal forecasts in advance of the budget.  It is the intention that this document will provide the platform for a debate on economic and budgetary decisions on a more fully informed basis.  Accordingly, I welcome this opportunity to set out the current and prospective economic and budgetary position.  The debate also provides an opportunity for Senators to state what they believe needs to be done to put the public finances and the economy firmly on the road to recovery.  There is widespread agreement that we must narrow the gap between income and spending by approximately &euro;4 billion next year.  Such an agreed view is a positive starting point and I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on how this can and should be achieved.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>However, before setting out Government&rsquo;s broad thinking on the public finances, I would like to outline briefly the short to medium-term economic prospects.  The past 18 months have been a period of exceptional economic difficulty.  The contraction in the construction sector, together with a severe global recession, have resulted in an unprecedented rate of economic decline this year.  GDP will decline by approximately 7.5%, GNP by even more at 10.5%.  The scale of deterioration in the global economy has been the worst in decades.  Given that our major trading partners have been badly affected, Ireland could never have expected to be immune from such a global recession.  Clearly, for an open economy such as ours which relies heavily on international trade, this highly unfavourable environment has presented enormous challenges.  Declining levels of activity have taken a heavy toll in the labour market.  This year, employment will fall by approximately 165,000 people, with the construction, retail and manufacturing sectors the worst affected.  Unemployment has increased significantly and this is the most tangible part of this recession.</P>
        <P>A reasonable degree of consensus has emerged on the short-term outlook.  The current consensus forecast is for a GDP decline of 1.1 % next year.  The pre-budget outlook anticipates that growth would return during 2010, but that for the year as a whole GDP will still contract by 1.5%.  Nevertheless, this is an improvement since the April supplementary budget forecast.  While unemployment is expected to increase into next year, recent labour market developments suggest the rate of increase in unemployment has slowed.  While the data do not make it clear whether this is due to emigration, the Government does not regard emigration as a solution to our labour market problems.  The creation and protection of jobs remains the overriding objective of Government economic policy, and all aspects of active labour market policies are required to ensure work rather than unemployment remains the norm.</P>
        <P>There are three main pillars to the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy and these were further highlighted in the pre-budget outlook: to ensure we have a properly functioning banking system capable of meeting the needs of savers and borrowers; to ensure our public finances are stabilised and put on a longer term sustainable path; and to regain our international competitiveness to be in a position to exploit the global economic recovery and to generate employment growth.  With regard to restoring our banking system, substantial time has been spent both within this House and elsewhere discussing what needs to be done.  Whatever the differences of opinion may be regarding solutions, everyone agrees that a healthy, fully operational banking system is a cornerstone of a modern economy.  Clearly, repairing this system is a fundamental requirement for economic recovery.  That is why the Government, like governments and central banks across the globe, has provided substantial support to the financial sector and the broader economy in the current crisis.  Much more work needs to be done, but we now have the basis for ensuring we develop a modern healthy banking system whose focus is to support economic activity and underpin employment, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises.</P><Col N="735"/>
        <P>The deterioration in the economy has exposed weaknesses in our public finances.  Our tax revenues have returned to 2003 levels while current spending has increased by 70% since then.  Borrowing for day-to-day spending has escalated to unsustainable levels and an Exchequer deficit of &euro;26 billion is projected for this year.  To put this enormous figure into perspective, we must borrow &euro;500 million each week to fund it.  What is striking about the figures is that the deficit has emerged not because the share of Government revenue in our economy has become disproportionately small, but because the share of Government spending has become disproportionately large.  Over the past decade, Government revenues have moved within a relatively narrow range of between 34% and 37% of GDP while the share of Government spending has increased from 36% of GDP in 2007 to a projected 45% this year.  As a country, we face the hard reality that if one continues to spend more than one earns, one must keep borrowing the difference.  If one keeps borrowing the difference, the interest bill will soon become overwhelming and all one&rsquo;s money will be spent repaying it.</P>
        <P>Everyone who subscribes to the basic tenets of responsible management knows that the current position cannot continue.  Debt service costs are rising rapidly and are absorbing a large and growing share of tax revenue.  We must halt this phenomenon and ensure it does not become ingrained.  If it does, it will greatly inhibit the Government&rsquo;s ability to provide essential public services.  It is also imperative to inspire confidence both internationally and domestically that the deterioration in the public finances is being tackled.</P>
        <P>It is also important to restore balance to Government expenditure and ensure taxation is at more sustainable levels.  As a number of commentators have remarked, the improvement in the economy over the medium term will not be sufficient to close the budgetary gap.  There is a significant underlying deficit that must be dealt with in a targeted way.  The report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the report of the Commission on Taxation will form the basis of future tax and spending policy.</P>
        <P>Our immediate priority is to stabilise the deficit at this year&rsquo;s level, which is already one of the highest in Europe.  To do so requires an adjustment of about &euro;4 billion.  Without such savings, the deficit would rise further next year.  Between now and budget day, the Government will decide how the necessary savings will be achieved.</P>
        <P>Turning to where the adjustments should come from, I would welcome the views of Senators.  However, it is important to bear in mind some key facts.  Taking account of the very significant increases that have been made to personal taxation, the marginal income tax rate is now at 52% for PAYE earners.  It is abundantly clear that the scope for further income tax increases is limited.  Moreover, the data on who funds the income tax yield tell their own story.  In overall terms, 4% of income earners contribute almost half of the income tax yield.  Furthermore, for 2010, it is estimated that around half of income earners will pay no income tax under the current regime.  While they may have some exposure to the income levy, having 50% of earners out of the tax net is no longer viable if we want to fund the range of services we expect the Government to provide.</P>
        <P>In terms of the other significant taxes &mdash; VAT and excise duties &mdash; our rates are already high by international standards.  The rate of corporation tax must be seen in terms of international markets and our ongoing ability to foster enterprise and future job creation.  Given that these four tax areas, income tax, VAT, excise duties and corporation tax, represent the vast bulk of tax revenue, there is limited capacity to raise additional revenue in the forthcoming budget.  Consequently, the immediate focus must be on expenditure reduction measures.</P>
        <P>The overall amount of gross current voted expenditure stands at almost &euro;56 billion in 2009.  Roughly one third of spending is on social welfare related matters, one third on programme expenditures and the final third on public sector pay and pensions.  Therefore, the bulk of the <Col N="736"/>adjustment, which must be on day-to-day spending, must consider each of these spending lines.  A further significant fact is that we are currently in a period of falling prices.  While a prolonged period of price decline would bring its own problems, the current short-term decline in consumer prices does have the effect of supporting real income levels.  Consequently, there is some scope to adjust public spending, including welfare expenditure, while still protecting the living standards of those most in need.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to correcting the public finances has been acknowledged by the European Commission.  In its excessive deficit report which was published recently, the Commission acknowledged the balanced approach taken and the measures that have been implemented towards reducing the deficit.  On the basis of stabilising the deficit the Commission has also proposed a one-year extension for a number of countries and in our case this will mean an extension to 2014 of the deadline to bring our deficit below the 3% of GDP threshold.</P>
        <P>This proposed extension, which will be considered by the Council of Ministers today, is welcome.  However, let there be no misunderstanding about what this implies.  An additional year to correct, while easing somewhat the adjustments required in the later years, does not change the focus of our need to stabilise our very large deficit.  If anything, it reinforces the need to continue to take effective action for 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition to restoring the banking system to health and stability to the public finances, the Government is also focused on the needs of the wider economy and in particular the promotion of favourable employment conditions.  The pre-budget outlook reiterates the requirement that we reposition our economy on a more sustainable, export-led growth path through regaining our international competitiveness.  Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness has deteriorated in recent years.  As a number of agencies such as the National Competitiveness Council have pointed out, elements of our costs are higher than those of many of our competitors.  While this has been aggravated by some factors beyond our control, such as the euro appreciation in recent months, there are measures we can take ourselves through domestic policy action to improve our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>In recent years, our labour costs have risen faster than productivity growth.  As we refocus our economy towards export-led growth, these crucial input costs become all the more important.  Therefore, reducing labour costs through some combination of nominal pay reductions and enhanced productivity must form part of the strategy to improve competitiveness.  On a positive note, our labour force continues to be highly skilled and flexible.  We have made a significant investment in education at all levels to ensure we have the skills demanded by our increasingly knowledge-intensive economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In discussions with the public sector unions, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have indicated that, in view of its share of total spending, the public service pay and pensions bill will have to contribute to the overall budgetary adjustment.  An indicative figure of &euro;1.3 billion was identified for the level of adjustment required in the pay bill for 2010.  As a Minister of State and public representative, I am in daily contact with public servants.  In some senses I have been one since 1974.  From my experience in dealing with officials from all grades and sectors of the public service, I readily acknowledge the professionalism, integrity and ability of the majority of our public servants and the important and continuing role they play in delivering essential services to our citizens.  However, the public service, no less than any other sector of the economy, must adapt to meet changing social and economic conditions.  Maintaining the <i>status quo</i> is not an option.  However, the public service has changed and adapted in the past and significant measures have already been taken in the public service since July 2008 to deal with the economic crisis.  These measures include the suspension of payment of the general round increases under the terms of Towards 2016 review and transitional agreement, the appli<Col N="737"/>cation of a general moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service, the introduction of a pension related deduction of an average of 7% from the earnings of all public servants and the implementation of incentivised early retirement and career break schemes.</P>
        <P>Despite these measures, the reality is that public service pay still accounts for about one third of all current expenditure and cannot be sustained at current levels given the severe reduction in tax revenue and other spending pressures that have arisen.  The measures introduced and under consideration by the Government to reduce the cost of the public service pay bill reflect the absolute priority to bring the public finances under control so as to provide any sort of foundation for economic recovery.  To achieve the necessary savings in public expenditure, the public sector pay bill has to make a further contribution, as indeed all other areas of public expenditure are required to do.  This will affect those employed in the public service but it is a matter not of choice but of necessity as expenditure cannot be sustained at current levels without adversely affecting economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Discussions with the unions have been ongoing for some time at both plenary and sectoral level to find an agreed basis for achieving the necessary reduction in the public sector pay bill.  Discussions have centred on identifying alternative measures to pay rate reductions to achieve the necessary saving.  These discussions reflect the Government&rsquo;s preferred option of reaching agreement with the unions on measures to effect the necessary reduction in the public sector pay bill.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that public service workers engaged in a national day of industrial action on 24 November that interrupted the availability of services to our citizens.  Industrial action will not further the interests of public sector workers, it will not change the economic realities of our current national finances and it will not create a situation where public service workers can be excluded from the contributions required from all sectors to meet an unprecedented economic crisis that will inevitably impact negatively to some extent on all our citizens.</P>
        <P>Given my ministerial responsibility for the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for flood risk assessment and major flood relief works, I could not let this occasion pass without referring to the recent flooding in the west and south which had such devastating consequences for everyone affected.  I have just been discussing these issues with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I spent the first half of the morning viewing flood damage in Carrick-on-Shannon and Leitrim.</P>
        <P>The impact would have been even more severe had it not been for the tremendous efforts of the emergency teams who have worked tirelessly.  Thanks to them, no lives have so far been lost.  We have witnessed a co-ordinated and dedicated response from all the emergency services, including local authorities, the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, the garda&iacute; and local volunteers, for which we are immensely grateful.  OPW engineering staff have provided technical and additional material back-up in many places.  While it is important to note that many of the affected areas have not experienced this scale of flooding in living memory, we must make every effort to improve our capacity to anticipate and react to such events.</P>
        <P>I have given the highest priority to progressing the OPW&rsquo;s programme of major structural flood relief schemes to reduce the flood risk in areas which already have a long history of flooding.  Several successful schemes have been completed, including those in Kilkenny, Carrick-on-Suir, the River Tolka in Dublin, Dunmanway, Gort, Cappamore, Sixmilebridge, the River Nanny, Hazelhatch, Leixlip and Newport, County Tipperary.  However, there was still some severe flooding in Gort when I walked through after midnight last Sunday week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Construction works on flood relief schemes at Mallow, Clonmel and Ennis are substantially complete.  Work has just commenced on the first phase of the flood relief scheme for Fermoy.  The OPW is also funding major schemes in Waterford and Carlow.  It has been undertaking <Col N="738"/>major works on the River Dodder in Dublin for the last three years, an area that suffered severe flooding in the past.  It also commenced works on a major scheme in Mornington, while minor works have commenced in Newcastlewest, in Mullingar and at Ballymacoda, County Cork.  In addition to those at construction stage, major schemes to deal with flooding problems in Templemore and Enniscorthy were formally placed on public exhibition earlier this year.  The design of a scheme for Tullamore is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>OPW officials are also working closely with the local authorities in Bray and Arklow to develop flood relief measures for both towns.  Yesterday, I, together with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, issued joint planning guidelines to prevent, as far as possible, aggravation of the problem by inappropriate development in flood plains.  I would add a word of caution in this respect.  Experience elsewhere has shown that while we can build up flood defences, even the best flood defences do not provide an absolute guarantee for the future that the places concerned will be protected but they should mitigate the risk and frequency of flooding.  There are many lessons that will need to be learned and many actions that will need to be undertaken in the short, medium and long term in regard to this issue which, I understand, will be debated in more detail in this House on Friday.</P>
        <P>As a country we face some extremely tough economic and fiscal challenges.  To overcome them, we must continue to pursue appropriate policies to position the economy to benefit from the global recovery.  We have already taken action but much more is needed.  To summarise, we have taken significant actions curbing expenditure and raising additional tax revenue since July 2008 to address the crisis in our public finances.  Our immediate priority is to stabilise the deficit and this we will do in the forthcoming budget.  In this regard our actions have been commended by various outside commentators and international market reaction has changed in our favour.  Bank lending must be facilitated and our actions in regard to the very difficult banking situation are taking hold and are the right decisions.  We have, through various measures, sought to promote a climate that will facilitate employment, but more must be done here in terms of restoring competitiveness.  In taking action now, we must keep our eyes set on the goal to be achieved.  Implementing difficult measures now will enable the economy to return to sustainable growth over the medium term.  This will facilitate a return to employment growth and a sustainable improvement in living standards.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware that businesses, families and almost everyone in our society are affected by the deterioration in economic conditions.  In the forthcoming budget we will bring forward policies that will ensure the burden of adjustment is spread as fairly as possible.  In anticipation of budget day, I look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  When we look towards the future, we should always cast an eye back on the past to understand why we ended up in this situation in the first place.  Lord David Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary and is a qualified doctor, wrote a book entitled <i>In Sickness and In Power</i>.  In it he examined how illness affected those in power.  He described something that can also affect a person&rsquo;s behaviour.  He discussed hubris or hubristic behaviour.  A hubristic act is one where a powerful figure puffed by an overweening pride and self-confidence starts to treat others with contempt.  Reflecting on what has happened in this country, one must ask if Fianna F&aacute;il was engaging in hubristic behaviour and is that what led to the current financial crisis.  If one considers what the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, were saying and doing, it seems that both of them engaged in a bad dose of hubristic behaviour in recent years.  One must also ask if the main party in government during that period, Fianna F&aacute;il, was engaging, collectively in hubristic behaviour.</P><Col N="739"/>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il took the credit for the success of the Celtic tiger, even though that success was by no means exclusive to Fianna F&aacute;il.  They did not share the success at the height of the Celtic tiger.  Unfortunately, they started to believe in their own spin and the whole experience seems to have gone to their heads, especially in the case of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  They moved on to a stage where they felt it necessary to treat others with contempt.  It is not that long ago that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said that anyone who talked down the economy should commit suicide, nor is it that long ago that the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, preached the teenage school of economics, namely, that when we have the money we spend it and when we do not have it, we will not spend it.  That did not help and now we are in this crisis.</P>
        <P>They developed a false confidence in their own ability and they believed they could do anything without consulting anybody.  They started to make some serious mistakes and failed to learn anything from anyone.  When Members on this side of the House made observations down the years, they were either dismissed or if they were taken up, no credit was given to anyone for them.  That is the reason the final act of hubristic behaviour is being made in a situation called the nemesis, where we are in a mess, which the Minister of State has talked of trying to get us out of.</P>
        <P>It is important we look back on history because it teaches us where we will go next.  There has been very little done by the Government to deal with this economic crisis.  The Minister of State knows that borrowing in excess of &euro;25 billion a year is no solution to the crisis.  We have to take this pain at some stage.  If Government borrowing is not controlled, in a few years we could be paying an extra &euro;8 billion to &euro;10 billion on the interest of our national debt.  The Pre-Budget Economic Outlook published in November offered some startling facts that we should examine and publicise.  One section of it states:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . when economic growth resumes it will be export-led growth, which is not as tax rich as the domestic growth of the recent past.  Consequently the expected pick-up in tax revenues based on existing policies will not bridge the significant gap that has emerged in the public finances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That needs to be emphasised.  The way we will get out of this mess is by producing jobs.  The only place a country like Ireland can produce jobs is in export-led industries.  What this document clearly points out is that even though we will have extra jobs, we will not have the massive tax revenue that was generated in the dying days of the Celtic tiger, which accrued from capital taxes.  Even, if the position improves in terms of jobs in the next few years, there will not be a massive improvement in revenue.  However, if we could address the increase in the numbers unemployed, which happened very quickly, almost like a tsunami, it would help to correct the deficit.  It is the huge loss of jobs that is contributing to the massive extra cost to the Exchequer.  If we managed to recover those 200,000 job losses, it would correct the economy in terms of the &euro;4 billion figure.  We are paying in excess of &euro;3 billion in unemployment benefit and there are additional costs such as medical cards and grants for school books and for other items given to those individuals in receipt of social welfare benefit.  Everything in the forthcoming budget must be about protecting jobs and getting people off the live register.  This is a significant issue and reference has been made to unemployment of 11% in the country.  However, in reality 20% of the workforce receives some form of benefit payment, that is, one in five of the workforce, a very substantial number of people.  The focus must be in this area.</P>
        <P>The next paragraph in the pre-budget outlook states that while taxation receipts have declined, total current expenditure has continued to increase, a point made by the Minister of State already.  Taxation is now back at 2003 levels but Government spending is 70% above that level.</P><Col N="740"/>
        <P>The next table in the pre-budget outlook, table 5, shows the source of the benefits during the growth of the Celtic tiger.  There was an increase in the number of people working in public services such as education, the health services and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na among others.  We do not wish to lose these gains but if we do, student-teacher ratios will increase, access to hospital care and health care in our community will disappear and there will be fewer garda&iacute; on the streets again.  There is a fine line to be walked for the Minister.  However, these issues must be made clear to the unions in the discussions and it must be made clear how important it is to control expenditure.  We must not lose the gains made.</P>
        <P>At issue is a reduction in the costs of the public service and the Minister must be as open as possible, not only with public sector unions but with the people such that they can understand what is taking place.  We are spending &euro;58 billion per year.  Even according to the Government forecasts, growth will not improve very dramatically in the coming years and when it does, there will be no great increase in tax revenue.  The problem we face will not go away very quickly and we must acknowledge this.  It is important the union leadership understands the situation, although I cannot believe that Jack O&rsquo;Connor or David Begg are any less the wiser about the matters to which I have referred than the Minister or myself.  They have access to the same information and they must understand the seriousness of the crisis.</P>
        <P>There has been talk of resisting pay cuts and taxing the mythical wealthy people.  It is somewhat mythical to talk of such wealthy people and even if some do exist, there is not a sufficient number to make a difference to the crisis in which we find ourselves.  It is important that the union leadership face up to this and speak to their members in this way.  They must not psyche up their members as if something will be different because the deficit is too great.  If the union leadership continues to talk as it has done, it is no different from Deputy Bertie Ahern or Mr. Charlie McCreevy in suffering from hubris.  They must know in their hearts that things have changed.  We cannot afford to let public debt increase at the level it continues to increase.</P>
        <P>I recall the pre-budget debate in the D&aacute;il in December 2006.  My counterpart at the time was the then Minister of State, Mr. Tom Parlon.  His arrogance and hubris had gone out of control.  He was in the position currently occupied by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Fortunately, the Minister of State does not suffer from the same sense of arrogance.  At the time growth in our economy was of the amount of &euro;15 billion per annum.  That growth, about which everyone was boasting, was exactly the same as the amount the ordinary man and woman in the country was borrowing at the time.  Growth was exactly the same as borrowing.  How did this change matters?  In 2000 for every &euro;100 of income earned by ordinary men and women, there was personal debt of &euro;60.  By 2007, for every &euro;100 of income, such people were &euro;140 in debt.  Personal debt more than doubled within the country during that period.  Worse, most of that debt was property related.</P>
        <P>Having explained these figures, I asked the former Minister of State, Mr. Parlon, what would happen when we reached the point where we could borrow no more or if something bad happened the economy.  He stated that it was a matter of buoyancy and confidence in the economy and that the people would make their own choices, a point he repeatedly made.  He never once considered there was a need to express any concern with regard to this issue.  Hubris was alive and kicking in the form of the former Minister of State, Mr. Parlon.  It is galling for the people because Mr. Parlon has moved on to his &euro;350,000 job with the Construction Industry Federation.  He is calling for taxpayers to support his members, the very people who led us into this mess in the first place.  Those who would make their own choices and who should have <Col N="741"/>been on their knees blessing themselves for the great Government in place according to Mr. Parlon are now in negative equity, provided they have managed to hold on to their jobs and homes.  It is a sad state of affairs in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>The issue of where we go from here is equally important.  If next week&rsquo;s budget involves taking tough decisions we must explain why.  If we pay &euro;8 billion in interest, there will be a remarkable impact on public spending.  In 2007, a bad year, some 5% of tax revenue was used to pay interest.  These figures are contained in the pre-budget outlook.  The forecast for next year predicts 15% of tax revenue will be used to pay interest on the national debt.  This is despite the acknowledgment from the Minister that we will borrow &euro;25 billion, not only this year and next year but beyond then.  We could reach a stage at which 25 cent or more of every euro in tax revenue may be used to pay interest on the national debt rather than the principal borrowed.  What will happen when we try to correct our competitiveness while there is low growth and while the national debt is increasing at an incredible rate?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should begin the habit of using gross national product when trying to explain the seriousness of the situation.  Gross domestic product takes into account the repatriated profits of multinationals.  Such moneys have little or no impact on the present or future in the country.  The Minister of State should use gross national product as a measure to highlight the seriousness of the situation.  This would show the people that public sector spending is reaching close to 50% of gross national product every year.</P>
        <P>If these developments come to pass in the coming years, including an explosion in the interest bill on the national debt, there will be no money for pensioners, sick children, for the development of hospitals or for public sector pensions.  No one, including those in public sector, should be marked out as responsible or as having a special role to play in sorting out these problems.  This is a collective problem involving all of us.  We must discuss the problems in a rational matter to highlight the seriousness of the crisis.  If we do not correct the public finances in the coming years, the country will be in an even greater mess than it was during the 1980s.  In the 1980s the country was in debt to the extent of 150% of GNP, but most of that debt was the responsibility of the State.  Now, personal debt is approximately 75% of GNP and State debt is in excess of 100% of GNP and it does not appear to be coming under control.  The pain and misery will be great for everyone, not only public servants, but especially for those requiring public services.  Those who require public services include children in school and hospitals and elderly people who rely on the old age pension.  All of these individuals require that we make the correct decisions in protecting as many existing public services as possible and developing those that will be delivered in 2016 or 2020, which is not that far away.  It is sad that we ended up in the position in which we find ourselves so quickly, particularly when we had been doing so well for so long.  Even though I am not suggesting tax or other increases, I do suggest our focus should be on jobs.  The only way we will extricate ourselves from the mess we are in will be by creating new jobs and protecting existing ones.  We must not waste money on something that sounds good.  The focus of the next two budgets must be on creating jobs and restoring competitiveness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I also welcome his predecessor, Mr. Parlon, who is in the Visitors Gallery.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few points on the forthcoming budget.  As has become customary, I must commence by making a basic rebuttal of what Senator Twomey stated.  He always frames his contributions on matters of this nature by stating we got the country into the mess in which it finds itself and that it is important to learn the lessons of the past.  To an extent, I agree with him.  Many of the gains made since 1987 can and will be made secure as we look to the future.  Any objective analysis of what has happened in the past 20 <Col N="742"/>years or so must take account of and acknowledge the fact that as exports began to decline from the mid-1990s onwards, they were replaced by a tax base that was fed by transaction-based taxes such as stamp duty etc.  As everyone now knows, such a position was not sustainable.  If, however, we are to engage in an objective analysis, it must also be stated any manifesto produced by Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in or an Independent Member during the period in question would have advocated higher levels of expenditure across various departmental Votes.</P>
        <P>There is no question that the world is a very different place.  There is also no question but that mistakes were made.  Senator Twomey has referred to those who predicted what would happen and used the ancient Greek word &ldquo;hubris&rdquo; &mdash; which relates to someone who is arrogant or presumptuous &mdash; when talking about the actions of previous Governments.  It would be presumptuous of the Senator to state that had Fine Gael been in power, it would have done things differently.  The reality is that a stopped clock is right twice a day.  As much as anyone else, in its election manifestos Fine Gael argued for increased expenditure, rates of pay etc.  It is arrogant and presumptuous to state matters would have been different if any other party had been in power.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey referred to the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, who held the view that if the resources were available, they should be made available.  Had we known what might occur, there is no question but that this approach and the expenditure and plans relating to it would have been adjusted accordingly.  Circumstances have changed and, like any responsible regime, the Government has changed its mind and is trying to implement the policies that are necessary in order to allow us to meet the challenges we face.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to suggest a number of items I would like to be included in the budget.  I am not stating they will form part of the budget.  We can have the debate after 9 December on what we think of the budget.</P>
        <P>It is important that people remain positive, optimistic, constructive and realistic.  Some &euro;56 billion is being spent, while, relative to this, very little is coming in.  There is no question but that serious action must be taken.  We are all aware of the difficult challenges and the need to make an adjustment of &euro;4 billion in the forthcoming budget.  Decisions that will have a severe impact on every household will have to be taken.  As the Minister of State indicated, we must try to spread the pain and difficulties that will be forced upon those households as fairly as possible.  We must also do everything possible to ensure those who are most vulnerable and least well off will be protected to the fullest extent possible.</P>
        <P>When introducing the pre-budget outlook in the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, indicated that the scope for increases in taxes was minimal and that reductions in expenditure would be the priority on this occasion.  According to Davy Stockbrokers, the budget&rsquo;s only real job will be to outline the split of the &euro;4 billion package to which I refer, not to alter its absolute size, on either side.  Davy Stockbrokers also stated a fiscal consolidation focused on expenditure would be more successful and boost competitiveness.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State indicated, the aim in the budget will be to stabilise the public finances and reduce the budget deficit back below the European Union&rsquo;s 3% limit by 2014 in order to ensure we regain international competitiveness.  While I agree with Senator Twomey that it is vital that there should be a correction of expenditure and that the tax base should be broadened, it is also important that we do everything possible to restore our competitiveness.  It was not, as Professor Colm McCarthy noted, just the cutbacks and reductions in various expenditure streams in the 1980s which led to the high growth rates of the 1990s, it was also the increases in revenue that occurred.  There are many differences between Ireland&rsquo;s position <Col N="743"/>now and in the 1980s when we had our own currency, could reduce interest rates and benefited from transfers from the European Union.  Currently, there are fewer such transfers, Ireland is part of the single currency and we no longer have full control over interest rates.  I do, however, agree with Senator Twomey on the need to restore competitiveness.</P>
        <P>It is predicted that the economy will contract by 1.5% next year.  This will occur in the aftermath of a 7.5% decline this year.  Annual growth is expected to turn positive in the second half of 2010, but this may not occur until 2011.  As the Minister of State indicated, the rate of unemployment is expected to peak next year at approximately 13.75%.  If corrective action is taken now in order to stabilise the deficit, it is expected the general Government balance in 2010 will be minus 14% of GDP.  Ireland&rsquo;s income is approximately equivalent to that obtained in 2003 through tax revenue, while its expenses have increased by 70% in the interim.  In other words, we are spending in the order of &euro;22 billion more per annum than we are generating in tax revenues.</P>
        <P>On a previous occasion Senator Quinn inquired whether, if it arose, we would embrace the opportunity to return to our lifestyles of 2003.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Of course we would do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The vast majority would do so.  Many people have lost their jobs in recent times and we must bear in mind the prospect highlighted by Senator Quinn when contemplating the difficulties we will be obliged to face with the budget for this and succeeding years.  Two to three budgets will be required in order to rectify the situation.  While it is estimated that adjustments of &euro;4 billion will be required in each of the next three budgets, I hope current income and revenue levels will hold in order that we will not be obliged to make even greater cuts.</P>
        <P>As the pre-budget outlook states, &ldquo;Evidence from international organisations, such as the IMF, EU Commission and the OECD, suggests that consolidation driven by cuts in expenditure is more successful in reducing deficits than consolidation based on tax increases&rdquo;.  However, a broadening of the tax base will be necessary because we have a high level of services and, compared to other nations, a low level of taxation.  The latter must change.  For credibility purposes, and acknowledging the great efforts and progress made in Government Buildings in the partnership negotiations, it would be just to have a higher tax rate for earnings over a certain amount, whether that is &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
        <P>If we went through the 226 individuals in the Oireachtas we would not get consensus on the various bodies or services to be cut as envisaged in the McCarthy report.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that some of its suggestions appeared ridiculous and I concur with that.  However, many of these measures will have to be introduced.  I hope we can get on with it, that they are as fair as possible and that over the next two years we achieve very substantial savings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1977, a disservice was done to the country by the abolition of domestic rates.  While it was introduced by a former member of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party, Mr. Martin O&rsquo;Donoghue, with the benefit of hindsight it was a mistake, not that one could envisage the reintroduction of a domestic rate as it would be political suicide for anybody to advocate it, but we need to focus on local government funding.  If a charge similar to a domestic rate, a property tax or that which is in Newry in Northern Ireland was introduced it would mean that Sligo Borough Council, instead of having to beg centralised funding for a project, would generate funds of its own of between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million.  With that type of income the relatively small urban area of Sligo Borough Council would be able to undertake its own capital projects for bridges or roads and there is merit in this.  While I do not believe it will feature in this budget, we must consider it.  I do not mean introducing it through broad brush strokes <Col N="744"/>across the board but through a community or property tax which would be just, with an appropriate waiver scheme whereby those most vulnerable and less well-off would not have to pay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years there have been huge increases in the level of social welfare payments, with pensions increasing from &euro;113 to &euro;230.  I do not advocate any cut in the old age pension and I hope other measures can be found.  Equally, I do not advocate a cut in jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments for those who are long-term unemployed.  As somebody who is employed I would happily be prepared to pay more to ensure those people can maintain the levels they are at.  Having said that, and as a recipient with two children of child benefit, we should examine taxing or means testing child benefit.  There is scope for doing so, particularly if one considers that people earning hundreds of thousands of euro per year can perhaps survive quite easily without these payments.  That is an area where savings could be made.</P>
        <P>I want to mention a very good suggestion for a social welfare chip and pin system, which I have forwarded to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I do not have time to discuss it in detail.  It was envisaged by Phelim O&rsquo;Neill, a solicitor and businessperson from the west of Ireland.  It is a very detailed proposal on how substantial savings could be made through a chip and pin system.  People already have a social welfare card and they would receive their benefits through credits on that card which could be used in the State.  There are vast benefits to this and merit in considering it.  I hope the Ministers have the opportunity to do so in a meaningful way.</P>
        <P>On previous occasions, I discussed an entrepreneurship education strategy for Ireland.  With regard to public pensions, I hope the social partners and those negotiating in Government Buildings make the further progress they need throughout this evening to ensure the strike on Thursday can be averted.  If we are to tackle this crisis it is vital that we move forward together as a nation rather than stacked against one another as programmes such as &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; would like, with the public sector set against the private sector, to which I am fundamentally opposed.  The successes of the 1990s were achieved in partnership and if we are to get out of the difficulties we are in it is vital that we do so now.</P>
        <P>In the north west in particular, and in the six Border counties, the State is haemorrhaging financial revenue, which is going across the Border.  This needs to be examined urgently and I go so far as to suggest a special VAT rate for businesses selling in those six counties.  At least it would ensure that the revenue stays in the country.  A vast amount of money is leaving the country.  I do not blame families for seeking better value for money; I fully understand they need to do so in these difficult days.  We must help them and the quickest way to do so would be to introduce such a VAT rate in the Border counties as a temporary measure for four or six months.  We would see an increase in revenue for the State.  Her Majesty would do little to support employment in this jurisdiction and we should do more to prevent facilitating revenue going to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government at present.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken many steps over the past year and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, mentioned several of them.  These include the establishment of NAMA, labour market activation measures, the back to education allowance, the work placement scheme, the employment subsidy scheme &mdash; I do not agree it should be limited to certain sectors because if somebody is prepared or can save a job through the employment subsidy scheme he or she should be able to do so &mdash; and other measures introduced in the supplementary budget in April.  Many unpalatable and difficult decisions had to be taken.  Nobody sets out to introduce such measures or wishes to do so.  However, they are necessary.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for his work and to the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who has displayed an unbelievable and unprecedented level of com<Col N="745"/>petence in coming to terms with a brief that at no time in the history of the world was as complex as it is, with financial services, the banks and the world crisis in which we find ourselves.  That was acknowledged by the IMF, the ECB, the OECD, former Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, former leader of Fine Gael, Alan Dukes and other commentators.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I saw that he enjoyed the tributes to his modesty as compared with his predecessor.  I am not the slightest bit interested in political point-scoring by parties.  As an ordinary citizen, taxpayer and Member of this House I say a pox on both your houses.  I am not really bothered.  It is a matter for a further day to have a historical review to see where things went wrong.  Now we are faced with a crisis, the dimensions of which have been laid out very clearly by the Minister of State.  The figures are shocking; &euro;500 million a week to be borrowed and we will be lucky to have a decline of 1.1% in our domestic product next year.  These are horrifying figures.  It is right that they should be front-loaded.  I agree with the Minister of State that we have to restore our banking system but must we revert to the same kind of system?  I am referring to the structure of the system as well as the personnel involved.  I accept that we need a good banking system but what does that entail?  Investors should believe their investments are safe and credit should be made available for business but that has not been the case in the recent past.  I am deeply concerned about NAMA.  I do not intend to show malice towards the Government because we were all enmeshed in this but I suspect the sums may be wrong.  Recent news reports indicate an additional &euro;1 billion in banking deficits.  Banks are having to defer interest payments on bonds, including those now due.  The signs are poor, which is why we need a positive review of the situation.  </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This morning I attended a business breakfast meeting which was addressed by the chairman of Aer Lingus, Mr. Barrington, a very charming man.  We must be careful not to cause further damage.  I have been contacted by Aer Lingus employees about their pensions.  We are in danger of doing another Irish Ferries job, given that the airline is transferring its assets to a new company registered in the United Kingdom.  We may find that all the pilots of our national airlines are hired on lower wages from eastern Europe.  I do not think that would be good for the economy.  Perhaps the events which led to the closure of SR Technics are now a matter of history.</P>
        <P>I have to laugh at Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s remarks on the North of Ireland.  I recall the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s call for patriotism during last year&rsquo;s budget debate.  We have not seen much patriotism from the banks.  People would not demean themselves to take &euro;500,000, while the little people pay tax, as that horrible American woman said.  There was not much patriotism among the people who headed across the Border while they were supposed to be on strike but the Government led us to this situation.  I questioned the sense of increasing the rate of VAT by 2.5% on the day that it was lowered by the same amount in the United Kingdom.  That was a daft decision in the light of the land border between our jurisdictions.  As a result of allowing <Col N="746"/>property speculators to impose upward rent reviews only, Grafton Street became the most expensive street in the world.  Add the increase in rates and one strikes three hammer blows against the capital and other towns.  If the haemorrhaging to the North continues, a further 17,000 jobs will be lost.</P>
        <P>I agree with the proposed suspension of the general round of increases and would be the first to volunteer a 20% pay cut but such gestures are useless if they are from individuals rather than across the board.  I can afford a pay cut but that will not make the slightest difference unless those who can afford it contribute most.  Similarly, I acknowledge the need for a ban on recruitment but advise the Minister of State that sensitivity is needed.  In the past programmes which had been given permission to hire staff before being axed by previous bans on recruitment resulted in undelivered services and a couple of old freaks who were stored somewhere and paid out of taxpayers&rsquo; money to do nothing.</P>
        <P>The 7% reduction in regard to pension arrangements and the incentivised early retirement scheme is fine but, again, the implementation of these proposals must be nuanced.  We have already seen in the case of the Garda that the most senior officers got out quickly because they were afraid that in the budget their lump sum payments would be whacked.  In several Departments early retirements compounded the lunacy of decentralisation.  I understand many of the staff in the Department of Transport who have transport expertise have gone or are going.  I hope the excellent personnel who continue to work in that Department do not leave because it is important to press ahead with the metro project.</P>
        <P>The development of a private hospital in Sligo represents yet another drain on taxes.  However, the real Scrooge cut was to the Christmas bonus.  We would all give up 20% if the Government were to restore it.  Last year I attended an excellent briefing by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at which the suggestion was made that the fuel allowance be front-loaded.  It is idiotic to stagger it over several months because recipients have to pay up-front for oil and other heating fuels.  Women are particularly disadvantaged because their lower wages mean they have lower savings.  MABS needs additional funding because it has insufficient staff to provide its services which are absolutely necessary.</P>
        <P>I am in favour of a windfall tax on property development but again I ask the Minister of State to ensure the proposal is nuanced.  I am sure he is familiar with Westport House which may be facing bankruptcy.  I will forward to him the letter I received from Jeremy Browne on the matter.</P>
        <P>For God&rsquo;s sake, let there be no further cuts to overseas aid.  The Government should restore us to our proper position of heading towards the figure of 0.7% of GDP.  The decline means we will continue to reduce spending, even if we leave the target intact.  Will the Minister of State raise with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the urgent necessity of cutting all intergovernmental aid to Uganda in the light of the introduction in that country of the death penalty for homosexual activities?  I do not think any Member of the House, no matter how extremely reactionary his or her views may be, would welcome such a development.</P>
        <P>The scrappage scheme proposal is interesting but the Government should be careful.  A similar scheme in the United States led to a environmentally unhealthy bulge.  Why not increase tax on petrol?  That would address the principle of the polluter pays.  We need these cuts and people like me are prepared to take whatever medicine is doled out because we are lucky enough to afford it.  However, we must protect the vulnerable and be nuanced in our approach in order that budgets do not conspire to destroy the system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and was interested to listen to his contribution.  We have a crisis on our hands.  Our immediate priority is to stabilise the deficit <Col N="747"/>at this year&rsquo;s level which is already one of the highest in Europe.  However, this stabilisation which will require an adjustment of &euro;4 billion is not nearly enough.  We should be cutting &euro;8 billion.  </P>
        <P>I have a problem with the urgency with which the issue is being addressed.  Last week Fitch Ratings downgraded Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating.  It also downgraded the rating for Spain which had a similar problem and cut its level of public expenditure by 12% to 15%.  The Danish deficit figure is seven points better than ours and people there have accepted 20% cuts.  The IMF forced Latvia, Hungary and Estonia to cut by as much as 30%.  What would happen if this was a business rather than a government?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Government buy a used car from any company, the rating for which has been downgraded by every agency in the world?  We owe so much money that we have to borrow &euro;500 million a week, as Senator Norris reminded us.  No company could survive in that way.  What would a CEO do?  He or she would tell the stakeholders, his or her customers, staff and suppliers that the company faced a real challenge, that it would not be enough just to tick over, that the company would have to do something much more urgent to get back to where it was.  It is easy to say, please, do not hurt the vulnerable and the others.</P>
        <P>Last week I asked Mr. Colm McCarthy at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service what would happen if we really had to take cuts that brought us back to the standard of living we enjoyed in 1999.  He said we would not have to go back that far &mdash; just to 2003.  I can recall what happened in 1999 well and in 2003 even better.  Our standard of living then was quite good.  To those who ask the Minister not to touch the vulnerable, the old age pension, children&rsquo;s and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowances or the Christmas bonus I say we have to do this to get back to where we were in 2003.  It sounds disastrous and people ask that these benefits not be touched.</P>
        <P>The Forf&aacute;s report, The Cost of Doing Business in Ireland in 2009, contains the answer to our competitiveness problem.  It will not be solved by moving the four Border counties south.  We have to become more competitive.  We must get our costs down and must find a way to do this, which means taking difficult decisions.  If these decisions returned us to the standard of living we enjoyed and our way of life six years ago, we could put up with this.  I went to Dundalk when a store was closing and asked the people working there where they would get jobs.  They said they were not sure.  When I said they would probably have to go to Newry, only a 15 minute journey from Dundalk, they told me the rate of pay there was only one third of what they were earning.  How can we manage to compete on the world market in that way?</P>
        <P>I spoke on Radio Ulster last week.  The presenter of the programme spoke about the fact that so many people from here were travelling north and asked about the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and other rates of pay and commented that our public service was not finding it easy to take cuts in pay.  He said we talked about people earning &euro;50,000 as being poor.  In Northern Ireland &pound;50,000 or &euro;50,000 would provide a very high standard of living compared with the standard here.  We must take steps to get our cost of living down and bring down the cost of doing business.  It is not enough to take &euro;4 billion out of the economy this year, we must take &euro;8 billion.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry talked about what had happened 20 years ago.  Between 1987 and 1989 we took very tough decisions that got us back on track very quickly.  We were not afraid to take them.  There was strong leadership at that stage and it was said we would not succeed by spreading the cuts over many years but by doing so in a much shorter period.  Within ten years we had doubled the number of people working in Ireland.  We got the economy right within <Col N="748"/>three years.  We must do something like that, which involves leadership by the Government.  It needs a Government that states, &ldquo;We can do this,&rdquo; very much like President Obama who said, &ldquo;Yes, we can.&rdquo;  We can do it.  Let us make sure we stop dithering, that we stop dodging the issue and that we grab hold of and take some tough medicine.  That would put us back only to the standard of living we enjoyed six years ago.  If we were to put up with this for a couple of years, we would be back where we were.  We will not do this unless we become competitive and are willing to take the tough medicine.  It is easier to take the tough medicine now than to say we will spread it over six years.  If we are unwilling to take that medicine now, it will be spread out and we will not get on top of the economy.  Let us go back to President Obama&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;Yes, we can.&rdquo;  We can do it, but we must be determined to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The pre-budget position is ominous and requires difficult decisions to be made not only by the Government but also by the political system.  Our room for manouevre is painfully small and we are led by circumstances not entirely within our control.  We may not be doing this to the same extent as other countries.  However, we have some advantages such as a high level of exports.  We have also managed to keep Government borrowing within European averages.  Even after this year, we will rate high as a country with a high level of wealth and an average level of borrowing.  We will be in a better position than most other European countries.  However, we cannot continue to borrow &euro;500 million a week.  We must show due cause to those from whom we borrow that not only do we have the capacity to repay but that we will not rely on continued borrowing.  The gap of over &euro;20 billion or &euro;22 billion must be closed.  The political debate is on the question of whether it should be closed over a short or long period.  The agreement we sought from the European Commission allowed us to do so until 2013 but that has been extended to 2014 because already this year we have seen a shortfall in taxes of &euro;2 billion.</P>
        <P>We must remove &euro;4 billion from the budget on 9 December.  The implications of this, even if it is not what other countries are doing, are severe.  That is more than we have done in any budget in any given year.  It involves making decisions that would seem unpalatable at all other times.  Our choices are stark &mdash; we can reduce public expenditure, as the Minister for Finance has indicated.  If we bring in only &euro;32 billion and spend approximately &euro;50 billion, we must consider our expenditure.  We need to reduce capital expenditure, which is high in European terms but we need to maintain it at a level that will allow us to continue to develop infrastructure and be competitive.  We need to measure our level of public expenditure against that of our competitor neighbours.</P>
        <P>A relative of mine works as a personal assistant to the registrar of a British university.  Their salary is &pound;18,000.  The equivalent salary here would be twice that amount, even in sterling terms.  We have deluded ourselves in recent years.  We have inflated wages and, consequently, our cost of living, beyond a level we can sustain.  The effect of the budget on 9 December will be to introduce an air of realism into the economy.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance and the Government face the challenge of sharing it out in a proportionate way.  We all know the consequences of the 1927 budget in which Ernest Blythe reduced the old age pension by a shilling.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>People think of the value of a shilling in today&rsquo;s terms, but a shilling represented 10% of the old age pension at the time.  We cannot imagine the Government coming up with a proposal to slash social welfare payments by 10%, especially pension payments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 16%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is even higher again.  Very difficult decisions will have to be made.  The Minister has said that his room for manoeuvre on tax rates is very small.  We increased taxes in the April budget, especially through the levy system, and this has improved the effective rate of taxation paid by higher earners and the level of money paid through income tax.  Our scope might not be as large this year, but I believe that on 9 December, the Minister for Finance must refer repeatedly to the report of the Commission on Taxation.  We are not just talking about bringing in additional money through taxation.  We must bring about tax reform.  There is much fat in the current tax system in instruments such as tax reliefs, tails in tax reliefs that have already been ended, the tax residency rules and what are prosaically known as horizontal measures, where people on higher incomes from &euro;250,000 and &euro;500,000 have an effective tax rate of 13.6%.  We have to be seen on budget day to be sharing the burden most proportionately.  If there are no figures to show that the tax take among those income groups has changed radically, then we will have failed as a Government.  We will set a bad precedent in our efforts to improve the economy.</P>
        <P>We also have to address the question of public sector pay and numbers.  Initially the McCarthy report was derided politically.  Taken as a whole, many of its recommendations are practical and should be introduced quickly.  It refers to getting rid of bodies that do not seem to have any practical purpose, amalgamating bodies that could work more effectively together, and to practices within public sector spending that could help reduce costs.  Nonetheless, part of the argument on public sector reform has resulted in an unnecessary confrontational attitude to those who work in the public sector.  We are fortunate with the quality of the people we have in the public sector.  It happens to be a sad fact that in terms of public expenditure, most of the Government&rsquo;s resources goes into this area.  It needs to be examined critically.  While I wish those involved in the talks every success in coming up with a formula that addresses the cost of the public service, I would not be that impressed with a deal that is structured around unpaid leave alone.  The overall package must include less being paid and fewer people working.  Otherwise there will not be jobs in the short term.  We are talking about measures that will bring about a change in people&rsquo;s individual circumstances and which will bring down the standard of living to what it was five or six years ago.</P>
        <P>As the Minister rises on 9 December and we get to talk about his proposals, I hope we in this Chamber will address the reality of what is ahead of us, not only this year but in the next three to four years.  I do not believe that any change of Government would result in addressing these problems differently because our room for manoeuvre is pitifully small.  Given the scale of the problem we are facing, the actions necessary and the need for honesty with the people, there should be a greater degree of consistency among all politicians about the nature of that problem.  If there are those who continue to say that if we tax differently, cut differently, and pretend that everyone can be kept happy in the aftermath of 9 December, then I do not think that is being honest with the people.</P>
        <P>To be successful, the budget must do more than meet the broad economic parameters.  In philosophical terms, it has to be a budget that nobody is happy with.  It must be a budget of such consequence that everybody will look at it aghast and realise the nature of the problem we are facing and recognise that if we do not take actions of this type, we are not going to recover in time and to the extent we can given the potential we have shown in recent years.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s debate is important in setting out the decisions we need to take, but I would also like to hear the extent to which politicians collectively are prepared to address the people about the nature of the problems we face and how we can deal with them in the immediate future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one reason for a change of Government, and it is related to credibility.  We have a deficit that is the most serious in our lifetimes.  Historically, it ranks very high on the list of economic crises anywhere in the world.  We have seen one of the biggest collapses of a country anywhere on record.  However, people accept that there are two components to our deficit.  There is a structural element to it and a cyclical element to it.  I regard the structural element of our deficit as being the Fianna F&aacute;il element.  The reason there should be a change of Government is not so much that a new Government would not have to find &euro;4 billion on 9 December, because we in the Labour Party accept that we have been brought to a situation where that is necessary.  We regrettably accept that we must take &euro;4 billion out of the economy this December, and more in the future.</P>
        <P>However, I disagree with a point that was made by Senator Quinn and Senator Boyle.  When we measure the success of a budget, it should not be about how painful that budget can be.  That is a complete abrogation of our role and of the requirement that is on politicians.  Are people suffering enough?  I can assure Senator Boyle that people already know that this budget will be an unhappy event.  It is ludicrous to suggest the measure of our sense of achievement will be in how unhappy people are after the budget and that there will be success if they are screaming, unhappy and annoyed.  What a poverty of imagination that betrays on the part a politician to suggest that this should be the case.  I accept that the budget will be painful, but that should not be a measure of its success.</P>
        <P>We need a broader sense of bringing the community together with what needs to be done.  That will require political leadership beyond accountancy economics, which is what we have now.  We regrettably have to subscribe to that accountancy economics because we can see the reality of what is facing us in the next few weeks.  However, we have a much broader vision that is lacking in this Government.  The problem with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s point on a change of Government is that the people do not believe this Government has any credibility, especially the main Fianna F&aacute;il component.  They are simply not believed or trusted.  All the former Taoiseach&rsquo;s talk this morning about growing bluebells is an example of how deluded both he and the members of his party are about how they are seen by the people.  They are not regarded as people with any credibility because they have largely brought us to where we are.  If there was no other reason for a change of Government, that is one.  Nobody can get away from that reality.</P>
        <P>The situation has been described by other colleagues and there is no point in my taking up the short time I have describing how bad things are because we know how bad they are.  The serious situation facing us is perhaps best expressed by the unemployment situation.  We are now looking at 40% unemployment among people aged 15 to 19 years and 30% among those aged 20 to 24 years.  It is no good for the Minister to say the increase has slowed down.  As we will see when the figures are released, the increase has slowed down in considerable measure because of the return of emigration, which it is clear and documented is beginning to happen.</P>
        <P>The problem I have with the whole approach of the Government is not that it and its advisers in the public service are sitting down to come up with the measures they need in the next few weeks.  It is that I cannot believe for one moment that it would be possible or desirable to take any more than &euro;4 billion out of the economy.  I respectfully cannot understand how Senator Quinn or anyone else could conceivably justify how the economy would even survive losing more than &euro;4 billion on 9 December.  Even the Government does not believe it could survive a bigger whack than &euro;4 billion.  The situation that more could be taken out is fanciful, not in <Col N="751"/>the sense that one cannot actually do the sums and subtract &euro;8 billion but because of the impact it will have on people&rsquo;s lives, on public services &mdash; the real, everyday services that people need &mdash; and on the overall future prospects of the economy.  Such a deflationary act would be a seriously retrograde step.</P>
        <P>My problem with the Government&rsquo;s approach is not so much that it will do the sums and the subtraction but that there is no vision for anything else.  Where is the jobs strategy?  Where is the strategy to face the future in terms of turning the economy around?  The Minister of State in his speech listed three priorities for Government policy, first, the banking system, second, to ensure the public finances are stabilised, with which I absolutely agree, in case I am misunderstood, and, third, to regain our international competitiveness so as to be in a position to exploit the global economic recovery and to generate employment growth.  However, what is the Government doing about any of these things?  It is not enough for a sovereign government to say it will take action to position itself so it can take advantage of changes that happen in other countries and elsewhere.  We should be agents of our own futures and take steps and have policies that will ensure we can restore confidence in the economy through job creation strategies including &mdash; this is where I would agree with many of the points made by Senator Quinn &mdash; genuinely targeted assistance to enterprise, small business and people with ideas and those who want to take risks.  That should absolutely be part of our turning around what has happened, and it is the sort of thing I want to hear from the Government.</P>
        <P>It is lamentable that Government policy is reduced to those three items.  This is not because any of those items is wrong.  I agree that each one of them is necessary.  However, they are far from sufficient, which is the problem with Government policy.  It is doing plenty of things that are necessary but it is not doing anything like enough of what is required to turn things around.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s contribution was interesting and thoughtful in regard to a number of issues, most strikingly in regard to taxation.  If I understood him correctly, he thought there was a strong case to be made for a higher rate of tax for those earning in excess of, say, &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000.  In that, he is reflecting a view taken by Mr. Ray MacSharry, who is not unrelated to him.  I agree with that view and my party has advanced that proposal, not, as we are often accused, because we take pleasure in taxing people, but because we have to face the fact that one of the legacies of the past ten years is that we have introduced some progressive new public services that we all support.  I do not say the Government has not done good things, whether in regard to special needs assistants, improving infrastructure or the new child care system which is being introduced.  All of these things are important and any society or country wants to have those kinds of services.  However, what I lay particularly at the door of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in Government, as well as the vanished Progressive Democrats, is that they sought to persuade people that these services could be funded permanently from the kind of temporary taxes we saw being levied through the property bubble.</P>
        <P>We cannot have world class public services without a taxation system to sustain them.  The figures just do not add up.  I am not in the camp referred to by Senator Boyle, namely, trying to persuade people that everything can be fine and we can have great public services without the answer to the question as to how we are going fund them.  We did not make long-term provision in the last ten to 12 years for those public services and the advances that were being introduced.  Now, we are left with a situation where we are asking ourselves whether we have to remove these services or whether we must consider, at least in part, what contribution a reform of the taxation system can bring, including an increase in some areas of taxation.</P>
        <P>The figures show that we are one of the most under-taxed economies in the world, certainly in the OECD, which has been documented repeatedly.  The Government was very happy to welcome the support of Dr. Garret FitzGerald for the NAMA project.  I disagreed with Dr. <Col N="752"/>FitzGerald on that but perhaps the Government will also agree with him on his comments in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 7 November last, which is a very clear statement of the position.  He said: &ldquo;[W]hat I find absolutely unacceptable is that because of what seems to be universal cowardice about the need to tackle our unsustainably low level of income taxation &ndash; in most cases at a level which no other developed country in the world would ever even contemplate &ndash; we are currently prepared to tolerate cuts in our health services that threaten the lives of our people, including in particular our children, as well as some cuts that will weaken our already grossly under-funded education system.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>With regard to the trade unions, I respectfully disagree with what I understood my good colleague Senator Twomey to suggest earlier, namely, that there was a sense in which trade union leaders were acting in a perhaps somewhat less than responsible manner, or that they were psyching up their members, as it were,  into thinking life could be otherwise than it is.  I do not believe that is the case.  I do not believe the trade union leaders are doing anything other than giving, as best they can, genuine leadership to their members.  They are in an extremely difficult situation and I certainly do not believe the trade union leaders in this country are the problem.  We can see the problem.  It is not in the trade union leadership; it is much closer to home in this House.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir White as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  T&aacute; a fhios agam gur d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht iontach t&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire freisin.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the pre-budget outlook and to outline some of my party&rsquo;s proposals in terms of where we believe the Government&rsquo;s direction should be on 9 December and beyond.  There is an onus on parties in Opposition to provide alternatives.  There is no point in us continuing to argue that we do not support X, Y or Z unless we are willing to put forward proposal A, B and C as an alternative.  We are the only party in opposition that has submitted a range of proposals to the Government which are costed nearly entirely by the Department of Finance and the Commission on Taxation.</P>
        <P>This takes me to the point that whether the Government supports these proposals is an issue we can have a debate on, and we can argue the merits of taking from those who are living on &euro;200 a week or taking from those who are earning &euro;200,000 per year.  Let us have that ideological argument.  I have no problem with this.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle spoke of honesty.  I want to turn that point on its head.  It is utterly dishonest for the Government and Minister after Minister to say time and again that there is only one option.  There is clearly more than one option.  We have provided the Government with an option in terms of our analysis of where the budget deficit can be closed, how we create a stimulus package to keep people at work or get them back into work and how we help families in households that are suffering as a result of the downturn in the economy.  These options are costed by the Department of Finance in order that when we say that, for example, standardising discretionary tax reliefs will generate &euro;1.1 billion, it is a fact.  Let us discuss, then, whether we should do that or not.  When we talk about introducing a wealth tax, we do so knowing it is available in many other European countries.  For example, France, Norway, Switzerland, Greece and Holland all have a wealth tax.  In the 1970s we had our own wealth tax and the introduction of such a tax on those with assets above &euro;1 million would bring in revenue well in excess of &euro;1 billion.  The introduction of a third rate of tax at 48% would again bring in revenue that is badly needed for the State in region of &euro;355 million.  The capping of public sector salaries at &euro;100,000 would generate &euro;450 million in savings.</P>
        <P>These are examples from a range of proposals costed for the Department of Finance in our document, Road to Recovery.  We need an honest debate to discuss the fairness in deciding to <Col N="753"/>cut social welfare rates instead of taxing at a higher rate those who have significant assets and wealth.  The average person does not follow these debates and the little nuances that different political parties emit time and again.  The Government has done a good job in making people believe there is only one strategy, which is to cut public sector pay, social welfare and front-line services.  We have shown this is not the only way.</P>
        <P>The Government has also been very successful in saying we have the most generous social welfare allowances in Europe.  That is absolute nonsense as we have the third lowest rate for an individual, with the second lowest being the United Kingdom and the lowest being Greece.  We have terrible social welfare rates when it comes to individuals and with couples, the rate is just below average.  We need an honest debate and we must discuss fairness in the budget.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to go through every point in this brochure but I made an appeal, from a parochial perspective, last year when we spoke about VAT rates after the budget.  We have two proposals that will deal with cross-Border shopping.  The first is that we reduce VAT rates.  Given that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain is about to increase VAT rates, now is the opportune time to give confidence to those people shopping in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
        <P>Report after report has shown that the primary driver for people in cross-Border shopping is the purchase of alcohol.  Some 50% of all alcohol sold on the island of Ireland is now sold in the North.  The consumption of alcohol on an island-wide basis has increased; there has been a 7% drop in the South but a 30% increase in the North.  The reality is that we have the highest excise duty in Europe on wine and the second highest on beer.  The Minister should take that duty in for the month of the December; if the exercise does not work it would cost &euro;18 million but if it does, it will keep people at home to purchase their alcohol and then the rest of their groceries.</P>
        <P>We have seen reports today and yesterday that cross-Border shopping could cost approximately 1,700 jobs.  Excise duty could be cut on a pilot basis by 20% this Christmas and VAT rates could be reduced in line with what is happening in Britain.  We should try to keep shoppers in each county.  I am an all-Ireland person; if people want to travel to Newry that is fine but I want the people of Donegal to stay in Donegal, the people of Gweedore to stay in Gweedore and the people of Dungloe to stay in Dungloe.  That is how parochial we are.  We must build our local economy.</P>
        <P>Such action makes sense as we are losing a significant amount of money.  I ask the Government to consider some of the proposals in the Road to Recovery document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  In joining the debate I note there was a call for a change of Government.  Considering the past two years, there was a divergence of opinion on major issues in the Opposition parties and I wonder what kind of Government they would have formed and how long it would have lasted.  It would not have even got over the first hurdle, which was the agreement to underpin the deposits in the banks.  If they could not deal with such a simple issue undertaken by all major European economies subsequent to our underpinning of the banks, it is surely time for a party which is in a position and willing to take the tough decisions to undertake them.</P>
        <P>These are tough decisions.  We find ourselves in an almost unique position and going back to the 1930s is the nearest parallel we can find.  It is fortunate we have the 1930s as a template as we know what we should not do.  The first action that period shows us should not be taken is to act on the temptation to impose trade barriers.  That was taken from the system very quickly and the American economy ensured it would not happen.  The Gramm-Rudman Act created all the difficulties where tariffs started to increase around the world.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>The second issue was to implement a Keynesian policy of spending money at a time when the public was beginning to slow its expenditure.  That is beginning to show positive results.  There is a clear consequence to that because in the printing of money, somebody loses out; unfortunately for people holding American debt, the value of the dollar has decreased because of the amount of extra money primed into the economy.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, although the recovery appears tentative, it is there.  We saw a reversal during the week in Dubai, where debt was put into default and the stock market collapsed for a short period before recovering on the basis that things were not quite as bad as people had feared.  The recovery is tentative but we appear to be on the right track.</P>
        <P>Being on the right track means the Government took steps which had to be taken.  The first was to stabilise our banking system and we are in the middle of the second step, the stabilisation of our economy and fiscal position.  I have no difficulty in doing what needs to be done as long as we do it right.  It appears the Government has spent hours, days, weeks and months in ensuring the forthcoming budget will be fair.  It appears there is no lack of compassion in Fianna F&aacute;il but as Mr. Colm McCarthy quite succinctly put it, there is a significant lack of money.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government would like to have kept the rates as high as they were, and we did so in the good times.  I have no doubt there will be changes but the Government will ensure such alterations are targeted, and only those who can afford to take the cuts will be affected.  It is very easy when in Opposition to say that when the Government does A, it should have done B, when the net result is the same.</P>
        <P>If a very high earner is taxed more or has social benefits decreased, it probably has the same net effect.  Invariably, the Opposition has said it would have been much better if the Government acted in a different way.  People who are very high earners are invariably those people who have availed of every possible tax shelter.  They have section 23 and section 48 tax exemptions, allowances for capital allowances and we can be sure they will have invested in employment benefit opportunities where they can take tax relief on investing in a new business.  What great benefit would accrue from increasing the taxation on such people?  There are ludicrous cases where people on as much as &euro;100,000 per year could be in a negative tax wedge; in other words they get more from the State in benefits than they pay in tax.  That has to be rectified and I hope it will be rectified by the Government.</P>
        <P>There is the idea that the problems can be solved by just increasing taxation and in one fell swoop everything would be cleared but I am sure that route would have been taken if that was the case.  That route was taken in the 1980s and it cost us dearly.  It took us a long time to get back to a competitive advantage.  Considering the amount of tax that is being paid, a very large portion is being paid by 4% of people.  That is the way it should be and I have no difficulty with those who can afford to pay doing so.  As I have also said, those who can afford to pay can also do without their benefits or at least with fewer of them.</P>
        <P>Where is this leading us?  There will clearly need to be cuts in public expenditure.  We have come back from the brink and the Government was largely responsible for bringing the country back from that precipice.  The public, in the fullness of time, will see that we did not take popular or political decisions.  We did not take decisions to put on the long finger the hardship entailed in getting our economy right.  We are looking to correct the economy now.  We are doing it in a measured way to ensure those who are less well off do not suffer as a result of us taking the action we need to take to ensure fiscal stability in the economy.  The economic projection that there will be a GDP drop of 7.5% this year, followed by a drop of 1.5% next year plus the fact that unemployment levels are decreasing in terms of the number of people and the rate at which they are losing their jobs are positive signals.  They are not the new dawn <Col N="755"/>but they are heading towards a new dawn.  The only way to get to a new dawn is by ensuring we have our banks right. As I said, the Opposition would not have done this correctly, but we are putting the banking sector on a sound footing.  We must also get the economy right, which we are doing, and be competitive.  The private sector is becoming more competitive and there has been a 7% fall in real terms in our competitiveness index.  In other words, costs here have decreased by 7% and it is becoming easier to attract manufacturers back into the country and get businesses up and running.</P>
        <P>The public sector has also played its part.  It saddens me when I hear people pitch the private and public sectors against each other.  The public sector has played a marvellous role in ensuring the nation achieved what it has achieved.  It is worth noting where we are currently.  Despite all the changes and difficulties and despite the current position with the economy, the gross domestic product per head in Ireland is $52,390.  In Germany, it is $38,520, in Denmark, it is $57,000, which is one of the highest in Europe, and in Italy, it is $36,000.  In other words, we are looking at a situation where major economies have significantly less output per person than the Irish economy.  In the United Kingdom GDP per head is $36,000 and in Sweden, a major economy, it is $46,000.  GDP in Switzerland is $60,000 per head.</P>
        <P>The economy starts from a very high base and we must ensure the public realises the need to get our finances in order and the benefits this will bring to the economy and bonds.  We want to get to a situation where economists can agree that Ireland is doing what needs to be done.  That is what economists are saying about the economy.  I suggest members of all the major parties recognise there is no alternative.  What other Members here have spoken about are different methods of getting to the same point, but there is no alternative to what the Government is setting about doing.</P>
        <P>In the past, I have often quoted <i>The Economist</i> when it suited.  It is a fine publication but an article in it comments that Ireland is tapping the same capital markets as the richer stronger nations and that we may find it more difficult to access capital.  The fact that people are now saving 13% of their income, rather than the usual 2.5% to 3%, has proven a boost for the Government.  We are borrowing practically all we need to borrow at home.  Therefore, we can fund our deficit at home from people&rsquo;s savings.  This is positive because at least our borrowing is not foreign borrowing.  Therefore, I hope <i>The Economist</i> will adjust its expectation that we may find it difficult to get funding in the world markets.  We do not need to go to the world markets for funding.</P>
        <P>The Government will ensure there is fairness and equity in the budget, but it is not going to be an easy budget.  When Senator Boyle spoke earlier about all round hardship, I understood he meant there would be fairness all round and that everyone would share the burden in accordance with his or her ability.  That is what I hope for in this budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, back to the House.  I listened to the contributions of Senators Boyle and Hanafin and was struck by the number of times I heard them say there is no alternative and there is nothing that could be done differently.  Listening to them I realised that not only is the economy under the vicious assault of which we are all aware, the nature of politics we practise here is under assault.  I have heard person after person stand up and say there is no alternative nor no other way other than what the Government is doing.</P>
        <P>There is always an alternative.  Politics is about generating choices and options and there are always different ways of handling things and tackling a crisis.  Fine Gael, in its contribution up to now and in the contribution it will make before budget day, has shown it would respond and handle this crisis in a different way.  Senator Hanafin praised the care and the lavish detail the Government has given to preparing the current budget, but that is what the Government <Col N="756"/>is there for.  That is its job and that is what we expect from it.  If less time had been spent running around the country opening swimming pools, newsagents and hairdressing salons between 2002 and 2007 as opposed to the Government doing its work and looking after the long-term plan for the country, we would not be in the mess we are in now or we would be in less of a mess.  Senator Hanafin praised the Government for its care and attention, but if a fraction of that attention had gone into considering a long-term plan for the country and economy, not just by the next election, but afterwards, we would be in a better place now.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If times had been a little less good in previous years, they would be a lot less bad than they are now.  That is the choice we faced and the reality of where we are now.  When preparing for this debate I took a quick look at the front pages of two main investment newspapers, the <i>Financial Times</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>, to see what they are saying about Ireland&rsquo;s current position.  I want to be serious and move away from party politics in this regard.  Today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> printed an article entitled &ldquo;Investors tear up old rules on behaviour&rdquo; which examined what is happening in Dubai.  Having analysed the situation in Dubai and what is happening with regard to debt there, it turned its attention to Greece and Ireland.  It mentioned that Ireland&rsquo;s debt-to-gross domestic product is forecast to rise by 80% next year.  This was the front page story today.</P>
        <P>With regard to the story in <i>The New York Times</i>, after it mentioned what was happening in some parts of eastern Europe, it turned to Ireland and stated the burdens are even greater in Ireland than in Latvia because economic boom here was driven by easy credit and soaring property values which have now given way to precipitous busts.  It stated that public debt in Ireland is expected to soar to 83% of gross domestic product next year, from 25% in 2007.   Today, when considering where the markets might be looking to next for the next sovereign bond scare, the front pages of two of the main investment newspapers mention Ireland.  This brings home to us the precipitous state in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>When Senator Hanafin began his speech, he started off with a little diatribe against the Opposition and talked about coherence between the Opposition parties.  We have no requirement to be coherent.  We are here to put forward our different political ideas and try and gain the support of our parties.  We are not in government.  One gains coherence if one is lucky enough to be in government.  That is when the discipline kicks in.  We have Fianna F&aacute;il saying one thing about the tax burden.  It says it wants to make all the savings out of expenditure as opposed to taxation, but Senator Boyle, on the front page of <i>The Sunday Times</i> every week, says the exact opposite.  He says what we need to do is broaden the tax base.  Where is the coherence there?  There is a basic incoherence.</P>
      
        <P>Another matter strikes me repeatedly and it was very apparent during the debate.  I refer to Senator Boyle&rsquo;s contribution.  He said that when people heard the budget, they would gasp.  What is there to be praised?  We are not here just to make people gasp but to offer them hope and to say there is a way forward.  When Senator Hanafin was making this point, he deliberately slowed down wonderfully and I thought there was going to be an epiphany, that he was going to reach out to us across the party political divide and make a point on which we could agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I was sadly disappointed.  While he talked about bringing the country back from the brink, he failed to acknowledge the role played by the Government in bringing the country to the brink in the first place.  The need to stand and accept pain is quoted repeatedly.  </P><Col N="757"/>
        <P>I have worked in the real economy and was fortunate to do so for many years.  I have been through it all &mdash; creating and losing jobs.  The economy has one simple purpose &mdash; to create wealth which, in turn, will allow us to create employment and provide security for people.  Members on the Government side talk about the need for cutbacks and adjustments, objectives with which I agree, but the only reason this should be done is to create the space needed to allow employment to be created and to put in place creative employment strategies to maintain employment and enhance our competitiveness.  I note there is a subtle positioning of the need for dialogue.  The Government wants to confine the debate to the need for cuts and adjustments, a word which is both clear and dangerous.  It wants to confine the debate to what needs to be taken out of the economy.  We need to do this, for the reasons highlighted in the newspapers from which I quoted, but that is only half the job that needs to be done.  We are here to give people a feeling and a vision as to how employment will be created.</P>
        <P>I refer to a document which I have studied and read in its entirety and which is being praised repeatedly entitled, Towards the Smart Economy, which was launched by the Government.  It is without doubt one of the worst documents I have ever seen published by any Government in recent times.  All it does is sum up everything that has been happening.  There are no ideas for new initiatives, no new plans to make a difference to our future.  It does not contain a single deadline or a single target delivery date.  It is not possible, therefore, to evaluate how the specifics of the document will be delivered because every attempt has been carefully made to make it bland, non-measurable and not time specific.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has a very different view.  Measures must be taken to recognise the need to cut the fiscal deficit and bring borrowing under control, while, at the same time, focusing on the one aspect that will make our recovery sustainable &mdash; the creation of employment.  Every job created means an additional &euro;20,000 in tax revenue and savings to the Exchequer in social welfare.  My party made a proposal last week and there are more to follow, including a fully costed plan to reduce the higher rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI by 20% and the lower rate by 50%.  This plan would cost &euro;900 million to implement.  We have suggested the elements that would pay for such a plan, including broadening the tax base by the implementation of a carbon tax and a windfall tax on power generation activities and the abolition of the employee&rsquo;s PRSI ceiling.  Our plan would accomplish two things, only one of which is being pursued by the Government.  It would make a contribution to reducing the fiscal deficit to make the country secure again and accomplish the one objective that would make our recovery sustainable &mdash; job creation.  The absence of a strategy to achieve this leaves a gaping hole in the Government&rsquo;s plan.</P>

	<P>I must admit I am disappointed by what Senator Donohoe has had to say.  I wrote it down because I could not believe it.  He states that in government that is where the discipline kicks in, as if to say one can have any fanciful notion one wishes while in opposition because there is no need to be consistent and disciplined and one&rsquo;s numbers do not need to add up.  </P>

The Taoiseach was wise last week in inviting members of the Opposition to come up with ideas.  We must avoid leading the people up the garden path, as has often happened up to this point.  Therefore, I am astonished at Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s comment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is not good enough because the people need to know.  The Senator will regret having made that point and his party will regret conducting itself in that way.  The country needs to hear it from all of its political leaders, not just from the Government exclusively.  It needs to hear how we can together and realistically solve the country&rsquo;s problems.</P>
        <P>I was very encouraged when I heard the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution because it marked out exactly what we needed to do.  In many ways, we all know what we need to do; it is a question of how we go about it.  I hope that next week the Minister for Finance will have the courage shown by the Minister of State and make the necessary difficult adjustments.  The one consistent lesson to be learned from previous economic downturns is to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past and fail to grasp the nettle and make the required adjustments quickly enough.</P>
        <P>We all know that next week&rsquo;s budget will be painful.  We have all learned to live at a certain standard but we no longer have the money to finance it.  The Minister for Finance made a point during the debate on the NAMA legislation which was overlooked; he said everyone was rightly concerned about the liabilities of &euro;54 billion which might be produced with NAMA.  However, nobody seemed to be looking at the deficit of &euro;20 billion year on year which being incurred.  That is what the Minister has to sort out.  A total of &euro;500 million a week is needed to finance it.  This means that every one of us will have to feel the pain, which does not give anyone any pleasure.  However, we need to be realistic and should not pretend there is another way.</P>
        <P>Like other Members, I have attended briefings by various interest and representative groups which have asked that their sector not be touched.  They all have legitimate reasons for asking for this.  There was a time when we had money to give to everyone.  It reminds me slightly of the 1977 budget, when everybody got a bit of everything and there was nothing left for the farmers, although we were already giving them everything possible.  In recent times there was money available for everybody.  However, time and again after the Budget Statement people asked why an allocation was not bigger.  That was the cry.  Ministers were encouraged to spend money because it was available, particularly on the old age pension, and the Government was determined to bring it up to a high standard.  That was then but, unfortunately, this is now.  We can no longer afford increases and cutbacks must be made.  I am glad the old age pension is not likely to be touched and I hope that is the case.  Life is difficult for elderly people on a fixed income because that is their lot whereas unemployment assistance claimants have the capacity through training schemes and so on to return to the workforce and not to remain on social welfare for the rest of their days.  It is desirable to protect fixed incomes for the elderly, as they have given their lives to the State.</P>
        <P>Last weekend I read the papers published by the MacGill school in 2007 about what was next for the economy.  People of every political persuasion did not spot the problems and it is worth reading these papers because no politician saw what was coming.  Parties were trying to outdo each other with generosity.  I accept Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s criticism that the parties responsible for getting us out of the current predicament must take responsibility for getting us into it.  However, the Government parties have not shunned responsibility for where we are, although that does not make the next task of solving these problems and having the courage to make adjustments easier nor does it make it more palatable for our citizens to have to face up to and accept the impending cuts.  The Government will not take pleasure from the cuts that will be announced next week but I hope it will continue to discuss them with the public.  The last thing a Government can do is to continue cutting public services without communicating its message clearly as to why they are being cut and for how long.</P><Col N="759"/>
        <P>I am also worried that people are focused on the upcoming budget whereas it will only be one of three tough budgets.  However difficult this year&rsquo;s budget will be, next year&rsquo;s will be equally difficult and the Government will have to seek the same amount in savings.  That is why realism needs to come into play because it is not the case that if we all hold tight, this will be as bad as it gets.  It will probably be much worse next year, although there are positive signs such as price reductions and increased exports.  We need to be careful about that because, as Senator Donohoe said, the only way to revive the economy and to create jobs is to restore competitiveness.  That means reducing costs, in particular labour and energy costs.  While energy costs have reduced, they have a long way to go.  We need to focus on restoring competitiveness.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that we have a youthful, highly skilled and highly educated workforce and it must be ensured the unemployed can enhance their skills in order to be prepared for the upturn when it comes.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn has raised the issue on two or three occasions of the rate of pay for workers in the South compared with their compatriots in the North in equivalent jobs.  That speaks volumes about the bind we are in.  I hope a strategy will be devised to get us out of the difficulties we face but we all need to be responsible and that is why the Opposition parties, and not just the Government parties, also need to be disciplined for their own credibility.  We all should be realistic about what can be achieved for the country in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  In 2008 the economy entered the worst recession in 80 years, sparked by the global credit crunch and the collapse of the domestic property bubble.  The scale of the economic collapse was staggering.  In 2006, at the height of the boom, the private sector was a net borrower to the tune of &euro;10 billion.  In 2009 the private sector will be a net saver of &euro;20 billion a year, which represents a withdrawal of &euro;30 billion from the economy annually because of lower spending on housing and consumer goods, and less capital investment by businesses.  The massive withdrawal of capital contributed to a major growth in unemployment, which doubled from 5.9% in June 2008 to 11.9% in June 2009.  It currently stands at 12.9%.</P>
        <P>Government spending is running at more than &euro;500 million a week in excess of income and the Government will need to borrow &euro;26 billion this year to fund the differential between income and expenditure.  This equates to a significant percentage of national income.  While the Minister for Finance is correct to point out that the one-year extension of the budgetary deadline granted by the European Commission is welcome, we are in a serious position and I agree with him that soft pedalling the necessary adjustment in the coming year is not an option.  If corrective action is not taken by 2011, the deficit will increase to 15% of GDP.</P>
        <P>The scale of the economic challenge facing the nation is daunting.  Few families have not experienced their incomes shrink or have not had a family member lose a job.  These are challenging times and I do not envy the Minister for Finance his job.  I wish him well, as his role is crucial in preparing the ground for an economic recovery.  While I disagree with him on many issues, I acknowledge he has risen to the challenge and he is one of the few showing real leadership at a dangerous time in the history of the State.  Handing out that bouquet, which will not put him up or down, highlights that one of the reasons we are faced with our current problems is bad leadership in the past.  There is no point pretending this is due to international circumstances.  The leadership we had was unable to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Such leadership is always bad leadership.  It must be acknowledged folksy communitarianism was no substitute for principles-based governance, which provides for people to be told what is excessive.  A nanny who cannot say &ldquo;No&rdquo; will spoil a child and a government that cannot say &ldquo;No&rdquo; will spoil an economy.  That is why there is a massive disconnect between Exchequer revenue which, as the Minister of <Col N="760"/>State pointed out, is in the same range as a percentage of GDP as it was in recent years, and massively increased public spending.</P>
        <P>It is crucial to acknowledge that everyone is not equally to blame for the current crisis and, therefore, everyone should not bear the burden equally.  The most vulnerable, particularly the elderly, the disabled and the ill, need to be protected.  They did not create this mess nor should they pay for the greed and stupidity of those who did.  While cutbacks must be made, we must try to trim the fat of government such as public relations budgets, expenses, unnecessary travel, ill-thought out and pointless conferences and meaningless reports rather than the tangible services that make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives, which are the muscle that sustains the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
        <P>If the cuts the Minister proposes are to be sustained, we need to rethink the way government works in Ireland.  For too long the solution to every problem the Government experienced was to throw new organisations and money at it.  I am reminded of the overly indulgent nanny of recent years.  Invariably, a quango was set up to deal with every problem and the number of Departments, agencies, quangos and regulators is in excess of 600.  Government was one of the fastest growing industries in Ireland and that was neither healthy nor sustainable.  One could say that one of the fastest growing industries in Ireland has been Government and that was never healthy or sustainable.</P>

        <P>We need to go back to the drawing board and redesign Government in order that the money Government collects and spends gets to the people who need it and not to an ever-growing and not necessarily very effective bureaucracy.  Improvements on procurement, the more widespread adoption of shared services, better IT management, the increased use of virtualisation and electronic payments could all contribute to lower costs and increased efficiencies.  There is also a need for fundamental redesign of process used by Government and the structures and work practices used in Government.</P>
        <P>Reform cannot take place without the co-operation of public sector workers.  There are those who would set public and private sector workers at each others&rsquo; throats but the reality is that many families are the product of mixed marriages between public and private sector employees.  Ireland is too small for factional interests to triumph.  In the words of Benjamin Franklin, with <Col N="761"/>which we are all familiar, &ldquo;we must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately&rdquo;.  The Minister is not only responsible for managing the fiscal crises but also has crucial responsibility for public sector reform.  Once the budgetary process is over, I urge the Minister to turn his considerable talents to driving public sector reform in Ireland and providing the same leadership there as he demonstrated in addressing the financial sector crises and the fiscal crises.</P>
        <P>I wish to address some remarks on the topic of education.  Education is not a cost for Government; it is the single most important investment we can make in the future of the nation.  The human talent we possess is the most important asset and our education system is the single most important item of critical infrastructure.  No sector can be immune from cutbacks but the education sector is one where it is far better to use a scalpel than a slash hook.  In making cuts I urge the Minister to look at back office operations and quangos of dubious benefit rather than frontline services.  To be blunt, good teachers perform one of the most valuable tasks in society and deserve to be paid fairly for their work.  I have no doubt if one asked Members how they got here in the first place they would eventually mention a teacher who inspired them many years ago.  In recent months teachers have been all but vilified as though they created this current mess rather than the greed and stupidity of bankers, developers, crony capitalists, and corrupt politicians not to mention regulators who drew fat salaries but were asleep at the wheel.  Teaching is an honourable and worthwhile profession whose contribution has never been properly recognised.  If we develop a smart economy in Ireland it will be due in no small part to the work of Irish teachers who have consistently given far more than they were paid to do.</P>
        <P>We need much more than a smart economy; we need a wisdom society.  That is why I put the emphasis on education.  Earlier today I pointed out that voluntary schools, of which I am a trustee of over 100, receive &euro;200 less per student than VEC schools and &euro;90 less per student than community schools.  That is not equitable.  Some schools are at their wits&rsquo; end as they face water charges and the moratorium on posts of responsibility means that in some cases six out of eight school head posts are unfilled.  The key pastoral role played by year heads is not available to students.  How can we talk about cherishing children of the nation equally and safeguarding the welfare of our future society if we are not putting young people first?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  It is crippling the management of schools.  I make no apology for saying that education should be excepted in any cutbacks.  As it stands, with the Government slow to pay grants, schools are being pushed into bad management practices where they must borrow from banks in order not to be in the red.  The articles of management require them to run the school within a budget.  Schools require extra support from the Government, not cutbacks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to speak on the commitments to which we must adhere in the budget.  It is important to set out the parameters and guidelines of what we would like to see.  We all want to see as much support as possible for education, people on fixed incomes and social welfare.  That is a reasonable approach when dealing with difficult times.  Ireland faces a very important budget because we have committed to the European Commission to cut the deficit by &euro;4 billion, which amounts to 2.5% of GDP.  It is reasonable for a country currently overspending to correct its spending.  We cannot continue or this country will be unsustainable in terms of the budget deficit.  Recent suggestions by the unions of a slash and burn policy with regard to public servants is total nonsense.  The unions gained so much in the past 11 years by being partners with the Government.  We had great engagement with the unions over that <Col N="762"/>period to the unions&rsquo; benefit and it is nonsense to see that, when the unions must take a little pain, the highly paid members of the unions will take no pain.  Union leaders ordered union members onto the streets over a week ago but it does not get away from the fact that we must make these decisions.  We would prefer to make these decisions with the social partners rather than outside of social partnership.  It is possible to do this.  If unions get down to real negotiation we could come up with a solution to accommodate unions, workers and the Government.  It is vitally important that we do so.  The unions are going into negotiation even though they have a strike planned for the following week.  That is not the way to do business.  The gun to the head never produces good policies.</P>
        <P>It is vitally important for the country to have a good public service, as without it, it is not possible to run the country.  The public service is equally as important as the banks are to the economy.  Deputy Mullen is right that the reality is we will hang together or we will hang separately.  If the IMF comes in, it will not be too worried about the public service, social welfare recipients or pensioners; it will simply make a 35% cut across the board.  We do not want it to do our business for us.  We have to do our own and should do it together.  Everybody benefited from the partnership process during the past 11 years.  If we run into bad times, we have to work together to find our way out.  In thar regard, we are confronted by a serious flooding problem.</P>
        <P>Union members went on strike on a day of protest last week.  Some 15,000 people had hospital appointments on that day and will not receive another for the next two or three months.  As a result, there will probably be a build-up of 45,000 patients on waiting lists.  A pork plant in County Offaly had to let its 200 employees go home on the day of the strike because there were no inspectors on duty to inspect meat.  I do not believe anybody has examined the cost of the strike.  It must be phenomenal, running into hundreds of millions of euro.  If we do not work together to find a solution, we will face a very bleak future because we will not be able to borrow money from the institutions from which we are now borrowing.  Therefore, a reasonable approach should be taken.</P>
        <P>The figure of &euro;4 billion appears to comprise a cut of &euro;2.5 billion in current spending, a hike of &euro;750 million, mainly derived from a carbon tax, and a cut in capital spending of &euro;750 million.  That is a reasonable approach to how we will balance the books, which we must do, as we are taking in &euro;32 billion but spending &euro;55 billion.  That cannot continue.  We must ensure old age pensioners, child care services and education services are part of the consideration.  To continue investment in these areas, we will all have to reduce our expectations.  If income is &euro;32 billion and X amount has to be borrowed against that figure to balance the books, hard choices will have to be made, such that those who can afford to pay should pay a little more.  The people who cannot afford to pay have to be looked after.  The smart economy programme will play a major role during the next seven or eight years.  A good education system, of which I am all in favour, is necessary to produce the people who will work in the smart economy.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the teachers who teach our children have longer holidays and are better paid than most teachers elsewhere in Europe.  These are two important points to bear in mind.  Teachers here do not put in the hours worked by teachers elsewhere in Europe.  The same applies to nurses.  Nurses here are paid well above what nurses in England and elsewhere in Europe receive.  The same applies to those who deliver professional services such as consultants and doctors.  If we are to drive down the public sector pay bill, bearing in mind that there has been a 20% to 30% reduction in the private sector, we will have to drive down the prices charged for professional services.  The &euro;60 charge for a visit to the doctor and the &euro;75 or &euro;100 charge to have one&rsquo;s teeth cleaned or for an extraction cannot continue.  Neither can hospital <Col N="763"/>consultants continue to have an annual salary of &euro;250,000, when their counterparts across the water and in Germany are on a salary of &euro;80,000 to &euro;100,000.</P>
        <P>Pay costs account for 50% of the budget in the health sector.  Alarm bells would ring in a private company at the point where pay accounted for 35% of the budget.   Account must also be taken of middle management.  I have pointed out to the Minister that there is room for at least &euro;1billion in cuts in the health service without affecting the delivery of health services.  The cost of middle management should have been examined four years ago when the health boards were broken up, but that did not happen.  Half of the staff concerned do not know what they are supposed to be doing.  I know a number of them and their biggest task is to get out on the golf course two or three times a week to amuse themselves.  That cannot be good for any organisation.  Nobody seems to be taking action in that regard.  It was a misjudgement when the decision was made to remove authority from the Minister.  Those who pay the bills are the ones who should make the decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate.  A number of colleagues, including Senator MacSharry, have actively sought such a debate during the past month to six weeks.  We are now almost at the 24th hour and presumably the major budgetary decisions have been taken.  I do not believe, therefore, that there will be any dramatic changes as a result of this debate in the Seanad.  However, I hope that, if we are still in our current positions in 12 months&rsquo; time, this House of the Oireachtas will be used in a much more proactive way to debate the financial issues facing the country and the budgetary choices available.  I also hope this Chamber will be used to liaise with the social partners, listen to their suggestions and present some ideas and suggestions of its own.  Notwithstanding that concern and complaint, a matter for another day, I wish to express some of my thoughts on the current economic choices facing the country.  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State knows better than I that next week&rsquo;s budget will almost certainly be the most difficult ever faced by the Government, in terms of its preparations, and one of the most difficult ever faced by the people.  It is unique in terms of the scale of the problems we face and the solutions that will have to be presented by the Government.  On the other side of the equation, the Government has one small advantage.  Possibly for the first time ever in the history of the State, there is a reasonable degree of acceptance by the public of the scale of the problems.  There may be limited public acceptance of the solutions and measures required also.  I recall the Governments of the 1980s under the leadership of Dr. Garret FitzGerald and the late Charles Haughey which attempted to bring forward difficult financial measures.  One of the road blocks they faced was the lack of public understanding of the scale of the problem.  At least this time almost every citizen is able to quote the figures mentioned by Senator Butler that show the country is spending &euro;57 billion, while our income is &euro;34 billion.  This cannot continue.  If there is light at the end of the tunnel for the Administration, perhaps it is the expectation of difficult measures.  People are willing to take some medicine.  Everyone favouring cuts, tax increases or revenue curtailments as long as they are in someone else&rsquo;s area is a regular occurrence.  Tomorrow week the people must accept that we must all play our part.</P>
        <P>A phrase that has annoyed me very much in the economic debates of the past 12 months is, &ldquo;We did not cause the problem, it was the banks which caused it&rdquo;.  As <i>The Sun</i> newspaper might put it, &ldquo;It was the banks wot done it&rdquo;.  The banks have done significant damage to the economy and our society.  Several people within the banking institutions are guilty of grave economic crimes.  However, even if there was never a banking crisis, there would still be a serious economic crisis and we would still have a deficit of more than &euro;20 billion.  To be brutally frank, we have all caused the problem to some degree.  In the past decade every citizen has earned somewhat more than he or she should have, spent in excess of his or her income and <Col N="764"/>saved too little.  We have all been part of the problem.  I am the first to acknowledge that some are a good deal more guilty than most, but we have all sailed along in the ship of State which is now in very choppy and rocky waters.  Therefore, we must all play some little part in turning the economic fortunes of the State around.</P>
        <P>The throwaway comment to the effect that if there was no banking crisis, there would be no economic crisis is silly in political and economic terms because Government revenue and spending equations have been out of place for some time.  When one adds the international economic thunderstorms that hit us, we can see exactly where we are.  The question is how can we get out of it.  There is a mature political consensus on the need for the correction to be in the region of &euro;4 billion.  When one debates from where this &euro;4 billion should come, whether spending cuts or taxation, it falls out of kilter very quickly.  However, it is good for the political establishment to have a degree of mature acceptance among all political parties that tough decisions are required.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that progress appears to have been made with the social partners in the talks to pare back the public sector pay bill.  I support and admire our public servants and the public service very much, as does everyone on this side of the House.  However, we must recognise that matters cannot continue as heretofore and if they do, there will be no public service or public servants because the country will be forced to transfer responsibility for its financial future to the IMF.  If the formula required is a temporary lay off of public servants for ten, 12 or 14 days, that is acceptable.  If that measure produces the 5% or 6% cut in the public sector pay bill without embarrassing anyone too much or without anyone coming under an obligation to say what it really entails, we can live with it politically and economically.  By one or other means we must reduce the public sector pay bill.</P>
        <P>We must consider the big spending Departments, including the Departments of Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs and Education and Science to determine the savings that can be made in these areas.  We could continue to live in dreamland or cloud-cuckoo-land and maintain there should be no more cuts, especially in a given area.  However, these three Departments spend approximately 75% of taxpayers&rsquo; money and savings and reductions must be made within them.</P>
        <P>A fine contribution was made by Senator Mullen on the education budget.  On several occasions in the House he has made an excellent case in outlining the reasons teachers are so important, why the education service must be maintained and developed and why we must ensure investment continues in education.  He has been a great champion of this political argument and it is a view with which I agree.  Notwithstanding the dreadful budgetary figures facing the country, I trust we will continue to invest in education.</P>
        <P>Although stark economic and political choices will be presented to the people next week, we must project a degree of hope.  The term &ldquo;stimulus plan&rdquo; has been thrown around too easily.  We have been informed of the success of such plans in Germany and France.  However, they were based on the motor industry.  There was a short-term gain but such plans may not succeed in the longer term.  However, we must consider investment and job creation.  My colleague, Senator Donohoe, pointed out very effectively that every job created was worth almost &euro;20,000 to the taxpayer.  This must be at the forefront of our thoughts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us consider Irish society, industry and the economy.  How does one stimulate the economy in a manner that will not be dramatically inflationary and will not result in a vast amount of money leaving the country because it is spent on imported goods and services?  Irish agriculture stands out as an area suitable for a stimulus plan.  There is a production deficit in the European food industry at a time when world food supplies must be significantly boosted.  Irish <Col N="765"/>agriculture could play a very significant role in this regard with the help of a stimulus plan.  Thousands of jobs could be created if there were reasonable and wise levels of investment.  Let us consider REPS, the rural environment protection scheme, bio-fuels and other alternative energy sources.  The Minister of State and his ministerial colleagues would be wise to consider the possibility of introducing a stimulus plan based on Irish agriculture which could return rural Ireland to prosperity.  Only last week definitive figures were produced showing the drop in farm incomes during the past 12 months, on a scale of between 20% and 30%, which represents a frightening drop.  This issue must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The specific measures to be taken next week remain secret to the Department of Finance and the Government but there have been some straws in the wind in respect of cutbacks that are a source of concern for many citizens.  Child benefit has been the subject of debate for a significant period.  The classic argument is that a universal payment for rich and poor alike can be challenged.  Members received a huge number of representations from various groups in recent months and these indicate that direct payments to mothers in respect of their children are still extremely important.  I hope the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance will reflect on that point.</P>
        <P>The social welfare budget is huge and as unemployment increases, it will become even larger.  I hope means-tested payments and old age pensions will be maintained at their current levels.  There is a possibility that benefit payments which are not means tested could be examined.  If a saving is to be made on the social welfare budget, I hope it will not be imposed on those who are on the basic means-tested payments or old age pensions.</P>
        <P>Figures in respect of VAT have emerged in recent weeks.  A lack of both consumer confidence and spending power has obviously resulted in a significant drop in VAT revenues.  Last year&rsquo;s decision to increase VAT has proven to be a catastrophe.  While I accept that a number of tough measures will be announced on Wednesday next, I hope some positive measures will also be introduced.  A strong case can be made in respect of reducing VAT.  Such a move would result in the generation of additional revenue to the State and would restore consumer confidence and spending power.</P>
        <P>As well as presenting the people with stark choices and challenges on Wednesday next, the Government must also give them a degree of hope.  The budget must be realistic but people must also be afforded the opportunity to see that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I am of the view that people are up to the challenge.  They are ahead of members of the political establishment in this regard and they are aware of the scale of the problem.  They are concerned with regard to their jobs and incomes but they also have fears with regard to their children and their children&rsquo;s children.  If next week&rsquo;s budget is tough but fair, it will achieve the desired response from the people.  I accept that it will be difficult for the Minister for Finance to frame such a budget.  However, he must try to match people&rsquo;s expectations.</P>
        <P>We have moved well beyond the politics of economic illiteracy.  The people are not stupid.  They are aware of the challenges we face and of the choices that must be made.  I hope the Minister for Finance will introduce a budget that is both balanced and fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to Senator Bradford&rsquo;s fair and measured contribution.  We have come to expect such contributions from him.  I also listened with interest to contributions from Senators Butler, MacSharry, Mullen and others, including the Minister of State.  I must admit that I missed some Members&rsquo; contributions as a result of the fact that I was obliged to carry out other duties.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point to the effect that this debate should be held on an earlier date next year &mdash; assuming that we will all still be here &mdash; is well made.  If that were to happen, Members <Col N="766"/>comments could be factored in to the overall debate on the budget.  As matters stand, this debate is taking place somewhat late.</P>
        <P>Framing the forthcoming budget has presented the Government with a tremendous challenge.  Governments across the world &mdash; the Administration in this country was no different &mdash; were overwhelmed by the scale and speed with which the economic downturn took hold and caused what was, more or less, a global banking collapse.  Owing to the fact that the downturn arrived in the wake of a period of unprecedented growth in this country and of general growth in the global economy, it was difficult to come to terms with quickly.</P>
        <P>Commentators and politicians on different sides of the House sometimes overlook the fact that during the good years the mantra repeated by the Opposition and backbenchers on the Government side was that we should ensure the fruits of the Celtic tiger would be distributed in an equitable manner in order that those who did not appear to be doing well would benefit.  I and others subscribed to that argument.</P>
        <P>We have quite an amount to show for what occurred during the good times.  Roads and other infrastructure throughout the country have improved dramatically.  I was involved with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, in the early 1980s when times were difficult.  At the time, I strongly campaigned for the Government to emphasise the improvement of road infrastructure, especially in the context of constructing motorways on the main arteries between our cities.  In the early 1980s, it was estimated that the payback in respect of the Naas bypass, the first section of motorway built in this country, was of the order of 15%.  By any standards, even those relating to private investment, that level of payback would be regarded as attractive.</P>
        <P>As Senator Bradford correctly stated, there is no one in this country who did not in some shape or form benefit as a result of the Celtic tiger economy.  In the late 1990s, for example, huge emphasis was placed on improving social welfare payments, particularly old age pensions.  That was the correct course to take and those on old age pensions welcome and appreciated what was done for them.</P>
        <P>A serious attempt was made to redistribute the wealth that was created.  However, there is no doubt that people involved in risk capital ventures became very wealthy during the period in question.  Those who use their initiative and take risks &mdash; that they took the latter is highlighted by the predicament in which they currently find themselves &mdash; deserve to obtain a reward.  These people also created a considerable number of jobs during the Celtic tiger period.  Up to 400,000 people were employed in the construction industry at one point.  It must be remembered that the large influx of immigrants into this country during the past ten years or so occurred as a result of the need to meet the demand in that industry and in other parts of the economy.</P>
        <P>Public servants have stated that they are not responsible for what has happened.  All of us in the public service &mdash; the pay of Senators and Deputies is linked to theirs &mdash; benefited to a tremendous extent from the significant improvements made during that period.  Some of those improvements came about as a result of social partnership.  In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, social partnership played a pivotal role in laying the foundations which gave rise to the success we subsequently enjoyed.</P>
        <P>During this decade, probably based on the false premise that we were on an upward curve, a view that was held across the globe, we tended to dismiss the normal dogma that applies in respect of economics, namely, that everything goes in cycles and what goes up must eventually come down.  This has exacerbated the difficulties with which we are now faced.  Our level of competitiveness has been seriously eroded, a matter about which I am concerned.</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>In 1998, the public service pay bill, which includes those who are on pensions, was marginally in excess of &pound;7 billion, which today would be somewhere between &euro;8 billion and &euro;9 billion.  At present, this bill stands at more than &euro;20 billion.  People must recognise that the level of public pay has increased dramatically.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of navel gazing in respect of this matter.  Earlier today, Senator MacSharry highlighted a number of significant failures on the part of the national broadcaster, RTE.  One of the most obvious of these is its failure to meet the challenges presented in the context of promoting an understanding among members of the public with regard to the global banking crisis, the economic downturn and the property bubble.  That people should have such an understanding is important from my point of view.  I have no difficulty with people in the media.  They are right to be critical where they feel mistakes have been made.  I do not have any difficulty with that and it is up to politicians to defend themselves.  The constant drip of negativity, which has almost reached tsunami stage, has damaged to some extent the psyche of the country and the confidence of investors and consumers.  Unless those areas recover we will not get back on the path to growth to which we aspire.</P>

        <P>This has a global dimension.  I saw very good programmes on channels from our neighbouring island, BBC 2 and Channel 4.  I would say they were relatively inexpensive to produce but they were extremely informative.  They were on the banking situation in Britain and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which had resonances for what was happening here as a microcosm of what happened in the United States.  Other programmes were on the collapse of eastern bloc countries such as Latvia and the effects on the Czech Republic and Poland.  It is a pity it was not done here in an educative way which would inform people and allow them to see that we are in a very serious crisis but that we can work our way through it.  It would have harnessed a level of cohesion in the population to deal with the serious challenges that exist.  Without such national cohesiveness we are very unlikely to rescue ourselves any day soon.</P>
        <P>Our banking system did not escape the global downturn.  People feel the property bubble gave rise to all our woes but that is an incorrect and superficial analysis.  If we had never had a property bubble we would still be encountering serious economic difficulties because of the global downturn in banking.  Our banks would still have had credit difficulties.  Very definitely, factors were the property market, the reckless banking which went on and the lamentable and disgraceful failure of our regulatory authorities, and I include the regulator and would not exclude the Central Bank.  The former Governor of the Central Bank stated that it gave warnings and included them in reports but people who are paid very high salaries need to be more proactive than putting something in a report and significant failures occurred in that area.  In mitigation of their failures, the same thing happened in the United States, Britain and other places.  We must recognise these failures if we are to ensure we do not go down that path again.</P>
        <P>The Government faces challenges on three fronts.  One of these is banking, which it has dealt with in the best way it could, given the difficult circumstances.  I do not know whether the guarantees given at the time needed to be as all-embracing as they were but I do not know that they were not right either.  NAMA was the correct measure to take.  On the fiscal side, perhaps our successes have not been as good as the manner in which we dealt with the banking situation.  Our public finances fall into three areas, namely, pay and pensions, social welfare and non-pay areas.  It is my opinion that Irish pay generally is way ahead of what it should be.  We are approximately 30% to 40% ahead in the private sector.  Pay in the public sector is supposed to be, according to economists, 22% ahead of what it is in the private sector, which means our public sector wages are probably too high by a factor of 50%.  That is extraordinary.  I do not think we can correct that amount unless we take &euro;5 billion out of the public pay bill and I suggest we do so through a cut in pay, consolidating the pension levy into a pay cut, and <Col N="768"/>reducing numbers.  We must reduce numbers in the public service by 50,000 to 60,000.  That will come close to getting the &euro;5 billion.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we have no option but to cut social welfare.  There has been a decline in prices and if this is done there is an onus on the Government to ensure the cost of living also comes down.  There has been too much profiteering throughout the economy.  Senator Butler mentioned fees.  Legal fees in this country are a disgrace and the Government has never tackled them.  Medical fees are also a disgrace.  They are far too high and exorbitant.  This is also the case for a range of other fees.  Hotels and the retail sector are feeling the pinch.  It would be fair to state that they ripped us off during the good days and this needed to be corrected.  People have to become more competitive and whatever price controls need to be introduced should be introduced.</P>
        <P>In the next three years we need to save approximately &euro;14 billion.  As I have stated previously, the target of &euro;4 billion is too low.  We should aim for &euro;5 billion or &euro;5.5 billion this year, a similar amount for 2011 and less in 2012.  If we do so it may give us a little scope to provide stimulus and in 2010 we need to target very specific stimuli to areas of the economy that can retain and improve employment.  The real blight of the downturn is unemployment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran.  What could I possible say at this stage that will make a difference and will be heard?  So much has been said.  It is not all about what is being said this evening.  We face a &euro;4 billion hole that the Government will try to fill next Wednesday, 9 December.  It is borrowing &euro;500 million a week just to stay afloat but the problem as I see it is that we have lost confidence that the Government can keep us afloat even with this.  Its lack of sustainable strategies has instilled fear in the entire nation and this has led to paralysis.  Above all, the paralysis seems to be in the Government, with its lack of imagination to get us out of the mess it has brought us in to.</P>
        <P>What are the Government&rsquo;s choices to find the &euro;4 billion?  That is the biggest issue.  There is wide agreement that it cannot tax its way out of the recession.  It is considering cuts to spending, some of which we support.  We would particularly support cuts to waste.  Only yesterday, I met a person with a small enterprise who has 13 people working for him.  He is a supplier of goods to the HSE.  He told me he faces other suppliers giving backhanders to people in the HSE.  That is what he is up against to stay afloat.  Clearly, there is no accountability or monitoring of systems.  The buck must stop with the Government.</P>
        <P>Cuts to services that affect the front line are not acceptable, namely, cuts to children&rsquo;s education, health care that people need or social work that could affect child protection.  I am disappointed with the union leadership in this country.  I do not blame the public servants, I blame the union leadership for its lack of a holistic vision of this problem and coherence.  I blame the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, for this.  He turned the unions into the monsters we have today.  The Government continues to give &euro;1.5 million for activist training.  Social partnership left out the small and medium enterprise sector.  These are the people who created the jobs that paid the taxes to pay for public services.</P>
        <P>We need to get this right.  Today, we hear the unions want to ask public servants for 12 days unpaid leave.  How will this be managed?  The last thing one wants to hear &mdash; I am sure Senator MacSharry will agree &mdash; is that one&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s teacher is out.  If a child&rsquo;s teacher is out for 12 days, that is the equivalent of one day every three weeks of the school year.  Add sick and personal leave and the child&rsquo;s education will be seriously compromised.  Are we getting as a <i>quid pro quo</i> the guarantee that the child will be taught by other teachers in the school?  That certainly would increase pupil-teacher ratios.  What would happen if four or five teachers were out at the same time?  This could cause mayhem.  I recall what it was like to go without substitute <Col N="769"/>teachers when I started teaching in the mid-1980s.  If one was genuinely out sick for a day, one dreaded coming back to hear about how one&rsquo;s children messed up other classes.</P>
        <P>What about social workers and child protection services?  We have learned about the Monageer case and the lack of out-of-hours mental health services.  Last year I was told by social workers based in Galway that they had to leave 15 child protection cases unopened for up to two weeks because they were severely understaffed.  Lives may be put at risk.</P>
        <P>I blame the poor leadership given by union officials rather than public servants.  We have done a serious disservice to public servants because they are widely regarded as an easy touch.  I do not blame them for asking when their salaries will stop being cut.  They have already seen levies of 7.5% introduced.  It can be conclusively argued that benchmarking increases were wrongly given.  Why not roll back on benchmarking entirely and leave it at that?  Public servants would then know where they were going and their demonisation might end.  I recently spoke to a 29 year old teacher who earns a salary of &euro;29,000.  He has already taken a 7.5% reduction through levies.  Will he have to accept a further cut of 7%?  His salary is not high, given the cost of living in this country.  He has a house and a car but already rents some of his rooms to cover his mortgage repayments.</P>
        <P>People want hope and leadership.  This morning I visited the Ballyvaughan enterprise centre where I met unemployed people who spoke about their sense of isolation.  Their feelings are shared by 420,000 people.  With one in every three under the age of 25 years out of work, the level of youth unemployment is running dangerously high.  In Galway city alone, 5,300 people under the age of 25 years are unemployed.  The solution has to be the introduction of a jobs stimulus.  I was stunned when Senator Walsh said the Government might consider such a stimulus if it had more money.  Why not consider one?  That is what separates Fianna F&aacute;il from Fine Gael.  My party believes we must offer hope.  We cannot take from people, while giving nothing back.  I do not know how many job policies have been presented.  Our most recent pro-jobs policy involves the elimination of PRSI as part of a &euro;900 million tax cuts package to create employment.  Why not transfer some of the money provided in the social welfare budget to fund internship programmes?  The Minister of State will be aware of how much Members of the Houses benefit from internships.  Both employers and newly qualified graduates would benefit.  Young people are in a catch-22 because they lack the experience to secure the few jobs available.  By investing in job creation we would create the tax income needed to pay for public services.</P>
        <P>I am one of the three people who started a job creation initiative in Oranmore, where I live, because we were fed up with the lack of leadership and solutions from the top.  Every Friday at least three people approach me with ideas.  We have established a panel of experts from people who are willing to donate their time for free.  We have an information technology person to help us to build a website, a marketing expert who will help to market ideas and a former banker who never foreclosed on a mortgage in 40 years of work.  We have every kind of expert needed to start up a business.  This initiative is generating a wonderful level of excitement and hope but we can do much more in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is unanimous agreement that the Government has made a mess of the economy but I am more interested in solutions than in apportioning blame.  We need to educate ourselves out of the recession.  Thanks to Finland&rsquo;s investment in teachers in the early 1990s, that country is much better able to cope with the current recession.  Only 8% of Irish teachers have qualifications at masters level or above, whereas all Finnish teachers are qualified at least to that level.  Finland is top in the programme for international student achievement in literacy, mathematics, science and problem solving.  We need our graduates to perform at that level if we are to develop Ireland into a knowledge and innovation economy.  Solutions are needed, not only <Col N="770"/>today but also in four or five years&rsquo; time.  Our graduates will create and maintain the jobs needed to fund the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>It is no longer acceptable to praise ourselves for our educational achievements.  Our literacy problems are intergenerational in nature.  Approximately 30% of children in disadvantaged areas leave primary school with low literacy levels.  The equivalent figure is 10% in ordinary schools.  One in six students drops out prior to completing the leaving certificate with no qualifications and no hope.  Such students go on to become the parents of the future and the cycle continues when they pass on to their children their low literacy levels and disregard for education.  We have to invest in education and cannot permit cuts to be made at the front line.  We will lower standards if the Government agrees to the unions&rsquo; proposal to force teachers to take 12 days unpaid leave.  I will not accept such an outcome unless it can be proved that children will not be disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>At tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science I will fight to ensure the registration fee for third level students is capped.  They are already struggling and the current policy is simply aimed at introducing fees by the back door.  This will be the acid test for the Green Party.  Let us focus on education and growing the economy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar si&uacute;l.  Gach l&aacute; sa Seanad, b&iacute;onn c&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad againn chun labhairt faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta.  N&iacute; chabhra&iacute;onn sin d&aacute;ir&iacute;re, mar t&aacute;imid ag caint ar rud at&aacute; uileghabh&aacute;lach ar fad.  Bheadh s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhf&eacute;adfaim&iacute;s &aacute;r dtuairim&iacute; a nocht&uacute; agus f&eacute;achaint an mbeadh aon chomhthuiscint eadrainn.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh na tuairim&iacute; a nochtfar anocht cabhrach agus dearfach.  Aonta&iacute;m leis an Seanad&oacute;ir deireanach go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach d&oacute;chas a thabhairt do dhaoine ach n&iacute;l m&eacute; cinnte an raibh d&oacute;chas le baint as an chaint a chualamar ansin.</P>
        <P>Each morning on the Order of Business we have one minute of glory to talk about different issues.  When we start to talk about the economy, it is clear we are dealing only in sound bites.  We must accept that we are dealing with an exceptionally complex issue.  It is easy to talk wisely with hindsight but in years to come when we ask what was our reaction to the recession and the economic crisis here several issues will become clear.  It took us a long time to get out of denial that we had a problem, possibly because the recession hit us so quickly.  We were in denial that this was a global problem, which it is.  When we could not accept that we were wasting time again.  Then the blame game went on for a long time.  The media, in the main, did not crown themselves with glory.  Many will look back and say there were many missed opportunities to respond positively, and where necessary, with compassion, to this recession.</P>
        <P>People on both sides of this House are well aware that many things happen in the background that very often cannot be made public until the appropriate time.  We cannot act in isolation from Europe because we have benefited so much from the EU structures.  Thanks be to God, we will have a good infrastructure when, I hope, there will be an upturn in the economy soon.  Unless we retain the confidence of the European Union we will go nowhere.  That must form part of every debate we hold.</P>
        <P>Everyone here could spend ten or 15 minutes on the blame game but that will not make a positive contribution.  We have had good times.  The Celtic tiger was good to many.  Our employment rate is exceptional by any measure.  We should not forget that but we should think about how to protect those jobs and help those who have recently lost their jobs or who will never have jobs and will depend on social welfare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have seen a great sea-change in competitiveness in a short time.  For example, one sees hotels offering bargains every day in the newspapers.  They seem to have adopted the attitude that it is better to have full capacity in a hotel, and keep all the workers there, than have two <Col N="771"/>thirds unused and let many workers go.  I can see that clearly and that hotels are competing with one another.  There is a new culture.  There is no doubt that we had crossed a line in pricing.  It seemed as if we were pulling prices out of the air.  The same could be true of other areas, for instance, the construction industry, which is experiencing a downturn.  It was quite clear that from a competitive point of view we were pricing ourselves out of the market and worse still putting those excessive prices onto the shoulders of many young people.</P>
        <P>I am not criticising hotels, the construction industry or any other sector.  That was typical of the Celtic tiger era.  It is important to see how people are prepared to respond to this.  I am glad to say that denial is gone.  The blame game has been diluted and people are focusing in a more positive way on our present situation.  I will not enter into discussion with Senator Fidelma Healy-Eames because, as I said in the c&uacute;pla focail Gaeilge, we want to hear everybody&rsquo;s point of view.  However, when one throws a word like hope around loosely but speaks in negative terms and undermines every single positive proposal brought forward one will not raise hope but do quite the opposite.</P>
        <P>This struck me recently in respect of the flooding crisis.  The Taoiseach is involved in many issues, not just the economy, yet he travelled the length and breadth of this country to identify with the people and their problems.  He made himself available, travelling to every flood area but somebody picked out the small point that he did not have his wellington boots with him.  That might sound funny in other times but it is not a bit funny because that kind of response to leadership shows a degree of irresponsibility.</P>
        <P>I also salute the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Mansergh, who has been at the coalface, although I know that is the wrong term for flooding.  He was available to listen to the people and to bring back their views.  Let us respond positively when we see people being proactive about any problem or issue.  The flooding crisis is attached to the economic problem because it will involve a high cost.  That will be thrown back onto the Exchequer.  People responded negatively to the Government&rsquo;s announcement of its first &euro;10 million measure rather than waiting to see whether it was a roll-out rescue effort, which it obviously was.  Did people expect that without any assessment of the problem we would name a figure, as if that was the way to solve the flooding problem?  I hope we are going to get into a new frame of mind, to think how we can all work together.</P>
        <P>Since the day when the recession became official I have said repeatedly to many fine people on the Opposition side who hold the same views that this was one time when we should all work together, leave political point-scoring to one side and think particularly of those who are most vulnerable.  I have no doubt there are anomalies in the social welfare system and that corrective measures are required but there are some people within that net who are exceptionally vulnerable and helpless to whom &euro;3, &euro;4 or &euro;5 could make a serious difference.  We must ensure the caring element remains within the budget.  I saluted the Taoiseach when he indicated that pensions for the elderly were unlikely to be hit.  At least that is how we all interpreted his remarks.  It struck me straightaway that the Taoiseach was sending out a message that in spite of our drastic condition there would be a caring element in the budget.  I would like to see that extended to other areas.</P>
        <P>There is absolutely no <i>&agrave; la carte</i> formula for getting out of the recession.  We must examine all the challenges we face, including the public sector, which is a very powerful body as we saw in the number that came out on the streets.  It has made a major contribution to the development of this country and we are particularly lucky in the calibre of people we have in the public service.  If, however, one has a secure job and a guaranteed pension one sleeps fairly well at night.  One may have to tighten one&rsquo;s belt a little but in the main one can do that by being a little more careful with expenditure.  The person who exists on &euro;200 plus a week, particularly <Col N="772"/>if he or she had a job or another lifestyle, has a limited chance of being animated or energised now.  We must appeal to those who have jobs to think of those who do not.</P>
        <P>We must also believe in ourselves.  Throughout history we have overcome many challenges.  This is not the greatest challenge we have ever faced.  The mere fact that we were successful in passing the Lisbon treaty shows that we have maintained our status in Europe; therefore, we are part of a bigger structure on which we can depend.  I have seen many of the statements that have come from the European Union and have no doubt that the Commission is happy with the approach we are taking.</P>
        <P>We will only have hope if we are realistic; tell it as it is; try to be fair to everybody, especially those who are most vulnerable and are competitive.  Above all else, we will only have hope if everybody regards himself or herself as part of a partnership.  I would include in that partnership employers, trade unions, the media and public representatives.  If we do not do this, we will not attract investors to help us to get back to a strong position.  We will not succeed in holding onto confidence which we have in international markets.  The foundation for all of this must be social partnership.</P>
        <P>I heard at lunchtime that there was a possibility of substantial progress in the talks with the unions.  The greatest sign of hope for the people would be the bringing back of social partnership to centre stage.  We should encourage the social partners to go down that road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say few words in this debate.  I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his contribution.  I can identify with much of what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said on the issue.  There is no doubt we all have a vested interest in returning the economy to sustainable growth as quickly as possible.  As the Minister of State pointed out, everybody has been and will be affected by the deterioration in the economy.</P>
        <P>One of our primary concerns must be the creation and protection of jobs.  That is essential if we are to get the economy back on a growth path.  We need to reduce the burden on the State caused by the large number of unemployed and get them back into gainful employment.  In my area we have been greatly affected not just by the flooding, but also by a great decline in tourism, which has been very damaging to jobs, morale and confidence.  It has been an extremely challenging year in the industry, particularly in sectors such as golf tourism, and the suffering is likely to continue into 2010.  We urgently need help to mitigate the challenges we face.</P>
        <P>As golf tourism becomes ever more competitive internationally, increased Government support, through financing promotional initiatives by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, is ever more vital to restore Ireland&rsquo;s position as a leading golf destination.  We have suffered terribly in this regard.  Given climate change and other factors, perhaps it will continue to decline and we will not be able to control it.  Therefore, more emphasis may have to be put on walking holidays and many other activities which are equally important.  The removal of the &euro;10 airport tax on tourists would go a long way to encouraging tourism.  Reducing the VAT rate to comparable levels in the United Kingdom to improve our competitiveness would also make us more attractive to British tourists, as there has been a significant fall in the number of tourists from Britain in 2009 and this trend will continue in 2010.</P>
        <P>We are all very concerned about what has happened in the retail sector and the fact that a number of our own citizens are travelling north of the Border.  We need no further increases in indirect taxes.  The impact of an increase in the rate of VAT on goods would further depress consumer spending here.  I hope the Government will take action on the issue in the budget.  An increase in the rate of VAT would drive more consumers to the North and make it <Col N="773"/>extremely difficult for retailers to compete on what is already a very unequal playing field.  We need to restore balance.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to reduce regulatory charges, including water and waste charges, commercial rates and other levies for specific sections of industry.  There is a necessity to reduce the cost of complying with obligations on businesses, which costs need to be driven down by central government as part of an initiative to control costs, encourage businesses to survive, reduce the regulatory burden and enhance competitiveness.  We have lost out greatly in this respect.</P>
        <P>Controlling public spending is absolutely vital.  We need to modify the social welfare system to encourage people to work.  We also need to encourage banks to make credit available to SMEs and the Government to clamp down on illegal tobacco and alcohol sales which are causing huge losses of revenue to the Exchequer.  Specific measures are needed in the budget to keep local businesses afloat and people in jobs, the most critical issue for our economic well being.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made a good contribution and I look forward to something positive in the budget.  He has held out the promise that good measures will be introduced in it.  If that is the case, we will welcome them.  However, a major reduction in excise duties and VAT is vital for the future of the economy.  As consumer confidence is very fragile, we urgently need a stimulus to restore it.  It is critical, therefore, that the Government does not increase taxes in the budget and that the bulk of the adjustment to be made to the public finances is on the spending side.</P>
        <P>In the last year 30,000 jobs have been lost in retailing.  Consumers must be encouraged to spend.  Members of the public are now saving 12% of disposable income and need to be encouraged to spend some of this in order to create employment and give the economy a boost.  This can be done by convincing them that they will not face increases in taxation and through proactive measures to encourage spending.  The minimum required is a reduction in the rate of VAT to the same level as in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that there was a huge failure in the banking system.  The banks fuelled the greed.  What they did was inexcusable.  There is a perception that developers and bankers created the bubble but, in fact, they destroyed the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>The failure and reluctance on the part of some in high society such as judges and the heads of various important public bodies and quangos to take a pay cut are totally inexcusable and lead to a sense of injustice.  No one can excuse himself or herself and stand aside from this national effort.  The taxpayer simply can no longer afford the luxury to which the people concerned have become accustomed.</P>
        <P>There has not been a proper clear-out at the top of the banks, at director or management level, which is doing nothing to restore the confidence of the average taxpayer.  The Minister needs to exercise more control and authority in this regard.</P>
        <P>Flexibility and changes in work practices to reduce the overall cost of and improve services to the public, as well as the removal of restrictive practices which have been hugely damaging, need to be tackled urgently.  The figure being spoken of, namely, &euro;1.3 billion on the spending side, is a mere stumble in the right direction.  If the necessary medicine is meted out equitably, the people will accept it, which is in keeping with the tenor of the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks.  I hope that will be the outcome of the budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, who is a regular visitor to the House.  </P>
        <P>Senator Twomey dealt with the issue of jobs.  One of the few ways we can hope to get the economy moving again is to create jobs which should be export-led.  It is all about taking people from the dole queues, as we need to reduce the cost to the Exchequer.  There are very few ways we can do this other than by creating jobs in industry, the services sector and tourism.  Senator Coghlan referred to tourism and I fully concur with what he said.</P>
        <P>I come from County Mayo where in the best ten years for growth in the history of the State only ten jobs were created in industry.  That is an indictment of the Government and the way it treated County Mayo in those ten years.  That said, a considerable number of jobs were created in the services industry and construction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That brings me to tourism.  Senator Coghlan is correct that we have the product, whether it is fishing or golf.  Only today I received a golf magazine from a company in Dublin which has put together packages incorporating hotel accommodation, golf and evening meals.  There is unbelievable value to be had compared to some years ago but we are not marketing the industry properly.  There is no doubt F&aacute;ilte Ireland has fallen down in this regard.  As I have said on a number of occasions in the House, we have the product &mdash; walking holidays, the best fishing in Europe and the best golf courses in the world.  We also have access through the airports at Dublin, Knock, Shannon, Galway, Cork, Kerry and Donegal.  Using tax breaks, we have built a vast number of hotels throughout the length and breath of the country.  We also have better roads, rail and other facilities.  I heard the managing director of Aer Arann being interviewed on television last weekend by Ivan Yates.  The managing director said there were 26 agencies dealing with tourism in the west, which is completely ridiculous.  That is where we have fallen down.  We need to merge all of these agencies into one, two or three which could sell tourism &mdash; an international product &mdash; in international markets.</P>
        <P>On previous occasions I have raised the issue of banking with the Minster for Finance and the Minster of State.  Yesterday we saw the value of bank shares fall drastically in the markets because it transpired that, while it was thought the figure for the haircut would be 18%, it would be 25%.  As Senator Norris said, this will require an injection of a further &euro;1 billion by the Government which will take a bigger share in the Irish banks.  It already owns Anglo Irish Bank and will take a major shareholding in Irish Nationwide also as part of its amalgamation.  It will also take a larger shareholding in AIB and Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>This leads me to the point I raised about charges.  I am led to believe various accountancy firms working in some of these institutions, particularly Irish Nationwide which will be wound up, are charging &euro;3,500 a day for their services.  I would like the Minister of State to confirm this.  If that is the case, we are again going down the route taken by the tribunals.  Several Senators referred to the charges being applied.  While I received no answer from the Minister or the Minster of State on previous occasions, I am led to believe these are the charges levied by the companies operating in the various institutions.  Some &euro;3,500 a day is being charged to evaluate loans and properties that will probably be transferred to NAMA from the institutions which will be amalgamated.  Somebody has to be take charge.  The Minister for Finance has the powers available to him to take charge and make sure the taxpayer is not ripped off.  We are considering taking a few euro off those on the dole and not paying the Christmas bonus, yet, at the same time, we are throwing &euro;3,500 a day at the senior partners in some of these firms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have listened to a lot of the discussion here about what should and should not be done in the budget.  The most important point is that there be an element of fairness.  The people understand there will be hardship and <Col N="775"/>are ready to take a stand for it.  However, they have to be convinced that what is being done is fair.</P>
        <P>I heard my colleague, Senator Quinn, for whom I have great respect, say recently in the House that people might ask in the future, &ldquo;What did you do in the time of great economic crisis?&rdquo; and that the only answer would be, &ldquo;I went out on strike for a day.&rdquo;  This shows a complete lack of understanding.  I spoke to people on the day of the strike last week and the one question that came through time and again was, &ldquo;What did we do to deserve this?&rdquo;  There are answers on both sides and they can be dealt with.  However, the most significant part is that we looked at the situation as matters stood and we made the best of things as we went along.</P>
        <P>Last week I heard the contribution on radio of a woman representative of a large private sector group, IBEC, a diligent body with which I do not have a problem.  However, I was astonished when, in the context of rubbishing the public sector, she said it would be those in the private sector who would help us to work our way out of the recession.  I said to myself that this might well be true, but I then waited for the next bit, for somebody to ask who got us into this mess in the first place.  Who was it?  It was the banks and the developers, not the public sector.  The people who caused this crisis were in the private sector.  We all understand and acknowledge this because that is the way it happened.</P>
        <P>As I know the Minister of State has been a great advocate and defender of the public sector, I am not saying this in a personal way.  However, it is important that, in striking a balance, when people talk about pay levels in the public sector, we should also talk about the tax breaks made available to the private sector at the same time.  It is important that we remember the banks shovelled out money.  We should also look at the efforts made to allow developers to do things which perhaps they should not have done.</P>
        <P>People have asked me whether I was involved in the benchmarking process.  I certainly was.  The choice was very simple at the time &mdash; would the public sector stand by and see everybody else take his or her share of the cake?  This was at a time when people had joined the public sector as a teacher, nurse, civil servant, garda, etc. and realised they were not being paid as much as those in the private sector.  They acknowledged the job security and the process by which they paid for their pensions.  They pay for them over a period of 40 years.</P>
        <P>There is talk of people leaving the public sector with a package.  I told a story recently about a guy I knew who had been in the private sector but had not worked for 35 years.  When he became eligible for the State pension, he received a pension package worth &euro;270,000.  If we use the media method of working out the cost of pensions, that is what it costs to give a person the non-contributory old-age pension.  Somebody who has paid into a pension fund for 40 years is portrayed as having a package worth &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 and suddenly ripping off the country.  There is something wrong about this.  There should be balance.  A couple of weeks ago in this Chamber Members said there was no chance of public service unions doing a deal with the Government or accepting a reduction in pay packets and no chance of peace.  We are within hours of such a deal.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator MacSharry, announced that Thursday&rsquo;s strike was off.  That may have been made previous to the announcement but he was probably right.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s last point, one of the last points I made in my opening contribution was that we would bring forward policies in the forthcoming budget to ensure the burden of adjustment was spread as fairly as possible.  That is something common to us all.</P>
        <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate which has been constructive.  I do not propose to attempt to answer all of the points made but would like to pick up on a few issues.  In a rather interesting contribution Senator O&rsquo;Donohue suggested the Government was bringing forward a notion that there was no alternative.  I can think of many alternatives, four of which I will mention.  We could put off taking serious action or spread it out over a long period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that not result in the IMF coming in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The second option is that we could abdicate altogether, default on our debts and let the IMF come in.  The third option, advocated by Senators Quinn and Walsh, is that the Government could go in far harder.  The suggestion was that it was not a figure of &euro;4 billion that was required but &euro;5 billion, &euro;8 billion or another figure.  The fourth alternative is for the Government to put much more emphasis on increasing taxes and less on expenditure reductions.  The difficulty with that option is that increasing tax rates would not necessarily lead to an increase in the tax yield; it might even diminish it.</P>
        <P>Apart from the political points made at the beginning of his contribution, Senator Twomey gave a very sound analysis of the seriousness of the position in which we find ourselves.  I largely agree with him on the need for action.  There was a point debated in the background and the Senator used the word &ldquo;hubris&rdquo;.  He said we had over-extended, become over-ambitious and unrealistic about our prospects and that we should have taken action earlier.  I agree.</P>
        <P>I do not accept Senator Mullen&rsquo;s notion which has been propagated that in the time of the former Taoiseach, in particular, the answer to every demand was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Senator O&rsquo;Toole will remember the nurses&rsquo; strike in 2007, when the answer was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I remember an occasion five or six years before when the ASTI did not want benchmarking and engaged in a prolonged action and the Government held perfectly firm.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is absolutely correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Oversimplified caricatures are being painted of past events.  </P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Twomey that we should use GNP as a gauge and made sure such a reference was inserted in my contribution.  I also agree with Senator MacSharry that one of our main aims must be to try to secure as many as possible of the underlying gains made since 1987.  We will have to take one or more steps back in order to ensure we can take steps forward in the future.  I also agree with him in his comments about broadening the tax base.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There were contributions on indirect taxes and the Border.  My comments are without prejudice to decisions that might be made one way or another in the budget.  A 2.5% increase in the rate of VAT in Northern Ireland is due to take effect in January, as the cut in the British VAT rate was temporary.  There is speculation that further into next year, possibly following a change of government, the rate will rise even further.  One of the main difficulties with the 0.5% increase in the VAT rate last year was that it might have advertised differences with the rate in Northern Ireland but underlying differences include the exchange rate and price factors independent of tax and exchange rates.  That point has been well demonstrated.</P><Col N="777"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I agree with Senator Hanafin in his contention that we can bounce back and we will do so more quickly if we take the right action now.  I also agree with Senator Boyle that incomes have become too high in comparison with those in other places.  That was part of the logic in joining the single currency.  There is little doubt, however, that incomes have fallen in the public and private sectors.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole acknowledged, there is no antagonism towards the public service.  That is true of the vast majority of Government Members.  We recognise the great contribution it has made, as we have seen recently in the response to the flooding throughout the country.  Volunteers and various branches of the public service have come together and done a fantastic job in dealing its effects.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White expressed a sentiment which almost sounded like a sound bite but I agree that our measure of success should not be the suffering of the people.  This is not a gratuitous or masochistic exercise; we are only doing what is absolutely necessary.  If one likes, it is being done to secure the future viability of the State, economic independence and control over our own decisions.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the strike has been called off, or at least that is the information passed on to me.  When the second day of action was announced last week, I felt the unions were putting pressure on nobody but themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I think that was the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Nobody would be more delighted than me if a way could be found to achieve the cuts required in the public service pay bill on a consensual basis.  That would be wonderful.</P>
        <P>I appreciate this is a slight diversion, but Senator Norris tends to divert from some of the main points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

	<P>He talked about the departure of a number of senior public servants.  I attended the farewell dinner for the president of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors last week.  </P>
        <P>We would all like to be in a position to restore the Christmas bonus, but that is not realistic.  The Senator also spoke about ODA for Uganda, but no decision has been made in that regard; only discussions have taken place.  I would be surprised if the Government proceeded with it.</P>
        <P>I have covered as many points as I can.  I thank Senators for engaging in a constructive debate, which tends to be the norm in this House.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 1 proposes the deletion of a definition of the core strategy.  However, the evidence-based core strategy is a cornerstone of the Bill as it ensures a sound development plan, which is a key to ensuring good planning at local level, and a central plank to zoning reform.  Decisions taken at the development planning stage affect all other planning decisions.  This amendment was considered on Committee Stage and my position remains that the proposed amendment is not acceptable.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I spoke at length on this on Second and Committee Stages.  We in Fine Gael see no logical reason for changing the wording from a simple &ldquo;majority&rdquo; to a vote of &ldquo;not less than two-thirds&rdquo;.  Later in the Bill the Minister proposes to reduce the quorum required for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, based on the same principle.  We feel that leads to a democratic deficit and the legislation as proposed by the Minister gives more power to the minority within local authorities.  It should be retained as a simple majority and this is the reason for this amendment.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, are related to the issue of the higher two thirds majority as opposed to a simple majority which was discussed at length last week.  I found the Committee Stage debate on this issue very constructive and I have reflected further on the issues raised.  As I have clarified, it was intended to ensure that any further changes proposed by Members to amendments to the draft development plan that had been subject to public consultation, namely, the second consultation period, were to be subject to a higher approval threshold because such changes would not be subject to any further public scrutiny.  It was always intended that a simple majority vote by the members would be all that is required as is currently the case in respect of all other stages in the development planning process as I have already outlined.  This is also the position in the case of variations to development plans, namely, where such changes would not be subject to any further public scrutiny.  Nevertheless, I am minded to introduce a substantive amendment to clarify further and provide that the voting change to the development planning process will only apply in such instances.  Unfortunately, in light of the tight timeframe, it is not possible to revert to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with specific proposals to seek further legal advice.  I assure the Senator that I have taken fully into consideration his strong input into this element of the debate.  I will address it accordingly on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and report back to the Seanad at a later stage, in light of the discussions initiated here.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response which I regard as fairly positive.  He has certainly listened to the debates and the concerns of Senators and their views on this issue.  This is fundamentally an issue of democracy running to the heart of local democracy and the manner in which local authorities conduct their business with regard to development plans.  The existing legislation is more than adequate in this regard.  Every local authority elects its chair and mayor by a simple majority vote.  It is the democratic decision of that local authority and it should be no different in this legislation.  As this is a strongly held view, I will be pressing the amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, lines 19 to 36, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo; in line 19 down to and including &ldquo;variation&mdash;&rdquo; in line 36 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;and a resolution to make any such further modification (other than a further modification recommended or accepted by the Manager) shall require approval by two-thirds of the members of the authority concerned, and in addition such further modification&mdash;&rdquo;.</P><Col N="780"/>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment deals with two issues raised on Committee Stage.  First, the Minister of State indicated that his intention was only to apply the two thirds rule to modifications to amendments that would not require further consultation and not to apply it to all amendments to the manager&rsquo;s draft of the development plan.  The amendment achieves that purpose.  The Bill, as initiated, was too sweeping in curtailing councillors&rsquo; powers to amend the draft plan.</P>
        <P>Second, we seek to ensure the two thirds rule will not apply to modifications to amendments the manager agrees to or proposes.  Sometimes amendments are proposed by the manager and sometimes he or she will accept an amendment suggested by someone else.  The Bill&rsquo;s provisions mean the manager&rsquo;s amendments will be defeated unless two thirds of councillors vote in favour.  A simple majority should be more than adequate at least for the amendments accepted by the manager.  The Bill is hugely bureaucratic, as it will make it cumbersome to pass an amendment to which no one is opposed.  Such an amendment cannot even be passed by acclamation because a roll call vote will be legally required to establish that two thirds of the overall membership have voted for it.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to this issue on Committee Stage.  It is ludicrous to seek a two thirds majority when a simple majority is required currently.  This provision will give a small rump on a council significant authority and this should not be allowed.  A small number of people could block or promote a development.  A simple majority is more than sufficient.  It has served us well up to now and I cannot see the reason for requiring a two thirds majority other than it might appease the Minister, his colleagues in the Green Party and like minded people who might acquire one third of the votes to block development.  I am surprised Government colleagues are going along with this.  I hope the Minister of State, following the deliberations he said he would undertake following Committee Stage, will shoot this duck in the water and accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>It is no harm to say something a second time even though I thought I made my position clear a few moments ago.  Amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, refer to a higher two thirds majority as opposed to a simple majority.  We discussed this at length last week.  The debate on Committee Stage on this matter was very constructive and I reflected further on the issues raised.

It was always intended that a simple majority vote by the local authority members would be all that was required, as is currently the case in respect of all other stages in the development planning process.  This is also the case in respect of variations to the development plans, namely where such changes would not be subject to further public scrutiny.

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, to delete lines 10 to 45 and in page 17, to delete lines 1 to 16.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister said during the debate on an earlier Stage that:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . the mandatory population threshold for preparing local area plans . . . [should be] raised from 2,000 to 5,000 persons.  The preparation of local area plans is resource intensive, involving consultation with both the elected members and the general public.  Such resources are best used when an area is likely to undergo significant development on a greenfield site or redevelopment on a brownfield site.</P><Col N="782"/>
        <P FLI="0">We in Fine Gael believe there is no logic or reason as to why this threshold should be changed.  The 2,000 population threshold is sufficiently adequate and communities, villages and towns throughout the country are entitled to have their local area plans formulated by local authorities on a statutory footing, as has been the case up to now.  Increasing the population threshold from 2,000 to 5,000 absolves the obligation on an authority to have local area plans for those towns and villages.</P>
        <P>As I said during the debates on Second and Committee Stages, every town and village should be entitled to reach its full potential and should have the hope and aspiration to develop to the best of its ability, as should any individual or community.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State pointed out that nothing is stopping the local authorities from having local area plans, but this measure effectively will remove the statutory obligation on them to do so.  The existing legislation, which provides for a threshold of 2,000, is more than adequate.  That is the reason we have proposed this amendment and we will press it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I listened to what the Minster of State said during the debate on an earlier Stage.  As Senator Coffey said, what is proposed will change the statutory obligation on local authorities.  The flooding during the past two weeks illustrated the need to maintain the <i>status quo.</i>  Population centres of 2,000 and fewer require their own specific plan.  I heard what the Minister of State said because I was in the Chamber when he spoke.  There is no rationale for what he is trying to achieve.  What is proposed in the legislation in this respect will result in the creation of a two-tier community.  A dormant sleeper type development will be created.  There is an obligation on the Minister of State, as the responsible line Minister, in conjunction with the authorities to make sure we have a sustainable community-led planning process which allows smaller, urban and rural communities to have their own development plan and local area plan.</P>
        <P>I cite the Marsh community, which is part of Cork city, as a microcosm in this respect.  If that community was in the middle of rural Cork, it would be absorbed into the wider, bigger catchment area and would be lost and forgotten.  That is the fundamental point.  I appeal to the Green members in the Chamber not to sell out the small community.  It is imperative that the Minister of State listens to this point.  This is about creating sustainable communities.  It is about helping people in small communities, as Senator Coffey said, to have the plans and aspirations of people living in a big metropolis or a big urban town.  If this amendment is not accepted, the situation will be different.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn asked if a matter might be considered when the Bill goes to the other House.  If the Minister of State does not accept this amendment, I ask that he reflects upon it and accepts such a proposal in the other House, as this is an important amendment.</P>

	<P>The proposal to raise the mandatory population threshold for preparing local area plans from 2,000 to 5,000 persons provoked some good discussion.  I recognise the issues raised as to the possibility of no new local area plans being put forward in some instances because the population may fall below the threshold, even though a local area plan would have been prepared previously for an area.  I am therefore minded to give this matter further consideration with a view to, if necessary, bringing forward a proposal on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and reporting back to the Seanad at a later stage in light of the discussion initiated here on Committee Stage and today.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  I am pleased he has listened and I trust he will introduce amendments on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We would have preferred the amendments to be tabled in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and we flagged our difficulty with this matter at an early stage, some weeks ago in the discussion on Second Stage.  It is important that Ministers and officials give due recognition to the contributions of Senators to be fair to the Seanad and the input from Senators on all sides.  Where genuine concerns are raised concerning legislation we would appreciate if the amendments could be introduced to this House.  However, I am willing to accept the thrust of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments and we will not press the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 21, to delete lines 16 to 45 and in page 22, to delete lines 1 to 19.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We propose to delete the sections related to the report of the regional authority and the preparation of draft development plans because of the top-down approach to planning this legislation will foster.  All city and county development plans will be required by law to comply with regional authority guidelines.  Previously, I outlined that the regional authorities as currently structured do not have the resources to formulate development plans in the same manner, on the same consultative basis and with the same representative basis as local county and city development plans.  I pointed out that regional authority members are essentially delegations from local authorities, not directly elected from the regions.  They do not advocate the interests of the wider region.</P>
        <P>I recognise they have a role in co-ordinating local authorities and the way development plans progress within a given region.  However, we believe this is a step too far and that it represents a top-down approach with which we are not satisfied.  This is why we propose the deletion of a large section referring to regional authorities.  We believe it would create an unfair hierarchy of planning and that a bottom-up approach is preferable.  As I outlined previously, improvements are required in planning laws and in the way in which development plans are formulated.  However, we believe this is not the correct approach and that it further removes the formulation of plans from local people, communities and local elected representatives, who are directly elected every five years.  This is why we propose the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, are not acceptable for the reasons outlined already.  Regional planning guidelines are the linchpin between the national spatial strategy, which sets the broader strategic planning framework at central Government level, and local planning, which sets the local context for development planning and management.  The amendments provide for regional authorities to participate in a consultation process in the pre-draft development plan preparation, the draft development plan and variations to the development plan, to ensure a consistency between the plans and the regional planning guidelines in force.</P>
        <P>Taking account of the points made on Committee Stage and today, I stress that regional planning guidelines represent a combination of top-down and bottom-up content.  While <Col N="784"/>regional planning guidelines are required to give effect to the national spatial strategy objectives at regional level, especially in respect of gateway and hub towns, they also reflect specific regional priorities.  These include regional economic strategies to address identified strengths and weaknesses within a region, for example, within the mid west; regional flood management, for example, where a river catchment crosses a county boundary or boundaries; and conservation of built and natural heritage within a region, for example, in areas of high scenic value.  These regional priorities are identified by the elected members and the regional planning authority officials and are fed into the regional planning guidelines drafting process at an early stage, that is, the publication of the regional planning guidelines issues paper.</P>
        <P>The draft regional planning guidelines are prepared on foot of this public consultation and the feedback from the members of the regional authority will eventually provide approval to go to public consultation on the final draft guidelines.  On foot of this second round of public consultation, the draft guidelines are modified as necessary and subsequently adopted by the members of the regional authority as the final regional planning guidelines.  Therefore, these amendments are not accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister of State will not accept the amendment.  We have serious reservations about this part of the Bill.  We believe that in practice it will neutralise the potential of many local authorities because it will make all of them appear bland and the same within a given region.  Let us consider any given region.  Every local authority in every city or county within that region has their own strengths and weaknesses.  This is an effort to have consistency within a region and all local authorities are considered to be the same and will be managed from the top down.  We have serious reservations about this in practice.</P></Speaker>

	<P>Amendment No. 11 proposes to delete the proposed amendments to section 28 of the principal Act in respect of strengthening the requirements for the planning authorities to adhere to rather than merely have regard to key statutory guidelines issued by the Minister under the section.  The amendments relate to the inclusion of more specific information in development plans and how a plan would implement the guidelines.  As I stated on Committee Stage, I will consider the text of this section again and, in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, consider whether further amendments are warranted to clarify and strengthen the status of my Department&rsquo;s planning guidelines.</P></Speaker>

        <P LI="1">In page 26, to delete lines 35 to 39.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Our concern is that reference is made in the section to an inspector.  However, no definition or indication is given as to who such an inspector should be.  It is not clear whether it is intended that the Minister would have the power to appoint a completely new category of inspector or if it is intended an inspector would be appointed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This is a technical amendment to bring clarity to the Bill because it is not clear from the wording and it could be open to challenge in future.  Our advice is there should be clarity and this is the reason for the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 12 proposes the deletion of the proposed new subsection 31(12) which would remove the selection criteria for the inspector to be appointed by the Minister to report to him or her on the draft direction.  There must be an over-arching criteria which would determine if a person is experienced and qualified to act as an inspector for the purpose of reporting to the Minister on planning and development issues.  Without such selection criteria, the inspector&rsquo;s report would not have credibility and it could be open to challenge.  Therefore, the amendment is not accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s point but he does not define who such an inspector should be, who would have the power to appoint such an inspector, or whether the inspector would be appointed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Will the Minister of State take this into account when he introduces the Bill in the Lower House?  It is a genuine attempt on the part of Fine Gael to bring clarity to the Bill.</P>

         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">The new section 31(19) to be inserted into the principal Act provides that, &ldquo;A planning authority shall make a direction issued to it under subsection (16) available for inspection by members of the public, during office hours, at the offices of the authority&rdquo;.  However, the subsection does not stipulate when this should be done.  Amendment No. 13 suggests it should be done within seven days.  No effort is made to specify for how long the direction to which the subsection refers should remain available for inspection.  These are basic omissions, particularly as confusion may arise with regard to the amount of time for which the direction should remain available for inspection.  A clear timeframe should be set down in the Bill.  I am open to correction by the Minister of State but I seem to recall his indicating on Committee Stage that he would examine this aspect of the Bill in the context of either introducing a timeframe or clarifying the position.</P>

      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>While the new section does not provide for a specific timeframe within which a final direction must be put on public display, I am considering a generic wording which would allow planning authorities to display directions in as timely a fashion as possible.

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>We flagged at a very early stage the need to ensure the wording was clear and that, as with the planning process, a specific timeframe was laid down.  The Houses can either produce legislation which is understandable and which works or we can produce that which causes great confusion among those &mdash; planners or members of the general public applying for planning permission &mdash; who will use it on a daily basis.  This is a basic omission.  There should be clarity.  We propose a timeframe of seven days but remain open to suggestions from the Minister of State in this regard.</P>
        <P>Members of the House are again proposing genuine amendments designed to try to improve the legislation.  However, all we are hearing in reply is that it may possible to amend the Bill when it goes to the D&aacute;il.  The Seanad is a separate House of Parliament and Members would appreciate it if Government amendments could be introduced here.  After all, the omission in respect of a timeframe was, in the first instance, raised in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue has been raised and debated in the Seanad and I am responding in that context.  If there is a need to amend the wording, it will be done on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Senators will appreciate that we are obliged to engage with the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General on matters of this nature.  It is not always possible to have matters adjudicated upon and dealt with in a short period.  However, it is important to state I provided the House with a commitment to the effect that I would have the matter examined by the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General.  I have shown the Seanad great respect.</P>

To insert the word &ldquo;connected&rdquo; would mean that the planning authority could only have regard to development carried out pursuant to a permission granted to the applicant or a connected person.  It would mean that the authority could not have regard to development carried out pursuant to a permission granted to a person other than a connected person.  The proposed amendment would therefore limit the scope to refuse permission on the basis of past performance and I do not accept it for that reason.</P>
        <P>My Department has sought the view of the Parliamentary Counsel on amendment No. 16.  Section 18(c) of the Interpretation Act provides: &ldquo;&rdquo;Person&rdquo; shall be read as importing a body corporate (whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole) and an unincorporated body of persons, as well as an individual, and the subsequent use of any pronoun in place of a further use of &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall be read accordingly&rdquo;.  I therefore consider the proposed amendment to be unnecessary.</P>
        <P>The Parliamentary Counsel believes amendment No. 17 would lead to inconsistency in the use of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 18 was discussed at length last week and, as I explained previously, under the current provisions planning permission may be refused to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous permission.  A development which is left substantially unfinished would represent non-compliance with the permission.  The proposed amendment is therefore unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it.  I acknowledge the concerns expressed by Senators about unfinished estates but this is a question of planning enforcement.  My Department will further consider whether the enforcement provisions in the legislation require amendment to strengthen the requirements on planning authorities and, if appropriate, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>In 2008, my Department issued comprehensive policy guidelines to planning authorities which emphasised the importance of taking all possible steps to compel the completion of estates.  These steps include the attachment of appropriate conditions to planning permission on the standards for roads, drainage and public lighting.  The guidelines also urged planning authorities to inspect residential developments during or shortly after construction to ensure they are properly completed.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s guidelines on bonds, which were discussed at some length last week, state that the amount of the security and the terms on which it is to be given must enable the planning authority to complete the necessary services in the event of default without giving rise to costs to itself.  The guidelines also state that the conditions must require that the lodgment of <Col N="789"/>a security be coupled with an agreement that would empower the planning authority to realise it at an appropriate time and to apply it to meeting the cost of completing the specific work.  My Department has not been made aware by planning authorities of any current problem in regard to bonds.  However, my officials will liaise with the County and City Managers Association to determine whether problems have arisen and, if so, whether they can assist through, for example, the circulation of relevant advice.  Data obtained by local authorities for the recently published fifth annual report on service indicators in local authorities indicate that more than 300 estates were taken in charge by local authorities in 2008.  Senators will agree this was a reasonably good performance.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn asked whether I would table a Government amendment on Report Stage to give locally elected members a role in directing county managers to take action against rogue developers.  As Senators will be aware, section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 allows elected members to direct managers to take any action which they may lawfully take as an executive function.  The Planning and Development Acts already place clear statutory obligations on planning authorities in regard to unauthorised development.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in response to written complaints about unauthorised developments except in the case of trivial or minor issues.  A statutory obligation also exists to carry out investigations and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority&rsquo;s decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where a decision is made not to issue a notice, the complainants must be informed.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 19 is a Government amendment which inserts &ldquo;accordingly&rdquo; whereas Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendment No. 20 proposes to insert &ldquo;on that basis&rdquo;.  It is the view of the Parliamentary Counsel that the word &ldquo;accordingly&rdquo; is more appropriate and would achieve the same effect as the Fine Gael amendment.  I commend amendment No. 19 to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive, and 20 are technical in nature.  I welcome the introduction of amendment No. 19 to address the issues raised by amendment No. 20.  The Minister of State has repeatedly agreed to consider bringing forward amendments in the D&aacute;il.  There is a feeling on this side of the House that we are being treated with a degree of contempt.  We raised many of these issues early in the Second and Committee Stage debates.  I begin to wonder why the Government initiates Bills here if it will not have clarity and amendments on time for debate here.  We saw that the Bill was rushed through Committee Stage and was left open-ended.  There is no genuine attempt to accept recommendations or amendments from Senators on all sides of this House.  That is not good enough.  We have something credible and genuine to offer but to a degree we are disregarded .  I hope the Minister of State and his officials might take that on board for future debates and Bills.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned unfinished estates.  They are a matter of concern.  We spoke at length about major infrastructure such as sewerage and water supply systems in unfinished estates.  I am amazed that local authorities are not telling the Minister of State that the bonds are inadequate.  Every Senator knows full well that they are inadequate.  Under previous planning legislation they were intended to address minor works in finishing an estate such as a missing public light or the final course on a piece of tarmacadam or a section of footpath, or correction of drainage covers.  The bonds collected will not cover the finishing of estates which are only half finished or where houses are built with no water supply or sewerage infrastructure.  When local authorities have tried to claim the bonds the banks, knowing the legislation inside out, have known full well that the planning permission must run its full term.</P>
       <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The Minister of State will put an amendment to increase the term for planning permission up to five years.  This will have implications for unfinished estates because the banks that hold <Col N="790"/>the bonds for those planning permissions will be within their rights to retain the bonds until the full five years of that extended permission passes.  This will create many problems for those living in estates who are lobbying hard to have those estates taken in charge by the local authority or to have the local authority force the developers to finish the estate.  The Minister of State and his officials need to be aware of the implications of this Bill and its impact.  I can understand why he is tabling an amendment to extend the permission to five years but will address that later.  It will, however, have an impact on unfinished estates and delay the rights of council to draw down the bonds which are totally insufficient.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the Minister of State issue a circular to all local authorities.  There is no reason why the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who issued a circular to local authorities about councillors&rsquo; expenditure on conferences, should not issue a similar circular on a major issue such as unfinished estates and bonds, requiring them to submit or furnish information regarding the number of unfinished estates in their jurisdictions, the amount of outstanding bonds due to them and their view on whether those bonds will be adequate to finish the estates to an acceptable level.  Many issues surround this section that will have far-reaching implications.  One of the biggest challenges facing local authorities and councillors and more important, their communities who live in these unfinished housing estates, is trying to finish those estates.  This requires the Department&rsquo;s and Minister&rsquo;s special attention.  He could in early course send out that circular and get the information in as soon as possible.  I am amazed that local authorities are not telling the Minister of State that bonds are an issue because they most certainly are a serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Much has been said about unfinished estates and it is widely acknowledged that they pose a major problem.  The Minister of State contends that the power exists and that the problem lies in planning law enforcement but the problem does exist.  He says that our amendment No. 18 is not necessary.  What is the problem in putting the phrase we suggest into the Bill, even if an interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;not in compliance with a previous permission&rdquo; could include unfinished estates?  Given that in so many cases it has not been used as it should be, why can the Minister of State not accept our amendment?  This is a very important aspect of planning and is a daily problem for communities and residents of estates.  It is so important that we ask the Minister of State to reconsider his view and accept this amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject totally the suggestion that I am treating this House with contempt as Senator Coffey indicates.  I have given the view of Parliamentary Counsel on three of the four amendments with which we are dealing.  That is a fair achievement since last Wednesday.  Any changes or amendments made in the D&aacute;il will have to come back to this House because the Bill originated here.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Ryan I acknowledge the concerns of Senators about unfinished estates and planning enforcement.  My Department will consider again whether enforcement provisions of the Act require amendment in order to further strengthen the requirements of the planning authorities.  If appropriate I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Any such amendment will be open to debate at a further Report Stage in the Seanad.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>
        <P>If there is a deficiency in bonds in some local authorities they are not following the guidelines that my Department issued in 2008.  The local authorities have a responsibility to ensure they are implemented.  They are sent out as guidelines from the Department and the bonds are supposed to cover all the areas I mention.  I am prepared to consider this in respect of unfinished estates.  I appreciate the points being made.  Senator Ryan made a strong case about this on Committee Stage.  I am prepared to take further advice on it if we need to strengthen the requirements of the local authorities in regard to the enforcement provisions of the Act.</P>

	<P>Section 21 amends section 37H(2)(<i>c</i>) of the principal Act providing for the extension of cost recovery to pre-application scoping requests for environmental impact assessment for strategic infrastructure development cases under the Seventh Schedule of the principal Act.  This is in addition to cost recovery which is already in place for the strategic infrastructure cases that proceed to a full application and determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey opposed the entire section on Committee Stage on the basis of his concerns regarding costs and public confidence in the determination of such costs.  On Committee Stage, I confirmed that the applicant pays principle is the basis for the payment of costs under the strategic infrastructure Act.  This section provides for the recovery of costs associated with the pre-application stage for strategic infrastructure cases.  I also clarified that such costs can be offset against the formal strategic infrastructure application fee for those cases that proceed to a determination by the board.  We must remember that we are generally talking about large-scale strategic infrastructure projects in this instance.  It is unrealistic to expect the Exchequer to have to foot the bill for these costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 23 replaces section 42 of the principal Act.  The section provides for the extension of permission for a period not exceeding five years in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out but where there were commercial, economic or technical reasons beyond the control of the applicant which substantially mitigate against either the commencement or the development of the carrying out of substantial works.  On Committee Stage, I outlined the general purpose and intent of section 23, which provides for the extension of planning permissions in certain circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out.  I undertook to come back on Report Stage with an amendment which would set out more explicitly the conditionality attached to these provisions.  Amendment No. 22 now substitutes section 23 and will require the planning authority having to satisfy itself that there have been no significant changes in development objectives in the development plan, or in the regional development objectives in the regional planning guidelines, for the area of the regional authority since the date of the permission, such as the authority would not, as a result of these changes, grant an application for permission for the development as being in material contravention of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the authority.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 23, I can confirm I have sought the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel with regard to Senator Coffey&rsquo;s proposed amendment to delete &ldquo;each of&rdquo; from line 8 of page 31.  As I understand it, Senator Coffey&rsquo;s concern that the use of the aforementioned &ldquo;each of&rdquo; could possibly conflict with the use of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in paragraph (<i>a</i>) on line 9 and with the use of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 19.  I am satisfied, having received legal advice, that no such conflict arises as the use of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; and &ldquo;or&rdquo; arise only in the context of paragraph (<i>a</i>).  It remains the case under the amended section 42(1) that each of the requirements under paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>) must be complied with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I can see where Senator Coffey is coming from in regard to amendment No. 24, in practice it would be very difficult for a planning authority to determine the number of jobs that the use of a proposed development would create.  However, I would propose to use the statutory guidelines that will accompany this provision to ensure that the planning authorities have regard to the employment potential of developments where applications for an extension of permission are being considered.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 25, as I indicated on Committee Stage, there are many instances throughout the planning Act where entries must be made on the planning register.  Generally, no time limit is prescribed for making entries on the register or it is stated that the entry must be made as soon as may be, that is, as soon as possible.  I do not see any reason why a time limit of one week should be put on the entry of these particular details on the register when the registration of other details is not subject to a time limit.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 23 to 25, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 22 is a substantial Government amendment.  We on this side of the House outlined on Second Stage that we felt this Bill was not complete and we <Col N="795"/>forecast it would be heavily amended by the time it would leave the Seanad.  That has transpired and, as the Minister of State said, it will be amended further by the time it gets to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      
        <P>I referred earlier to bonds and the extension of the planning permission, and I wish to clarify the point further.  Bonds generally remain in place until an estate is taken in charge by the council.  In some cases, developers got into difficulties after a year or two of development and there were calls for the council to call in the bond in order to finish works on lighting, paths, green areas and even sewerage networks.  The bond does not allow for this and the legal advice is that unless it is specifically made a condition that something must be done by a particular date, the bond will last for the full length of the planning permission, which is normally five years.  Once a development has substantially commenced, a developer is entitled, by law, to seek an extension to complete it and the council must grant such an extension, usually for up to two years.  The legal advice is that the council cannot try to use the bond unless it has given the developer the opportunity to finish the development in the extended period allowed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We have the case that the period will be increased by a further five years under the new planning Bill.  Local authorities will be caught in a catch-22 and residents will not be able to understand why they cannot act.  Legal advice indicates that it would also be pointless for local authorities to try to acquire the bond if they have not gone down the enforcement route first.  In some instances, heavy enforcement by the council would put many developers out of business, which would be in nobody&rsquo;s interests, as the council would still not have the money to finish the estate.  There are implications in this for those living in unfinished estates with the extension of the period of planning permission from two to five years.  I can understand why an effort is being made to do this from an economic perspective.  I presume that in the current economic climate the hope is the economy will recover to a degree and enable developers to finish estates.  The downside is that local authorities will be restricted in trying to secure bonds when developers do not finish estates and where the extension of the period of planning permission is required.  I am marking the issue for the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I take on board the legal advice given to the Minister of State on amendment No. 23.  We were trying to ensure clarity on the wording and did not consider there was a need for the inclusion of the words &ldquo;each of&rdquo; and &ldquo;either&rdquo;.  In the light of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments, we are willing to withdraw the amendment.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to amendment No. 24 and has said he understands from where we are coming.  Planning authorities should not be limited to considering factors which conspire to prevent development, be they commercial, economic or technical.  They should be entitled to consider the proposed use of the development and whether such use is likely to lead to the creation of long-term and sustainable employment.  Within the current economic climate the generation of employment is critical.  Development which stimulates long-term job opportunities must be protected and encouraged by the planning system.  That is the reason we are proposing amendment No. 24, as it would allow planning authorities consider whether the proposed use of a development would lead to the creation of at least ten full-time jobs.  The Minister of State has indicated that the thrust of the amendment will be considered in guidelines.  We look forward to such a provision.  Will the Minister of State clarify his intentions in that regard?</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 25 is proposed in an effort by the Fine Gael Party to bring further clarity and a definitive timeframe to the Bill.  All planning practitioners, including planners, architects and draftspersons, and the general public should be clear on the defined time limits specified in the planning Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make two points.  With regard to determining the number of jobs to be created through the use of a proposed development, I have said I am prepared to consider statutory guidance in that respect to accompany the provisions included.  Members will see that with the Government amendment, a local authority will have much discretion with regard to an extension.  It is a matter for planning authorities to tie down the issue in the event that an extension is granted.  I would be amazed if a local authority did not write into the permission for an extension that there be some contract with regard to the bond.  I will have the matter looked at, as I do not want there to be a loophole when people are granted an extension that would lead to the bond going by default.  That is not the intention.  I will take advice on the matter and see if that is the case; if it is, I will have something further to say on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 32, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>i</i>) the provision of facilities for physical activity to promote a healthy lifestyle.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I know the Minister of State spoke on Committee Stage about how he supported the concept behind this amendment but he decided not to proceed with it at that stage.  I was disappointed about that.  I have an American friend who loves ice cream.  However, he feels very guilty whenever he has one but he is also a keep fit merchant.  Whenever he has an ice-cream cone, he obliges himself to walk 5 km.  He actually says it is 3.5 miles but I will stick to kilometres.  The reason I say this is if we provide space for exercise, we are likely to avail of the facility.  With many of the Americans I think of, he talks very strongly about prevention rather than cure when it comes to health issues.  There is the fundamental question of promoting a healthy lifestyle and exercise.  In that regard, we must allocate space to allow people to engage in such activity.  I have read the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments made on Committee Stage.  He indicated that planning authorities might levy a charge but we have an obligation, when developing, to make sure space is allocated.  We are not talking about the provision of facilities but the provision of enough space to enable people to walk, run or cycle.  It would not have to be a large space, but we should not develop in the future without taking this matter into account.</P>
        <P>Obesity poses one of the major threats to 21st-century lifestyles.  If we are to make a healthier lifestyle a way of life for our population, we must give people opportunities.  This would be one of the simple ways of achieving such a goal and it would not carry a cost.  The amendment merely stipulates that space should be provided.  It is worded simply and seeks &ldquo;the provision of facilities for physical activity to promote a healthy lifestyle&rdquo;.  It would not place a heavy onus on anybody.  It could include area in which people could do physical jerks in the morning, if they wanted to.  The provision is worthy of support.  I will be disappointed if the Minister of State responds in the way he has responded to a number of requests that he may take it into account and make changes in the D&aacute;il.  I remember when he was in this House and know he realises the importance attached to having a decision made in this House, particularly with a <Col N="797"/>Bill introduced, amended or discussed in the Seanad.  I will not use the words of Senator Coffey but it would show a certain degree of respect for the work put into legislation in this House.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to seriously consider the amendments which he has said he may take into account.  If we have an amendment proposed in this House, it should be given consideration here rather than in the D&aacute;il.  There may be occasions on which provisions need more attention but I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to the amendment I have proposed and accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment, as it makes a clear statement of intent.  We are used to local authorities dealing with the provision of obvious infrastructure and services; the legislation mentions substantial works, refurbishment, upgrading and enlargement, as well as the replacement of roads, car parks, sewers, wastewater and water treatment facilities.  I also welcome the inclusion of high capacity telecommunications infrastructure such as broadband which in this day and age is as essential as any other major service in a development.  The provision of school sites is also an important inclusion.  We welcome all these provisions.</P>
        <P>However, Senator Quinn has raised an important issue and perhaps we should send out a clear and strong message in the legislation that local authorities should be required to consider the provision of facilities for physical activity.  One of the biggest challenges facing society today is the rise in diabetes, obesity and other illnesses related to inactivity.  It makes sense for us to promote a healthy lifestyle infrastructure.  While on holiday in the North of Ireland during the summer, I noted that not only were parks provided in local areas but outdoor gym circuits were provided in the parks.  This physical infrastructure promotes a healthy lifestyle.  Not only were people walking in the parks, they were able to exercise because of the provision of the physical exercise infrastructure.</P>
        <P>This is a good amendment.  It encourages all of us to think outside the box about providing physical exercise infrastructure.  It would certainly be no harm to encourage local authorities, through making it a requirement in law, to include the provision of such facilities for communities.  They can only do good.  They are not overly expensive and would not involve huge costs for developers, local authorities or whoever would ultimately pay for them.  During the Committee Stage debate I was one of those who raised concerns about the implementation of the infrastructure requirements of the Bill and about where the costs would lie eventually.  I warned that first-time buyers might have to pay for much of the essential infrastructure.  I am sure they would welcome a small amount of the moneys they pay for their houses being spent on facilities for physical activity.  This would be bring a healthy, long-term sustainable benefit for them and local authorities.  I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party strongly supports this worthy amendment, especially at a time when there is a growing level of obesity, particularly among young people and adults.  We urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment in the Seanad and not to defer it until the legislation comes to the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 24 amends section 48 of the principal Act which provides for development contribution schemes to be drawn up by each planning authority and approved by the elected members following a public consultation process.  The Bill redefines the definition of public infrastructure and facilities to provide local authorities with greater flexibility to use development levies, if needed, on a broader range of infrastructure such as flood relief work, broadband provision and school sites.  Amendment No. 26 seeks to extend the definition of &ldquo;public infrastructure and facilities&rdquo; further to include the provision of facilities for physical <Col N="798"/>activity to promote a healthy lifestyle.  We discussed this amendment in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Acts already provide for the provision of facilities for physical activity.  There is nothing to prevent the locally elected members including such facilities in the development contribution scheme, if they so wish.  The Minister has already stated his intention to provide statutory guidance under section 28 of the planning Acts with regard to development levies.  This guidance will provide the appropriate mechanism to elaborate further on what is meant by recreational facilities and will include specifically, but not necessarily be confined to, the provision of facilities for physical activity to promote a healthy lifestyle.  It is the reserved function of the elected members in each authority to specify the nature of such facilities in their adopted scheme.  On that basis I will not accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>I would like to put some additional information on the record.  Section 48(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that a planning authority may, when granting a permission under section 34, include conditions for requiring the payment of a contribution in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in an area of the planning authority and that is provided, or that it is intended will be provided, on behalf of a local authority, regardless of other sources of funding for the infrastructure and facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 48(17) of that Act defines public infrastructure as &ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the acquisition of land, (<i>b</i>) the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities and amenities and landscaping works, (<i>c</i>) the provision of roads, car parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water treatment facilities, drains and watermains, (<i>d</i>) the provision of bus corridors and lanes, bus interchange facilities (including car parks for those facilities), infrastructure to facilitate public transport, cycle and pedestrian facilities, and traffic calming measures, (<i>e</i>) the refurbishment, upgrading, enlargement or replacement of roads, car parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water treatment facilities, drains or watermains, and (<i>f</i>) any matters ancillary to <i>paragraphs (a) to (e)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for development contribution schemes to be drawn up by each planning authority and approved by the elected members following a public consultation process.  It is a matter for the members of the planning authority to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.  Planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area, including recreational facilities.  It is a reserved function of elected members in each authority to specify the nature of such facilities in their adopted scheme.  I wanted to put on the record that local authorities have a reserved function pertinent to this situation and the opportunity is there for them to avail of this facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed.  What I am trying to do is to ensure physical exercise as a recreational activity is put on the same level as some of the other areas mentioned by the Minister of State, for example, broadband and car parking spaces.  These are important provisions but they have been included in the Bill.  I suggest that prevention is better than cure and if we want to promote a healthy lifestyle, it is important we send out the message that exercise and physical activity are good for people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State covers the issue by saying there is nothing to prevent local authorities from providing facilities or that the planning authority may provide them.  I can understand the importance of specifying that they must provide water mains, but broadband and car parking <Col N="799"/>are also considered important enough to be included in the Bill.  However, when it comes to providing that we ensure there is somewhere where youngsters or adults can exercise to prevent obesity and ill health, it has been decided not to provide for that in the Bill.  Instead, all that is provided is that the planning authority may make provisions.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed but I hope the Minister of State will consider the amendment.  I would prefer to see the amendment accepted in this House but the case has been made and has been supported strongly by a number of Senators, including Senators Ryan, Coffey, Mullen and Coghlan who have spoken eloquently on the issue, as did some Members on the Government side of the House on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister of State to consider the matter further.  It is worthy of that.  I will not push it to a vote now but hope the Minister of State will reconsider it between now and Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very conscious of what Senator Quinn has said, which was supported by other Senators.  I do not have any conflict with the concept or principle of the amendment.  What I am saying is that already, under section 48(17) of the principal Act, there is provision for open space, recreational and community facilities, amenities and landscaping works.  I am also conscious, as somebody who worked in the local authority system, of the reserved functions of local authority members and their entitlement under the levy regime.  However, as Senator Quinn has requested, I will ask the Parliamentary Counsel to check whether there is an opportunity available, without infringing on someone else&rsquo;s authority, to deal with this matter.  The Senator will be conscious of what I mean by that in so far as there are already reserved functions.  I will ask whether there is any opportunity for me to make any further provision by amendment.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated I am prepared to provide for this by way of guidelines.  This guidance would provide for the appropriate mechanism to elaborate further on what is meant by recreational facilities and will specifically include but not necessarily be confined to the provision of facilities for physical activity to promote a healthy lifestyle.  I am prepared to do that which I believe I am entitled to do by guidelines to the local authority.  I will have the matter investigated further to see if there is another opportunity for amendment and I will revert to the House if this is dealt with on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 27 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 33, to delete lines 3 to 38.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was debated at length on Committee Stage and many Senators spoke on it.  We are opposed to the reduction of a quorum of An Bord Plean&aacute;la from three to two.  There is no reason for this change.  The rationale given by the Minister of State previously was that the workload of the board required the quorum to be revised downwards to allow more efficiency and throughput in appeals.  A quorum of two is a very strange proposal as deadlock can arise in such situations and in that case it will be referred to a quorum of three in any event.  We do not see the reason for the requirement as it gives more power to individual members of the board and I have outlined difficulties that have come to light recently with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and accountability of decisions within that structure.  I urged a review and a reform of An Bord Plean&aacute;la but that is for another day.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this <Col N="800"/>view.   We do not see the reason for this proposal to reduce the quorum in An Bord Plean&aacute;la from three to two.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second amendment No. 28.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the workload of An Bord Plean&aacute;la demands that there be a quorum of two in these instances.  I have not heard of a quorum of two for playing tiddlywinks.  This proposal is an absolute disgrace and could lead to deadlock in many cases unless there is collusion between the two people to agree.  It is a dreadful situation to propose such a quorum of two persons.  For instance, two members of the technical side of the board who are technically qualified in a particular area may have the same technical ability in that both may be architects or solicitors.  The board is supposed to have a spread of membership.  It would be a disgrace if the quorum for making decisions is to be two people.  Fine Gael will be pursuing this matter.  I ask the Minister of State to take consider the points being raised because it is ludicrous to suggest that two people would comprise a quorum.</P>
        <P>The way this Bill is being handled in this House is an absolute disgrace.  This Bill should not have come into this House if it was not proper.  It is being rushed through the House from Second Stage to Committee Stage.  A week has elapsed and nothing has happened with regard to the points we have raised.  I do not blame the Minister of State who is present.  This Bill is being rushed through the House.  Reference has been made to the Parliamentary Counsel being consulted but at the same time no cognisance has been given to the amendments from this House and this is unacceptable.  When the Bill goes to the other House there is no guarantee it will not be guillotined there as has happened to so many other Bills.  It will return to this House with amendments made by the Minister of State.  What is behind the rushing of this Bill and the manner in which it is being dealt with in this House?  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject completely the assertion of any disrespect to this House or that the Bill is being rushed.  Of the 31 amendments in front of this House, owing to proper investigation and judgment by the Parliamentary Counsel and Attorney General, approximately six need further study by those offices.  It is appropriate this is done so that the proper response to amendments is given.  Legislation is not treated differently in this House compared with the other House.  Any Bill must return to the House in which it was initiated.  Any of the responses we are dealing with tonight are as a result of debate in this House.  I have given all the time necessary to this Bill.  I have given the responses of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General on the amendments they have dealt with.</P>
        <P>Section 28 refers to section 108 of the principal Act which relates to the quorum of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is now proposed to assist the board in achieving efficiencies of operation by providing a reduction of the current statutory required quorum of the board members from three to two for the purposes of determining certain classes of routine cases.  Fine Gael Senators opposed the entire section on Committee Stage on the basis they are not convinced that the reduction in the quorum will solve the issue of time delays in the process.  As I have stated on Committee Stage, this provision is a flexible facilitation mechanism for the board.  It is estimated that more than 60% of the current case load will be affected by this proposal, offering a significant potential for improved performance.  It would also allow for more board time to be allocated to complex and economically significant cases.  I have also outlined the appropriate safeguards in place in the event of a disagreement.  For these reasons I commend section 28 to be part of the Bill.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>The chairperson or the deputy chairperson of the board will have the power to recommend which cases are suitable for a reduced quorum.  Cases as outlined are outside the proposed provision.  The provision of this amendment will not apply in respect of the following case types: developments that would materially contravene the relevant development plan, strategic infrastructure development or a development or class of development referred to in the regulations made under section 176 EIA type developments.  If there is a meeting with a quorum of two and it is evenly divided on a vote, the matter should be referred to a meeting where there is a quorum of three.  The board has achieved a significant reduction in its caseload backlog, moving to 1,653 cases on hand, a decrease of 43%, compared with the 2,900 cases for the same period in 2008.  The board&rsquo;s 18-week compliance rate for 2008 was 23%.  It is envisaged that in the coming months this will double to 50% and will continue to rise in 2010, aided by this amendment of the principal Act.</P>
        <P>The matter of the determination will be as a result of the inspector making his or her recommendation to the board.  In other jurisdictions cases such as this are dealt with by an inspector and do not go to the board at all.  We still continue to have two members of the board adjudicating after the inspector has made his or her recommendation and that the chairperson has decided in those cases it is suitable to go for a quorum of two persons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the comments of Senator Cummins.  Those of us on this side of the House understand and appreciate that clarifications and consultations must take place with the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General with regard to amendments before the House.  We fully understand this is part of the parliamentary process.  We have a difficulty with the Bill being rushed through the House.  It is fair enough that the Minister of State must await advice from the Parliamentary Counsel or the Attorney General but Report Stage should not have been taken until these consultations had been finalised.  That would show more respect to the House and make it more relevant if Report Stage had been delayed.  I do not blame the Minister of State because the ordering of business is the cause of the problem.  Account needs to be taken of this when dealing with future legislation.  If advice is needed from the Parliamentary Counsel on amendments tabled by the Opposition, we should be given the benefit of that advice when the various Stages of a Bill are being taken.  That is our problem.  We appreciate the Minister of State needs clarification.</P>
        <P>With regard to the efficiencies achieved by and throughput of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Minister of State outlined the logic behind this section but in a few years will Bills be introduced to reduce the quorum to one, as happens in other jurisdictions?  That is not the way we should go.  We are supposed to have an objective and impartial appeals body, which is supposed to reflect a cross-section of views in society.  Some commentators argue rural Ireland is not adequately reflected in the appointees to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but that is a debate for another day.  The number of appeals must be slowing down in the current economic climate.  Staff numbers in planning departments of local authorities have been cut from ten or 12 to two or three and, as a consequence, the number of appeals to the board will reduce significantly.  Is this legislation being introduced after the horse has bolted?</P>
        <P>Perhaps this is not the correct way to deal with the achievement of efficiencies within An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If the Minister of State and the Department are serious in this regard, they should review how the board does its business.  Reform of the board could be considered in separate legislation.  This is not the proper Bill to insert such a provision.  It will not achieve significant efficiencies; it will interfere with the powers of members of the board.  I have a difficulty with this and will press the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with my colleague&rsquo;s remarks, especially in regard to the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General.  I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s bona fides <Col N="802"/>but if he is seeking opinions from them, Report Stage should have been delayed until the advice had been provided.  He has stated inspectors&rsquo; decisions have been accepted on many occasions but, in some cases, their decisions have been overturned by the board.  Providing for two members to adjudicate on such decisions is insufficient.  It does little for openness and transparency.  Will the Minister of State revisit this issue?  Staff numbers have been decimated in planning departments because fewer planning applications are being made, yet the Minister of State proposes to reduce the number of board members making decisions on appeals from three to two.  This proposal is ludicrous.</P>

	<P>The reason I have asked the Parliamentary Counsel to do additional work is I am satisfied good points have been made in the House and I would like them to be teased out.  I indicated I would address Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment which addressed a new issue.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s 18-week compliance rate in 2008 was 23% and, with this measure, is expected to increase to 50%.  Inspectors&rsquo; reports are forwarded to board members.  A total of 11% of cases are rejected by the board and, by and large, they are significant.  A determination can be made by the chairman or vice chairman on whether cases are suitable for forwarding to a two-person board.  If there is a conflict between the two members concerned, the case will revert to a board meeting comprising three members.  The measure is designed to increase the efficiency of the board and meet the 18-week guideline, for which everybody is crying out.  My Department and I have received strong representations about meeting the deadline.  I would like the 18-week compliance rate to increase from 23% to 50% and, ultimately, 100%.  The measure is proposed to effect this.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
        <P LI="2">In page 33, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;29.&mdash;The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 151&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;151A.&mdash;Where, following complaint by a person relating to a breach of this Act, a planning authority fails or refuses to take measures under this Act by way of planning enforcement, the person may appeal such failure or refusal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which may on such appeal give such directions to the planning authority in relation to its functions as it considers appropriate.&rdquo;.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">We had a good discussion on the consistency of planning enforcement right through from Second Stage to Committee Stage to Report Stage.  Planning enforcement is probably the only area in planning legislation where no appeal mechanism exists.  The Minister of State will recall we tabled an amendment on Committee Stage, which was more of a general nature, proposing that local authorities put in place measures to provide consistency in enforcement.  I gave a commitment on Committee Stage to bring forward a more specific amendment.  Given that the amendment has only been tabled on Report Stage, I wish to record that we want to insert in the principal Act that &ldquo;Where, following complaint by a person relating to a breach of this Act, a planning authority fails or refuses to take measures under this Act by way of planning enforcement, the person may appeal such failure or refusal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which may on such appeal give such directions to the planning authority in relation to its functions as it considers appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The amendment deals with the matters we discussed on Committee Stage.  Senator Glynn had some support for the thrust of a similar amendment tabled on Committee Stage.  We believe this is a good amendment, it addresses the issue and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the substantial obligations that planning authorities already have in regard to enforcement, I do not support the creation of an appeals mechanism, as proposed.  In any case, this would result in a whole new area of work for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which would be required in each case to inspect the development, review the entire dealings with the issue by a planning authority etc.  This would have some serious implications for the board&rsquo;s work in dealing with planning appeals.  Nevertheless, in view of the concerns expressed by Senators on the issue of planning enforcement, my Department will consider again whether the enforcement provisions of the Act require amendment to further strengthen the requirements on planning authorities.</P>
        <P>I addressed this matter in my reply to amendment No. 18 in the name of Senator Ryan and other members of his party.  Other Senators, including Senator Glynn, commented on this matter on Committee Stage and perhaps on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Parliamentary Counsel to examine if some extra provision as regards enforcement can be made in the Act.  I will bring forward such a provision on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, if that transpires to be the case, and report back to the House.  I thank the Senators for bringing forward this proposal.  I appreciate this is a topical and current issue but I also reiterate there are existing provisions regarding enforcement.  If I get clearance on this from the Parliamentary Counsel, we will examine this proposal.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Under the planning Acts there is a clear statutory obligation on planning authorities in regard to an unauthorised development.  It is important to state that because they have a responsibility in this area.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in regard to written complaints regarding unauthorised developments or other unauthorised developments of which it becomes aware, except in the case of a trivial or a minor development.  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority&rsquo;s decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice must be entered on the planning register and in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be informed.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>My Department&rsquo;s development management guidelines for planning authorities issued in June 2007; the statutory guidelines issued, under section 28 of the planning Act, recommend that enforcement notice should issue in all cases where an investigation has established that unauthorised development is being or has been carried out, unless there are compelling and defensible reasons for not doing so, and the persons who do not comply with this enforcement notice should be prosecuted in all cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>A problem arises with the possibility of an enforcement officer being able to have the fall back position of resorting to the phrase &ldquo;a trivial or a minor matter&rdquo;.  This is one person in the planning system who can decide this is a trivial or minor matter.  Nothing the Minister of State said gives me any comfort in terms of putting in place an appeals mechanism.  We need an appeals mechanism for people.  As the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said during the debate on an earlier Stage, planning is about people.  If the person on the ground does not have the means to appeal a decision, it is not satisfactory.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I am not making a charge against any enforcement officer, but the existing provision in this area lends itself to one person deciding a development is trivial.  Therefore, how can that be fair?  We must have an appeals mechanism available in every matter of life and legislation.  In his initial response the Minister of State said we cannot have this.  To where else can a person appeal in the planning process if not to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  He seems to have already dis<Col N="805"/>counted the possibility of having an appeals process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If an appeal is not allowed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to where can it be allowed?  If there is to be provision for an appeals mechanism, can one appeal up the ladder in the local authority structure?  I tried that in a case in which I was involved.  I went from an enforcement officer, to the director of services, to county manager and the answer I got was &ldquo;sorry, that is a delegated power&rdquo;.  Therefore, one does not get anywhere with that process.</P>
        <P>It is essential we have an appeals process in planning legislation.  This is probably the one element of planning legislation where we do not have an appeals process.  This is an important aspect.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on it and not to discount, as he seems to have, the possibility of an appeals mechanism to An Board Plean&aacute;la.  We have already decided on one aspect of this legislation, where the Minister of State has reduced the quorum from three to two.  I would not have a problem with the quorum being reduced from three to one for the purpose of this specific aspect of appeal, but there must be an appeals mechanism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much appreciate the heartfelt contributions made by Senator Ryan and the difficulties he and perhaps other Senators have encountered.  I do not support the creation of an appeals mechanism, as proposed, because of the workload it would add to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am conscious of the contributions the Senator has made in this regard not only on this Stage but on Committee Stage.  I know they are based on good solid cases.  I will try to ascertain, through the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General, if it possible for me to enhance the provisions on the enforcement side.  I am not closing the door on anything here.  I do not support the proposal on the basis of how it would affect the workload of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but that does not exclude the Parliamentary Counsel from coming up with some solution, if they can, on this matter.  Senators will have an opportunity to consider the legislation again in this House and it is possible matter will be teased out in the meantime on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I have been involved in planning for almost 30 years, including 23 years in a local authority and as part of my work in the Department at present.  I am conscious of the points made by the Senator of the difficulties that arise and what determines a minor infringement.  I take the point also that a planning officer may make a decision which may be considered a delegated responsibility but it may go no further.  I will give this matter attention and request that it be examined to determine if a solution is possible without piling a good deal of extra work on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As I remarked earlier, there was 23% efficiency in 2008 and with these revisions I am attempting to reach 50% efficiency by 2010.  However, I will consider if we can address this issue one way or another but I am in the hands of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>

	<P>As stated on Committee Stage, the purpose of this amendment is to implement a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission to the effect that only the owners of properties should have a say in respect of whether a development should be taken in charge.  The Law Reform Commission noted that the capital value of units owned may be affected where an estate is taken in charge.  For example, where an estate&rsquo;s common exterior areas are heavily landscaped, the local authority&rsquo;s taken-in-charge budget may not match the resources required for their upkeep.  On the other hand, it might be the case that an estate would be better maintained under the charge of the local authority.  In either case, whether an estate is taken in charge can have serious implications in respect of the value of properties.  This, in turn, will directly impact on the owners of individual units and, to a much lesser extent, on tenants.  Accordingly, I consider it is reasonable that the decision on whether an estate is taken in charge should be made by the owners rather than the occupiers of the units.  I am not, therefore, in favour of the proposed amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment also relates to language used.  We are of the opinion that the Bill is being complicated in circumstances where it is not necessary to do so.  The wording used in section 35 is too prescriptive.  For example, the phrase &ldquo;secure the creation, management, restoration or preservation of any site of scientific or ecological interest&rdquo; is used in paragraph (<i>g</i>).  We suggest it would be adequate for the paragraph to read &ldquo;secure the preservation of any site of scientific or ecological interest&rdquo;.  The amendment is technical in nature and is designed to reduce the level of complexity in the Bill.  This section is overly prescriptive in the context of the wording it contains and that is why we have tabled the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 35 amends section 212 of the principal Act, which refers to developments by planning authorities.  This is an enabling provision to allow such authorities to take proactive steps to protect areas of ecological importance.  Much like the other provisions of section 212 of the principal Act, it remains within the discretion of a planning authority to take such measures as it sees fit.  Where European, national or local nature sites are threatened, local authorities must have the ability to intervene, where appropriate, to create, manage or restore such sites.  This corresponds with the biodiversity responsibilities of local authorities.</P>
        <P>As indicated on Committee Stage, local authorities have an important role &mdash; indeed a responsibility &mdash; to ensure that Ireland complies with its obligations under EU nature conservation law.  As pointed out on Committee Stage, section 212 of the principal Act, which section 35 amends, is an enabling rather than an obligatory provision.  The proposed new provisions will provide local authorities with an additional set of tools they can use, where warranted, in order to protect the natural heritage in their areas.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the important issue of male cancer awareness.  Last month was November, or movember as it came to be called.  I commend the Movember Foundation on its efforts to raise awareness of men&rsquo;s health.  The movember campaign started in Melbourne, Australia, in 2003.  Movember is a moustache growing charity event held during November each year to raise funds and awareness for men&rsquo;s health.  To date the campaign has raised &euro;30 million worldwide.  Last year, movember&rsquo;s first in Ireland, more than 1 ,700 men around the country took part, raising a phenomenal &euro;370,000.  In its first year of participation, Ireland surpassed all other countries in donations <i>per capita</i> with an average individual donation of &euro;213.  Anybody who listened to the radio last month will have followed the moustache growing exploits of celebrities and less well known people.  These funds went directly to action prostate cancer, an initiative of the Irish Cancer Society, to help it improve the state of men&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer and Irish men have a one in 12 chance of developing it during the course of their lifetimes.  Irish men have the highest risk profile for this cancer in Europe.  The national cancer registry estimates a 275% increase in the incidence of prostate cancer by 2020.  Despite the extensive publicity received by breast cancer, the risk of a man getting prostate cancer is only 2% less than that of a woman getting breast cancer.</P>
        <P>As is the case for all types of cancer, prevention is better than cure.  I speak on this Adjournment matter to encourage the promotion of health awareness among men.  Already we have seen the national expansion of BreastCheck and the introduction of CervicalCheck.  I call for a similar programme to be introduced for prostate cancer screening.  To date, BreastCheck has provided almost 450,000 free mammograms to 206,800 women and detected more than 2,700 breast cancers.  The prospect of a successful intervention is much higher where a cancer is detected earlier.  The successful BreastCheck model has been used and adapted for CervicalCheck, which became available to the 1.1 million women aged between 25 and 60 years living in Ireland on 1 September 2008.</P>
        <P>There is at present no screening programme for prostate cancer in Ireland.  In 2008 the national cancer screening service published its first annual report which noted that current evidence is insufficient to recommend a population-based screening programme because of concerns that it may not improve survival or quality of life and may ultimately cause more harm than good.  Areas such as County Donegal have battled to get screening programmes for breast cancer because mortality rates were causing concern.  I am not a medical person but I cannot understand why leaving cancers undetected would achieve a better outcome.</P>
        <P>I call for action on the promotion of men&rsquo;s health awareness.  Positive initiatives like the movember campaign and action prostate cancer need to be built upon.  Through early detection, diagnosis and effective treatment, we can change established habits and attitudes to make men aware of the risks they face.  A stigma remains around male cancers but early intervention allows people to avert life threatening situations.  It is better to detect and deal with the problem than to hide one&rsquo;s head in the sand until it is too late.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my col<Col N="809"/>league, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on male cancer services and cancer screening for male cancers.</P>
        <P>When we speak of male cancer, many people will automatically think of prostate cancer.  Figures from the National Cancer Registry show that prostate cancer is the commonest cancer diagnosis in men, accounting for 29% of cases.  The stark figures behind the percentages are that on average every year more than 2,400 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 540 die of the disease.</P>
        <P>The reorganisation of breast cancer services has probably been the most high profile aspect of the work of the national cancer control programme, NCCP, over the past two years.  However, considerable work has also been done on services for prostate cancer and the key initiative this year has been to speed up access to diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment.  The NCCP is putting in place rapid access diagnostic clinics for prostate cancer in each of the eight designated cancer centres.  This is crucial in improving outcomes.  Comparison with other jurisdictions shows that advanced stage of disease at presentation is more common in Ireland and access to diagnosis for prostate cancer has been problematic.</P>
        <P>To date, rapid access diagnostic prostate cancer clinics operating under the national guidelines have commenced in University College Hospital Galway and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  Two further clinics, in Beaumont and St Vincent&rsquo;s, are due to open before the end of this year and the remaining four will open in 2010.  In due course, when all eight clinics are in place, they will be run within national guidelines so that from one part of the country to another, the service is the same and the opportunity for best outcomes is the same.</P>
        <P>Prevention and early detection are also key features of the national cancer control strategy.  There is as yet, however, insufficient evidence to support a population-based screening programme for prostate cancer.  The Department of Health and Children and the National Cancer Screening Service are keeping emerging evidence about prostate cancer screening under review, including the results of randomised trials that are being conducted internationally.</P>
        <P>While prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men it is not the source of the greatest mortality.  Lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in men.  In 2006, the latest year for which figures are available, 964 men died from lung cancer.  In the same year, 585 men died from colorectal cancer while 543 men died from prostate cancer.</P>
        <P>As with prostate cancer, the NCCP has been working this year to develop services for lung cancer and rapid access diagnostic clinics for lung cancer have now opened in St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s.  A fourth clinic, at University College Hospital Galway, is due to open before the end of this year and the remaining four clinics are on schedule to open as planned in the first half of 2010.  As for screening patients for lung cancer, no effective test has been developed and routine screening X-rays have not been shown to improve outcomes.</P>
        <P>Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in men.  Overall, the incidence rate of colorectal cancer in Ireland ranks among the highest in western Europe and survival rates are also lower in Ireland compared with our European counterparts.  There is widespread agreement that highly technical rectal cancer surgery must be performed by specialist cancer surgeons to achieve the best possible outcome.  The NCCP accepted a recommendation from the Irish Society of Coloproctology that the number of hospitals performing rectal cancer surgery should be reduced to 13 public hospitals from January 2010 with a goal of reducing this number to the eight designated cancer centres as surgical capacity is created.</P>
        <P>Unlike lung and prostate cancer screening, screening for colorectal cancer would be highly effective.  The national cancer screening service has submitted proposals for a national colorec<Col N="810"/>tal screening programme to the Minister.  The Minister is anxious, notwithstanding the current budgetary situation, to introduce such a programme as soon as possible and is examining options in this regard.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has been made this year to improve cancer services for men with the goal of achieving better outcomes.  I have also outlined the position on screening and while the evidence does not support population-based screening for prostate cancer or lung cancer, there is a very strong case for the introduction of colorectal cancer screening and this will be a priority for the Minister as resources become available.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for a very comprehensive answer.  The awareness campaigns are important to get people to come forward as soon as they think they have a problem so that it can be dealt with as soon as possible because there is no national screening process for most cancers, and Professor Keane said that lung cancer is the big one coming down the tracks.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State ask the Department of Health and Children to answer my specific questions about how these eight centres will affect Letterkenny?  I think they include Letterkenny but I would like confirmation of that and if possible to have estimated times for when these services will be put in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the need for compensation for flood victims throughout the country, but especially in Cork city, on the Adjournment.  I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to outline the measures that will be put in place as a matter of urgency, in particular for the middle parish, Grattan Street and the Mardyke areas of Cork city.</P>
        <P>We have had the wettest November on record with rain cascading down and causing flooding.  This has displaced and wrecked family homes and the lives and livelihoods of many.  I thank the Department for its work so far but fear it will make the humanitarian aid it has announced bureaucratic and cumbersome for people who need it.</P>
        <P>Having visited people&rsquo;s homes and spoken to those affected the word &ldquo;devastation&rdquo; is an understatement of what they have suffered.  The impact of the flooding is phenomenal.  In Cork, hundreds of people were displaced as well as thousands of students from University College Cork.  Part of the city was under water.  I worry that we could create a situation in which home insurance will be impossible not just for those on the floodplain.  Some houses will be uninsurable.  University College Cork gave a briefing last weekend in which it said that the damage to 29 buildings is estimated at &euro;25 million.  One can multiply that out to the Mardyke, the Western Road, Grattan Street, Peter Street and Patrick Hanly Buildings where family homes have been decimated.  Thankfully the flood water did not stay in Cork as long as it did in the west but the homes are in an unbelievable state.  I was in a house last Saturday morning where even after a week of dehumidifiers working, the smell and the unsightly damage to the family home distressed people.</P>
        <P>I note the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remark about the means-testing of the humanitarian aid but it is important we try to prevent this being a bureaucratic system, recognise that people are not looking to rip off the system and assist people in re-starting and restructuring their lives.  I was in a house on Saturday whose occupier had lost all their medication, personal effects and belongings.  Businesses have closed and employees are unable to work because of the nature <Col N="811"/>of their jobs.  Wages, livelihoods, stock and property have all been lost.  I hope the Minister of State will give a positive response.</P>
        <P>There has been a great outpouring of goodwill from the community welfare officers, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the public sector.  At a time when public servants are getting bad press, those in the city of Cork were to the forefront of the recovery work and deserve great praise.  The spirit of Cork is alive.  People are looking for assistance and I hope we can give them proper assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this matter.  The Government recognises the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the recent floods.  Community welfare service staff throughout the country have been providing huge support to families every day since this flooding occurred.  They have already provided emergency financial and other assistance to households affected by the flooding to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs.  Community welfare officers have made over 470 initial emergency payments to people in areas affected by flooding.  This includes 200 payments made in Cork.  The average payment is &euro;300.  Officers will continue to make such payments as long as there is a requirement to do so.</P>
        <P>In addition, a humanitarian assistance scheme is being initiated to provide means-tested financial support for people who have suffered damage to their homes.  An initial sum of &euro;10 million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.  As flood waters abate and people assess the full extent of the damage to their homes, qualified households can claim for essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.  Assistance will also be available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance.  The cost of medical treatment and supplies may also be considered in determining the payment of assistance where medical cover is not in place such as private health insurance or a medical card.  The level of payment available under the aid scheme to a qualified individual will depend on the severity of the damage to that person&rsquo;s home and the extent of the loss experienced, as well as household income and general family circumstances.  The scheme will provide for hardship alleviation, as opposed to full compensation.  As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses will not be covered by the scheme, nor will losses covered by household insurance.</P>
        <P>Applications under the scheme will be means tested to ensure the available assistance will be prioritised for those who are most vulnerable. Neither will the scheme cover damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation, although humanitarian assistance may be considered in a case involving a tenant&rsquo;s personal belongings.  The basic principle of the means test will be to determine a household&rsquo;s capacity to meet the cost of restoring their home to a habitable condition.  All household income will be considered when determining entitlement to payment.  However, account will be taken of outgoings such as rent or mortgage repayments, other loans and travel to work costs.</P>
        <P>In addition to the means test, other factors will be considered by the community welfare service in assessing individual applications, including whether the applicant is or was homeless as a result of flooding; the age profile of family members such as babies, young children and elderly persons; the availability of support from the wider family; and the special needs people may have as a result of illness or disability.  People seeking assistance should contact their local community welfare office.  Further information and applications forms for the humanitarian assistance scheme are available from the community welfare service in the affected areas and on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i>, and that of the HSE, <i>www.hse.ie</i>.  While the <Col N="812"/>scheme is not intended to provide full compensation for all losses and damage, it will go towards alleviating the hardship which many hundreds of families have had to endure.</P>
