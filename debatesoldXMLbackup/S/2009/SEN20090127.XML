	<P>I have notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter: </P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the operation of supervision and substitution in special needs schools, with specific reference to St. Columba&rsquo;s national school, Douglas, Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Phil Prendergast of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the huge increase in job losses affecting south Tipperary resulting from the closure of Quinn Merriott and Moy Isover and the cutting of the workforce in Dell, Waterford Crystal and Bulmers Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the national cancer screening services prioritise the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar as a centre for the continuing and further development of colposcopy services for the women of the entire midlands region.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call the Leader of the House, there is an error in No. 1 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.  The time allowed for the Order of Business should read &ldquo;50 minutes&rdquo;, not &ldquo;40 minutes&rdquo;.  It has been corrected in No. <i>a</i>1 of the Supplementary Order Paper.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re times for Order of Business, to be taken without debate on the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, motion re extension of specified period for the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 1 and to conclude within 30 minutes, if not previously concluded, with spokespersons having five minutes and the Minister to be called upon five minutes before the end of the debate for concluding comments; and No. 3, statements on the economy, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 but not later than 4.40 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m., <Col N="330"/>if not previously concluded, with spokespersons having 15 minutes, all other Senators eight minutes, and on which Senators may share time.  </P>
        <P>I inform the House that emergency legislation is before the D&aacute;il and that it will be necessary for me to return to the Seanad later this evening to amend the Order of Business to take this legislation, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2009.  A Supplementary Order Paper will be issued later.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I received a letter from the Cathaoirleach before I came to the Chamber which stated he did not intend to take any further the matter of the vote which was not called on the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009.  We had a number of serious concerns about the fact that a vote was not taken by you, a Chathaoirigh, despite a vote having been called for by Senators Norris, Cummins and others.  While you do not intend to take the matter any further, I asked that it would be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the parliamentary adviser because of concerns on this side of the House about what happened.  I am informing the House that I will raise it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because the vote was called but, as far as we are concerned on this side of the House, agreement was not reached during the procedures last week.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have written to Senator Fitzgerald on that matter and I have also set out the position on the record of the House.  The Bill was passed in accordance with a resolution of the House and I have nothing further to say on that.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the level of disorder on the floor of the House, which at times causes difficulties in dealing with the business before the House.  I have two options for dealing with disorder.  I can either suspend the House or, where appropriate, deal with the individual Member causing the disorder.  If disorder continues I will have no hesitation in following either of those routes in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite all the talk by the Government about partnership, the legislation was rushed through the House last week.  Some 18 amendments were tabled by Fine Gael but not even the first one was reached that evening.  I would like an assurance from the Leader that important legislation will not be rushed through in that manner without adequate time.  It was really important legislation yet not even one Fine Gael amendment was reached or discussed.  These amendments would have protected the taxpayer.  If there was disorder &mdash; and people made their point of view clear about this &mdash; I think the Cathaoirleach can understand why we felt we had to make the point that this was no way to do business in the Seanad.  It is not the way to get consensus, good legislation or to conduct our business.  I make that point absolutely clear.  I ask the Leader again to ensure that we are not asked to rush through important legislation without adequate consultation, preparation and time to consider Opposition amendments with a view to co-operating with the Government.  There is a great deal of talk about partnership from the Government but we do not see it in action.  </P>
        <P>I oppose today&rsquo;s Order of Business because we are having a debate on the economy without adequate input from the Government.  We are not discussing proposals or policy.  We are having this debate in a vacuum and the least we should have is a question and answer session with the Minister on the details of policy and proposals which the Government should bring to the House.  We have waited since the mini-budget last July and the budget in October, but we are still waiting now.  There seems to be no clear plan from the Government for discussion on the floor of the House.  We see the same thing happening with the partnership talks.  On Friday, the social partners were meant to get detailed information on the Government&rsquo;s approach but it would appear as if it broke up in disarray with no discussion.  It seems an extraordinary way <Col N="331"/>to conduct the social partnership talks, as is the way it is being dealt with in the Seanad today.  The very least we should have is a question and answer session on the economy and the Government&rsquo;s proposals and policies, as opposed to these statements.  The public feels it is being dealt with in that way as well.  The public is calling for leadership, asking for plans and seeking reassurance and hope that there is a plan in place from the Government.  The very least we should have are some proposals and policies on the table from the Government to discuss here.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader agree to an all-party motion regarding Pamela Izevbekhai who lost her case in the High Court earlier?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have discussed this matter in the House a number of times.  It is clear that Members on all sides are concerned about this case.  An all-party motion should be tabled and agreed by the House to allow Pamela Izevbekhai and her daughters to remain in the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a great deal of debate over the weekend about the outcome of the Roscommon incest case and related matters.  I did not listen much to it because I can no longer stomach the craw thumping, puke inducing hypocrisy of commentators shedding crocodile tears for children who suffer abuse and neglect while blaming the HSE and everybody else along the way.  It is 22 years since I was first elected to the House and there probably has not been one year in that time I have not raised  a children related issue ranging from the Stay Safe programme to mandatory reporting.  Along the way we have refused to address the issue.  We had the same debate following the Kelly Fitzgerald and Kilkenny incest cases and the Ferns report.  Time and again we do not give children the confidence to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to deal with abuse.  It is more than I can stomach anymore.</P>
        <P>There is no honesty in the debate.  Each time any of us has moved on the issue, we have been hammered.  The same people who tried to stop the State intervening on behalf of the children in Roscommon were outside my gate with posters calling me a pervert and a pornographer when I was promoting the Stay Safe programme.  When we tried to introduce this minor, soft programme in schools to give children protection, a number of organisations such as the Knights of St. Columbanus, Family Solidarity, as well as solicitors and politicians, including county councillors, lined up against it.  I hope every one of them takes responsibility for what is happening because they are all responsible.</P>
        <P>I recall people raising this issue time and again.  I recall an edition of &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; during which a well known and popular jazz musician of the showband era from Monaghan stated how bad it was when fathers could not take children on their knees without being accused of being perverts.  This is the society we have created and in which we live and I am sick and tired of asking for something to be done because I know it will not happen.  Everybody else will say the family is more important than the child and that not interfering with the family is more important than the safety of the child.   There is no political will to protect or save children and I cannot see it happening.  Let us deal with the issue.  Let us say, &ldquo;Let our children suffer because the family is more important and we are afraid to take action with which some right wing conservative groups might be unhappy.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We face a spectacle later when there will be a debate in both Houses on the economy and I suspect we will be treated to a contribution from the Government along the lines of the single transferable speech on the economy to which we have been listening in the House for three or four months.  I hope I am wrong and if I am, I will accept it.  However, I do not expect the Minister to come to the House later to outline what the Government intends to do regarding the economy.  However, at the same time, the Government is circulating a document to the social partners which will not be laid before the Oireachtas.  Will the Leader ensure such proposals as are circulated by way of a completed document to the social partners will be published and laid before both Houses in order that we can have a meaningful and realistic debate?</P>
        <P>I understand the process of negotiation as well as the next person and the necessity for people to be careful during negotiations.  However, this relates to the future of the economy, the single most important issue facing any politician or government.  Senator Fitzgerald is correct that we are not clear on whether any proposals have been made.  However, we read newspaper reports about various decisions that will be made.  These were then denied by Ministers as late as this morning saying it was just newspaper speculation.  Apparently there was a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party last night at which the members of that party indicated to the Taoiseach that they supported his approach to dealing with the economy.  What is that approach?  Perhaps some of the Members on the Government side will share some of the information as to what the approach is to dealing with the economy because it has not been published to the people.  It has been described by people who have caught glimpses of it in the social partnership talks as a blancmange.  What exactly is it and where are the proposals?  It ill behoves the Government, whether Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party or any other member, to demand the answers from the Opposition in circumstances where it has tabled no proposals whatever to address, for example, the crisis in the public finances.  In the context of the debate we had last week on the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, Senator Fitzgerald is right in calling for frankness with the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas so that we can ensure we have an opportunity to do the job we were sent here to do.  For the Government to come in this afternoon with a platitudinous and single transferable speech containing no specifics or clarity is not acceptable in any democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the matter of the incest case in Roscommon raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  The facts about the Roscommon abuse case must be established before action is taken.  We need an investigation to determine how this most serious family abuse could continue for so long.  I do not believe the Health Service Executive should be involved in that investigation.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>How can a mother abuse her children over a six-year period, subjecting them to incest, sexual abuse and neglect?  Apparently the community, school and relatives all knew about it.  The HSE social workers were called in as far back as 1996.  The abuse mentioned in the recent court case took place between 1998 and 2004.  We are told that subject to no unforeseeable impediments, the investigation into the matter is expected to be completed within six months.  Why should it take six months?</P>
        <P>I want the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce the constitutional amendment on children.  The Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007, which resulted from extensive consultations by the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, contains a number of proposals to amend the Constitution regarding children, covering such diverse areas as children&rsquo;s rights, adoption, collection and exchange <Col N="333"/>of soft information, and absolute and strict liability.  This legislation should be brought before the House and passed forthwith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow up on what Senator Alex White has said about our various debates on the economy.  What the Government has presented in recent months on different aspects of the economy are frameworks.  We have had a framework on the recapitalisation of banks.  We have had a framework for economic recovery.  We now have a framework for discussions, which is essentially an agenda for a meeting.  This is as far as the Government has got in mapping out a series of measures to begin to reverse the process of economic recession and depression.  I appreciate that we will have a debate this afternoon on the economy and I will reserve my comments for that debate.</P>
        <P>We have not had an opportunity to comment on or debate the invasion of Gaza by the Israeli forces during the recess.  I feel duty bound to raise this issue in this public forum.  I also believe the House should not be silent on the issue.  There are two sides to the story.  There is the issue of who broke the truce which gave rise to the invasion.  There is the issue of the proportionality of the measures taken.  However, we know there was mass destruction, not only of property but also of civilian lives.  There is a question as to the legality of the invasion, the force used and the effects it has under international law.  I call for a debate in this House.  I appreciate that the Independent Senators have tabled a motion on an inquiry into certain incidents in that invasion.  It is important for this House to have a view on it, to inform the policy of the Government and the EU.  A statement that was issued of the conclusions of the EU Foreign Ministers on the Middle East peace process is quite anaemic.  This is one area in which Europe is not playing a leading role.  The creation of a president of the European Council in the Lisbon treaty could play a role in ensuring a defined and meaningful policy on the Middle East.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That would make it worse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not be silent on this matter.  We should have a view and should try to influence the process that, hopefully, President Obama will play a part in to ensure peace in the Middle East.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senator White.  Unfortunately, I did not hear the views of Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I call for the immediate implementation of the changes required and the constitutional amendment before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  It beggars belief that it takes a case such as that in Roscommon to bring about hysteria and furore in this area.  I do not know what those who have been in the Houses for much longer than I have been doing for the past 20 or 30 years.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>As a practitioner of law, I can tell Members that the law in this area has been out of date for so long that it is unbelievable.  We are in the dark ages when it comes to child legislation.  The Roscommon case is terrible and the facts are unbelievable but there are other cases which are equally bad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is closing the door on these cases and closing files on them every day.  One need only ask a principal of a primary school to explain how difficult it is to get anything done in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="334"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The guidelines are not being implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, emergency legislation on the economy was passed.  That was needed and I fully support emergency legislation where required.  This area requires emergency legislation also because children are suffering.  If we cannot protect them in a republic, who can protect them?  I call for an immediate debate.  The Oireachtas committee is doing its work but this must be brought to fruition at this stage.  We cannot wait any longer, we need change in this area forthwith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the extraordinary and compelling comments of Mr. Justice Paul Carney yesterday when he said that he felt constrained such that he was unable to impose a life sentence on a rapist convicted of rape for the third time because of an appeal against a previous decision of his where a life sentence was reduced.  I strongly believe in a rehabilitative system of justice.  I am not for a &ldquo;hang &rsquo;em and flog &rsquo;em&rdquo; system of justice.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When Mr. Justice Carney asked whether the female half of the population must accept that one or more might be a target because of a rapist&rsquo;s constitutional rights, then it is time for a debate, particularly in light of the latest report that describes assessment and treatment services for sexual offenders as patchy.  Until such time as we take seriously the treatment and assessment of sexual offenders and the need for a rehabilitative system of justice, we must not put women or other citizens at risk.  People refer to constitutional amendments and we must do what we must do in the Constitution and in our legislative system so that life sentences can be passed on rapists convicted in the circumstances of the case to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question raised by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and McDonald, namely, the horrifying events in Roscommon.  The House needs to debate this issue and it needs to be a calm and reasoned debate and we must avoid hysteria.  I am not inspired by some of the comments I have heard already.  There seems to be a desire to bring an extraneous matter into the issue, namely, some fringe group which was offering assistance of some kind.  That is an extraneous matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the court, it took the Health Service Executive 11 years to bring this matter before the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We never gave it the power to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and even then we do not know why the High Court made its decision and neither do we know why the HSE did not appeal the decision.</P>
        <P>I think I know a little bit about law and I can say this much.  We have ample legislation in the child care<b> </b>Acts to provide that the State may intervene in cases of abuse and neglect and if it is the case that the courts are being tardy in this matter, it is open to us to bring forward legislation that gets into the detail of the circumstances where the courts might provide that children be taken into care.  It should be remembered that since 2004, more than 400 care orders were granted and that number grew to 1,200 in 2007.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with a constitutional amendment on children&rsquo;s rights if that is necessary, but I have a problem with posturing and people living in the 1980s and hauling down scapegoats <Col N="335"/>from the past when what we should be doing is asking how we address the needs of children who may or may not be subject to the possibility of abuse and who may in any event be subject to the risk of abuse or neglect.  There should be an end to the posturing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear, particularly from the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; and we should start trying to deal with the problem and if a constitutional referendum is needed, that is fine by me.  It is far more likely that what we need is a tweaking legislation and we need the existing law to be applied by the HSE and others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I support Senator Eugene Regan&rsquo;s point about the situation in the Holy Land.  The Israeli ambassador and the representative from Fatah appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and to say it was a full and frank exchange of views is putting it mildly.  To be balanced, I told the Fatah representative that their problem was that they were corrupt in the extreme and this was the reason they lost the support of their own people.  The Israeli ambassador eventually admitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>At that meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies Timmy Dooley and Michael Mulcahy proposed that the European Union and the United Nations Secretary General should compile a report on human rights abuses in Israel and Palestine and if human rights abuses were confirmed, Article 2 of our preferential trade agreement with Israel would be invoked and its preferential trade arrangements with the EU would be withdrawn.</P>

	<P>I support the remarks of Senators Fitzgerald and Alex White on today&rsquo;s debate on the economy which will not be properly structured.  Senator Alex White reminded the House that today the Government will publish a document on cutbacks which, if I understood correctly, will only be made available to the social partners for the talks they are having.  None of us has any objection to the social partnership talks; they have their own place.  However, this is a Chamber of the Parliament.  This evening&rsquo;s debate on the economy would be better informed if the Leader made this document available to Members beforehand.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Leader speaks <i>ex cathedra</i> when he is replying on the Order of Business and giving us what he believes is the Government&rsquo;s report.</P>

	<P>I was here last week and the week before as the Leader well knows.  The document to which Senator Alex White has drawn our attention should be made available to Members.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  Are talks in progress concerning the proposed recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland?  If so, is there a timetable for them?  The longer this process is delayed, the longer confidence will be absent in the marketplace.  As we all know, it is an intangible matter but without it much damage is being done every day.  It is a most important matter and I appreciate it is top of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s agenda.  However, we are still in the dark as to its progress.  I would appreciate if the Leader would inform us as to the Government&rsquo;s view on the recapitalisation programme and where matters stand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s calls for a debate on recent events in Gaza.  The Seanad was in recess when these happened and we did not have the opportunity to express our views on them in the Chamber.  There is no doubt there was palpable outrage at these events throughout Irish society which was particularly well reflected in the Irish media.  For that, some Israeli spokespersons gave us a rap on the knuckles, as if we were being partisan in our denunciations of what happened.</P>
        <P>I can only refer to what was imposed on Gaza as sheer brutality and butchery.  I am in no doubt that there was a connection between the timing of the invasion and the change of presidents in America.  The intention was to make an impact and to virtually commit genocide against the people of the Gaza Strip before the US President, Mr. Bush, left office.  It was also intended to make it more difficult for the new US President, Mr. Obama, to indicate his position on the matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome, however, the appointment of George Mitchell as US envoy to the Middle East.  He showed great integrity, insight and tenacity in Northern Ireland for which we owe him a great debt of gratitude.  One would hope he will not be restricted or constrained by the American Administration in what he is expected to do in Gaza.</P>
        <P>When people could no longer take the outrage they felt when they saw the bodies of innocent little children being carried from the rubble in Gaza, they referred to it as a second Holocaust.  This upset some Jews at the time.  Relatively, however, if six members of the one innocent family were wiped out, it is a holocaust to them and the survivors have the memory of their <Col N="337"/>lives coming to an end when their loved ones were butchered in such a way.  It may not go down well when I say Hamas has to be recognised in any talks because its representatives were elected by the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>If one studies world history, one will realise that in any part of the world where the electoral decision of a majority has not been accepted or crushed by another state the long-term result has been to prolong suffering.  It is vital that George Mitchell ensures Hamas is brought into any negotiations that will take place.  Israel may think its endeavours to wipe out the leadership of Hamas, including Ministers and representatives who have been elected by their own people, has put an end to the matter or changed its status but they have had the opposite effect.  We have witnessed this in every country, including this one.  I would welcome a debate on the matter.  It would be wrong of us to suggest that because the bombing, killing, brutality and butchery have come to an end the perpetrators should not be held accountable by the free world.  If that does not happen, we will have undermined the entire concept of democracy and uniting against the terrorism inflicted on Gaza.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the comments made by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I ask the Leader whether he will accept non-Government motion No. 32 which urges the Government to support the establishment of an international war crimes inquiry.  I tabled this motion before I became aware that the Government was, in fact, taking this line.  I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, on the action he took in the matter.  It is clear that we must have a war crimes tribunal.  I pay tribute to the extraordinary, heroic, noble and selfless work of people such as John Ging.  I am proud that an Irishman like him is representing the UNRWA in Gaza and remaining with the terrified people to bear witness and call for an inquiry on behalf of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that war crimes were committed and I have no doubt that they were.  I watched on al-Jazeera as the first shell was fired and knew it was white phosphorus.  I immediately asked my office in Dublin to contact Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other organisations.  Queasy, miserable and lying excuses were made by Israeli spokespersons to the effect that they were using these munitions in the same manner as Britain and other European countries had used them.  When did Britain or any other country use white phosphorus in densely populated civilian areas?</P>
        <P>These arguments are heard not only from Hamas but also from the United Nations and the international doctors present.  They know what happened, including about the disproportionate use of force, the use of white phosphorus and the targeting of United Nations schools, despite having global position co-ordinates.  The attackers knew exactly what they were doing.  One third of casualties were innocent children.  Lies were consistently told to the effect that Hamas fighters were based inside the schools.  Let us find the truth by means of an international inquiry.  It is a disgrace that EU Foreign Ministers have turned their backs and do not even want an inquiry.  In other words, they do not want to know what is happening.  In the same way, we have this farce of human rights protocols being attached to external trade association agreements.  I have repeatedly asked over the past three or four years that they be monitored but this is not even happening.  It is a systematic undermining of everything we know about human rights.</P>
        <P>Thank God for al-Jazeera and people like Ayman Mohyeldin who was reporting in the thick of the events.  The Israelis did not want anybody to know what was going on.  That is the reason they kept all the reporters out, just like America did in Iraq.  I strongly make this call.</P>
<Col N="338"/>
        <P>I say to the Leader, through the Cathaoirleach, that we have had very passionate statements from the Government side of the House and equally passionate pronouncements from this side.  We appear to be in agreement and we are only urging and reinforcing the Government in acting the way it should.</P>
        <P>Shame on Germany and how dare the Germans behave in this way.  It was not enough that they were responsible for the Holocaust; now they want to turn their eye again against this kind of attack on humanity out of their guilty feelings.  Why should the Palestinians pay for their guilty feelings?</P>

	<P>I am sorry if I have taken a while with this but I feel very passionately about the subject.  I saw the doctor beating his head when his children, his entire family, were wiped out.  We must have a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to the events of last week, I will content myself by saying I called for a vote and I pay tribute to those who recorded the fact.  There was some disturbance but I indicated at the time that we should have adjourned so people could have been heard.  I will leave that aside.</P>
        <P>If I may, I will quickly return to one matter which was raised, namely, the Roscommon incest case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to move on from that to the Roscommon case.  I have been disgusted by some of the comments made in this House, for example, during the discussion of civil partnership, etc.  We were told, and it was reported by various interest groups, that a gay couple would not be fit to raise children.  Would those Roscommon children not have been better raised by a loving couple who happen to be of the same sex than exposed to this particular family?  This concept of family is protected in an idolatrous fashion despite the damage it does.  We should not have any more of this cant and nonsense.</P>
        <P>I remember exactly what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about how we were blackguarded when we raised the question of Stay Safe.  We were asked about the rights of parents, as if it was a right of parents to molest their own children.  I remember these organisations and the personnel, who have remained the same.  It is the very same rotten source in Irish society.  I will no longer tolerate being told by groups and organisations, including the church, who represent forces that singly fail to protect children that gay people are not as good as anybody else at keeping children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in asking the Leader to postpone the debate this afternoon, given that the relevance of politics and politicians is being debated now more than ever.  As Senators Alex White and Fitzgerald have said, we will debate the economy today in a vacuum.  We are one of the two Houses of Parliament and this Government has yet again shown disrespect not just to us but to the ordinary citizens we represent.  It is incumbent on the Leader to bring to the House the document being presented to the social partners today so we can debate it.</P>
<Col N="339"/>
        <P>This is clearly a case of the Government making up policy on the hoof.  There is no cogent plan or vision as all we are seeing is fire-fighting with no water or sand.  We are leaderless and the ship of state is on the rocks.  It is audacious to ask us to become part of a national Government when the Government is not providing leadership.  How dare it do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, should attend the House.  I am not a legal expert but rather an ordinary citizen who saw what happened with the Roscommon incest case.  I am not as eloquent as Senators Norris or Mullen.  The events that took place in Roscommon should never be allowed to recur in this State.  Responsibility for this matter should be placed upon the various authorities that failed to act.  Deputy Shatter is correct to state that the Health Service Executive should not be involved in the independent inquiry because it has a vested interest and would be investigating itself.  The HSE should do the honourable thing and stand aside.</P>
        <P>We need leadership &mdash; this has not been forthcoming from the Government &mdash; in respect of children&rsquo;s rights.  When I worked as a schoolteacher, I taught religion and disseminated information on the On My Own Two Feet programme.  Parents questioned my motivation and that of colleagues throughout the country in respect of this matter.  Teachers should not be blamed for what occurred in this instance.  They did their job.  We must try to discover the identities of those who failed to do their jobs.  Action must be taken to ensure that children will never again be placed at risk.  It is time to stop playing politics with children&rsquo;s rights.  This matter revolves around people and the Minister must come before the House to discuss it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the announcement that 73 employees are to be let go by Kildare County Council and on the fact that others throughout the country are also being made redundant.  I accept that we will debate this matter tomorrow but I wish to raise it here because yesterday was the third anniversary of the publication of A Vision for Change.  I am concerned, in a roundabout way, with budgets and the fact that Kildare County Council may have been told to make redundant the people to whom I refer.  The council has not been given a budget; nor has the Health Service Executive.  How can any of these organisations make plans and provide leadership to their employees if they do not have budgets?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Moloney, was extremely modest when discussing A Vision for Change.  He held his hands up and stated that implementation has been far too slow.  Senators Corrigan and Prendergast raised this matter on several occasions and stated that mental health is the poor relation within the area of health.  All of the money obtained from the sale of real estate is being ploughed back into the big black hole that is the HSE and not into the services where it is required most, namely, those relating to mental health.  Despite the major problems in the context of drug abuse, eating disorders and so on, there are only 30 beds available for adolescents throughout the entire country.  I accept that this is an improvement.  However, money should be ploughed back into the system to improve matters further in the area of mental health services.</P>
        <P>I met a mental health provider last evening who informed me that people are being transferred from the psychiatric services at Naas General Hospital to St. Loman&rsquo;s in Mullingar at 5 p.m. each day because the hospital is not able to cater for all of the people coming in from Dublin.  The staff at St. Loman&rsquo;s are then expected to treat the individuals to whom I refer in a loving and nurturing way.  There is no joined-up thinking in respect of this matter.  The Leader should arrange a debate, as a matter of urgency, on A Vision for Change and the delay relating to its implementation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I request that the Leader make time available for a calm, serious debate on the mandatory reporting of child abuse.  It is time such a debate took place in Ireland.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the extremely important distinction between the protection of the child and the protection of the family.  This is a taboo subject with which we are all afraid to deal.  I was one of those teachers who, in the early 1990s, encountered opposition from people when obliged to implement the Stay Safe programme.  The latter was extremely mild in nature and was designed to assist children to protect themselves.</P>
        <P>I also worked as a teacher in the United States.  While there, I was obliged to operate within a system where mandatory reporting applied and I received adequate training to allow me to apply it.  My experience in the US made me look differently at the areas of child protection and child abuse.  I made one report during my time as a teacher in the US.  When one makes such a report, one does not know if one&rsquo;s suspicions are correct.  On checking the position in the case to which I refer, however, I discovered that there was a history of abuse within the family concerned.  A sister of the little boy in my class had been flushing her hair down the toilet because of how she felt about herself.</P>
        <P>It is time we faced up to this issue.  Senator McDonald spoke very passionately about the terrible horrors in that house in Roscommon.  However, this Government has failed to implement the Children First guidelines.  Let us call a spade a spade.  In every school in Ireland, only one person is trained to be a designated liaison person to report child abuse.  That is not enough.  The abused or neglected child could be in someone else&rsquo;s classroom.  It is only the duty of the school to report child abuse and not to investigate it.  I have no doubt that when teachers see nits and lice on a child&rsquo;s face, they ask questions.  However, they cannot make the Health Service Executive or the Garda act.</P>
        <P>Who is protecting our children?  It is time we faced up to mandatory reporting because once one lives under that regime, one deals differently with this issue.  One knows that one has a different responsibility.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to say that I am losing confidence in the ability of the Houses of the Oireachtas to act for the people.  I do not see any point in being in this House if we do not get answers to reasonable questions.  Last week we debated the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009 but we did not get an answer as to the bad debts we are taking on for the people.  Would the Leader buy a business without knowing what he was taking on?  He would not, nor would I.  However, we asked the people to do so and they are in the dark.</P>
        <P>Can we change?  Can the Government show leadership?  When we ask the Minister for Finance a fundamental question, he should give an answer.  Unless the Oireachtas can force the Cabinet to take action, we are going nowhere.  I am a new Member of this House and I wonder why I was elected.  I wonder what I can give to the people who elected me.  I cannot get answers and it is not right.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Frances Fitzgerald called for a debate on the High Court decision in the case of Pamela Izevbekhai and her daughters.  As somebody who holds pretty conservative views on immigration, I believe this country has badly failed that family.  There is still time to put that wrong right.  I admire the courage of that woman in trying to protect her daughters from the possibility of mutilation if repatriated.  We should have a debate at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>I concur with many of the comments made on the Roscommon incest case.  I do not disagree with most of what was said in the House.  Senator Mullen said the courts were tardy.  As far as <Col N="341"/>I understand the facts of the case and what happened over the past seven or eight years, it seems the Government and the agencies of the State have been tardy and not the courts.</P>
        <P>Many years ago, the former Taoiseach gave a commitment that a constitutional referendum on the rights of children would be held within a couple of months of his announcement but that has not happened.  The HSE has given insufficient resources to prevent such cases as that in Roscommon.  I share the views of other Senators that there should be no HSE involvement in the inquiry being conducted.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White and others spoke about the economic debate scheduled for later today.  I agree that there is not much point having that debate if we do not have the facts on what the Government is speaking to the social partners about.  That is the fatal flaw in the system of social partnership.</P>
        <P>I was the Opposition spokesperson on finance in this House for a number of years and I constantly raised with Ministers, and Deputy Cowen when he was the Minister for Finance, the need for the involvement of the Oireachtas in the social partnership process.  The Seanad, when it was set up, was to be a form of social partnership, but the vocational panels did not work as originally planned.  We should have a full role in the Government&rsquo;s plan for economic recovery, which we know nothing about other than the small amounts of information that have been leaked to the media and are speculated upon in the newspapers.  Other than that, we have very little detail on the Government&rsquo;s plan.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to provide time at the earliest possible opportunity for an urgent debate on pensions and pension provision.  The issue was raised before the House rose for the Christmas recess in regard to the difficulties of Waterford Crystal and the problems workers, and former workers, are experiencing in terms of what is essentially a black hole in the company funds for their pensions.  A large number of people who work in the private sector are in defined benefit schemes.  There may be cases similar to that in Waterford Crystal and there could be serious repercussions in the coming months as the number of redundancies continues to rise.  I do not see any prospect of that position changing in the short term and I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on pensions at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the views of Members who have spoken about the Roscommon case.  As a parent I am appalled.  The people who were dealing with this case must have had eyes in the back of their head because it is clear from the reports that the system failed those children.  It is interesting that it was only when the children went into foster care that the problem was revealed.  Great work is being done by foster carers.  The one bit of light in respect of this matter is the fact that 100 additional social workers are being recruited.  We can be assured that a number of children may be at risk and we want to ensure that we are not talking about the same subject in a week, a month or a year from now.  Our children are tomorrow&rsquo;s citizens, leaders and Government.</P>
        <P>I have been in contact with the Health Service Executive about the acute psychiatric services in the midland region.  It does not make any great sense that people will have to travel from parts of Longford to an acute facility more than 100 miles away.  That is not acceptable.  As somebody who knows something about the psychiatric services, I am aware that St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar is one of the few hospitals with an acute unit for psychiatry of later life.  It is a unit with which the Cathaoirleach is very familiar and which has great successes to its credit.  I will not waste the time of the House by outlining those successes but the fruits are obvious.  This proposal does not make any sense to me or to anyone I have spoken to in Longford, Westmeath and further afield.</P>
<Col N="342"/>
        <P>This is a proposal by the HSE.  It is a case of somebody casting a cold eye over a situation which they have not considered.  Acute service is about providing for people with the least inconvenience.  It is not good clinical practice for somebody to travel up to 100 miles for an acute service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Pension funds in many companies throughout the country are either insolvent or seriously underfunded.  In my own city, Waterford Crystal is in a precarious position.  Workers who have paid their pension contributions for 20 and 30 years are being told there is not a penny for them at the end of that time.  That is a disgrace.  It is criminal that pension funds should be allowed go in such circumstances.  This matter was raised on several occasions in the previous Seanad by a colleague of mine, Senator Sheila Terry, who spoke on pensions on several occasions.  It is a matter that has been flagged for many years but the Government failed to act in the area of pensions.  I ask that the Minister should come into this House and outline to us what she intends doing about the underfunding of pension funds.  It is disgraceful that people who have been in employment for over 30 years and who have paid all their contributions are being told that there is not a penny available for their retirement.  That should not happen.</P>
        <P>I join colleagues in calling for a debate on the Middle East.  I condemned Hamas for its indiscriminate shelling of Israel on many occasions but &ldquo;disproportionate&rdquo; is not a strong enough word to describe the Israeli response to the butchery of women and children which we saw on our television screens.</P>
        <P>I attended a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs meeting, to which Senator Daly referred also, at which I was glad to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs reprimand one of his own colleagues for calling for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador because he believed, and rightly so, that all avenues of diplomacy should be kept open.  I join those who expressed the wish that the appointment of George Mitchell as an envoy to the Middle East will bear fruit and that a process will arise that will bring peace to that much troubled land.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s call for a debate on A Vision for Change.  In light of the report launched by the Minister yesterday it would be useful at this stage if the Leader could make arrangements for the Minister to attend the House to discuss the next steps in the implementation of A Vision for Change.  It has been recognised by everybody, including the Minister, that the progress made has not been at a pace we would wish.  While the economy is in a serious position currently, it is important that Members of this House take every opportunity to ensure that people with disabilities and mental health illnesses do not get left behind in these very difficult economic times.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader indicate when the legislation covering capacity for vulnerable adults will be brought forward?  We had hoped to have it prior to Christmas.  Is there an update on that?</P>
        <P>There are no words to express the horror, upset and distress caused to everyone who has heard the details of the Roscommon incest case.  It is clear there are lessons to be learned.  There must be as full an inquiry as possible and those of us in the House, and people in other appropriate areas of society, must have the opportunity to consider carefully the findings of that inquiry.  There appear to have been a number of events over the years and a study of each of those events will help us inform our own role here.  Senator Healy-Eames asked why we are here but we have an important role here in terms of legislation and the contributions we make to debates.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive tried to take the children into care.  It went to court but its desire to take the children into care was opposed, it appears, by an organisation which believed <Col N="343"/>it was acting in the interests of the family in question.  Members of the Oireachtas can play a role by communicating a message that this is not a battle between the rights of the family and the rights of the child but trying to ensure everyone is society is protected to the maximum possible extent.</P>
        <P>Twenty months ago, the then Taoiseach made a commitment to hold a referendum on the rights of the child.  An Oireachtas joint committee is examining the proposed referendum.  While its work has been slow, this is a reflection of interest in the issue and the large number of submissions made by members of the public.  Senator Fitzgerald will agree that one of the issues to have emerged in the deliberations has been the number of organisations which mistakenly believe the joint committee&rsquo;s purpose is to attack the family and that they must make submissions to protect the family.  Our role is not to attack the family but to try to ensure children are afforded the best possible protection in the interests of their safety.  While we must consider legislation and the wording of any referendum which may be necessary, Senators must also convey the message at every opportunity that our role is not to attack families.  The rights of the family and the rights of the child can operate in tandem.</P>

As Cathaoirleach, I have sole responsibility for calling speakers.  There is nothing to be gained from approaching staff and the practice must cease.  When the House is in session Senators should not approach or annoy staff as it prevents them from doing their job properly.  I regret the Senator who broke that rule today is not present. </P>

        <P>As Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, on the first sitting day of the session, I offer the congratulations of the House to the new President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.  President Obama has an onerous responsibility and everyone hopes and prays he will assist the world in this difficult time.  The United States also has a new Vice President, Joe Biden.  As I have stated on many occasions, Bill and Hillary Clinton have done great work for this country.  I congratulate Hillary Clinton on her appointment as Secretary of State and look forward to meeting her during her term of office.  I also extend best wishes to Mr. George Mitchell on his appointment as the envoy of the United States to the Middle East.  Mr. Mitchell is a dear friend of Ireland who brought peace to our country.  We wish President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary of State Clinton and the special envoy, Mr. Mitchell, God speed.  We hope they will be successful.  I look forward to their stewardship.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Regan, Coghlan, Buttimer, McFadden and Healy-Eames expressed their views on economic matters and the debate on the economy which will take place later.  I acknowledge that in the past 24 hours the media have justifiably given equal coverage to the Seanad and D&aacute;il in this matter.  People will know the Upper House of Parliament is taking seriously the review of recent events when Senators update the Minister on economic matters which may be of particular relevance or urgency in their respective areas.</P>
        <P>When the economic downturn started in earnest in late September or early October I indicated that I intended to have a special debate on the economy every five or six weeks.  These debates will be wide-ranging and will allow Senators to express their views freely with the Minister, a Minister of State and senior officials in the Department of Finance present.  They will be enormously helpful.</P>
        <P>On 1 July 2008, approximately 480 people were signing on for unemployment assistance in my home town of Castlepollard.  I have noted with regret seven months later that 1,200 people <Col N="344"/>are signing on at the unemployment exchange in this small community, which I am privileged to represent.  The percentage increase in unemployment in Castlepollard is the third largest in the country over the period in question.  This is principally due to the area&rsquo;s dependence on the construction industry, particularly through its many sand and gravel pits, and the manufacture of various items for the construction industry.  With the motor trade, which is supplied by Iralco and Mergon, experiencing a global downturn, Honda is not in a position to purchase chrome strips or parts for their stores in Europe.  As a result, workers at the Mergon factory in Castlepollard have been placed on a three-day week.  Unprecedented global events are taking place.  I thank the leaders of the groups for their understanding and assistance in these changing times.</P>
        <P>I welcome the improvement in the fortunes of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks shares in recent days.  This development will give heart to small and medium-sized family and private businesses which employ more than 40% of the workforce and encourage them to keep up the good fight.  I hope we will see an economic upturn in the next 18 months or two years.  I have assured the House that regular debates on the economy will take place throughout the year as the economy experiences difficulty and colleagues seek to express their views on matters arising.  I look forward to today&rsquo;s debate on the economy.</P>
        <P>I extend my best wishes to the social partners and Government in their efforts to find a formula to meet the challenge of correcting difficulties being experienced in the public finances.  As we are all aware, parts one and two of the Celtic tiger might never have occurred had it not been for the decision of the former Taoiseach, the late Charles Haughey, and the former leader of the trade union movement, Mr. Mullen, to establish the social partnership process in 1987.  Everyone involved at the time deserves congratulations on finding a winning formula for Ireland which was held up as a shining example across Europe.  The social partners and Government are rallying to the call to address the problem of finding savings of &euro;2 billion required to correct the Exchequer imbalance.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Mary White, McDonald, Mullen, Norris, Buttimer, Healy-Eames, John Paul Phelan, Glynn and Corrigan referred to the Roscommon incest case and expressed horror, shock and disappointment that it should have arisen.  We can all learn from this experience and I intend to arrange an urgent debate on the issue.  I am encouraged by the actions of a brave, new Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, in the few days since this matter was brought to his attention.  I intend to request his presence in the House to allow colleagues to raise their concerns and ascertain how we can respond to this dreadful case.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan, Daly, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Cummins and many others brought to the attention of the House the invasion of Gaza which took place over the Christmas period and the horrors being experienced by its people.  We did not believe we would see the like of this again but it is real and we were able to watch it live on television.  The Seanad must commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and the Taoiseach on the Government&rsquo;s stance on the issue.  I intend to have a debate with the Minister present.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris has placed non-Government motion 32 on the Order Paper.  I will do everything I can to facilitate the debate but I remind Independent Senators that next Wednesday night is their Private Members&rsquo; time.  If the Senators wish to have additional time to discuss this and make it their priority for next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

<Col N="345"/>
        <P>Senator Mullen has brought the judgment of Mr. Justice Carney to the attention of the House and I will pass his views to the Minister later on this afternoon.  I agree with the many of the sentiments he expressed.</P>
        <P>Senators McFadden, Glynn and Corrigan gave the House the benefit of their expertise on the issue of mental health and making it a priority.<b>  </b>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, is determined to make an impact in this area.  He has been given a special portfolio by the Taoiseach.  As one who has worked very closely with him through the years, I have every confidence there will be an opportunity created by the Minister of State&rsquo;s endeavour and determination to see that it happens.  I take the point made by Senators McFadden, Glynn and Corrigan that moneys from the sale of property, such as St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar and other areas, should be prioritised and used for the betterment of those who need assistance and care in the area of mental health.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators Phelan and Cummins called for a debate on pensions and pension funds and I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed.  It is a difficult time for those who have been paying into pension funds for many years.  The bond market is on the ground, the stock market is on its knees and investment is probably at the lowest level in 70 or 80 years.  At the end of the day, if one holds one&rsquo;s stocks the wheel will take a turn.  As we have learned before on many occasions, particularly over the past 40 years, those who have invested in pension funds have done very well.  These are unprecedented times.  Those who are now retiring should avail of the opportunity of extended time.  I think there is an extended period of two years.  Such people do not have any other option in this area.  I sympathise with them because everyone looks forward to the day when they will be able to enjoy their retirement.  A pension means certainty but at the moment there is no certainty.  Senator Cummins has said that it is a difficult time.  We, as legislators, must do everything we possibly can to create and keep confidence for those who have made such a significant contribution over the years.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the House of the new legislative programme.  The Seanad will play a pivotal role in charting a way forward for our country during these difficult economic times.  As well as continuing to meet the challenges of the global economic downturn which has affected our country, the Government is introducing a raw legislative programme until 8 April.  Among the Bills to be published during the coming period are the employment agency regulation Bill, the planning and development (amendment) Bill, the financial services (deposit guarantee scheme) Bill, the National Pensions Reserve Fund (amendment) Bill, the child care Bill, the covert surveillance Bill, the criminal justice (money laundering) Bill, the property services regulatory Bill, the criminal procedure Bill, the civil partnership Bill and the road traffic and transport Bill.</P>
        <P>Over the coming weeks and months the Government will continue to make progress in introducing legislation aimed at strengthening the laws protecting citizens and the Irish economy.  Working in a renewed spirit of co-operation, Members of the Oireachtas can help to put Ireland on a firm footing to sustainable economic renewal and improved social protection.  I look forward, under the guidance and stewardship of the Cathaoirleach, to working with all Members to achieve these goals on behalf of the Irish people.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the draft Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Section 5) (Specified Period) Order, 2009, a copy of which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 22 January 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">Under section 5(5)(<i>a</i>) of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, the commission <Col N="347"/>is statutorily obliged to publish its report to the general public within the specified period.  The current specified period will expire on 31 January 2009 and the extension is required in order to allow the commission to fulfil its statutory mandate to finalise and publish its report during the specified period.  As prescribed by the Act, the Department consulted the commission on the timeframe for the extension of the current specified period.  The commission, which is independent of the Department in its functions, has requested an extension of four months to the end of May 2009 to allow for completion of the report and to make the necessary preparations for its publication.  The chairperson, the Honourable Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan, in a letter to the Department, dated 19 January 2009, confirmed the commission is finalising the report, which is expected to comprise between 3,000 and 3,500 pages.  The present position is that more than 90% of the material is being given final approval by the commissioners and the remainder will be completed before mid-February at which time the printing and proofing process will begin.</P>
        <P>When the previous extension was sought in May 2008, the commission had indicated to the Department that it hoped to be in a position to forward the report to the printers by the end of November 2008, with a further period of two months being allowed in which to finalise the printing and proofing process.  Consequently, the previous specified period was extended to the end of January 2009 on foot of those advices received from the commission.  However, in his letter of 19 January 2009, the chairperson has indicated the work and time involved in the printing, proofing and publication of the report was underestimated.  All focus to date has been on completing the writing of the report but the commission is now in a position to be more accurate about the schedule of work required leading to the publication of the report.  Under the terms of section 5(5) of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, an order to extend the term of the commission must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Since the then Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology of 11 May 1999 to the victims of abuse in childhood, a range of Government measures have been put in place for the redress of abuse, including the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the setting up of a financial redress scheme for victims of abuse and the establishment of a statutory redress board to administer this scheme, the provision of counselling services and the establishment of the education finance board.  The commission was formally established in May 2000 and its broad terms of reference are to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum; to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940 to the present; and to compile a report and publish it to the public on the activities and the findings of the commission, containing recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in future.</P>
        <P>One of the core functions of the commission is to provide those who previously had no such facility with an opportunity to recount their experiences of childhood abuse to an experienced and sympathetic forum.  This therapeutic role is all that many former residents of institutions require of the commission.  However, others have expressed a wish for their allegations of abuse to be inquired into.  To ensure both strands were accommodated, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 provided for two distinct committees &mdash; the confidential committee and the investigation committee.  In providing two separate fora, this has ensured, on the one hand, the right to confidentiality of those who wanted only to access the therapeutic role of the commission and, on the other hand, the right to natural justice of those persons accused of abuse.</P>
        <P>The confidential committee has provided a forum for 1,090 victims of abuse to recount their experience on an entirely confidential basis.  The purpose of the committee is to meet the needs <Col N="348"/>of those victims who want to recount their experiences but who do not wish to become involved in an investigative procedure.  The investigation committee investigated complaints and allegations made to it.  It has the power to compel persons accused to attend before it and to compel them to produce any relevant documentation which it may require as part of its investigations.  This committee is, therefore, facilitating victims who wish both to recount their experiences and to have allegations of abuse fully inquired into. To date, part of the committee&rsquo;s activities are as follows: 286 individuals attended 288 hearings; 553 people were interviewed; 59 complainants attended for interview and hearing; 353 who made applications withdrew from the process; and 253 transferred to the confidential committee.  The investigation committee has also held public hearings into a number of specific institutions.  Evidence has also been submitted to the committee at public hearings relating to the Departments of Education and Science, Justice Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  The committee is in the process of finalising its report.</P>
        <P>On completion of its investigations and as required by the relevant legislation, the commission will publish its report.  This will be published directly to the public by the commission itself.  The final report of the commission will be based on the findings and subsequent reports of both the confidential and investigation committees.  The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 provides that, in its report, the commission may identify institutions in which abuse occurred and the people responsible for such abuse and may make findings in regard to the role and responsibility of management and regulatory authorities.  The report however, following the recommendation of the commission, will not make findings on any individual case.  It may also contain recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in the future.</P>
        <P>The publication of the report will not represent the end of the commission&rsquo;s operations.  Other functions must be performed which statutorily can continue after the specified period has lapsed.  These include settlement of all third party legal representation costs, management of discovery documentation held by the commission, the carrying out of any work related to post-publication of reports and management of the general shutdown of the commission.  The commission, during the period of its existence, has been the recipient of a voluminous body of extremely confidential and sensitive material.  Consequently and in accordance with section 6 of the 2000 Act, the commission will have to make such arrangements as it considers appropriate for the making of as complete a record as is practicable of the proceedings of the commission and the committees.  It will also be charged with making arrangements for the custody and-or disposal of the documents provided to the commission.  This in itself will be a huge task.</P>
        <P>Expenditure for the commission from inception to the end of 2008 was &euro;59.4 million.  It is estimated that an additional provision of between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million may be required to meet remaining overall costs of the commission to the end of 2010.  The 2009 allocation of &euro;20 million will meet part of this liability.  This is a tentative provision, given the commission has yet to receive and assess a large volume of third party legal costs.  The granting of this extension will not require additional funding above that allocated.</P>
        <P>I urge Senators to approve this resolution by supporting the motion.  By doing so, Senators are enabling the commission to fulfil its statutory mandate by publishing its report.  By supporting the motion, Senators are providing the legal basis through which the Government and this House have previously decided the commission would report and they will provide the opportunity for a regrettable episode in Irish history to be recorded fully, accurately and fairly and to acknowledge the input of all those who were part of this process.  The publication of the report, containing the findings and recommendations of the commission, is an essential part of the service the Government can render to our society as a whole.  However, while society as a <Col N="349"/>whole can benefit from the work of the commission, we must not forget that this is primarily a commission for the victims of abuse.  The work of the commission and its public report is an opportunity for them to receive the kind of respectful and sympathetic acknowledgement to which they are entitled.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Senator Fitzgerald.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is time we got on with this because the commission has been sitting for nine years.  We, in Fine Gael are happy to support the time extension requested by the Minister of State but it is time to finish up and, therefore, this should be the final extension.  Is the reason for the delay the need to proof the document before publication?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is more or less a reflection of the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the recent revelations regarding the Roscommon incest case and the Cloyne diocese, does the Government intend to ask the commission to conduct investigations into other allegations of child abuse?  The Minister of State said it would have a future role.  What type of role will it have and will it have a role in new emerging cases of abuse?  In light of recent revelations can we feel genuinely satisfied that an inquiry into Health Service Executive actions carried out by a team including HSE members can be genuinely independent?  There is no point unless we can get the truth.  This was essentially a truth commission.  We now have a monster doing really good work but it has cost the State &euro;79.4 million over nine years.  It must knit in and the findings of this report must be implemented.  Can the Minister of State give a commitment to the House that it will and that practice will change?</P>
        <P>Has the commission considered mandatory reporting of child abuse within its terms of reference?  I am a former teacher and when I taught in New York where there was mandatory reporting of child abuse.  It changed how I viewed the area of child protection and child neglect.  The very definition of neglect included even educational neglect.  With that new perspective, I was definitely more aware of my responsibility.  On the Order of Business today I shared with the House one experience I had.  A six year old boy in my class was always tired and could never concentrate.  On talking to him, he told me that his brother was always getting up on his back at night.  When I reported my concerns to the principal, there was an investigation into the family which discovered an entire litany of abuse.  It was known but not about this particular child and the case was, if one likes, let rest to be reopened again.  Educators or teachers will just have suspicions and need help through the law and by training to be protected and empowered to act.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science promised full implementation of the Children First guidelines along with training provided to teachers.  There is only one designated liaison person in each school with another person being offered training this year.  That is not good enough.  Regardless of whether it is the diocese, priests, school or family, it is the child who is being hurt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing this matter in the context of the appalling revelations about a family in Roscommon where there was abuse and neglect over many years and the children were not protected.  I imagine this report will shed light on a very dark corner of our history.  More than 1,000 victims of abuse have been interviewed by the commission.  Obviously we support the extension of the commission&rsquo;s work and it being given the opportunity to report fully and comprehensively on what it has found during its investigation.  No doubt many lessons will be learnt from the commission as its report comes into the public arena and at the same time the report into abuse in the Dublin diocese comes into the arena along with other recent findings.  Today I again looked at the Kelly Fitzgerald report, published <Col N="350"/>in 1996, from which we should have learnt many lessons.  Clearly we have not learnt from that case or from the Kilkenny incest case.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a number of brief points about the commission.  A very important social history will emerge in the coming months when it publishes its report.  It is very important that what the commission has learnt through its investigations is brought to the light of day in full.  The Minister of State talked about the records being preserved.  It is very important that as much information as possible comes from the report so that we can understand the full extent of what happened to allow us to ensure it does not happen again.  That needs to be the key lesson to be learnt from the report.  We need to implement its recommendations.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;79 million in costs have been incurred, much of it in legal costs.  The State needs to learn to investigate without incurring such costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on this.  I appreciate this is not strictly the brief of the Minister of State.  However, we need to have interconnectedness between the work he is doing and that of the Minister of State with responsibility for children.  The investigation into the Roscommon case clearly should be an independent investigation.  I know the person appointed as chair, who I am sure will do a very good job.  As soon as she finds that the terms of reference are so limited, I expect she will have serious concerns.  It is unacceptable for the HSE to be investigating itself.  In the time of the health boards, one health board used to investigate another health board, which was seen to be acceptable.  To have HSE staff members investigating themselves is simply unacceptable.  I note that Senator Mary White also said this on the Order of Business.  I hope the Government will immediately review that proposal and the investigation team&rsquo;s terms of reference.  The children were left in the situation they were in because many agencies, for whatever reason, did not come together and work together.  We need to investigate not just that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator must conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but also the school, the community and the court decisions that were taken.  The terms of reference simply do not allow for that, which is very disturbing.  On a day when the Seanad is discussing the issue of 1,000 people who have been abused in various residential settings and a report on it costing &euro;79 million, which will be well spent if it prevents the sort of abuse it will outline, to be setting up another inquiry in the same week that is not as objective as it should be and that is not a commission of inquiry with the power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As we all know, the issue of child abuse is reported in the newspapers, if not daily then every second day.  The <Col N="351"/>headlines in the past two weeks on the Roscommon case put more pressure on the Government to amend the Constitution to protect children.  The rights of children need to be enshrined in the Constitution.  We have had the findings of the Roman Catholic Church&rsquo;s national board for safeguarding children that the diocese of Cloyne was not compliant with the church&rsquo;s own child protection policies, having failed to alert the authorities to child sexual abuse allegations, and we have had the Roscommon case involving the first woman in the history of the State to be jailed for incest and abusing her own children.  The deadline for the commission to publish its report should be extended so that the commission may include also the victims and outcomes of these two cases.</P>
        <P>We are told that child abuse is rampant in this country.  The Rape Crisis Centre published figures in October 2008.  It reported that 60% of people abused in childhood were abused for longer than a year.  It also estimated that almost 7% of childhood abuse is perpetrated on girls under the age of four.  Girls are much more likely to be abused by a family member or extended family member.  Boys are much more likely than girls to be abused by an authority figure, which may include a youth leader, priest, or sports coach.</P>
        <P>What constitutes child abuse?  Children have a right to enjoy their childhood free from sexual abuse, violence or injury at the hands of adults or others.  This right is enshrined in law, from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child down to national laws and guidelines.  Children can be subjected to different forms of abuse, including by paedophiles when children are sexually abused by adults.  Paedophiles are monsters.  Neglect occurs where a child is deprived of food, clothing, warmth, hygiene, stimulation or care.  Another form is emotional abuse, where affection, approval, consistency and security are withheld from a child.  The effects of sexual abuse include post-traumatic distress disorder, deliberate self-harm, suicide, promiscuity, alcohol abuse and depression.  Unless abused children are identified and receive counselling and the best psychiatric services, I am afraid they will never be free to reach their potential or enjoy their lives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I support the motion.  I am glad the commission is doing its work.  Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan deserves great credit, as does his predecessor, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.</P>
        <P>The mark of a mature society is that it learns from past errors and evils and tries to ensures a brighter future, when the dignity of a person will be fully vindicated.  As we reflect on the Ryan commission, our first thoughts are with the victims of abuse.  I note the reference by the Minister of State to the therapeutic value of victims being able to tell their story.  It is worth noting the structure of the commission which has a confidential committee, a willow tree where people can relate their experiences in full, as well as an investigation committee to hear different sides in the making of allegations.  These separate fora were necessary to cope with the needs of the victims of abuse such as those who had a general story to tell of hurt caused.  Perhaps people on the margins of society had suffered before being institutionalised and then suffered further hurt while in institutional care.  There is a need to reflect on the institutional set-up.</P>
        <P>I know of cases in which false allegations were made.  I was contacted by such a person.  Eventually the case against him was dropped but not before he had endured years of torment.  In taking such a telephone call and hearing such a story, one does not know how to weigh what one is hearing in terms of its quality.  The man spoke of wanting to give evidence to the commission but the case was withdrawn.  There may be a small number of cases in which that happened but it is also an injustice when a false allegation is made.  In some cases false allegations were made against people who were still alive.  It is disappointing that in an era when society seemed to understand the strong social sense of the sanctity of life, there was not <Col N="352"/>always respect for the dignity of the living.  As we see everyday, including in the context of the Roscommon incest case, the difficulty of vindicating the dignity of the person remains a challenge in society.  It is arguable that, while in some ways the world is a better place for children, when one considers diverse issues such as family breakdown and the secrecy that still surrounds the neglect and abuse of children, it can be a hard world for many.  That is a tragic statement to make in a society that considers itself civilised and modern.</P>
        <P>Many of the institutions in question were run by the church which was the main carer.  It is disappointing that, in the cases investigated by the commission, on occasion institutions or people of the church proved to be poor carers.  We should not forget that the reason these institutions were largely run by the church is it was the main carer, in the words of the Constitution, in the place of parents.  As we continue to learn, sometimes the person charged with responsibility for the care of a child can be a poor or cruel carer, even a criminally cruel carer.</P>
        <P>We should situate this issue in an international context.  It is tempting to think such cases only happened in Ireland but if one examines institutional care settings throughout the world, one will see that those on the margins of society, those who were vulnerable enough to be placed in institutional care, were frequently considered to have rights lesser to those who grew up in more stable, loving families.  As we await the report of the commission and wish it well, listen to its findings and reflect on what we are told, we must learn from what it will tell us in order that there will be a brighter era and that we will be assisted in the work of ensuring a better society in which children and the most vulnerable members of society will cherished and which will be truly child friendly, not just in its laws and public rhetoric but the day-to-day reality of children&rsquo;s lives within their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Like others, I support the proposal that the period of time afforded to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse be extended for the period suggested.  It is appropriate that this be done and the time suggested is not unreasonable, notwithstanding what others have said about the length of time the deliberations have taken to date.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for the details provided in his contribution to this short debate.  He has gone as far as he can to put Members in the picture regarding the current state of play with the commission.  It is appropriate that this be done.  Often, when asked to extend the period of time given to other bodies, it is as much our fault as that of anyone else but we are inclined to let these matters pass quickly and with a nod.  It is appropriate, therefore, that short debates such as this take place and that the appropriate Minister should come into to the House to put us in the picture.</P>
        <P>We will have the opportunity to engage in a full debate on the findings of the commission in due course.  We are reminded by recent events that there is considerable abuse other than in institutions, with which the commission principally deals.  We have had a stark reminder in recent days that there is considerable abuse in the family home.  As others have said, it is important that the commission have the opportunity to finish its work.  Those undertaking it have considerable expertise, are persons of renown and have a considerable reputation.  They include Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan.  I note that his predecessor, Ms Justice Laffoy, did not have a happy experience in the early stages of the commission.  I hope the institutions involved and the Department have given their full co-operation to it, as we expect nothing less.  There were question marks against this in the early days but I believe the matter has been resolved.</P>
        <P>One of the attractions of the commission is that it is not characterised by adversarial presentations or the cross-examination of persons appearing before it.  It is more akin to a truth commission in the way we have become familiar with them in other countries.  On behalf of <Col N="353"/>the Labour Party, I agree to the reasonable extension proposed until May for the completion of the report of the commission and look forward to its publication and our debate on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion is simple in its nature and I am pleased that all parties are prepared to accept the extension of time being sought.  It also offers the House an opportunity to express ongoing concerns about the nature and practice of child abuse in society.  There is no doubt that recent events which are being examined by the Health Service Executive have appalled people and brought into question the extent to which society has a handle on this issue.  This is not necessarily a criticism of the systems currently in place but as a society we are failing and we need to make changes.</P>
        <P>I have made this criticism before but the situation will be helped when there is full implementation of the Children Act.  Although I am aware of the political and fiscal realities behind it, I cannot understand why there continues to be a reluctance to implement the remaining sections of this Act.  Until this is done, situations such as occurred in Roscommon, will continue to be repeated.  Unless the necessary political action is taken, I fear for the immediate future.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Oireachtas joint committee which is considering the constitutional issue of children&rsquo;s rights and I wish it well in its work.  I hope for an early deliberation on the decision we need to make as to whether such a change should occur.  There is widespread acceptance in society that such a change should be recognised in the Constitution and effected by legislation.  We also need to deal with the issue of mandatory reporting.  The debate on this issue is between those who think that mandatory reporting will somehow create a nanny state but I would argue and it is my party&rsquo;s policy that the absence of mandatory reporting has the exact opposite effect.  A nanny takes care of a child&rsquo;s needs.  The situation reported in the past week proves that a lack of care is evident in the case of too many children.  We need to put in place systems to allow people express concerns in a confidential way and which can be acted upon following sufficient investigation.</P>
        <P>It may be the case that mandatory reporting will result in people being unfairly accused but I am hopeful that the system of mandatory reporting will be used appropriately and we will have a society in which people will make such concerns known in a responsible way.  The alternative is the appalling events in County Roscommon and in too many other locations.</P>
        <P>I wish the commission well in completing its work and in using the extension of time wisely.  The House depends on its deliberations being a means of informing the wider debate on the issue.  I look forward to both Houses of the Oireachtas living up to the responsibility of both implementing the existing legislation and bringing forward further necessary legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Education and Science is sponsoring this motion.  Many of the questions raised are more properly a matter for the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  However, I will make some comments about the awful case heard recently in Roscommon Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>On 24 January 2009, Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, took receipt of the Health Service Executive preliminary review into the very disturbing case which recently came before Roscommon Circuit Court and which has been widely reported.  On foot of this preliminary review, the Minister of State has indicated his full support for the HSE&rsquo;s decision to launch an immediate detailed independent investigation into the case.  He is confident that the terms of reference are sufficiently broad enough to ensure all the relevant facts are established and appropriate findings are made.  The appointment of Ms Norah Gibbons of Barnardos, as chairperson of the team, brings a wealth of experience to the investigation and significantly adds to the independence of the inquiry.  As <Col N="354"/>the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has correctly pointed out, all members of society should be vigilant for the signs of child abuse and neglect.  The Department of Education and Science awaits the outcome of the HSE investigation and will take on board any recommendations made by the inquiry team which would enhance the child protection procedures currently in operation in our schools.</P>
        <P>A number of questions were raised by Senators and I thank Members for their support for this motion.  The commission will have no further role other than investigation of the historical abuse.  There are other functions to be performed which may statutorily continue after the specified period has elapsed.  These include settlement of all third party legal representation costs, management of discovery documentation held by the commission, the carrying out of any work related to post-publication of reports, and management of the general shut-down of the commission.</P>
        <P>The Dublin archdiocese inquiry will deal with clerical child abuse in Dublin and Cloyne.  The commission was extended to deal with allegations in respect of Cloyne.  With regard to child protection procedures generally, the primary statutory responsibility for child protection lies with the Health Service Executive.  The role of the Department of Education and Science is to provide guidance and support to schools in implementing child protection policy and to refer any allegations received to the appropriate authorities for investigation.  The Department has issued child protection guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>I refer to a point raised by Senator Mullen.  The Department has recently been in receipt of correspondence from representatives of the TUI, the ASTI and the INTO, expressing concerns regarding the Department&rsquo;s current practice of reporting all complaints to the HSE, especially allegations of bullying and emotional abuse.  The primary statutory responsibility for child protection lies with the HSE.  It is not the function of the Department of Education and Science to investigate allegations of abuse.  The role of the Department is to provide guidance and support to schools in implementing child protection policy and to refer any allegations to the appropriate authorities.  However, once the Children First guidelines are updated and the reports of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Dublin archdiocese commission have been published, the Department will review its current protocols and will make any necessary amendments or additions where appropriate.</P>
        <P>This subject could be further debated in the House in the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility and youth affairs.  I thank Senators for their support.  It is a reasonable request and I am grateful to Members for their co-operation in this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad on the state of our economic prospects.  We have witnessed their dramatic deterioration over the past year, which we must face up to.  In the days of our prosperity, perhaps we should have heeded the words of the psalm, &ldquo;though wealth increase, set not your heart upon it&rdquo;.  Certainly, any belief here or elsewhere that the economic cycle could be abolished or softened represented the triumph of hope over experience.  It will be a long time before any country makes such an assumption again or mistakes the dangers of indulging runaway growth.</P>
        <P>An almost unprecedented set of circumstances has now emerged.  The relatively new globalised economy is facing a most uncertain outlook.  From an Irish perspective, the fall-out from these developments means we are confronting major challenges on all budgetary, banking <Col N="355"/>and economic fronts.  It is understandable that people are afraid or angry or both.  Our duty in the Government and in the Oireachtas is to give back a sense of responsibility and direction to support the basic level of confidence needed for any society to function effectively.</P>
        <P>The origins of the global financial market crisis are well known in outline.  Nevertheless, the causes of the problems and the solutions to them are complex, as indicated by the broad range of policy responses so far employed by the relevant authorities in other countries to address them.  Global financial market conditions remain extremely difficult, negatively impacting upon almost all of the world&rsquo;s economies.  Access to credit has been restricted in most of our export markets, weighing on household expenditure and on normal business investment and activity.  The European Commission recently revised downwards its projections for growth in all our major export trading partners for this year.  It is projected the eurozone, the United Kingdom and the United States will all experience a recession this year, with at best a modest improvement in the next year.  Combined, these economies represent the destination markets for about 80% of our exports which will limit our ability to export.  Yesterday, in one day, 72,500 jobs were reported to have been lost worldwide.</P>
        <P>Factors outside our control such as recent exchange rate movements have also contributed to the declining competitiveness of our exports on global markets.  Particularly vulnerable are many of our small and medium-sized enterprises which export to the sterling area.  Many of these firms are small and labour-intensive.  The recent fluctuating appreciation of the euro against sterling has eroded the competitive position of these firms.</P>
        <P>While we cannot influence exchange rate or other external developments, we must focus on those aspects of competitiveness over which we can exert influence.  These include pay and non-pay costs, infrastructure, the skills level of the population and the regulatory environment. Our objective must be to position the economy to take advantage of global recovery when it emerges.</P>
        <P>Difficulties on the international front are being compounded by sharp contraction in the construction sector.  The level of house building this year will be around one quarter of that which prevailed in 2006.  The slowdown in the house building sector has spilled over to other sectors of the economy, with results in recent months being especially poor.  Employment is declining, unemployment is at its highest level in over a decade, consumer confidence is poor and tax receipts have declined drastically.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance expects the economy to contract by 4%, following a decline of nearly 1.5% last year.  A further contraction, although at a slower pace, is projected next year.  If so, this will represent the first time in the State&rsquo;s history when there were three consecutive years of declining economic activity.</P>
        <P>The sharp deterioration in economic growth has had a huge effect on the public finances.  Tax receipts last year were almost 14% below their levels in 2007, with those tax heads most closely aligned with the housing and the international financial markets worst affected.  Ireland complies fully with its international obligations in respect of taxation.  The world is becoming ever less tolerant of unco-operative tax havens which maintain absolute bank secrecy to facilitate illegal tax evasion by high worth individuals or companies.</P>
        <P>Reduced levels of tax revenue mean that not enough is being collected to finance the increases in public expenditure over recent years.  Ireland is once again borrowing significantly to fund day-to-day spending, while totally funding all capital expenditure from borrowings at a level which simply is not sustainable.</P>
        <P>In the absence of further policy action, a general Government deficit in the range at least of 11% to 12% of gross domestic product would be in prospect for each of the years to 2013.  This situation is untenable and as a result, the Government has submitted a plan to the European <Col N="356"/>Commission which prioritises the elimination of the current budget deficit and the restoration of a general Government deficit below 3% of gross domestic product by 2013.</P>
        <P>The plan will restore balance to the public finances by prioritising current expenditure and adjusting both expenditure and taxation levels to reflect changed realities.  At the same time, capital investment has been retained at a high level to provide, in addition to automatic stabilisers, a significant fiscal stimulus while boosting the longer term productive capacity of the economy.  In this context, the Commission on Taxation and the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes will have a key advisory role to play.  However, substantive immediate action is also required.  With that in mind, the Government agreed expenditure savings of &euro;2 billion have to be made in 2009.  We must demonstrate clearly, both nationally and internationally, that in response to the exceptionally difficult environment that we face, our public finances will be managed in a stable and sustainable manner and brought back on track.</P>
        <P>We are tackling these challenges starting from a position of relative strength.  The period of extraordinary economic growth which Ireland experienced allowed the significant reduction of the general Government debt.  At the end of 2008, it stood at 41% of gross domestic product, still well below the 60% which is the benchmark level for the eurozone.  In addition, the general Government debt does not measure the significant value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund or the substantial cash balances the National Treasury Management Agency holds.  When account is taken of these, Ireland&rsquo;s net debt is closer to 20% of gross domestic product.  This low initial level of public debt provides some leeway to target a restoration of balance to the public finances over several years.  Doing it over a shorter timeframe would inflict unacceptable extra costs and job losses on the economy.</P>
        <P>Vital discussions are taking place at present with the social partners on all aspects of the public finances, including the public service pay bill.  Decisions need to be taken by the Government in the near future.  I do not wish to say anything to prejudice the outcome of these deliberations given the critical sensitivity of this process.  However, it is clear all elements of public expenditure need to contribute to the package that will be implemented by the Government to begin restoring balance to Exchequer finances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position of the banking sector is fluid and the Government continues to monitor developments closely, both nationally and internationally.  The Government is committed to providing a platform for a regulated and profitable banking industry of high repute that operates in a national and international financial services environment.  The bank guarantee scheme, recapitalisation and linked credit package, and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank are intended to meet these objectives.  Requirements for the banking sector are that the banks will serve borrowers, small and medium-sized enterprises and all stakeholders in an honest and straightforward way to ensure customers and consumers are treated in a reputable and respectable way.  Those <i>ci-devant </i>movers and shakers who by their manipulations have betrayed public and stakeholder trust and thereby greatly exacerbated an already difficult situation will be brought to account.</P>
        <P>Significant falls in the share prices of Irish banks pointed to the capital market&rsquo;s belief they were undercapitalised.  The Government&rsquo;s plan to recapitalise is intended to stabilise the Irish financial system and secure its funding base.  Discussions are ongoing with Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland on recapitalisation.  Discussions are also continuing on the capital requirements of our other financial institutions.</P>
        <P>The nature and thrust of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory regime needs to adjust to the new realities.  Lessons will be learned from mistakes made and from the international experience of the <Col N="357"/>recent period of worldwide financial disruption.  Work is under way on forging a new model to govern the conduct and behaviour of the financial sector, both domestically and internationally.</P>
        <P>I wish to say a few words about the current role of the Office of Public Works in regard to expenditure reduction and investment.  The OPW&rsquo;s expenditure has been reduced by roughly &euro;200 million, or 30% in real terms, since I took office last May and further savings are likely.  Minimal constituency staff, comprising one unestablished civil servant in each of Dublin and Tipperary, are employed by my office.  Further substantial works to Leinster House have been postponed.  A national procurement operations unit to rationalize and economise on procurement policy across most of the public sector was approved in principle by the Government last July.  As manager of much of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio, our job is to bring down and keep down the cost of rents. The decentralisation programme has been rationalised and concentrated on the more immediately viable projects and a review of others will take place in 2011, when much of the programme will have already been fulfilled.</P>
        <P>Heritage management is a vital area of activity, with direct relevance to our domestic and foreign tourism industry.  The OPW manages a large number of the most important tourist attractions in the country.  Our objective is to maintain and develop these sites and properties and open public access to them at a level that can be economically justified in broad terms.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have given absolute priority to flood relief schemes because of the serious incidence of flooding in recent years and the need to increase the strength of our defences ahead of the threat of further climate change.  All the evidence indicates that there can be a substantial return on investment in such schemes in built up areas and that small works in villages and parts of the countryside, whether carried out by the relevant local authority or the OPW, or both, can often make a big difference.  I visited the works under way in Clonmel and Mallow last week and on the River Dodder last December.  A scheme to protect properties in Mornington, County Meath, will commence next April.  Tenders on the first phase of a scheme to reduce the flooding in Fermoy were issued last Friday and work should commence in May.  Flood risk assessments for all the river catchment areas in the State will be commissioned over the next five years.  Improved levels of flood protection will help to minimize risk to life and serious damage to property, as well as reverse the decline of urban areas regularly prone to flooding.  They are a good example of infrastructural investments related to the environment that improve both quality of life and the scope for viable urban renewal.  They are, therefore, being prioritised in the current economic conditions.</P>
        <P>Like all other open trading nations, we are in an acutely difficult international and domestic economic environment.  The Government has been pro-active and difficult decisions are being made which will help build the path to future recovery.  We must not lose sight of the fact that we have strengths, including our very low level of public debt which gives us some leeway over the short-term by allowing the public finances adjust, and our level of employment which is still high at some 2 million in work, or over 600,000 more than was the case a decade ago.  We are still a high income country by international standards and our underlying growth potential remains strong.  Many important and worthwhile projects and public improvements are still in the pipeline.  Without underestimating the issues currently facing us, the challenges we face must be overcome in order to maintain maximum employment and to set up a position that is conducive to renewed employment growth in the future.  I look forward to a constructive and informed debate.</P>

	<P>Over the weekend I read <i>The Builders</i>, a book about Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s movers and shakers.  Written by Frank McDonald and Kathy Sheridan, it describes how a small group of property developers fuelled the building boom and transformed Ireland.  Senator Ross and I are like-minded in our reading material.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the book&rsquo;s findings are interesting.  For example, of the &euro;413 million that was spent on the Ringsend glass factory, almost &euro;300 million came from Anglo Irish Bank.  Last week, Davy Stockbrokers wrote down the value of that site by 60%.  If similar valuations are applied across the commercial and residential property sector, we can expect significant write-offs.  I was also interested to read that Mr. Se&aacute;n Dunne, one of the movers and shakers who were responsible for this boom and bust, was a VIP guest of none other than Deputy Bertie Ahern when he attended Westminster and the US Congress.</P>
        <P>A programme about the property crash, &ldquo;Future Shock&rdquo;, was condemned by Government politicians when it was broadcast in April 2007.  It was claimed that the predictions made in the programme would never transpire even though, in November 2007, builders and developers meeting in the Radisson SAS made it clear to the then Minister for Finance that the construction sector was in trouble.  Afterwards, however, they each donated &euro;5,000 to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  In October 2007, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who was surely being advised by the same builders and developers, accused those who talked down the economy of being prophets of doom and claimed to be confident that the economy had good times ahead.  In the meantime, Irish people were taking out huge mortgages to purchase property.  One must ask how much the Government knew about these matters.</P>
        <P>What are we to do now?  The Government is spending &euro;60 billion despite earning a mere &euro;40 billion.  This situation is unlikely to change over the next few years.  Even if the Government lasts a full term in office, it will need at least &euro;50 billion to keep the public finances in order.  The value of the assets owned by Irish people have decreased by between &euro;50 billion and &euro;100 billion.  Many are now described by banks as &ldquo;distressed&rdquo; but we do not know the exact number of such assets.  If the total value is only &euro;50 billion we will have some hope but if it stands at &euro;100 billion, the Government will need &euro;50 billion to sort itself out and the taxpayer could be made liable for a further &euro;50 billion.  When the Taoiseach mentioned a figure of &euro;15 billion to his backbenchers last night, he was way off the mark in regard to the figures which are troubling this country.</P>
        <P>This House is being treated with contempt on this issue because the Government has retreated to Dublin Castle to discuss matters that have a major impact on Irish people.  Ministers should present more accurate figures to the Houses.</P>
        <P>The Government has focused its attack on the public sector, but no action we take in that regard is likely to resolve the mess we currently face.  The debate needs to be broadened rapidly.</P>
        <P>The aforementioned devaluation by Davy Stockbrokers of the Ringsend site will be repeated during the course of the year.  Any movers and shakers who are still making money will be able to write off their losses against their tax bills, which will mean even smaller revenues for the Exchequer next year.  We may find that our tax shortfall will be dramatically greater than the 2008 figures.  However, Ministers are not taking account of this prospect.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State stated that he is not making his decisions quickly because he is afraid of what may happen.  However, the Government is in effect selling the family silver.  It intends to protect the public finances and meet our commitments to the banking sector by giving away the gains we have made over the past decade in terms of repaying the debts we incurred.  Government debt will now be ratcheted up to an unbelievable level for the next couple of years.</P>
        <P>I do not know what interest rate the Government will borrow this &euro;50 billion or &euro;60 billion at but it will be significant, so this interest will have to be paid back as well as the principal.  That sort of talk is sending us back to where we came from in the 1980s.  That is profligate and <Col N="359"/>out-of-control Government spending.  When acting in such a way, the Government cannot argue it will do so in conjunction with the social partners in Dublin Castle.  These sorts of discussions should be open and far more information should be given to the people of Ireland on what is being done.</P>
        <P>It is an unbelievable position and it is only now dawning on many people because, to some degree, they were being misled for a long time.  The people expect direction from the Government.  In this House just before Christmas, the Minister for Finance stated that he still expected the 6% pay increase for the public service to be paid next September.  In the new year he is not just talking about getting rid of the 6% pay increase but making cutbacks.  The Government is not being honest with the people.  If it believes there is a crisis, it should speak as if the people need to realise how serious this issue is.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s own speech acknowledges this to some degree but one would have to look for the information.  Ministers misled the people all through 2007 and 2008 with regard to the crisis in the country.  Government backbenchers are expecting the Taoiseach to make a state of the nation address to the people of Ireland but all he must do is tell the truth.  They should stop talking as if there is leadership in this country and concentrate on what is going on instead.  The situation is very serious, if one considers the sort of figures currently being mentioned.</P>
        <P>The national debt could return to 100% of GDP before 2011 if we do not get to grips with what is going on, which would be a terrible failure by the Government.  We are returning to being the basket case of Europe.  This comes from not only fawning over the movers and shakers that were spoken about but a lack of realism in dealing with the problems when they arose.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend I read about the Swedish crisis in the early 1990s which the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has touched on in his speeches.  Some economists have argued that a devaluation of the Swedish currency was effective in getting the country out of its problems.  We cannot devalue the euro.  The cutbacks being spoken about may bring in &euro;2 billion, which is pretty miserable considering the Government will be liable for at least &euro;20 billion extra in Government spending and we do not know how much the bank bail outs will cost the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Is there a solution being discussed at a broader level that could be debated in this country?  Has the Government gone to Europe to consider some way of discussing what was done in Sweden, if devaluing the currency and making radical changes is the only way to solve the mess we are in?  As a small open economy we have a very strong currency, yet we are trying to export into a market with a very weak currency.  We do not have a hope in hell of sustaining this in the long term and something will go seriously wrong.</P>
        <P>Nothing is coming from the Government to suggest it has any plan.  I am not talking about pulling out of the euro, and the Minister of State would not even mention this in his response.  Surely there must be some way of the European Union looking at introducing a regional package for those three or four countries like Ireland at the periphery of the currency which seem to be seriously distressed.  There should be a way to deal with the strong currency and how it is affecting our economy.</P>
        <P>It is amazing that in 18 months we have doubled our national debt and unemployment levels in this country.  One economist, Mr. Jim Power, predicted that unemployment could reach 420,000 by the end of this year but most people feel it will easily reach 400,000.  Some think we could easily reach 450,000.  Fine Gael will table a motion on this issue tomorrow in this House and I am sure Senator John Paul Phelan will have more to say on the matter.</P>
        <P>We must begin hearing solutions from the Government on how it will deal with the significant number of people who will be unemployed by this time next year.  If 450,000 people are unem<Col N="360"/>ployed, it will have an incredible effect on Government finances.  We must also have a frank discussion with Ministers in both Houses on the advantages of pay cuts for the Irish economy over an increase in the higher rate of tax.  Some, including those in the unions, feel that increasing the higher rate of tax might be more equitable rather than just singling out public and civil servants for a significant reduction in their pay packets.  That may not take into account the overall gross income coming into each person&rsquo;s household.</P>
        <P>People&rsquo;s salaries cannot be considered in a vacuum, as they may well be paying for very expensive mortgages, child care costs or loans taken for other reasons.  In some cases, both people in a partnership may be working, with one in the public service and another in the private sector.  Perhaps both may be in the public sector.  All these factors must be taken into account before there can be a blanket decrease in public sector incomes.  We have a good idea of what can happen when we do not give pay increases or if taxes are increased.  There should be more input from the Government on why it is taking a particular line in the discussions so far.</P>
        <P>When making cuts, one factor that must be considered is the effect on services to people provided by Government.  We are already getting correspondence from the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children telling us that because of difficult financial circumstances, special supports for children with disabilities and intellectual needs and elderly people that have been expected over the last number of years will end.  There is a need to clarify what will be taken from people.</P>
        <P>Access to home help for elderly people in our communities is already coming under severe pressure and this will only get worse over time.  Local authorities have clearly lost out with regard to development levies and income from Government.  They are responsible for grants to elderly people to refurbish houses by putting in showers, stair lifts or extensions which make it easier for them to stay at home if they have some mobility problems or other disabilities.  That keeps such people out of nursing homes, which are far more expensive.  We will see a significant reduction in those grants, and county councils and local authorities will run out of money much sooner than expected.  We must hear from the Government about what action it intends to take in this regard.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately there is much we can talk about but I do not have the time.  There is talk of reducing salaries paid to Members of the Oireachtas.  I have previously indicated to the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that he is cushioned from many of the effects that other people in the country will suffer.  He has a ministerial driver so he does not have to worry about benefit-in-kind or the cost of petrol.  He has a significant salary and would get an allowance for living arrangements if he lived outside Dublin.  If members of the Government do not want to see themselves as different from the rest of the country and the hardship the people will have to endure over the next number of years, these perks should also be taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the economy.  I further welcome the frequency with which we are engaging in debates of this nature.  We are seeking the knowledge and experience of eminent and qualified individuals such as Senator Ross who is an economist of some renown and a journalist and someone who has had a long career in business.  It is important that we obtain a diverse range of opinions on this matter.  Innovation and differences of opinion will be required if we are to discover optimum solutions to the challenges we face.  It is vital that there be differences of opinion because otherwise we will merely engage in an exercise of public administration, of which there has been far too much.  Innovation is what will be required as we face into the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
<Col N="361"/>
        <P>The Government operates in real time and does not have the benefit of hindsight.  No administration has ever enjoyed or ever will enjoy the latter.  Senator Twomey referred to Frank McDonald&rsquo;s book.  All I can say in reply is that if the points to which the Senator refers are contained in that book, they must be true.  However, I am not sure that this offers much, either in the context of the debate or solving the problems we face.  In recent months the Senator has been all too quick to carry out his post-match analysis of the past and how certain problems arose.  He has done precious little in the context of indicating what might now be done.</P>
        <P>I wish to analyse some of the suggestions made in recent times in order that people might know that Fine Gael does not have the benefit of 20-20 vision either.  In its most recent election manifesto, it predicted that there would be a growth rate of 4% and, like everyone else, on that basis proposed expenditure in a wide variety of areas.  Since the election, circumstances have changed and the Government has changed its mind.  Fine Gael has also changed its mind.  In fairness, Deputy Bruton has been reasonably consistent in seeking pay cuts.  However, the leader of Fine Gael recently indicated that he was seeking a pay freeze.  Last night Deputy Shatter appeared on television and informed us that in the past government had involved nothing other than failed predictions.  Fine Gael claims to have a monopoly of predicting everything accurately but that is not, in fact, the case.  Deputy Shatter is also seeking a pay freeze.  Fine Gael is indicating that there should be no decreases in pay and that all the problems should be solved.  However, it has not suggested any method, other than an increase in taxation, we might use to bring in the money required to allow us to solve our problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Twomey also referred to the property market and, again, displayed 20-20 vision.  I accept that certain individuals indicated that the property market was overcooked.  The Minister of State and I concur on the contention that a stopped clock is right twice a day.  There were those who said the market was being overcooked and that we should perhaps row back on urban and rural renewal schemes at a particular time.  However, we did not have, for example, absolute control of our monitoring policy in respect of interest rates.  During the period to which I refer interest rates in the eurozone were unprecedentedly low.  Those rates focus on inflation, not the Irish economy.  It is not, despite what Senator Twomey suggested, our responsibility to devalue the euro but that of the European Central Bank, ECB, of which the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, CBFSAI, is a small but intricate part.  If the Governor of the CBFSAI, Mr. John Hurley, were to telephone Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet at the ECB to ask him to devalue the euro, I do not know if he would be as cognisant of this if we had absolute control.  We do not have such control, particularly since this country is a member of the eurozone.</P>
        <P>In addition to the low interest rates to which I refer, there were unprecedented high levels of growth.  Everyone in the country, including Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; some of whom may own second, third or fourth properties, have various investments in equities, commodities, etc. &mdash; got on the gravy train and stated it was time to invest and create a little additional wealth for themselves because money was cheap.  One of the welcome developments as a result of the current doom and gloom is the realisation that cultural change is required.  It must be acknowledged that individuals in every walk of life were involved in overcooking the economy in the areas of property, equities and commodities.  However, it is ridiculous in the extreme and completely uninformed to suggest this was happening only in Ireland and nowhere else.</P>
        <P>I do not have a background or possess a qualification in economics.  However, I would like to believe I possess a modicum of common sense.  In that context, it is fair to acknowledge that there have been property booms-busts in Spain and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom and the United States in recent years.  Recently, the asset values of property, equities and commodities across the globe have been inflated.  During the past 12 months they have <Col N="362"/>decreased significantly.  However, this phenomenon is not unique to Ireland; it is global in nature.  No one knew this would happen.  I accept, however, that certain individuals, based on particular criteria, predicted aspects of what came to pass.  That is fine and they can claim credit for being correct on some of the issues some of the time.  However, it is ridiculous to suggest someone was entirely correct in predicting what happened.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State correctly stated, our situation has changed to a substantial degree.  There is a great deal less coming in than we had planned to invest.  It is simple mathematics: if one has only three bananas, one cannot give one each to four people.  If one has &euro;40 coming in and outgoings of &euro;54, one must make adjustments.  The Government will make such adjustments.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Fine Gael&rsquo;s accusation that the Government is dithering in this matter.  The social partnership process is envied by many countries which do not possess such a model.  It was one of the largest contributory factors to the stability and relative success enjoyed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the growth experienced in more recent times.  It is the platform that will &mdash; in conjunction with the policies over which we have control such as those relating to the public finances, pay, pensions, public service numbers, etc. &mdash; allow us to extricate ourselves from the difficulties we face.</P>
        <P>I wish the Government and the social partners well in their important work.  If ever there was a time for Ireland to make a statement on its international standing and credibility, it is now.  It is important that we make a statement of confidence and indicate that we are in control of our destiny to the greatest extent possible.  There could be no more powerful message than the social partners and the Government emerging either from Government Buildings or Dublin Castle and stating a deal has been reached and indicating how the required &euro;2 billion will be saved.  I do not want to prejudice the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, nor do I wish to suggest or demand any particular outcome.  However, success in those negotiations will send the strongest and best possible message that the country is in control of its own destiny, that it acknowledges the problems it faces and that it is prepared to take the appropriate actions.  I wish the social partners and the Government well and I am extremely hopeful with regard to the outcome of the talks.  It was stated last week that there would be posturing on the part of the various parties &mdash; the employers, on the one hand, and the trade unions, on the other &mdash; in respect of pay, etc.  I hope, however, that there were no absolute prerequisites once the negotiations began.  Whether it is innovations in respect of pay or adjustments to pension arrangements, I will welcome whatever deal is forthcoming.  I am glad the parties involved are prepared to negotiate.  I must pay tribute to the suggestions made by the trade unions.  The concept of a pensions levy is a good one and has merit.  In addition, the suggestion with regard to a recovery bond is innovative.  Such a bond could work and I hope the Government will give it consideration.</P>
        <P>In these more difficult times one of the greatest challenges we face is retaining as many in employment as possible.  In that context, I would prefer to ensure I had a job &mdash; be it for three days each week, if it were not possible to have it for five.  I ask those with an interest in this area to recognise that placing people on a three-day or two-day week is much better than making them redundant.  Last week I spoke to some involved in a manufacturing business in County Meath who had retained their entire staff on a week on-week off basis.  This solution is innovative, shows the commitment of the company to the staff involved and acknowledges the difficult times in which we now live.</P>
        <P>With regard to other actions the Government might take &mdash; not least in the context of the public finances &mdash; the State&rsquo;s bills should be paid.  Arms of the State and State agencies are the slowest payers of bills in business at present.  It is completely unacceptable.  The State does not <Col N="363"/>live up to the standards that legislation effectively dictates.  One example of that is tax rebates.  Many small businesses and individuals are waiting for tax rebates.  While they may have been due as far back as November in some cases, Revenue has told them it might get around to them in March.  A &euro;5,000 rebate to a business at present is worth &euro;100,000 in terms of what it could do.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey mentioned borrowing and what the State may need to borrow in future years.  It is worth noting that in 1985, debt service accounted for 35.2% while this year, the share of tax revenue taken up by Government debt service will be between 12% and 15% rising to 17% to 20% between now and, say, 2011.  We are in a completely different situation and we are facing into it from a position of relative strength compared with many years ago.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting the International Monetary Fund is forecasting that 2009 will be the first year of negative growth in advanced economies in the post-war era.  To suggest what this country is experiencing, whether in terms of the banking crisis, the property situation or the other difficulties, is unique to Ireland or as a result of specific actions by governments in this country alone is ridiculous in the extreme.</P>
        <P>Deputy Enda Kenny, leader of Fine Gael, said 20% of the problem in Ireland is as a result of international factors and 80% is as a result of our own actions.  I completely disagree with that, although we might have placed ourselves a little better if we had had the benefit of hindsight and of adjusting interest rates at a particular time to cool the property market.  What could we have done?  Could we have put stamp duty up to 50% or 100%?  If we had done so, there would have been a revolution in the country.  Some 80% of this problem is international while 20% is national.</P>
        <P>As we look to the future, key elements of the Government&rsquo;s plan include the stabilisation of public finances, improving competitiveness, which can be done potentially through pay, supporting those who become unemployed and supporting Irish business and multinational companies.  We must invest heavily in research and development and in incentivising multinational companies to locate more research and development aspects of their businesses in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As we plan for the future, I would like to see us introduce an aspect to the primary school syllabus which can help to extract and nurture the natural entrepreneurial flair among young people, and I will bring proposals to the Minister in this regard.  Today a lobby came to Leinster House seeking the vote for people of 16 years.  While that is a debate for another day, it is welcome and it shows the level of maturity among our young people.  We need to tap into that a bit more.</P>
        <P>Implementing a new green deal and moving us away from fossil fuel-based energy production through investment in renewables is an area we need to grow.  Some 10,000 people are employed in this area in Denmark, which is a good example.  It is part of the programme of the new US President, Barack Obama, as he sets out to deal with the crisis in the United States.  As he said, the world is facing an unprecedented economic crisis.</P>
        <P>We can control an aspect of our own destiny through the management of public finances.  This needs to be done quickly and it important to send a message nationally to our people and internationally to our contemporaries that it is done best through partnership.  It is important we maintain our capital budget to the greatest extent possible.  I am glad more than &euro;8.4 billion is scheduled to be spent in the year ahead.  I ask that this be kept under review and that we continually prioritise those capital projects which will best assist us in improving our competitiveness in the years ahead.  I look forward to future debates on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I reflect what has been said by the previous speakers.  It is important we are having this debate and that Members put what they have to say on the record.  I agree <Col N="364"/>with much of what Senator Marc MacSharry said.  However, in fairness to Fine Gael, I must say two things.  It is not fair to say Fine Gael forecast 4% growth this year.  It was very clear in its election manifesto that on the basis of 4% growth, it would do certain things.  It was very clear about that at all times.  Deputies Richard Bruton and Joan Burton have been extraordinarily responsible in their participation in the debate.  I believe strongly, and I say this in a disinterested fashion, that they should be included more closely in Government cogitation and discussion.</P>
        <P>This is the challenge for social partnership.  The Government should say let us agree on the problem, offer possible solutions and ask if the social partners can deliver, but that is not being done.  I was appalled that the plan, launched a couple of weeks ago in Dublin Castle, was not launched also in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Government has no problem dealing with the social partners but why exclude the politicians?  Was it not a great opportunity for the Government?  This is what is emerging as an indication of a lack of leadership.</P>
        <P>The Government is entitled to be a bit more confident.  I have the benefit of hindsight because I am a sad person and spent a couple of hours last week going through what our commentators said a year ago about the year just gone, and it made very interesting reading.  National Irish Bank was talking about another year of strong growth in 2008.  IIB&rsquo;s Austin Hughes talked about employment being broadly flat and said there might be a technical recession.  Dan McLaughlin of Bank of Ireland talked about 5% and 6% growth.  AIB&rsquo;s John Beggs talked about GDP growth recovering to over 4% in 2009 as well as being positive about 2008.  Jim Power, who lectures us regularly, said we should have a modest recovery later in 2008 and into 2009.</P>
        <P>Why do I say this?  It is a good opportunity to ignore these people.  They got it completely wrong so let us not be at their mercy.  It would a good time to introduce a new section 30 to prevent RTE interviewing too many economists from here on in.  They are misleading the public and are getting it wrong.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that issue.</P>
        <P>I refer to our friends in IBEC who get a huge amount of time.  Let me put something clearly on the record.  The main financial supporters of IBEC are the five or six large financial institutions.  I would like someone to ask IBEC every time its representatives open their mouths what it is doing about its members who caused this major problem for us.  They are welcomed as people who can solve our problem without any reference to the fact they caused it in the first place.  We should be very clear about that.  Bankers, IBEC and economists are not the people who should tell us what to do next.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say the people are losing confidence in the Government but it is unfair to say it has got it completely wrong.  The Government has not got it any more wrong than the governments of the US, the UK, Germany or France.  During the first debate we had on this issue four or five months ago, people said Germany got it right but clearly it did not and it is now in the same position as the rest of us.  As the Minister of State probably mentioned, we have a lower debt-gross national product ratio than any of the countries I mentioned.  It is impossible to estimate the debt-GNP ratio of the United States.  It is off the scale.  It is right to say we have 2 million people working and a better infrastructure than on the previous occasion we came through it.  We should examine these aspects.</P>
        <P>We should not talk down the economy.  My only disappointment in the Minister of State is that he talked himself out of a job recently on a radio programme.  I cringed when I heard that.  The Minister of State is a busy, active, articulate and effective Minister of State &mdash; he can add that to his curriculum vitae &mdash; and it ill-behoves him to say on a radio programme that we do not need him.  It is not the case that we must sack people to give some kind of fodder to the <Col N="365"/>media in terms of politicians&rsquo; expenses and the numbers of Ministers of State.  If the Minister wants to examine the position of Ministers of State he should give me their diaries for the past six months and I will tell him who needs to go.  That can be done quickly and easily in terms of their productivity.  I have done it all my life in other jobs; I can do it in this one as well.  If people are delivering, they are delivering and we should not posture about it.</P>
        <P>Public sector unions are closer to the position on the ground.  What should we do with the public sector unions?  In terms of whether there will be a deal, of course there will be a deal because those people are committed to nothing else except the public service.  They want this country to work.  They are not in it for the profit.  They want to make it work.  They also want to protect their members.</P>
        <P>We should not do this piecemeal.  We should not leave people in a situation where they are dealing with a 1% levy and where they might also have to deal with an extra pension payment, although I accept the ICTU&rsquo;s point in terms of what we should do, and a pay cut.  That will demoralise people.  We should examine the figures.  If &euro;1.8 billion or &euro;2 billion is needed this year, the public sector unions should be asked if they can deliver on that and how they can do it.  They should be asked to give it back to us.  They should not give us a solution with wage cuts and expect people to buy into that publicly.</P>
        <P>I believe in the recovery bond.  I have been saying that for a number of months.  I discussed it with my colleagues in the ICTU.  If every public sector union was given the option of buying into a recovery bond, which would ensure our Government got money cheaper than we could borrow it from Germany or elsewhere, either at 0% or 1% interest or an interest rate related to gross domestic product and with no exit before five years, we would then get people involved who could afford it.  There is no difference between public sector and private sector workers in terms of making ends meet.</P>
        <P>Last May people were struggling with income in terms of paying their mortgages.  The drop in interest rates has brought them back into the game, so to speak.  If we cut their salary, whether they are in the public or private sector, they will now be back in the same position again.  Salary cuts are not the issue.</P>
        <P>I would go around this country as a union leader selling the idea of a recovery bond.  It was done previously.  Michael Collins did it in 1922.  We should collect the money from the people for the people.  It would be an investment in the country.  We should show some leadership.  The Minister should give us an objective and a target and let us deliver.  We can do that.  That is as much as I can add at this stage but we should give this issue to the people who we need to bring about a solution and let us make this work together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing his time with me.  The idea of a recovery bond, which has just been mentioned, is an imaginative one.  That is the way we should be thinking but the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, and that of Senator MacSharry, was somewhat calm, lacking in urgency and, to a great extent, too complacent.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should read the article on bonds in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i>.  I am not talking about British Paddy bashing, which has been going on recently.  I am looking at the spreads on ten year government bonds.  Out of 21 countries, Ireland is 20th.  It is just cheaper for Ireland to borrow than Greece, and that gap has been closing rapidly in recent days.  That tells us that the international money markets have lost confidence in Ireland Inc. and in the Irish Government.  The people who make these markets do not have some sort of prejudice against this country.  These are people who make cold, forensic judgments about what is going on in this country and whether they should lend it money.  They are saying specifically, and they are saying it much more so in the past three days, that Ireland is at risk and is a big risk. <Col N="366"/> I do not know whether it has overtaken Greece today but to be honest about it, Greece is not the sort of company we want to be keeping.  In terms of the others, which are known as the PIGS countries, as the Minister of State will be aware &mdash; Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain &mdash; we are far higher in terms of borrowing than those, bar Greece.  The international markets have made a judgment on us which is damning.  The signal coming out from there, and I say this as one who has supported Government finance policy for many years, is that the Government here is not capable and is not going to produce measures which are adequate to satisfy the markets.</P>
        <P>It was the Irish Commissioner, a former Minister for Finance, who said in the Merrion Hotel some weeks ago that we had better realise that we cannot keep ratcheting up the national debt by &euro;2 billion, &euro;10 billion or whatever because there may be no one who will lend to us.  That is the problem we are facing today, and the lack of urgency in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech is part of that problem.</P>
        <P>I was shattered to hear the Taoiseach say this morning that he may be able to further postpone a deal.  I do not know what sort of a financial world the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach are living in because every day this happens, the cost of borrowing goes up.  The Minister of State can examine the figures.  It has happened in the past week.  Every day there is a delay, it will cost millions of euro more in interest payments and in the cost of borrowing to the taxpayer.  We will be making false economies if we just keep talking and pretend it will go right because the cost of borrowing is increasing.</P>
        <P>There is no confidence in the international markets about what is happening in Ireland.  There is a great deal of disappointment.  I share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s view, but even more so those from the Fine Gael benches because I have been saying it for years about the extraordinary way the Government goes to the social partners before it comes to this House.  This House has never been consulted on any pay deal.  I do not know why people are suddenly becoming converted to this now in a time of crisis.  This House has been ignored, as has the D&aacute;il, while the important decisions on the economy have been made elsewhere.  The reality is that the Minister of State cannot tell us anything about anything in his speech except that the Government is monitoring this and discussing that.  He used those words frequently.  He is discussing it while the place is going up in flames.  It is long past time for decisions.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to IBEC, and I agree with every word he said, but IBEC does not matter.  It is a convenient foil for the unions to engage in a little bit of drama to rally the troops, and everyone needs that in this sort of situation.  IBEC does not care two hoots what people say.  Everyone knows that.  It has got nothing to fight with.  The people who matter are the public service unions.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt a deal will be done by the public service unions but the danger is that it is dictated by the public service unions and not by the Government.  We only have to look back to the last deal in the autumn &mdash; I have forgotten the month &mdash; which is now about to be scrapped because the Government capitulated and gave them what they wanted.  They are now so embarrassed by what they got they are now saying they will give back something to the Government in the national interest.</P>
        <P>Social partnership may or may not have served us well.  I do not want to go back over that argument.  It is a fairly stupid one and it cannot be proved either way.  We know, however, that it did not save us from the circumstances in which we find ourselves and we are making the same mistake again.  I hope the Minister and others do not appear in Dublin Castle in two weeks to tell the world, as they did a few months ago, what a great triumph they have achieved. <Col N="367"/> This is not the way the finances of the country should be run and it does not fool the international markets.</P>
        <P>In terms of other cuts in public expenditure, I plead that a hatchet be ruthlessly taken to State and semi-State agencies.  The waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money in these bodies which I could spell out if I had time is criminal.  It would be utterly wrong to deprive education, health and other areas of vital importance when such unforgivable waste is permitted in semi-State bodies.  It is there for the taking if there was the political will to do it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>What do we need to point the economy in the right direction when every economic indicator is heading in the wrong direction and it may not be possible to arrest the problem for a considerable period?  We need a Government which is honest with the people about the scale of the problems we face and the decisions required to overcome them.  We need an Opposition which takes a responsible approach to the most serious economic crisis in the history of the State and avoids the temptation to engage in naked political point scoring, one which suggests procedures and processes conducive to achieving the necessary recovery.  We need media which take a rounded approach to reporting the sad, economic story.  Notwithstanding the current economic indicators, a constant diet of doom and gloom becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy which precludes economic recovery in the short term.  We need to encourage citizens to use their full potential as economic actors, which requires them to be productive in producing, purchasing and consuming goods and services.</P>
        <P>The ingredient most lacking in the economy since the end of the Celtic tiger period, however real or otherwise that era was, is confidence.  This confidence is required on a number of levels.  Yesterday a prominent director of a major financial institution expressed to me his concern that the lack of confidence in Irish financial services arose from a belief there had been a level of corruption in that sector.  As a result, Ireland is not regarded as a good country with which to do business.  We need to sort out this problem.</P>
        <P>I suggest the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on financial services with powers similar to those enjoyed by the Committee of Public Accounts would be a first step towards achieving public and international confidence in our financial services sector.  Such a committee could investigate the practices followed in the financial services sector and, in bringing them to the surface, help to eliminate them.  The introduction of the bank guarantee scheme and nationalisation of one of our major financial institutions make the Oireachtas the custodian of these institutions and their future behaviour.  If we fail to take this action, we will entrench the bad behaviour which has brought about the current problem.  As Senator Ross noted, international confidence is an important factor.  The absence of confidence is creating a poor perception among members of the public.  It is important, therefore, that we also generate confidence among citizens as economic actors.  It will be difficult to reverse the current problems for as long as the belief persists we are in a downward economic spiral.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Ross that we need to avoid a sense of complacency.  The State has entered the most difficult economic period in its history.  This requires a degree of national cohesion which is not usually sought in political discourse but which will be necessary if the economy is to regain the international respect and trust it enjoyed just a few short months ago.  Decisions are being made and further decisions will be reached in the coming days to reflect the immediate need to curb public expenditure by &euro;2 billion.  It is clear a mechanism must be found to cut at least half of this sum from the public sector pay bill.</P>
        <P>Public service pay which is necessary to run essential public services costs every man, woman and child &euro;5,000 per annum.  If people believe this is sustainable, given current revenue from taxation and the level of public expenditure committed and agreed to by the Houses, they do not have a grasp of basic economics.  The expenditure and revenue sides of the equation must <Col N="368"/>add up.  While it may be uncomfortable for many Members, we have a responsibility to ensure cuts in the cost of running the political system are greater than those we ask other public services to accept as part of an overall package of expenditure reductions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This period of national crisis should be a time of solidarity.  If there is a perception that the Government and members of the political system wish to avoid reducing the overblown and burgeoning costs of the political system while seeking to impose swingeing cuts on many of those who are least capable of sustaining reductions in services, we will have failed as public representatives.  I am confident, however, that the package which will emerge in the coming days will bring about a realisation of the seriousness of the position in which we find ourselves and the nature of the decisions we must take.  While this package will emerge from consultations with the social partners, the decision making function remains with the Government, in the first instance, and, ultimately, the Houses of the Oireachtas.  While we need solidarity and social partnership, the political system must take responsibility on behalf of the people.  If we do not do so, we will delay the inevitable, make matters worse and render our objective more difficult to achieve.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by repeating a comment I made on the Order of the Business when I described as a spectacle the scenario that this House has been invited to have a debate on the economy, one which has been correctly facilitated by the Minister and the Leader, in circumstances in which the presentation made to us by the Government, through the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh &mdash; I do not criticise him personally &mdash; is almost completely devoid of detail in respect of the Government&rsquo;s proposals to take us out of the crisis described by Senator Boyle.  At precisely the same time as the Minister of State is appearing before the House, a document, described in the media as a framework document, is apparently being presented to the social partners and one is asked to believe it contains specific proposals as to how we are to proceed.  It is a spectacle and it is wrong, notwithstanding that Senator Boyle said decisions will be made by Government and these Houses and it is just a matter of consultation.</P>
        <P>I enthusiastically support social partnership, but what is the problem with the Government sharing with the public and these Houses the bones of its proposals on where we are at?  Why, day in and day out, must we pick up the newspapers, read informed and less informed, inspired and less inspired speculation on what will occur?  Pay freezes, pay cuts, tax increases, public expenditure cuts are all mentioned.  I ask the Minister of State to deal with this matter directly in his response.</P>
        <P>It seems to me that kites are flown for a day or two to see how far they travel and are then drawn in by Government when they do not achieve a particular outcome it hoped for.  That is no way to conduct this debate.  I doubt if any democracy in the world would conduct a debate about a crisis such as this in that manner.  What is the problem with the Government setting out its proposals and strategy to these Houses?  It clearly has not been done.  Why has it not been done?  Why can it not be done?  I understand the process of negotiation and the requirement for people to be circumspect on particular numbers, whether it concerns pay increases, reductions or freezes and so on.  We are dealing with more than issues concerning pay.  We are dealing with the broader sweep of the economic crisis we are facing.  Senator Boyle correctly described it as a crisis.</P>
        <P>To put it mildly, it is not good enough that we are treated to something that is not really a debate.  Out of deference to these Houses, I will not describe it as a farce, but that is what amounts to, particularly in circumstances where the real action is taking place somewhere else down town.  Somebody needs to explain that situation to the people we represent in these Houses.  I agree entirely and enthusiastically with what I understood Senator Boyle proposed, <Col N="369"/>namely a committee of these Houses to examine and report on the banking crisis and the financial situation that has arisen as a consequence of the collapses of recent months.  Some examples are the Government nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the various other steps taken on recapitalisation and the bank guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>Ministers and the Government often decry Opposition Members and journalists who want to talk about how we got here.  I can understand Ministers not wanting to talk about it.  That is a perfectly human response on their part, because if we are to have a debate on how we got here they will not come out of it particularly well.  The Minister of State and I had an exchange here on another occasion when I reminded him and colleagues of remarks by the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, that when he had money he spent it and when he did not have it, it could not be spent.  In fairness to the Minister of State, in his response to me he expressed the same level of unhappiness with that type of sentiment as I expressed.  In the opening remarks of his speech, he talks about the words of the psalm.  He uses the word &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;, the least useful word in the sentence.  He said,  &ldquo;In the days of our prosperity, perhaps we should have heeded the words of the psalm.&rdquo;  It is manifest that in the days our prosperity we should have heeded the words of the psalmist.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry may say that hindsight is all very well and we did not realise these things at the time.  There were plenty of people making these points and talking about the overheating of the housing and construction markets.  A person with a good reputation, Dr. Peter Bacon, was recruited by the Government to examine this issue.  He brought out a report in 2000 which made a number of proposals which, as I recall, were calculated to take the heat out the madness of growth in the housing sector.  It was a mirage rather than real growth, based on productive activity.  Dr. Bacon suggested, among other things, the introduction of a 2% or 3% property tax, which would not have to be paid if a speculator signed up to various standards in accommodation and so on.  He also sought major reform of stamp duty, with staggered rates, depending on whether the purchaser was a first time buyer.  Changes were made later, but these recommendations were made in 2000.  Bacon is an expert economic consultant who was retained by the Government, not a solo operator writing op-ed pieces in a newspaper.  He made it very clear at the time that property prices would continue to go through the roof and if the situation was not brought under control it would cause huge difficulties down the road, which is precisely what occurred.  People cannot say, &ldquo;This is all a big surprise, we could never have known.&rdquo;  Likewise, the Minister of State cannot seek to persuade us that what occurred is like a natural disaster.</P>
        <P>I hope to raise this issue again in the House.  Senator Boyle made a proposal to establish a dedicated committee of these Houses to consider the banking crisis.  I would have thought that the Minister of State, as a historian, would agree with the general proposition that it is very difficult for the Government, the Houses of the Oireachtas or the community to buy into &mdash; a phrase which I hate &mdash; have confidence in and be party to difficult proposals on cutbacks to services, pay cuts or anything else unless there is an honest assessment made of how we have reached the stage we are at now.  It is not good enough for the Government to give the impression that once proposals have been put through the social partnership process, there will suddenly be a set of proposals to solve everything.  I am not suggesting the Government thinks it will be that easy &mdash; because clearly it will not &mdash; but it would be vastly easier for the country if people were spoken to honestly and frankly on how we reached the current situation.</P>
        <P>The nature of political debate and discourse in this country on issues such as taxation has been, in my opinion, almost poisoned in recent years by a mad rush to encourage people to see that wealth, the future of their families and future well-being reposed in property, whether it was a first, second or third property.  There was no serious debate.  Allied to that was the complete failure, across the board, to have an adult debate on the relationship between taxation <Col N="370"/>and public services.  We have not had such a debate in this country for 20 years or more.  People have become petrified by the notion that if one talks about the need for a broader tax base, one is a tax-and-spend merchant coming in from stage left, and all one wants to do is raise taxation and spend people&rsquo;s money.  Glib dismissals of those kinds of issues have made it difficult for us to have an intelligent adult debate on taxation.</P>
        <P>I heard a Government colleague criticise Senator Twomey, saying that the Opposition&rsquo;s only solution was to raise taxes.  I  remind the Minister of State and my colleagues opposite that this Government raised taxes dramatically in the recent budget.  Let nobody say that the income levy is not a tax.  Does anybody believe that levy will be a temporary provision and will not be continued, perhaps being integrated into the tax code itself?  We all know the levy is there for good.  We also know that it is only a matter of time before taxes will be raised.  The tragedy is that taxes are being raised when the Government has its back to the ropes and must levy moneys to provide services to which it is committed, rather than having had a more serious debate over the past ten years about the proper level of taxation consistent with the required level of public services.  It is almost an emergency situation.  Meanwhile, we have pushed many public services into the private sector, most spectacularly in the health service.  In child care and other areas we have been content to say that people ought largely to provide for themselves rather than having a robust State system to do so.  While it may be for the wrong reasons, there is a genuine opportunity now to debate in this House, in the community, in the course of elections and in the media the level of public services we want.  In that way we can match it to the necessary level of taxation.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Taxation is due to report in the summer.  Its work is complex and there is much pressure at the moment because there is a major crisis.  Various options must be up for debate, both here and among the general public.  Can some consideration be given to bringing forward that commission&rsquo;s report, or to having an interim report to assist our debate on tax?  The commission was given a reasonably lengthy timeframe because of the complexity of its work, but it is a pity that it is impossible for us to have a truly comprehensive debate on all these economic issues because the tax issue is being put off until the summer when the commission reports.  We should not go off on our holidays and table it for debate when we come back in September or October.  I understand there are complex issues and that it is easier said than done to bring forward such a report.  However, in our particular circumstances, and in view of the peculiarly important role of taxation in the context of the economic crisis and the kind of public services we aspire to have in future, it would be useful if that report were available for deliberation.  Is it possible to have an interim report from the commission, which might guide the debate on that crucial issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday we saw an example of the difficulties in the economy.  Ulster Bank and First Active announced they were merging and seeking voluntary redundancies.  Of the 7,000 employees on the island of Ireland they are seeking 750 redundancies &mdash; 200 in the North and 550 in the Republic.  Branches will close or merge and the trading name of First Active will cease to exist.  This is a classic example because these banks are owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland.  RBS recently purchased ABN Amro which in turn purchased &euro;20 billion worth of sub-prime mortgages.  That is how the global economy is affecting Ireland severely.  We are major traders and have one of the most open economies in the world.  When there is a global downturn it will inevitably affect the Irish economy quite seriously.  We trade 35% of all our exports between the US and the UK.  In the last few years the euro has significantly appreciated against both sterling and the US dollar.</P>
<Col N="371"/>
        <P>Despite the perfect storm this Government has found itself in, with hugely decreased income in a short time, it has reacted properly and with a measure of confidence.  The Government has not attempted to cut back and create a difficulty.  In other words, the last thing the Government wishes to do is turn off the light at the end of the tunnel.  In fact, it has decided to spread over a number of years the decreases in expenditure that will be necessary.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Government is examining all areas of public expenditure to identify where some of the &euro;2 billion can be saved.  One of the major areas of expenditure is public pay.  I believe the public service will play its part and we will find savings of &euro;2 billion.  How can we get the confidence of world markets in such a short space of time?  We have that confidence.  Fitch&rsquo;s, one of the rating agencies, recently reinstated the triple A status of Ireland incorporated.  We are a good group to lend money to.  In ensuring that we continue to have some capital expenditure and that we do not just cut and slash, we are ensuring our future productivity and our future generally.  We have had a budget deficit in only one of the past 12 years.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we tend to forget that there will be a turn.  We might look inward rather than outward and say that the world economy and our own will pick up.  There are a number of positive signs already.  We are now looking at interest rates that are historically low.  In the UK the rate has not been as low since the Bank of England was established in the 1600s.  The ECB rate is currently at 2% and could fall lower to 1.5% or 1%.  In America, money is probably not even earning the return on inflation.  Those facts, coupled with low oil prices and lower expectations, mean that we have deflation in some countries.  Ireland has deflation of minus 2%.  It is a good time to commend the Government because in the most difficult, most severe and swiftest downturn it gave a 3% increase across the board in social welfare payments for those who can least afford to meet the challenges.  The same people are now seeing a real increase of 5% in their net incomes, due to 2% deflation.  That is not to suggest that we do not have severe challenges ahead.  Those challenges are being met and will continue to be met.  The Government put us in a position to be able to meet those challenges because we have a low tax rate.  We have one of the lowest tax rates in Europe, which gives us a particular edge in increasing taxation if needs be.  We have a very low debt and, as a percentage of general government debt, we have the lowest in Europe.  It is half the EU average when local government and other subsidiary debt are taken into account.  We also put in place the National Pension Reserve Fund and, therefore, we are well positioned.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank him for his brief outline.  It is unfortunate that the relevant document is, as Senator Alex White stated &ldquo; in circulation among other people down town&rdquo;, particularly the social partners.  As I stated on the Order of Business, we are supportive of the social partnership process and we would like progress to be made but this is one of two Houses of Parliament and, as Senator Ross said, it is strange that in our democracy we are being denied the document, which might list options and lead to a more structured and better informed debate.  All of us want the country to succeed and we are playing for the same team &mdash; Ireland.  We all have a vested interest in its success.  Everybody on this side of the House is as patriotic about their intentions to succeed as any Government Member.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State said, we are in difficulty on all fronts &mdash; budgetary, banking and economic.  I also acknowledge that a negative impact is being felt worldwide.  The Minister of State referred to the difficulty we are facing with competitiveness issues, particularly exports to sterling areas.  We must struggle with this until it comes right.  Why not consult everyone in order that they are on the same team working for this great country, which we want to succeed?</P>
        <P>We have experienced a significantly sharp contraction in the housing market.  Construction was important to our economy in the recent past and it helped to create the so-called Celtic tiger.  However, house prices have reduced by between 20% and 35% depending on the part of the country in which one lives.  Significant tax revenue is tied up in unsold houses.  The average price of a house is approximately &euro;250,000, 40% of which could be realised in tax if it was sold.  There are small signs of momentum in house sales as a result of low interest rates.  Why scare people from investing by imposing an additional tax of &euro;400 per house?  A tax of &euro;200 was imposed on second homes in the budget and the energy rating certificate requirement for new houses is a stealth tax of between &euro;300 and &euro;600 depending on who carries out the survey.  Landlords were caught by the income levy imposed in the budget while management companies running apartment blocks charge up to &euro;2,000 per annum.  The Government should not kill off the prospect of the housing market getting off the ground again.  That is very important.  We all know small builders and hard working tradesmen, as opposed to massive speculators, who have between three and six houses they cannot sell.  Their future and those of the few employees they have retained is uncertain.  It is difficult for them on a daily basis and I would do anything to enable them to sell their houses because that would be good <Col N="373"/>for the economy as well as them.  I would hate to see us go down the road of additional property taxation.</P>
        <P>This is why all the options must be discussed.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, we have had solidity from Deputies Bruton and Burton but more openness and consultation are needed.  I agree with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s proposal for a dedicated all-party committee.  That could be very beneficial because these are nervous times for our economy, particularly the banking sector, and we are trying to eke our way out of them.  Fine Gael accepted the principle underpinning the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank but we were upset about the way the debate was guillotined in both Houses because we were denied the opportunity to give matters we wished to air the detailed consideration they needed.  However, we have moved on and that measure has been taken.</P>
        <P>I refer to the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  These banks have significant networks throughout the State and our economy cannot work without them.  Their recapitalisation is vital.  We cannot afford delay, which is the enemy of progress.  The delay will adversely impact on investor confidence.  There have been small but encouraging signs in the movement of the prices of both, particularly today.  The talks with the two banks should be progressed urgently and brought to fruition.  The longer they drag on the longer we will have an absence of confidence.  Confidence is the intangible that is so important.  Without it we are going nowhere.  The acceptance in the investment community and the wider economy that the recapitalisation of the banks has been a success will be vital in getting off the ground.</P>
        <P>There is responsible opposition on all these matters.  There has been great waste in State and semi-Stage agencies.  I had wanted to deal with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Coghlan has set the tone for me regarding people with second houses.  The construction sector has gone extremely flat and the Senator is right in pointing to the surplus of houses.  One in two is owned by someone who bought it towards a pension or for the use of his or her children going to college in Dublin, Limerick or Galway.  Such persons now find themselves in a position of negative equity.  We do not need to put pressure on them.</P>
        <P>Economic forecasting has been near impossible in recent months.  The International Monetary Fund has looked at every economy and revised its projections of economic growth on a number of occasions.  Even though it is one of the better bodies at forecasting, it has not got it right.  The Government has taken action as difficulties have emerged.  The Taoiseach has made it very clear that there is an immediate and intensive round of discussions with the social partners, with which it is very important to consult.  As the social partners have been extremely good in ensuring we have had a stable economy for the past 12 or 13 years, why would we not hold discussions with them when we find ourselves in some difficulty, as is the case now?  It will not be a problem if it takes an extra few days to get agreement on savings of &euro;15 billion in the next five years.  People have not listened carefully to what the Taoiseach has said.  There is a plan.  We need to ensure we meet the target of &euro;15 billion in the next five years.</P>
<Col N="374"/>
        <P>The spreads on borrowing have widened in virtually every country.  It is more difficult to raise money on world markets because of a major extension of borrowing, not just in Ireland but across the globe.  Decisions in countries such the United Kingdom which I would regard as knee-jerk reactions have not ensured their banking sectors are any safer than ours.  Our approach to dealing with the sector has been responsible.  We have not cost the taxpayer one penny.  We bought Anglo Irish Bank at a very modest price &mdash; if we need to pay anything for it.  The people would expect us to take a cautious approach to the banking crisis.  We must investigate the disgraceful behaviour of former directors of Anglo Irish Bank.  I agree with Senator Boyle on the need for a proper inquiry into what happened at that bank.</P>
        <P>We are going to have a difficult time in the next five years.  We need to support the Government in its efforts to bring spending under control.  If we do not do so, it will cost us dearly.  It is important not to be doom and gloom merchants.  We can exaggerate our difficulties.  Mortgage and bank interest rates have reduced considerably in recent months, which is very good news.  Petrol and diesel prices have reduced.  Houses are becoming more affordable for young people.  There is a competitive market for clothing and footwear.  We will benefit from this readjustment in the economy.  A competitive market for consumer products is improving.  There is no point in increasing wage rates when inflation rates have stabilised.  Even if we stand still for the next year we will be in good stead because prices have stabilised.</P>
        <P>I have made a proposal to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party in respect of a &euro;9 billion retrofit of housing which could create up to 25,000 new jobs &mdash; three times the number of jobs associated with Dell.  Inspections with regard to the new building energy rating, introduced on 1 January, will result in the creation of at least 1,300 jobs.  The Government will put substantial money behind that job creation project in the budget.  There are more than 1 million houses which need to have their insulation upgraded.  Through attic insulation, cavity wall filling and air tightness, for approximately &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 the energy rating of a house could be raised to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; standard.  This, in turn, would result in a payback to the householder who would benefit by a 50% reduction in energy consumption.  We would also meet our EU commitments in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> reductions.  Such a job creation project would do more than taking 100,000 cars off the road.  We must reduce our dependency on fossil fuels through the provision of grants or tax incentives.  The use of solar energy and wood pellet burning would benefit the economy greatly and help to ensure we meet our EU commitments in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> reductions.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the House.  I did not think the bail out of Anglo Irish Bank was free.  Perhaps the Minister will give us the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the bad debts in Anglo Irish Bank.  Perhaps Senator Butler can let the Irish people know what they are paying to bail out the bank and the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The bailout was not free &mdash; the Irish taxpayer will pay for it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is a genuine, decent person and I supported his call last week.  I admired his bravery in saying that he would not mind being fired.  Senator Hanafin blamed Fine Gael for being unsupportive of the Government.  Let us put the record straight.  We were the first to raise the flag about benchmarking and public spending.  What do we get from the Government?  The <i>laissez-faire</i> approach, being all things to all people.  Let us call a spade a spade.  The scale of the economic crisis is due to bad Government planning, bad policy and the legacy of bad leadership over the past ten years.  The Irish people were sold a pup by Fianna F&aacute;il, in particular in 2002 and 2007.  We built our economy on a false boom.</P>
        <P>This party has never been found wanting on the economy, the North or any other issue.  Fine Gael has always been supportive and has always put the country first.  An example is the capitalisation programme at the end of September and October.  I resent any cheap shots and <Col N="375"/>I will challenge them.  I will take on the Senators opposite.  The reality is that we have had no plan from the Government.  Last summer, the Minister for Finance ordered a sort of mini budget.  There was pandemonium during the summer holidays.  The Cabinet decided to bring the budget forward to 14 October.  They forgot about the consequences of declining tax returns and that the budgetary process was not ready.  The budget was a botched job.</P>
        <P>Let us put the record straight.  The Government has not demonstrated leadership.  Where is the plan?  What have the social partners been told today?  I am an unashamed fan of social partnership and I admire what has been done in that respect.  No detail has been given to Members of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>The people have lost confidence, not just in the Government but in each other.  Walking through the streets of Cork at the weekend, one could drive a bus through some of the shops and restaurants in town.  These small businesses are struggling; they are not multinationals.  They are struggling to survive because banks will not lend, liquidity is being taken from them and there is no support from Government.  This has dragged on for ages.  We are in a vacuum yet again.  Tax revenues have plummeted.  This Government reminds me of the Tories in England in the 1980s.  It is going from crisis to crisis, bereft of ideas and lacking in leadership.  </P>
        <P>The Fine Gael general election manifesto was referred to and I want to clarify that Fine Gael produced this on the basis of 4% growth.  Long before the Government, the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, Deputy Richard Bruton, published a document entitled Recovery through Reform.  We identified areas and proposed solutions.  It is important that we allow cash to flow to small and medium-sized enterprises, that money is lent and that banks allow small enterprises to continue.</P>
        <P>As a public servant in my previous incarnation as a teacher, I want to defend the public servants.  They have been wrongly maligned by many commentators in the media.  The majority of public servants do an extraordinarily good job and are committed to the delivery of service.  I praise our education establishments and pay tribute to our teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;.  They do a job and are entitled to be treated with respect.  Mr. Turlough O&rsquo;Sullivan and some other commentators should get off their backs.  There is a political malaise where we blame the public service for everything.  Many politicians do so as well and it is not fair.</P>
        <P>We need the articulation of a plan.  We need a blueprint on how to move forward.  Judging by the behaviour of the Taoiseach in the other House today, he is not interested in collegiality or consensus.  How long can we prolong the drip-drip effect of Ministers talking about cuts in pension provision, cuts in salaries and cuts in services?  How long can this continue?  One cannot postpone the decision-making process forever.  We have been at this since the middle of May.  Change is necessary.</P>
        <P>The Government should stop blaming the Opposition, Joe Duffy, the people on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; and public servants.  The Government should blame those who got us into this.  We should regulate the banks properly once and for all.  The people of Ireland require action, not an <i>urbi <Col N="376"/>et orbi</i> state of the nation address.  If that is all the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party could come up with after five hours yesterday, God help us.</P>

Anyone who wants to be invigorated and encouraged at this difficult time should participate in a good, heavy, five-hour debate with the leader of the country, his ministerial team and the broadest spectrum of individuals who took part in that debate.  Senator Buttimer and others would learn a lot from it.</P>

	<P>Our country is battling the most severe global storm experienced in decades.  The Irish economy has hit a turbulent patch and this is totally different from any downturn we experienced in the past.  Some of my colleagues have stated that we have been through this before and that we will get through it again.  As Richard Nixon says, it is only when one reaches the dizzy heights that one appreciates the lowest valley.  We are battling this storm coming from the dizzy heights of a booming economy to a serious crash in the economy with deteriorating conditions elsewhere in the global economy along with exchange rate movements which have been most unhelpful.  The international markets and financial institutions play a pivotal role in our economy.</P>
        <P>The housing market has slowed down to a near standstill and has adjusted other sectors of industry.  This is especially noticeable in the retail areas of bedding, furniture, flooring and soft furnishings.  Consumer spending has been curtailed and a broad spectrum of businesses are experiencing difficulties, the car sales sector, for example.  Other sectors that feed into our economy are feeling the pinch and there is thus a visible decline in activity with reduced spending across the board which has triggered other difficulties such as unemployment and uncertainty.</P>
        <P>Many of the factors weighing down economic developments will continue throughout 2009 and into 2010.  International forecasting agencies are projecting that the global economy will record negative growth which does not bode well for a small country like Ireland which depends on its exports.  However, there is a view that the markets will pick up in 2010 and there will be some modest growth in 2010.</P>
        <P>Many of our difficulties are related to the manner in which our financial institutions carry out their business.  I have raised this issue with the highest authority and have been assured the banks have assured the authorities they are open for business.  That may be so but I suggest that the banks&rsquo; approach to business should be closely monitored.  Are the banks operating in a pragmatic and realistic manner given the current climate?  I pose the question and I understand that the banks are causing serious and grave difficulties that warrant special focus in light of the fact that they are receiving support to recapitalise.</P>
        <P>I refer to the opening remarks of the Minister of State.  Our requirement for the banking sector is that it will serve borrowers, small and medium-size enterprises and all stakeholders in an honest and straightforward way and ensure customers and consumers are treated in a reputable and respectable manner.  I wholeheartedly support the Minister of State in that regard. <Col N="377"/> We should neither underestimate our challenges nor overstate our difficulties.  It is important to have a positive attitude to our future and the opportunities that may present.</P>
        <P>Last week, we witnessed what many believed would never happen, namely, the inauguration of the new President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.  This is a president who has already raised the bar on many issues and who has brought hope and confidence for the future.  It is no exaggeration to assert we are at a point in our history where we have never been able to see more clearly what we can achieve.  The Irish &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude has characterised our success before and it is all the more necessary now.</P>
        <P>We have the basic ingredients of a good infrastructure, excellent educational and research and development facilities, diverse markets, established trade links, an entrepreneurial and determined population and much more.  We know the resources exist and we can get them working, especially with the correct incentives and investment policies.</P>
        <P>The Government has a wealth of ability, knowledge and experience and it is eager to get down to the task of getting us moving again along the road we successfully travelled in the past.  I wish all the parties in the social partnership well in their endeavours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The deterioration in revenue and the increase in expenditure has brought us to a position where our national debt in 2007 was &euro;37 billion.  An additional &euro;18 billion in 2008 has brought the debt just shy of &euro;50 billion.  We are borrowing &euro;50 million a day as our basic daily requirement.  I support the focus on restoring stability to our public finances and the rebooting of our financial institutions to meet customer needs, as outlined by the Minister of State, especially with regard to finance and credit requirements, and the commencement of the process of restoring confidence and competitiveness.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We need a framework to include all stakeholders which will be even and fair for economic recovery.  We need to initiate a range of pro-enterprise tax measures to stimulate activity and employment opportunities.  We need to reduce administrative burdens and regulation on business.  We need to create favourable opportunities for enterprise development through the generation of renewable energy resources, green enterprise and the smart economy.  We need to ensure wage moderation and flexibility consistent with a competitive position.  I refer in particular to the need to address the minimum wage and other cost factors such as regulation adherence costs.  I meet people who are active in the marketplace and are trying to adhere to the regulations in place in the Republic while they cannot compete with the Six Counties.  This situation must be addressed or else we will continue to see what has happened in Dell and in other places.  We must get real and be pragmatic.</P>
        <P>I support the stimulation of the economy by pumping billions of euro into the capital investment programmes, the multi-million investment in motorways, the roll-out of broadband, the investment in the commercial sea ports, and the upgrading of water services, school buildings and health facilities and social housing.  A total of &euro;20 billion will be invested over a period of years in ESB, EirGrid and Bord G&aacute;is network upgrades.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the Taoiseach speaking on the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il today.  I could not believe the arrogance he displayed at a time when he is asking for the co-operation of the Opposition and all sides on the economy.  The best he could come up was to ask the Opposition to state their ideas.  We have been giving him our ideas for the past six or seven years and more and not one of them has been listened to.  The positive ideas given over the past six or seven  years by our leader and our spokesperson on finance have been ridiculed.  When we warned of a property bust after the boom, we were laughed at and told we were being negative instead of being positive.  It is all very well to be positive when one has a reason to be with an economy built on solid foundations.  When it was built on the foundations <Col N="378"/>such as those in Ireland over the past several years, however, there was no reason to be positive.  The chickens now have come home to roost.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely spoke of a global storm.  Continuing with the nautical theme, Ireland has no captain, first mate or leadership.  It is a rudderless ship of state.  Senator Callely told us not to talk about our difficulties but to be positive.  This denial, as shown by the Minister for Finance on BBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; recently, is what got us into the current problem in the first place.  The Government is only waking up now after every economist has told it for the past six months, some even years ago, of the problems in the economy.</P>
        <P>This Fianna F&aacute;il, Green Party and other mixum gatherum Government&rsquo;s legacy is that in just 18 months it has managed to double the unemployment level and the national debt.  This has never happened before in the State&rsquo;s history.  May we get rid of this Government as soon as possible to ensure it will never happen again.  The electorate is looking for leadership and policies which the Fine Gael Party has advocated for the past several years.  An early general election is needed.</P>
        <P>In its latest quarterly bulletin, the ESRI has forecasted the economy will contract by 5% in 2009 after an estimated contraction of 2.2% in 2008.  This is unprecedented.  It has been the greatest reversal in economic growth, both historically and by current domestic and international standards.  In the depth of the last recession in the 1980s, the economy declined by 1.3% and 1.9% in 1982 and 1983, respectively.  That is less than half the current rate of the current decline which shows how bad the Government has run down the economy.</P>
        <P>While all countries face economic difficulties, not many of them face a crisis similar to Ireland&rsquo;s.  According to OECD forecasts, developed economies as a whole are expected to grow marginally in 2009 while the next worst performing EU member state to Ireland will be Hungary, whose economy has contracted by 1.5%.  Ireland has the worst deficit in public finances of any EU member state with borrowing likely to exceed &euro;18 billion, 10% of gross domestic product, next year.  The national debt will be doubled by 2010.  Ireland will suffer the largest increase in unemployment of any EU member state.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il wasted the boom and destroyed the fundamentals of the economy.  The economy was left uniquely exposed to the global economic crisis.  Of all the EU member states, Ireland had the largest property boom, the greatest dependence on the construction sector for jobs, the highest levels of personal indebtedness, the largest increases in costs and the greatest loss of export market share.</P>
        <P>The economic principles that delivered the prosperity of the Celtic tiger in the 1990s were keeping costs down, ensuring high levels of productivity, export-led growth, tight budgeting and prudent regulation of the financial sector and the housing market.  All these principles were abandoned by the Government.  The impact the collapsing economy will have on families and communities will be devastating.  Private sector wages will fall for the first time in the State&rsquo;s history, even as Ireland will remain the most expensive EU member state for food and household goods.  Employment is expected to fall by 116,000, 2,000 jobs a week, pushing up the live register to 375,000 by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policies are putting people into unemployment.  Competitiveness has been affected.  The ESB&rsquo;s electricity prices, for example, will not come down because of regulation even though oil prices have dropped significantly.  Domestic and industrial electricity prices should be coming down so we can position ourselves properly to come out of this recession.</P>
        <P>Only in recent months has the Government used the term &ldquo;recession&rdquo;.  It was afraid to mention it before then when everyone else could see the economy tumbling.  The people will have to make sacrifices because of this Government&rsquo;s failure and that of the Government in <Col N="379"/>which the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  The best the Government can do now is ask us for our ideas.  It would not listen to us for the past seven years.  Now it wants to hear these ideas and claim it is implementing Fine Gael&rsquo;s cuts.  It will not work and the public will not buy it any more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know why the Government would ask for suggestions from certain quarters because they seem to be bereft of any positive suggestions.  I too could engage in partisan politics but the situation is far too serious and would serve no useful purpose.</P>
        <P>As many Members have recognised, there is a global dimension to this economic problem.  That is not to deny there are domestic problems as well.  The entire banking system across the major western economies is in crisis.  While it may have been building up for years, it has happened rapidly and was not recognised by many economic commentators, as Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole stated earlier.</P>
        <P>In a report last week, Professor Roubini of New York University stated the US financial institutions could be facing losses to the tune of &euro;3.6 trillion.  His estimation was that if this turned out to be true, they would be effectively insolvent.  Who would have ever thought the banking institutions of the number one economy in the world could reach this disastrous point.</P>
        <P>In the neighbouring island, the UK Government had to inject &euro;20 billion into the Royal Bank of Scotland.  The bank has recorded a loss of &euro;28 billion for 2008 and may well have to be nationalised to be salvaged.  In the last quarter the German economy&rsquo;s output was reduced by 2.4%.  We are in uncharted waters. No one in our lifetimes has seen such challenges.</P>
        <P>Every village in the world is experiencing recession.  Unemployment is rising in practically all our competing countries.  However, this is no consolation to us.  We have our own problems and, while we may look to certain international institutions or the EU for assistance, we ultimately have to address them ourselves.</P>
        <P>Investor and consumer confidence is at an extremely low ebb but whether we are in Government, Opposition or the media, we all have a part to play as economic commentators to give a fair and objective account of our circumstances.  I was told last week by a person from America who plays an important public service role in this country that even though the United States&rsquo; economy is in deeper trouble than ours, the feelings of doom and gloom are much more pervasive here.  We need to manage those feelings because the sooner we restore consumer confidence, the better.  Unless we increase spending in the economy, unemployment will continue to grow.  Unfortunately, unemployment will be a feature in all the major economies this and next year.</P>
        <P>Suggestions have been made, although not by Fine Gael Members, regarding credit availability from banks.  We can all provide anecdotal evidence that credit is not being made available.  Efforts have been made to improve capitalisation and the policies of banks but perhaps it is also necessary to restore confidence in their lending policies.  Our procurement policies should as much as possible assist small and medium enterprises.  There should be less bureaucracy and fewer forms.  In so far as small and medium enterprises are concerned, regulations and labour interventions in particular should be set aside for the present.  I have learned of instances in my neck of the woods, which I know are being repeated throughout the country, whereby National Employment Rights Agency  inspectors insist that restaurant staff are paid double time on Sundays.  Apparently that is the law but it goes against the wishes of the employees and their employers who cannot afford the wage bill, and people are losing their jobs as a consequence.  It is a ludicrous policy in the current climate.  It was one matter to enforce these regulations in good economic times but we must now be pragmatic.  I make the <Col N="380"/>same argument about the minimum wage.  Every obstacle to employment must be examined and possibly set aside.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is a major issue in terms of Exchequer borrowing.  We may borrow as much as &euro;20 billion this year unless corrective measures are taken.  That is an unsustainable figure.  There is no room for manoeuvre and there is no such thing, which I sometimes hear in the public service, as setting aside 80% of expenditure and considering only the remainder as discretionary spending.  We have to consider our entire expenditure as discretionary.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;20 billion is paid on wages across the public service, of which we are part, and a further &euro;20 billion on social welfare.  It is my opinion that we need to cut &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion from the pay.  That will not be done without pain.  I have previously suggested that an immediate 10% cut should be made to the payroll of everyone in the public service without exception.  The number of public servants also needs to be reduced by 15%.  This can be done by means of career breaks or retirement.  I acknowledge the many hardworking people employed in the public service who are indispensable to the system but, like every large organisation, a proportion of public servants are hiding or unproductive.  We need to concentrate on identifying the latter.  In any large organisation, money is spent unnecessarily and sometimes wastefully.  It will not be easy to identify that waste but we must do so.  The best people to assist us in this task are the middle managers who know how to address inefficiencies without impacting front-line services.</P>
        <P>I recommend pay cuts over increasing pension contributions or taking other soft options such as borrowing for the national development plan because we are uncompetitive in our wages.  A report conducted 12 months ago by the University of Glasgow on income levels in urban areas of western European economies put Ireland in first place at &euro;44,300.  Denmark was second at &euro;36,200, which means we are 23% ahead.  Britain was in seventh place, at &euro;29,200.  In other words, our average wage in urban areas is 52% higher than Britain&rsquo;s.  The people who have bankrolled the EU since we joined, the west Germans, earned &euro;32,300 in urban areas, or 38% less than here.  These figures are not sustainable and unless we act now, wages in the private sector will be forced to fall further.  I appeal to the unions to consider this issue before the problems become more serious in two years&rsquo; time.  We will not be able to afford these pay levels and others will be dictating to us the cuts we need to make.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State and the previous speaker to tell us something we do not know.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s presentation threw out a few new figures, several generalities and some literary comments of such a generic nature that they have no relevance to the problems we face.  We need the Government to provide directions, decisions and policies.  The role of the Opposition is to comment on Government policy and point out weaknesses to bring improvements but we are being asked instead to come up with solutions.  Last July our spokesperson on finance, Deputy Bruton, proposed a series of measures which have been followed religiously by the Minister for Finance.  I cannot find in the measures introduced by the Minister any that have not been proposed by Fine Gael.  Deputy Bruton set out a programme for recovery in the autumn and articulated further measures last week.</P>
        <P>All we are getting from this Government are frameworks for dealing with the banking crisis and the recovery of the economy.  We have to read about the framework for discussions with social partners in the newspapers because we are told very little in the House.  Essentially, this comprises the agenda for their meetings.  I do not know the Taoiseach&rsquo;s problem but his policy <Col N="381"/>seems to consist of asking everyone what should be done.  No one in the Government is setting out a series of measures which could be judged on an objective basis.  This country&rsquo;s international credibility has been affected owing to the Government&rsquo;s lack of action.  Even when it became apparent that problems existed in respect of regulation in the banking sector, it did not act promptly to condemn bad practices and take the necessary actions.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State suggested we should never again rely on the assumption that there would not be an economic cycle.  Who assumed there was no such thing as the economic cycle?  If that is what is being suggested in the introductory remarks as being a conventional wisdom over recent years, it was only in the mind of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government of the past ten years.  It never saw the necessity of prudent public finances but merely assumed that the tax take from the construction sector &mdash; stamp duty, etc. &mdash; would go on and built economic policies on that.  That is the fundamental problem today.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has indicated global financial market conditions remain extremely difficult and this compounds the sharp contraction in the construction sector.  It does not.  All that international financial market conditions highlight is the weakness in economic management over the past ten years and the lack of regulation in our own financial sector.  It exposes the faults and mistakes made, and this is why Ireland was first into recession in the European Union and the reason the recession in Ireland is deeper than that of any other member state.  It is why our public finances are in much worse shape than in any other European Union member state.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has indicated the Department of Finance expects the economy to contract by 4% following a decline of nearly 1.5% last year.  The ESRI has indicated in its latest quarterly report that the economy is expected to contract by 5% following a decline of 2.2% last year.  The extent of the economic expertise in the Department of Finance has recently been highlighted and I wonder, even at this late stage, if the Government and the Minister have the correct figures.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has said we must demonstrate clearly, both nationally and internationally, that in response to the exceptionally difficult environment we face, our public finances will be managed in a stable and sustainable manner and be brought back on track.  The Taoiseach said this last summer, after the summer, before Christmas and we have had a statement again today.  We know this but a programme of action is required.  The Government must bring forward policy, which we do not have before us today.  As a result, commenting on any policy prescription from the Government is impossible.  There is none.</P>

	<P>I thought I would have the chance to make my comments when we had the debate on the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  We were guillotined on that occasion so there was no opportunity then either.</P>
        <P>I will briefly ask the Minister of State a few questions.  It is easy to see what has gone wrong over recent years.  Too many sections of this economy and parts of the Government were on autopilot.  There was no control, accountability or management.  When a former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, took some responsible decisions, he was given the boot and sent to Europe.  He got no great comfort on the backbenches of his own party either at that time.</P>
        <P>A former leader of our party, Deputy Michael Noonan, was scoffed at by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government of the day when he suggested that money from the National Pensions Reserve <Col N="382"/>Fund be used for infrastructure within this country.  Now we find money from fund will be used to bail out Anglo Irish Bank and, perhaps, other banks.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated on the BBC the other day that it was a good job we are linked to the eurozone.  I believe we are in the eurozone.  It was a big slip-up for the Minister for Finance to say we are linked with the eurozone when we are definitely in it.  It is a good job we are.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance places great confidence in the Governor of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the National Treasury Management Agency.  Not for the first time, the National Treasury Management Agency has lost a lot of money in the pensions fund.  It lost money a number of years ago and has done so again in the past two years.</P>
        <P>Shareholders buying shares in various institutions or banks do so at their own risk.  They know the responsibilities taken on and that they can lose everything.  The National Treasury Management Agency is acting on behalf of the people of this country and it has failed them and their pensions.  Its people did not carry out due diligence with many of the shares bought on behalf of the people and their agencies.  If the Minister of State makes a response, he should indicate how much money has been lost from pensions in 2007 and 2008.</P>

        <P>A point was just made about the alleged difference between the ESRI and the Department of Finance.  This possibly arises from rounding up and rounding down figures.

	<P>The Houses of the Oireachtas have many opportunities to make inputs of ideas, and this has been one.  They can also constitutionally accept or reject outcomes of programmes, plans and negotiations.  Inevitably, negotiations which involve the size of a pay bill must take in those who receive or earn incomes and those who pay them.  It is not realistic to believe negotiations &mdash; I have been involved in some in my time &mdash; can be done in public with partial ideas.  In a negotiation, nothing is agreed until everything is.  The problem with a partial approach is that the picture is distorted.</P>
        <P>The urgency of reaching a conclusion at an early stage is well accepted but the opportunity of getting it right with wide public support should not be missed, if possible.  Any agreed document will be published when there is agreement but at the end of the day the Government is democratically elected and must make decisions for which it can be held accountable through the Oireachtas.  These decisions can be debated.</P>
        <P>With regard to the banks issue, which is important, discussions are ongoing with AIB and Bank of Ireland on recapitalisation.  The recapitalisation announced in December included a credit package under which the banks committed to, among other things, providing an additional 10% capacity for lending to small to medium enterprise in 2009, an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009, assisting householders in arrears on their <Col N="383"/>mortgages and introducing a &euro;100 million fund to support environmentally friendly investments with a view to reducing energy usage and facilitating a switch to renewable energies.</P>
        <P>The immediate impact of the Act to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank which was signed into law on Wednesday last is to provide certainty for all of the bank&rsquo;s depositors and other customers across all of its operations in Ireland and internationally that it is secure and stable and will continue to conduct its business on normal terms.  One cannot overemphasise the need for a healthy and sustainable banking system which is vital for the functioning of society and will be a central plank of recovery.</P>
        <P>The Minister met the chairman of the Commission on Taxation last week and asked him to complete his report as soon as possible.  However, the complexity of the issues involved must be borne in mind.  In addition, decisions on changes in taxation will be made in the next budget which will not be introduced before the autumn.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the payment of bills by public sector bodies.  Under legislation, all commercial transactions undertaken by State bodies are required to be paid within a specified period &mdash; usually 30 days &mdash; subject to contractual arrangements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I raise a matter causing grave concern to the people of south Tipperary, namely, job losses.  I am sure it is a concern to people throughout the country.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State is aware, Tipperary has suffered very significant job losses in the past year and unemployment has almost doubled in the past 12 months.  The closure of Moy Isover and Quinn Merriott, as well as job losses at Waterford Crystal and Dell which have not yet been factored into the unemployment figures of south Tipperary, and redundancies at Bulmers, have impacted severely on my constituents in south Tipperary.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, we have started to hear more worrying news from Bulmers in Clonmel.  Some 24 permanent staff were laid off last week and a review is taking place currently.  Three men were recently appointed to the top positions at the parent company, C&amp;C, who have been awarded a pay package in the region of &euro;18 million, or equating to 5% of the company, which is linked to a share price.  That is performance related.  It is a worry when directors&rsquo; pay is devised in this way, especially when the break-up and sale of C&amp;C is mooted for the future.  This leads to short term thinking where shareholders&rsquo; interests are put ahead of the sustainability of the company.  The companies are benefiting from lower interest rates and energy prices and are likely to do so for the foreseeable future, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>I assume the Minister of State shares my views that any move to reduce staffing at Bulmers can only be seen as an unwarranted attempt to increase an already healthy profit base.  There is no crisis and there is no cashflow issue.  Bulmers is a premium Irish brand and it is very much linked to Clonmel and its economy.  It has international recognition and it holds a very special place both in Irish culture and in its home area of Clonmel, and no amount of slick advertising will cover up the damage which could be done to the brand if there are unwarranted job cuts.  The lack of information about the ongoing review in Bulmers is adding to the concern of workers, local businesses and families.</P>
        <P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State could provide some clarity on this situation and the jobs issue generally by answering the following questions.  Is he being kept informed of the review taking place in Bulmers in Clonmel and, if so, can he provide us with an update?  As I said, it has provided major employment in the area for over 60 years.  This is of major concern to south Tipperary and the south east generally because of the impact of recent announcements.</P>
        <P>What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on the &euro;18 million remuneration package for the directors who, I understand, are managing the review?  What is his view on share price related pay packages generally?  What specifically are State agencies, such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, doing to replace jobs lost in south Tipperary and when can we expect an announcement on investment in the area?</P>
        <P>What specific measures are being taken to assist those who have lost their jobs in south Tipperary in terms of advice on retraining and finding a new job?  Does the Minister of State accept the need for an employment task force for Tipperary which has traditionally been an unemployment blackspot and is heading that way again?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Government and the industrial development agencies are concerned at the situation in south Tipperary and in the other areas of the country outlined by the Senator.  While I am conscious of the effect that job losses have on the workers involved and their families, as well as on local communities, I assure anybody affected that the State agencies will give every support they can in order to assist workers who lose their jobs and to develop new employment opportunities in these areas.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The role of F&Aacute;S, the employment and training authority, continues to be particularly important in assisting people who lose their jobs.  F&Aacute;S employment services in the south-east region have engaged with the companies mentioned in south Tipperary.  The authority has provided career guidance, access to training and financial support for training to workers in the affected companies.  The authority continues to provide ongoing support to employees made redundant in those companies.  In addition, F&Aacute;S in the south east is providing a comprehensive package of supports for workers in Waterford Crystal, including those from south Tipperary, and is also part of the interagency response in Waterford.  Similarly, F&Aacute;S mid-west is providing a comprehensive package of measures for workers in Dell and is part of the Government task force recently announced.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The strategy of IDA Ireland for south Tipperary is to concentrate future economic development in Clonmel and to develop the town as a first-class location for overseas investment.  This strategy has been agreed with South Tipperary County Council.  The agency is actively engaged with its existing client base in County Tipperary to encourage their transition to higher value activities with a view to increasing their embeddedness in their location within Ireland.</P>
        <P>Currently, there are 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in south Tipperary, employing over 3,000 people.  The key industry sector for south Tipperary is life sciences, which accounts for over 90% of employment.  In marketing south Tipperary for new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland is focused on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge-based industries, including advanced manufacturing.  Recent key wins for the county have been Cordis and Alza in Cashel.  In December 2008, Cordis officially opened its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, development laboratory and finished goods testing facility in Cashel.</P>
        <P>To compete for investments at the highest end of the value chain, IDA Ireland has purchased 20 hectares of land in the South Tipperary County Council owned Ballingarrane Estate in Clonmel.  I am confident that the future development of the Ballingarrane lands, incorporating the IDA business park and Tipperary Institute, will be a key asset in attracting foreign direct investment into south Tipperary.  In addition, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with third level educational institutions in the region to ensure that the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county are being developed.  The agency also maintains a close relationship with F&Aacute;S to ensure the requirements of industry, particularly in the areas of training and up-skilling, are being met.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to foster job creation in south Tipperary and in the south-east region.  In the past three years, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of over &euro;18 million and made payments of over &euro;6 million to client companies in south Tipperary.  As part of an initiative to encourage new start-ups in the region, the agency supports the enterprise platform programme &mdash; a one-year incubation programme designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs wanting to set up their own business &mdash; by funding eligible participants to attend.  The south-east EPP for 2008-09 started in September 2008 and an additional programme will begin in September 2009.  The development of community enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise.  Enterprise Ireland has assisted in the establishment of community enterprise centres in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary Town.  All of these centres are now operating successfully and have achieved occupancy rates of 80%.</P>
<Col N="386"/>
        <P>Tipperary South County Enterprise Board, together with other county enterprise boards in the region &mdash; Clare, Cork north, Kerry, Limerick city, Limerick county, Tipperary north, Waterford city and Waterford county &mdash; have been working to support individuals, firms, and community groups.  During 2008, Tipperary South County Enterprise Board paid out more than &euro;240,000 in grant assistance to 26 projects.  In 2008, 587 people participated in Tipperary South County Enterprise Board training and development programmes. These interventions have contributed to the development of sustainable local growth-oriented enterprises which continue to deliver high quality job creation.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies being pursued by the State development agencies, in partnership with other key players, together with the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to regional development, will drive investment and job creation for south Tipperary generally.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of special needs pupils and teachers.  It is now imperative that special needs teachers and classes are exempt from the cutbacks being imposed regarding supervision and substitution cover.  It is important that we acknowledge the special role of special needs education in the education system.  It is extraordinary that in St. Columba&rsquo;s in Cork, which has become a model for the teaching of special needs students, its principal, who is a respected educator and a sincere man, is being forced to write to parents about this issue.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State believe it is right that a provision causing hardship is being imposed on special needs education?  Special needs classes should be exempt from the substitution and supervision cutbacks.  That would avoid the need for principals to engage in crisis management and alleviate the concern among parents.</P>
        <P>I am not making this up.  This week, the principal of St. Columba&rsquo;s, Douglas, Cork, had to write to parents explaining to them that because of the cutbacks in the employment of substitute teachers and supervision, he may not be able to provide immediate cover on the first day of substitution if a teacher does not come to work because of illness.  That creates a number of problems, not just in a specific school but across a multitude of schools in Cork and throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It now behoves Government to admit it made a mistake.  Before Christmas, the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, said he had found an additional &euro;2.5 million but this is not mainstream education.  I am talking about special needs education.</P>
        <P>The circular should be rewritten to include a specific exemption for special needs education.  It is imperative that is done.  I acknowledge that at a time of plenty the provision of special needs assistants became a welcome part of the education lexicon.  However, in this time of financial difficulty, those who most need our help to be educated deserve to be treated with the respect they are entitled to from the State.  I ask that children in special needs classes be <Col N="387"/>exempted.  The Minister can insert one line in the circular to the effect that an exemption is being given to special needs classes.</P>
        <P>This is not just about children with autism but those with all disabilities.  We have made major inroads in this country regarding that issue.  As the Minister of State is aware, the substitution and supervision cover is not like the cover in a mainstream class where any teacher can be brought in as cover.  Special needs education requires a specific, trained person.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to revisit this badly thought out, badly composed plan.  What does it take for a principal to compose a letter, perhaps talk to the chairman of the school board of management, and send that letter to parents stating that the classes for their children may not be able to proceed because the principal cannot get adequate cover?  I do not know any principal who will take pleasure in doing that.</P>
        <P>This scheme must be revisited.  We want to provide education for all our children but specifically our children with special needs.  I ask the Minister to do that and give an exemption to schools that cater for special needs classes.  They should be exempt from cutbacks in substitution and supervision cover.  I ask the Minister of State to take cognisance of that issue when replying.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  The example I gave is not an isolated case.  The same is happening elsewhere and we need to reverse a badly thought-out cutback.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position with regard to supervision and substitution for children with special needs who are attending the school mentioned.</P>
        <P>As a result of the 2009 budget provisions for education, arising from current economic challenges and following subsequent proposals from the management bodies of primary schools, new arrangements are being put in place for substitution cover for uncertified sick leave for teachers in primary schools.</P>
        <P>In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified sick leave other than on the first day of absence.  In a school where more than one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers who are absent.  In schools with two or less teachers, cover will be provided where any classroom teacher is absent.  Circular 0115/2008 outlining the full details has been posted on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie.</i></P>
        <P>Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of absences currently available such as certified sick leave and maternity leave.  In the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the additional expenditure and thereby ensuring the budgetary parameters are met.</P>
        <P>As we manage through this difficult period, I ask teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students.  I also request the school managerial bodies to ensure that the supervision and substitution scheme is operated with maximum effectiveness in all schools.</P>
        <P>With regard to circumstances such as those mentioned by the Senator, a range of options are available to school principals.  These include the temporary movement of teaching staff within schools to meet the needs of the special needs children concerned.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Senator and I thank him once again for raising the matter with me.</P>

	<P>While I thank the Minister of State for his response, his reply was not satisfactory as it did not take into consideration that a school principal may not be in a position to move teachers around or provide immediate cover.  In such circumstances, who will look after the children in question?  They will be forced to go home.  A new tier of wrongly <Col N="388"/>categorised students is being created in schools.  The reply is not good enough as it does not take cognisance of the position on the ground.  Nobody is listening to those who are trying to implement the circular imposed by the Government.

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Glynn.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss the important matter.  While I am concerned about general downgrading of services in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar, I raise in particular the urgent and grave matter of the downgrading of colposcopy services in the hospital.  Women in the midlands deserve to have a colposcopy service.  One of the most frightening moments any woman will experience is learning from her gynaecologist that a smear is abnormal.  While an abnormal smear could mean a woman has cancer, the majority of such smears are caused by vaginal infection.  </P>
        <P>A pilot scheme headed by Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly from Limerick was established in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  As part of a plan, 19 centres around the country were in a position to participate in the screening programme.  The programme was introduced in hospitals with full gynaecological services, namely, obstetrician, gynaecologist and inpatient services.  The Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar, which has a full service, was assessed and deemed a suitable location for the screening programme and funding of &euro;100,000 was provided.  This money was spent on upgrading facilities at the hospital to provide a colposcopy suite and the programme was to link in with the national programme.</P>
        <P>In October 2008, Dr. Flannery, who headed up the pilot scheme in place in the various centres, indicated that the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar was not a suitable location for the service.  However, she invited management at the hospital to submit a bid for the colposcopy service.  Following submission of a bid, a reply issued by the quality officer at the beginning of this month stated that the hospital was not a suitable location for the service.  The hospital was informed it did not have a sufficient number of potential patients as each centre should expect to treat 500 patients per annum.  It is estimated, however, that between them, Mullingar and Portlaoise hospitals would have 850 patients per annum.</P>
        <P>While the regional plan envisages the provision of a service in the midlands, I fear that, as in the case of the sexual assault unit, the service will be provided in Tullamore General Hospital.  Any such decision would stink of politics because Tullamore General Hospital does not provide gynaecological services, employ an obstetrician or have a maternity unit.  The Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar, on the other hand, provides all these inpatient facilities and has spent &euro;100,000 on the colposcopy unit.</P>
        <P>The Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar has lost its breast cancer service.  Although I accept the necessity for centres of excellence to undertake the screening and treatment of breast cancer, I resent the gradual but consistent erosion of services in the wonderful facility of the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  This trend will cause instability and dysfunction in the hospital and is demoralising staff.  The average turnaround for patients in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar is 3.5 days and, as Senator Glynn will agree, it is probably the most efficient hospital in the country.</P>
<Col N="389"/>
        <P>I ask that the colposcopy service be retained for women in the midlands.  It is already difficult for people in counties Longford, Westmeath and Laois to travel to Tullamore.  Let us retain the central service in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Women are very important people in society.  They are mothers who bear and rear our children and play a pivotal role in society.  I hope my remarks are not interpreted as patronising.</P>
        <P>The provision of the colposcopy service in Mullingar and the midlands region is important.  The Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar is among the best performing hospitals in the country.  I was pleased to note it received one of the highest ratings in the country recently.</P>
        <P>Without ploughing old ground, I ask the Minister of State to ensure women living in the midlands region are able to avail of a colposcopy service.  Too many young women die for want of appropriate services.  Cancer is a word which strikes fear into everyone&rsquo;s heart.  Its icy fingers clutch the individual&rsquo;s persona the moment the name is uttered.  When people ask if one has heard whether so and so has &ldquo;you know what&rdquo; one does not need to second guess what the questioner means.  Without labouring the point, I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Health and Children our concern that this service be available in the midlands region.</P>
        <P>It is true that the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore does not provide maternity services.  I ask that a colposcopy service be brought on stream as expeditiously as possible, if possible in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  I am surprised the hospital is not considered a suitable location for the service.  While the experts are not always right, they are not always wrong either.  I support what has been said and ask that the service be provided in the midlands region as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The national cancer screening service is responsible for implementation of CervicalCheck, the national cervical screening programme, which commenced last September.  Colposcopy services are an integral part of a cervical screening programme.  Women who have pre-cancerous cell changes detected by a smear test are referred for colposcopy.  Prior to the commencement of CervicalCheck, much screening was carried out on an<i> ad hoc</i> basis and women were offered varying structures and processes of care, in addition to sometimes lengthy waiting times for colposcopy, where necessary.  The roll-out of CervicalCheck has provided an opportunity to focus on the development and organisation of colposcopy services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The NCSS is responsible for the monitoring and audit of colposcopy services provided under the programme to ensure quality assured standards, based on those defined by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, are adhered to.  It is important to ensure that, as part of CervicalCheck, women can access colposcopy services within international best practice timeframes, based on adherence to quality assured clinical practice and the achievement of best clinical outcomes.</P>
        <P>In preparation for the launch of the screening programme the NCSS, in co-operation with the Health Service Executive, completed an analysis of existing colposcopy services.  This examined facilities, staffing, systems management, information management, information technology and governance.  Based on this analysis, the NCSS initially identified 11 colposcopy services as being most prepared to receive referrals from CervicalCheck.  A further four colposcopy services have since been identified to support the CervicalCheck programme, following a wide range of service enhancements.  The NCSS is making a significant investment to enhance these services to ensure best outcomes for all women, regardless of location.</P>
<Col N="390"/>
        <P>The colposcopy service at the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar is not among the services identified as suitable to receive referrals from CervicalCheck.  Historically, there has been a multiplicity of small-scale services in the midlands which do not meet quality assurance requirements.  For clinics to become part of the programme, there is a requirement to demonstrate capacity for a minimum of 500 new referrals.  For the midlands region as a whole, the projected total number of new colposcopy referrals is 868, based on Central Statistics Office figures and an 80% uptake rate of screening.  The NCSS recognises the need for a colposcopy service in the midlands that can meet the quality assurance demands of the programme.  The local hospital network manager is working actively with clinicians on the ground to ensure colposcopy services are delivered in the midlands.  If a service in the midlands is identified in terms of scalable capacity, sustainable quality assurance and geographical location, the NCSS will assess its ability to provide support to enhance the resources, information technology facilities and equipment of such a service.  In the meantime, women from the midlands region who require a colposcopy following screening through the CervicalCheck programme will be referred to one of the 15 quality assured services supported by the programme.  The aim is to ensure best outcomes for all women, including those living in the midlands area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions.  Who made the decision to move colposcopy services from the midlands region?  What is the evidence for using 500 new patients as a threshold?  I have contrary evidence that the requirement for each practising colposcopist is to see at least 50 new patients, according to information from the United Kingdom.  I do not know where the new figure of 500 has come from and would like the matter to be clarified.  </P>
        <P>Why have the four units in the midlands not been found to be suitable?  Every other unit in the country has been found to be suitable.  It seems crazy.  Where are the results of the assessments comparing different units?  Why have we not seen them?  Terms such as &ldquo;scalable capacity&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainable quality assurance&rdquo; are gobbledygook.  Does the phrase &ldquo;geographical location&rdquo; mean that consultants are expected to travel from one area of the midlands to another?  The service is being eroded from the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar in front of our eyes.  This is not acceptable.</P>
