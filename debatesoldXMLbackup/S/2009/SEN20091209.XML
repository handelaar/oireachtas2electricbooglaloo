	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure access to export credit insurance for exporters.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">As hundreds of students will not receive their first instalment of the student grant until 2010, the need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure no potential grant recipient in Letterkenny Institute of Technology will be unjustly penalised or forced to pay a proportion of the registration fee owing to the fact that he or she has not yet received confirmation from awarding bodies of grant applications.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make a statement on his plans to integrate the community development programme with the local development social inclusion programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the report by the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin (resumed), to resume at the conclusion of the Order of Business, on which spokespersons may speak for 20 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, and with the Minister to be called upon not later than 1.15 p.m. for closing comments and to take questions from spokespersons and leaders; No. 2, statements on farming and the agrifood sector, to be taken at 1.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 3.30 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, and with the Minister to be called upon not later than 3.20 p.m. for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons and leaders; and No. 3, Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2009 &mdash; <Col N="264"/>Second Stage, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 7.30 p.m.  The business of the House shall be interrupted between 3.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear the Government has created a climate of fear and anxiety about the budget in bringing the country to the edge of a financial precipice and I do not believe the people have confidence that it will bring us back from it.  I want to raise questions today &mdash; we will be discussing the budget tomorrow &mdash; about the values it will foster.  I point to one issue about which serious questions must be asked.  It appears, for example, that the price of alcohol will be reduced but what values will be fostered in terms of job creation and competitiveness?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I point to another issue, the welfare of children.  We will discuss the Murphy report later.  We have had the Ryan report and an implementation plan for it from the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  The implementation plan is excellent but will resources be made available for it?  We have heard so much talk about the need to protect children in the aftermath of the Ryan and Murphy reports but are we only paying lip service to the issue?  Will resources be made available, despite the financial difficulties we are facing, to protect children and implement the recommendations made in the reports?  That is the critical question.  </P>
        <P>It looks as if the Government will attack children by cutting child benefit which, I have no doubt, will have a dreadful effect on families and children.  Families are extremely worried about the cut and the implications for their weekly budgets and children.  We will watch the budget very carefully today to see what values it espouses and if resources will be provided to ensure more than lip service will be paid to the protection of children.</P>
        <P>Cutting back the work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is not the way to proceed, in the same way as getting rid of the Combat Poverty Agency, the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority was not the right direction in which to move at this time of difficulty.  We will have a debate in the House tomorrow and will see how the budget plays out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that the Garda Commissioner has written to the Garda representative bodies to say members of the force will break the law if they take strike action.  I do not know about that and would like to have the matter clarified in the House.  I do not know what law they would be breaking, but they might be in breach of secondary legislation.  It seems the Constitution clearly states people have the right to withdraw labour, associate and use these rights as it suits them.  The House should be aware that police officers in many European countries are members of trade unions or similar associations.  One may consider it is a given that garda&iacute; should not strike, but that is not the same as saying they do not have a constitutional right to strike.  I do not know whether a specific prohibition is provided for in law, but it may be provided for in regulations.  I question whether people can simply decide garda&iacute; will be in breach of the law if they engage in industrial action.  Therefore, certain constitutional issues need to be addressed.</P>
        <P>It seems every person, including members of the Garda, has the right to withdraw his or her labour.  The exercise of this right is guaranteed by the Constitution.  I would like to debate this point with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has commented on the issue.  I am not talking about whether garda&iacute; might go on strike in the current circumstances, as that is not the issue for me.  I am talking about a much broader issue.  People are reinforcing the <Col N="265"/>view that garda&iacute; cannot strike without breaking the law.  Everybody has a constitutional right to withdraw his or her labour as he or she sees fit.  I would like the matter to be discussed and to hear more about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for additional resources to be allocated to implement the recommendations made in the Ryan and Murphy reports.  I hope child benefit will not be affected in today&rsquo;s budget.  I have been contacted by many people who are concerned about what they will hear today.  Child benefit is particularly important to them as one of their vital weekly resources as they manage their family budgets.  They are awaiting what might be ahead with fear and trepidation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement that &euro;2 million is to be provided for farmers as part of the fodder aid scheme.  There is a chronic crisis in cattle farming.  Farmers had to meet the additional cost of moving and rehousing cattle during the extraordinarily wet spring this year.  They had to keep cattle housed and fed over the summer.  Beef prices are at their lowest level for 20 years.  An IFA study has found that farm incomes have decreased by 40% in the last two years.  I appreciate that we will have an opportunity to contribute to a debate on agriculture later today, but we need to listen to those who are on their knees and finding it difficult to manage because their grounds are waterlogged.</P>
        <P>More than half of the approximately 1,000 people surveyed on their blood pressure by the Trinity Centre for Health Sciences which is based at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital were found to have high levels.  In turn, just half of these were found to be on medication for hypertension.  There is a need for a national information campaign on the effects of high blood pressure which can include stroke or death, at worst.  If people are screened, they will know whether they need to take medication and be treated at an early stage.  They need to know what the normal level of blood pressure is and what the standards of care should be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard this morning that the Government has brokered a deal with Deputy Healy-Rae to develop a 40-bed hospital in Kenmare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a 42-bed hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a 48-bed hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing against Deputy Healy-Rae; in fact, I quite like him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can give him a No. 1 vote.</P>

	<P>I have nothing against Kenmare either.  The cronyism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Daly is in trouble now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appalling that people are being encouraged in this fashion to support a tired and worn out Government.  I asked the Leader last week to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to come to the House to discuss this serious issue.  I tabled an amendment to the Order of Business last Friday to try to get the Minister to debate the serious loss of 41 beds at the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to deliver this.  It is extraordinary that when we ask the Minister to advise us on HSE matters, she says it is a matter for Professor Drumm. <Col N="266"/> When support for this tired and worn out Government needs to be bolstered, however, it seems it is easy to deliver a 40-bed hospital in Kenmare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator Kieran Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is time to deliver beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an absolute atrocity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not go on strike.  There is a war in the country.  I am interested in knowing if there is any prospect of the Army declaring industrial action.  It would be a little odd if it were to do so in the middle of a war.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is also covered by the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.  I note that the Senator distanced himself from any suggestion he might be encouraging members of the Garda to go on strike.</P>
        <P>Twenty years ago yesterday the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gerry Collins, ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  It was suggested it was an important move because it wiped a stain from Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  However, the covenant does not have any teeth.  Since September the country has been coming under pressure to demonstrate its commitment to the protection of economic rights by ratifying an optional protocol to the covenant.  The protocol creates a mechanism under which people can assert such rights.  A distinguished former Member of this House, Mrs. Mary Robinson, has created an organisation called Realizing Rights.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister the urgent necessity to ratify the optional protocol, which would help people to realise their rights.</P>
        <P>I join others who have commented on the Government&rsquo;s extraordinary and lamentable decision which has apparently been leaked in advance to reduce tax on alcohol.  That such a decision will do damage is made clear by a headline in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers, &ldquo;Irish among top alcohol consumers in OECD &mdash; report&rdquo;.  One tiny country, Luxembourg, is slightly worse than Ireland in this regard.  We need to reflect on the damage to health and jobs being done by alcohol.  I suggest that rather than addressing the leakage of alcohol sales to Newry in this way, the Government should approach Mr. Peter Robinson who is always bleating about his biblically based Protestantism to get the Northern Ireland Administration to co-operate in an all-Ireland effort to address the problem of alcoholism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not increase the prevalence of alcoholism at Christmas time when it is particularly dangerous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator McFadden on the decision made by the HSE yesterday.  I ask the Leader to explain how the Minister for Health and Children can abdicate responsibility for matters relating to the HSE, while sanctioning the provision of a new hospital in Kenmare.  I salute the efforts of Councillor Patrick O&rsquo;Connor-Scarteen who worked very hard to secure the hospital in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>And his father before him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>How was it possible for the new hospital to be announced by Deputy Healy-Rae yesterday?  The Government is either responsible for the HSE and the cuts in the allocation and configuration of services, or it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is responsible when it suits.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="267"/>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also like a debate on the issue of alcohol.  As somebody who takes a pint, I am genuinely concerned about and outraged by the possibility that the Minister for Finance will propose a reduction in the level of tax charged on alcohol products in the Budget Statement later today.  The level of consumption of alcohol in Ireland is one of the highest in the world.  As a nation, we have a serious alcohol problem.  It has been accentuated, rather than addressed, by the Government&rsquo;s policies on the opening and closing hours of pubs and the operation of off-licences.  The epidemic of alcohol abuse evident in off-licences and pubs in our cities and towns needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The funding given to rehabilitation and treatment centres by the HSE and the Department of Health and Children has been cut.  A debate on these matters is urgently required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>A motion in my name on the Order Paper states &ldquo;Ireland has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world&rdquo; and mentions problems such as &ldquo;alcohol related violence&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; which are associated with alcohol.  Given that a headline in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers reads, &ldquo;Irish among top alcohol consumers in OECD &mdash; report&rdquo;, it is incongruous that the Government is proposing budget sweeteners to the effect that alcohol prices will be reduced.  At the same time, however, one reads about budget sweeteners to the effect that alcohol prices will be reduced.  A debate is needed in this regard.  My motion pertains to advertising, an issue which has not been addressed seriously.  It is an embarrassment that this country displays such a level of binge drinking of alcohol that causes such social problems.  This is a matter the Seanad could address.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Throughout the year the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has been issuing press releases on the savings made in the social welfare budget on foot of a crackdown on fraud.  In July she claimed &euro;250 million had been saved in 2008 and that an estimated &euro;500 million would be saved by anti-fraud measures in 2009.  However, she and the Taoiseach have rejected the suggestion highlighted in this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme that there is fraud to the extent of &euro;2 billion in the social welfare budget.  The Taoiseach has stated one cannot extrapolate from a single case in which it was found that 10% of the budget was being lost through fraud.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report of last September pointed to the social welfare overpayments recorded in 2008 and he suggested extrapolating the results from a number of surveys.  This report indicates there is a significant level of payments in excess of entitlements.  These are highly significant figures.  The Minister has claimed credit for saving &euro;500 million by way of anti-fraud measures.  What has been happening in recent years?  Has the State been losing this level of budgetary resources through sheer incompetence on the part of the Government in controlling this area of public expediture?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Members in acknowledging and welcoming the fact that this is budget day.  It is good to see that it is a good, sunny day outside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is going to rain later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>As Members contemplate the difficult, painful and severe decisions that clearly will be taken and outlined in today&rsquo;s budget, I hope they can be tolerant of that which clearly is necessary.  I do not know what will be contained in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither does the Government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="268"/>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, I acknowledge that certain measures appear to have been suggested in the media regarding reductions in excise duties and child benefit.  While I do not wish to pre-empt what Members may wish to say in the debate on the budget tomorrow evening, it is clear that it will be extremely difficult.  Unquestionably, it will be the most painful budget in the history of the State.  I hope and I am confident that the focus of the Government will be on ensuring the most vulnerable and the less well-off are protected to the fullest extent possible.  Moreover, when the budget is announced, Members of the Houses must be vigilant to ensure the many extant schemes aimed at looking after the less well-off do not allow people to slip through the net.</P>
        <P>On the suggested reduction in excise duties, it would be far too simplistic for Members to interpret it as pertaining to the promotion of alcohol.  I am from one of the Border counties from which almost &euro;500 million in revenue is haemorrhaging from the State.  On the basis that some do take alcohol and that this is their primary objective in crossing the Border&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>They take more than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>They take more than alcohol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>On that basis, I would welcome any movement in excise charges.  However, I agree with other speakers that not enough is being done in the prevention of alcoholism or in the treatment of alcoholics.  More should be done in this regard.  This does not suggest one should allow for one price in the Republic, while a less expensive one is on offer two miles down the road.  I would welcome any moves in this regard.</P>
        <P>Without wishing to be facetious, I congratulate my colleague, Senator Daly.  It did not take him long to ensure work on the hospital first announced in 1979 is to proceed.  I say, &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; to him and the other elected representatives, including Deputy Healy Rae.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a No. 1 for Senator Daly.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>As someone who represents a county that borders Ulster, I also am highly interested in the suggested reduction in excise duties.  I am unsure whether it will have the effect of reducing the level of cross-Border shopping.  I would prefer to see the Minister calling in the various multinational retailers and inducing them to reduce the prices of goods.  When Deputy Gilmore and I visited Northern Ireland last week, we brought up this issue with the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson.  We spoke to people about issues relating to cross-Border shopping, policing and tourism.  One subject that arose from discussions with party leaders in the North was a request that the board of NAMA include members from the Northern Ireland community.  This issue was covered in this morning&rsquo; edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Mr. Sammy Wilson, Minister for Finance and Personnel in the North, asks for such representation.  I note that &euro;5 billion of the NAMA package pertains to property in Northern Ireland where the authorities are concerned that were a fire sale of assets to take place, it would have a drastic impact on the North&rsquo;s economy.  This request is fair and could be accommodated without difficulty.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister to include a representative from the Northern Ireland business community in the board of NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Leader promised a debate on competitiveness in the economy.  I respectfully suggest this is probably too little too late and that today might see an opportunity to address competitiveness, whereby businesses could begin to compete and create <Col N="269"/>and protect jobs again.  Today the people will pay the price for what essentially has been incompetent and misguided leadership in the past ten years.  All the indications are that a cut, slash and burn approach will be taken, which will inflict obvious further pain on families and those who are most vulnerable.  There appears to be no hope for the unemployed, no stimulus measures and no packages or incentives to create jobs.  This Christmas families are fearful and worried about their futures and those of their children.  They seek a focus, confidence building measures, as well as job protection and creation.  I suggest these should be the strong messages that should be heard around both Houses today.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator McFadden that the Government has engaged in an obvious display of contempt for the people in the manner in which it is prostituting deals with Independent Members such as the deal on the hospital for Kenmare.  While all Members have examples from their own districts, people in Waterford have been promised a hospital for the elderly for more than ten years at St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital.  However, wards were closed there this year.  Such side deals display pure contempt because throughout the year the Minister states this is a matter for the HSE.  This simply is not good enough and is the reason people are so angry.  They do not see true, proper and fair governance and are tired of the cute hoorism that has been evident for the past ten years.  Members simply are reflecting their views.  It is about time there was proper, true and fair leadership.  Perhaps today&rsquo;s budget might provide an opportunity for it to commence but I greatly doubt it.</P>

Last October the <i>European Journal of Public Health</i> launched a document by Dr. Paul Corcoran of the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork.</P>

	<P>The matter I am raising is serious.  Every year 10,000 people &mdash; men and women &mdash; are widowed.  The harsh reality revealed by this new study by Dr. Corcoran is that a widowed person is twice as liable to die by suicide.  This is the first time a study of this nature has been conducted in Ireland.  It would be a simple matter for the local community or health nurse to visit a person who has been bereaved.  Widows and widowers are more liable to have an accident or endure death, including by suicide.  This is a highly serious report.  The official suicide figure is approximately 500 a year.  We know, because of the many unreported suicides and different autopsy reports, we are not hearing about the true effects.  A very simple solution to this problem would be for the community nurse to call to a widowed man or woman to assess the state of his or her mental health.</P>

        <P>I am convinced, from the politics of the situation, that there is no redemption for the current Government.  I am equally convinced that, come the election in January 2010 or 2012, Deputy Enda Kenny will be asked to lead a new Government.</P>

	<P>Questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a huge demand for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government to do the right thing economically for Ireland this afternoon.  Senators on this side of the House are also up to that challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader, for the umpteenth time, to use this House to focus on genuine economic debate in the next few months, if we are still in existence.  It would be very useful if each of the Cabinet Ministers would come into this House, make a statement on their respective Departments&rsquo; policy for the next few months and years ahead and to engage with us.  It is a request I have previously made.  I was promised it would happen six years ago in this House by another Leader.  It would be a useful forum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot answer for my predecessor.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="271"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader could have a quiet word with her.  It would be a useful vehicle for debate.  I ask the Leader to put that proposal on the agenda after Christmas because there is a huge amount of work to be done in every Department.  Every Minister could benefit from hearing the views of the Members of this House.  I look forward to a positive reply and some action on the subject.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On Friday fortnight, when all of us sit down to what I hope will be a safe, loving and caring environment to have Christmas lunch with our families, we should reflect on the fact that on the same day last year the ISPCC Childline centre received calls from 750 children throughout the country.  Many of them were seeking protection from domestic violence and abuse on what should be the happiest day of the year.  We should also reflect on the fact that another 500 children called Childline but their calls were not answered.</P>
        <P>It begs a question.  In this country we have a horrible habit of developing a collective amnesia every now and again.  We spend a week or two debating the Ryan and Murphy reports, wringing our hands over the horrendous things which have happened to children in the past and continually promising ourselves that we will not let such things happen now or in the future.  The very fact that on one day alone last year, on what should have been the happiest day for our children, 500 children called Childline, which should be available to assist them, and did not get an answer is a bad reflection on us as a whole.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the budget today will test the Government&rsquo;s economic and fiscal skills in taking us back from the precipice, as Senator Fitzgerald described it, it will also test its set of values, what it truly values in our society and what it means to be Irish.  In recent weeks, during our flooding crisis, we saw families and communities coming together to protect those rendered very vulnerable over a number of days.  Despite this, the people at the helm of this country seem to have lost their value system.  I ask that today we see a return to a situation whereby we value the most vulnerable and, despite the difficulties we find ourselves in, we afford them the protection they deserve.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to bring the Minister into the House.  We have been working on this issue in Kenmare since 1976, when the extra 12 beds were first announced and announcements were made in 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2008.  The importance of this hospital cannot be overstated in an ageing community where many people need long-term assistance and care to recover from illnesses.  I ask the Leader to arrange a monthly meeting between the HSE and the Kenmare community hospital group, led by Ms Una O&rsquo;Neill, to ensure the hospital will proceed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="272"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a day when we are all awaiting the budget with trepidation, we see a carbon tax is likely to be introduced.  We will have to see the format it will take.  It would be an important component of any package aimed at reducing our carbon emissions.  In that context, I note the Leader has scheduled a debate on Thursday on climate change.  Can the Leader tell the House when the Government Bill on climate change will be introduced?  When will it sign up to its commitment to ensure there will be a binding obligation on it and future Governments to ensure yearly reductions in carbon emissions.  As the House will know, No. 18 on the Order Paper is my Climate Protection Bill which would have imposed such binding obligations.  It is all very well having statements, but in a week when the Copenhagen talks are ongoing, we should know from the Leader when the Government Bill will be debated in this House.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate on a specific aspect of the Murphy report.  I know the debate on it is continuing today and I contributed to it last week, but I have been re-reading subsections of the report.  I have a particular concern about its criminal law implications.  We need a specific debate in the new year on that issue.  There has been a lot of talk about whether persons who knowingly concealed the incidence of crimes of sexual abuse could themselves be prosecuted for a crime.  Such people could include the bishops who were described as being guilty of wilful inaction or inexcusable negligence in the report.</P>
        <P>A view has been expressed that because misprision of felony was apparently abolished in 1997 it would be impossible to prosecute.  I have seen legal advice which would suggest otherwise.  I have also re-read the Murphy report&rsquo;s view on this which leaves open the possibility that persons could be prosecuted in the future for concealment of offences, many of which were not classified as felonies, but rather as misdemeanours, at the time.  I ask for an urgent debate on how existing criminal law, despite the 1997 Act, could be used to ensure persons who knowingly concealed the incidence of child sexual abuse within the church could be prosecuted.  There are ways of doing that.  Mr. Pearse Mehigan&rsquo;s article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday suggested there are ways to prosecute the bishops concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I too welcome the announcement regarding Kenmare hospital. Like the Shannon, it is not the first time it has been delivered.  I hope there is follow through on this occasion.  It is many years since I tabled an Adjournment matter on this issue in the House and I got a commitment.  I know Deputy Healy-Rae got commitments before.  With the Scarteens who have been mentioned, I have been campaigning on that matter since I entered this House in 1997.  Kenmare is located at the head of two vast peninsulas, serving half of Iveragh and practically all of Beara.  Upgrading of that hospital has been needed for years.  I hope there will be delivery this time because we have all been shouting for it for long enough.  The hospital in Kenmare is essential for that territory.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I take issue with colleagues, who in good faith claim there is not a case for reducing the excise duty on alcohol.  As an educator by profession and as a parent I am as concerned about alcohol problems as anyone else is.  Those problems need to be addressed on an ongoing basis.  However, we have a crisis along the Border with people going north to shop, which is threatening the entire retail trade.  Second and third generation family retail outlets are closing down; it is not just the new lessees.  It is a real crisis in all the Border towns.  I favour the suggestion in the media that the Government will reduce the excise duty on alcohol.  It is necessary to preserve the economy of the Border area.  While it is disgraceful and wrong, people are buying &euro;300 worth of alcohol at a time in the North.  They are buying other goods because they are there to buy the alcohol.  The issue needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposed carbon tax threatens to put petrol stations all along the Border out of action.  There is a crisis in the economy of all the Border counties, which is particularly noticeable in Cavan-Monaghan.  With the best of intent people are talking about the alcohol issue, which is <Col N="273"/>an important issue that needs to be addressed.  However, this is not the way to deal with it.  We need to preserve the economy and stop people going north to buy the alcohol, which they are going to get anyway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">More for Mr. Peter Robinson.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I take Senator Norris&rsquo;s point.  Cross-Border initiatives on dealing with alcohol should be taken.  That is something to which we should aspire.  However, we have a crisis today with young people losing jobs in retail businesses right along the Border.  It is very serious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the use and misuse of figures by the media and the misuse of figures by groups that are agitating.  In particular I refer to the wild claims of the Shell to Sea campaign that &euro;540 billion &mdash; no less &mdash; was being taken by Shell in gas from off the Irish coast.  It is amazing that 20% of the very same field was sold for &euro;100 million.  Somebody must be doing a very good deal or somebody is using wildly exaggerated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the only group.  Some groups claim that foreign fleets have taken &euro;200 billion worth of fish out of the Irish seas since we joined the EU.  It is also wildly exaggerated when &euro;8 billion is the correct figure.  A television programme in the past two days claimed that &euro;2 billion was being defrauded from the social welfare system without any proof whatsoever.  These figures will be used by people to misrepresent the situation, perhaps in the full knowledge that &euro;2 billion is not being defrauded.  There are questions to be asked on these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mary White in what she said about suicide, especially as it refers to widows and widowers.  In my experience that group is very vulnerable.  There are many examples of what might happen if appropriate action is not taken by relatives and concerned members of the community, especially neighbours.  A visit to those people at this time of year or at any time of year is of particular benefit.</P>
        <P>I wish the people of Kenmare and Kerry in general the very best of luck.  If they get their hospital I will not begrudge it to them.  However, I am already on record in this House as saying I am far from happy with the manner in which the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar is being treated.  The people of Mullingar and those in the rest of Westmeath and Longford will not take it lying down.</P>

        <P>We have all heard talk of reform of this House, the D&aacute;il, the public service and so on.  The public service is being demonised by a number of people both inside and outside these Houses.  One would swear on a Mass book that they were the cause of all the social and economic ills we have.  The best people in the country are in this House, on local authorities and VECs.  What has been said is not fair.  They will be the first people to agree that we need reform but they are not the villains of the piece and deserve respect.  Many people, young and not so young, in the public service have very serious responsibilities.  I hope that in delivering his Budget Statement, the Minister will take cognisance of that.</P>

	<P>I join my constituency colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, in welcoming today&rsquo;s media reports that the Government is considering reducing excise duty on alcohol.  I endorse everything the Senator has said on alcoholism and the problems faced by many people and more certainly needs to be done to address this issue.  He and I know people who are in serious business trouble as a result of people going north of the Border from Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim to buy drink because it is substantially cheaper than it is in the Republic.  While they are up there purchasing their drink they also do the rest of their shopping.  I welcome the reports that excise duty is to be tackled and reduced in the budget.</P>
        <P>Car VRT also needs to be addressed as it has seriously damaged the motor industry not only in <?oasys _dc28- ?>Cavan, Monaghan and other Border counties, but throughout the twenty-six Counties.  People are able to go north, purchase a brand new vehicle, bring it in here quite legally and pay less than they would pay here in the Republic.  That is another area I would like to see addressed.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On debating the Ryan and Murphy reports, as the weeks go along there will be no difficulty in allocating time to allow colleagues to give further comment.  In particular, I accept Senator Bacik&rsquo;s point that she raised on re-reading the report which is a massive report.  One of the great strengths of the House is that we will be able to allocate the time to revisit the report and perhaps enlighten the Government on the concerns of Members.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Prendergast, Coffey and Bradford all expressed their concerns and views on today&rsquo;s budget.  I also hope that today senior citizens and those people who have made immense contributions down through the years are considered, even though it will possibly be the toughest budget in the history of the State.  Only a few years ago, children&rsquo;s allowance was only &euro;34 a month.  Now five years later, child benefit is &euro;166.  It was great to see that happening when there was buoyancy in the economy.  We need to put the figures into perspective.  The Government cared for those who are marginalised and particularly the children &mdash; the next generation &mdash; who will become the men and women who will enhance the country and take it along from the point up to which we have played our part.  The thought has crossed my mind in the last few days that if there had been a change of Government in the last general election, we would probably be having another general election now because the responsibilities the Government is taking on and the tasks it must carry out involve much courage and expertise.</P>

        <P>Senator Prendergast spoke about farm incomes and highlighted the difficulties being experienced by the farming community.  We all know the tremendous contribution those in agriculture have made.  There is an old saying in rural Ireland: &ldquo;If the farmers are going bad, the country is going bad.&rdquo;  That is true.  We have an obligation to farmers; political parties of all persuasions have done everything possible to help the farming community.

	<P>The Senator is heading that way and will appreciate his time in the Seanad when he gets there.</P>
        <P>With regard to the value of Mullingar hospital, I share Senator Glynn&rsquo;s view that as Oireachtas Members we would not be worth our salt if we were not supporting the consultants in one of the best and most efficient hospitals in the country.  The administrator, Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan, deserves a gold medal for what he is doing and all his encouragement, help and assistance.  The Minister must recognise the achievements of the hospital and the commitment she gave in this Chamber that hospitals which come up to the mark will be rewarded.  We are all in agreement in that regard and I intend to remind the Minister of this commitment.  In fairness, she has been forthcoming in her support of the hospital.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, Buttimer, Regan, O&rsquo;Reilly and Wilson expressed serious concerns about trading along the Border which presents a serious challenge.  Not only is excise duty being lost, so also are large amounts of VAT.  Alcohol should be consumed in moderation.  As a Pioneer, I can fully understand people enjoying their evening out, but it is the abuse of alcohol on which we are in agreement on all sides of the House.  Be that as it may, small businesses and everyone involved in the retail sector within many miles of the Border &mdash; we are not talking only about counties Westmeath, Leitrim, Longford and Cavan &mdash; are concerned about the issue.  As two Ulster Senators have pointed out today, it is a serious challenge, but from what we see in dispatches in the media, the Minister is responding.  We will discuss the issue again, possibly tomorrow morning, but I accept the views of Senators expressed today.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry spoke about the budget and those who were less well off and on the margins of society.  I fully agree with him.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan and MacSharry mentioned social welfare fraud.  Those unfortunate enough to be entitled to receive social welfare know and appreciate the importance of this small contribution.  I speak with the vast knowledge of experience gained in this regard.  PPS cards with photographs should be introduced.</P>

	<P>Senator Hannigan spoke about his meeting with the First Minister of Northern Ireland, at which he discussed various issues.  The Senator indicates that &euro;5 billion worth of property taken over by NAMA is in the North.  This is a matter on which we can have a debate in the House.  It is a challenge for NAMA &mdash; perhaps, in one way, an advantage &mdash; that properties outside the State may be of higher value than those within it.  We will discuss NAMA and its operations on a monthly basis when we come back after the Christmas break.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>Senators Mary White and Glynn spoke about the problem of suicide.  Senator White who has been a champion of this issue in the House has mentioned the 10,000 people who are widowed every year.  I had not realised the number was so large.  As Senator Glynn who has much expertise in this area pointed out, we should discuss the matter in the House.  It has been highlighted by the two Senators as we approach Christmas.  We should all care for those who have been bereaved this year and last year and consider visiting them over the Christmas period.  As Senator Cannon said, the recent flooding has shown us that community spirit is still alive and well in Ireland.  Certainly, we should bear in mind at Christmas time what Senators Mary White and Glynn have stated.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer, Glynn and Bradford raised Seanad reform.  I am intent on making progress in this area early in February.  We will see what we can do to make the House more relevant and how the necessary reforms will start to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon raised the issue of the ISPCC, domestic violence and the 500 children who called the helpline on Christmas Day last year and had no-one to answer.  This deserves a full debate here in the House and I have no difficulty in providing time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik asked after the climate change Bill.  I certainly can inquire when that is due in the House but I am sure that the debate and the deliberations taking place in Copenhagen this week will be taken into account in that Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin outlined to the House issues of gas, fish stocks and misrepresentation in costs.  It is a serious issue where research has not been thoroughly investigated before it is published.  I certainly will pass his views on to the relevant Minister after the Order of Business.</P>

    <Title>Report by Commission of Investigation into Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin: Statements (Resumed). </Title>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The findings of the commission of investigation into the handling by church and State authorities of allegations and suspicions of child abuse against clerics of the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin were met with revulsion and horror.  The Murphy report spelt out that &ldquo;a systemic, calculated perversion of power and trust was visited on helpless and innocent children in the archdiocese over a 30 year period&rdquo;, according to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, when he spoke here in this Chamber.  He stated, &ldquo;it is a matter of profound regret that the tradition of deference which so many people showed to their church was, in so far as child abuse was concerned, entirely misplaced and had the effect of further abusing the victims&rdquo;. The Minister stated that when he received the report in July last, he immediately sent it to the Garda Commissioner.  He added:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have discussed it frequently with the ... Commissioner.  It is clear from my contacts with him that neither he nor his force will rest until everything possible is done to ensure the perpetrators of this awful abuse pay for their crimes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What stands out from this report is the failure of the Catholic Church to face up to, and deal in a proper and responsible way with, the serious and potentially criminal actions of its clergy.  In every country where similar abuse has been identified, the church responded in a similarly defensive fashion.  There has been no evidence of any country where the Catholic Church dealt with the allegations openly.  The Vatican state oversees all of this and it has failed completely <Col N="279"/>to handle the crimes committed by its members in Ireland and other countries.  The Vatican and the papal nuncio to Ireland failed totally.</P>
        <P>Speaking as a Christian, the failure of the church to put the welfare of the children before the perpetrators shows no reflection on the teaching of Christ, no more than if the Gospels did not exist.  It is a mark of profound regret that the traditional deference which so many people showed to the Catholic Church was not only misplaced but, in fact, facilitated the abuse of innocent children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House.  He has a critical role in the issues that arise from the Ryan and Murphy reports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ms Justice Murphy has done an excellent job.  In fact, I would like to quote so much from this report, but I do not have time to do so today.  Suffice it to say that the clarity with which the report speaks and with which it draws back the curtain on church practices is extraordinary and outstanding.  It is quite difficult at times to believe what one is reading about what happened.</P>
        <P>It also provides a stark reminder of the raw pain, hurt, anguish and degradation experienced by children subjected to child clerical abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin.  It is quite clear we need an audit in other dioceses as well, and perhaps the Minister of State could respond to that.  I am concerned that only recently this House discussed the HSE&rsquo;s attempt to get an audit done and the inadequate answers it got at that time.  I understand the Minister of State and the HSE have taken this up and I would like a briefing to the House on that.</P>
        <P>The report exposes the utter failure of both church and State to protect children and to investigate complaints.  It reveals how priests engaged in clerical child abuse, and how they were protected and the children involved exploited.  One can only imagine the terror, pain and hurt of the victims &mdash; the children &mdash; and their families when they sought to get the truth, thought they were going to the authorities in the church who would deal with their complaint, and were not listened to.  It was abuse all over again.  One must give great credit to those who persevered and ensured that the truth eventually came out.</P>
        <P>What is staggering in the report is the systematic strategy by the church leadership to protect the institution at any price.  The editorial in<i> The Irish Times</i> today puts it clearly.  It is an extraordinary editorial when one sees what it states: &ldquo;That culture of silence, denial and the protection of financial assets was instituted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under papal authority.&rdquo;  It goes on to speak of &ldquo;medieval-style structures&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It also comments on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s &ldquo;painfully deferential statement&rdquo;.  People in the country are concerned, and it is another matter to which the Minister of State might like to respond.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement was seen as deferential, in contrast to the way the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in this House dealt with the issues that arise from the report.  That is of concern.</P>
        <P>It is quite clear from the report that priests were moved from parish to parish, from places where they had damaged children to new places where children were easy prey.  I could quote from the report where priests went from one area to another, for example, where a priest was moved in to work in a convent and the nuns were not told about his background, and likewise in various parishes.  It is scathing in its description of how complaints were ignored, overlooked or dismissed, how a deliberate blind eye was turned and obscure mind games were used when victims sought the simple truth about these crimes of the most heinous nature.</P><Col N="280"/>
        <P Just="Left">Often the State did not know, except at times the Garda appeared to have been involved.  There was a conclusion, however, of which I will speak.  People went to the church because they thought their issues would be dealt with there.  It was really a mark of their faith that that was where they went.</P>
        <P>It is quite clear from the report that the abuse was not exceptional and it did not take church authorities by surprise.  The church actually knew, but far from protecting the most vulnerable, it suffered the little children to face repeated and vile abuse by people serving in its name.  That is there for all to see.  It is clear.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The church also went about developing strategies which involved insuring against a known problem, denying the problem and its extent, and protecting abusers.  In doing all this, as I stated, it was abusing the victims once again.  When one has been victimised, the worst that can happen is that one is re-victimised and has that experience again, and that is what happened.  That is why the report is scathing of the church authorities, but also of the State and its agencies.  It says that the actions of garda&iacute; involved in investigating the case of one serial clerical sex abuser in the 1980s were &ldquo;shocking&rdquo;.  It accuses garda&iacute; of connivance with the church in stifling one complaint, failing to investigate another, and allowing a priest under investigation to leave the country.  This is quite extraordinary.</P>
        <P>I welcome the response of the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, and I acknowledge the changes in Garda practice which we have seen since the 1990s.  The situation must be kept under review, however, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said in this House last week.  While all of this makes for depressing reading, it is good that the truth has come out.</P>
        <P>Where do we go from here?  It is clear that the days of a deferential State are over.  There is just one legal framework in this country, that of the State.  Canon law can never again be set as an alternative or, as seems to have been the case in many respects, a predominant law.  Nor should diplomatic protocol be used.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to go into the details of what the Minister said about the contact between Departments, but why was the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform not more proactive in ensuring that the commission got the material it needed?  Something was missing in that response.  They passed the material on, but given the seriousness of what was under discussion, there was room for a more proactive approach by the Department.  I note the Minister said it was dealt with at official and not political level, but a question mark remains.  I was not impressed by the way in which the Taoiseach dealt with this question when it arose.  In many ways, it was about playing mind games and refusing to understand what was going on.</P>
        <P>There is no question but that people&rsquo;s trust in the church has been very damaged.  The extraordinary article by Vincent Twomey in <i>The Irish Times </i>today makes for incredibly sober reading.  He states:</P>
        <P LI="1">These criminals have caused profound damage to the numerous laity, men and women, who have remained &ldquo;faithful&rdquo;, despite the scandals and the failure of the Irish church to nourish them, their children and grandchildren on the riches of this faith.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He also talks about the incompetence of the way in which the church is organised here.  The article makes for sober reading from the professor emeritus of moral theology at St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Maynooth.</P>
        <P>The church&rsquo;s failings have been shown very clearly, but what is our role as parliamentarians?  That is the key question.  What is the role of the State in relation to the church?  We are <Col N="281"/>definitely at a crossroads concerning church-State relations.  We need to be thorough and open in exploring whether a whole new set of arrangements would best serve the interests of children in future.  We must undertake an audit of current church-State relations, whether they concern health, education or the protection of children.  We need such an audit, as well as an open and proper debate.  These issues must be dealt with, including whether to establish an education forum and whether the church&rsquo;s role in various hospitals is still appropriate.  That discussion is for another day, but I just wanted to put down a marker on it.  We need a full assessment at this point, however.</P>
        <P>For decades the church has had a level of influence which must now be questioned in a republic that sets out to serve the people and protect our children.  Much good work has been done, but when one reads about these horrors it undermines some of that work.  There is no question about that.  People are focusing on what is in these reports and it is clear that for too long parliamentarians bent the knee to church leaders.</P>
        <P>We need to hear from the Minister concerning the child protection measures that must be put in place.   In the forthcoming budget, will we be prepared to put in place the financial structures required to implement the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the Ryan report?  Are we willing to prioritise this issue above and beyond all others, and in spite of the fiscal challenges we face?  I imagine the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is putting that question to his Cabinet colleagues.  It is a very real one.  Every day we hear of gaps in child protection services, including the independent inspections of residential care facilities where children with physical and intellectual disabilities are placed.  When will that change?  Does the Minister of State have the resources to deal with that now?  If not, when will he have them?  We should have independent reviews of the deaths of children in State care, but does the Minister of State have the resources?  When will it start?</P>
        <P Just="Left">When will the resources be put in place to prevent children from being put into adult psychiatric hospitals for treatment of mental health issues?  More children are being placed in such hospitals this year than last year, but how can that happen?  How can we put more children with mental health difficulties into adult psychiatric wards for treatment than in 2008, despite all the talk about the Murphy report?  How can we stand by?</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I saw the Minister of State replying to questions in the D&aacute;il about missing children.  I did a report on this matter and interviewed some of the children concerned.  The isolation and despair they felt was extraordinary.  One can only imagine the terror of children who go missing into the sex industry and what they must experience.  They receive a different level of care to Irish children in care.  That must stop.  They must get the same level of care.  We must protect these children.  It is not an easy issue.  I note the Minister of State said that many of these children go back to their families.  I hope that is correct, but I suspect that many of the children disappear into dangerous situations.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s report on the Ryan report contains 99 recommendations.  We need a further debate, however, on the implementation of that report.  The aspirations and wording of the Minister of State&rsquo;s report are very good, but are they backed up by resources and personnel?  Which recommendations have been implemented to date?  Have the timeframes been adhered to?  These are really serious questions.  I have gone through that report, which is a good check-list of what needs to be done.  However, we must have feedback on it from the Minister of State as to whether what needs to be done is actually being done and if the resources are there.  The Ombudsman for Children is the only independent office in the country solely charged with listening to children and highlighting their concerns.  It should not be downgraded or have its resources cut in today&rsquo;s budget.  I hope it will not happen because that office has an important role to play.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>If the Minister of State gets the resources and is in a position to deal with the range of issues I have outlined, the Government will give a strong message that it is not just about words.  It is not just about the shock and condemnation that everybody feels when they read the Murphy and Ryan reports.  If the Minister of State gets these resources to implement a programme to deal with the issues I have outlined, he will give a strong signal that children matter.  I look forward to hearing his response to the many outstanding issues regarding child protection.  On a simple level, however, his response is all about the aspiration to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  Quite clearly, this task falls to the State in terms of setting standards and assurances.  We must never again hand the care and protection of our youngest citizens over to a body that is not accountable.  This is clearly what happened and untold damage was done as a result.  We must examine the Murphy and Ryan reports together.  We must also look at the 1,000 victims who went to the Ryan commission.  When one reads the Murphy report one can see even more clearly what they were up against and how incredibly difficult it must have been for them when they were ignored.  We can never again turn a blind eye.</P>
        <P>Many cases of abuse are being reported to the HSE, but I am afraid that with long waiting lists for child and family centres &mdash; some of them are closed around the country &mdash; we are still turning families away.  We are not meeting their needs or responding to the crisis affecting many families today.  I wish the Minister of State well.  He has a huge task and I hope he gets the resources to deal with it.  We cannot be complacent, either about the issues in the report, or the State&rsquo;s ability to respond to children and families in trouble today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  He is doing good work, and I note how quickly he read himself into his brief.  Senator Fitzgerald and I sit on the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and of all<?oasys _jy ?>Ministers, he certainly plays his part.  That has to be acknowledged and is very much appreciated. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Where does one start when it comes to debating something like the Murphy report?  I have taken it up in the past ten days and I can read only a couple of pages before putting it down again because my mind is not able to take it all in.  I pick it up a few days later and have to read over what I have already looked at, because it is so unbelievable.  Archbishop Diarmuid Martin was right in coming out six or eight months ago and flagging this as one of the worst reports in the history of the State.  When somebody of his calibre says that, it is time to batten down the hatches, in the knowledge that this is to be an appalling horrific report.  Even the archbishop&rsquo;s statement did not prepare politicians, however, for what they would read.  Other media commentators have said the same in recent days.  One opens and closes the report, reopens and closes it again.  A report of this size will take several weeks, if not months, for people to read and come to terms with.</P>
        <P>With Murphy, Ryan, Ferns and perhaps even more reports to come, I would consider this to be Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;gulag&rdquo; and complete shame on us, the people of the State of Ireland for allowing this to happen.  It is an appalling situation.  I do not know Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, but people who do say what a good man he is.  I have no doubt he is a good man and is doing the best he can, with a terrible situation, to try and put it right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot understand, however, since he knew the enormity of this report and allowed it to be published and launched, and yet nothing has been put in place.  I speak of the resignations that I hope are pending, of some of the bishops named in the report.  I heard Archbishop Diarmuid Martin on the Sunday after the report was launched saying he did not have the authority to ask Bishop Murray in Limerick to resign or to dismiss him.  A couple of days later, however, when public opinion was at its height and people were so enraged at what they were <Col N="283"/>hearing and reading, Archbishop Martin wrote to the bishops named in the report and asked them to consider their positions, to look into their consciences and do the right thing by the church and the children who were abused.  I should like to ask the archbishop why he could not have done this before the report was launched.  Why was it not arranged in order that we would have seen those resignations in the very hour the report was published?  I hope the bishops involved will resign, but it seems they have waited to be pushed and it is somewhat too late for them to go now.</P>
        <P>Since I was a child, I have always heard, &ldquo;We are the brethren of the church&rdquo;.  Was it not convenient for the clergy to let us know that we were the church, when they were looking for support, donations or recruits among families who gave sons and daughters to the religious life?  Families have been wiped out by the abuse of children by clerics in this country.  It is severe to term this Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;gulag&rdquo;, but so horrific is the situation that this is how I see it.  Directly behind the Houses of the Oireachtas is the Dr. Dermot Ryan Park.  I believe it was owned by the church a long time ago, and at some stage there were plans for a cathedral to be built there.  The church handed it over to the council many years ago, and out of gratitude it was called the Dr. Dermot Ryan Park.  Dr. Dermot Ryan was one of the archbishops named in the report.  I suggest to the Minster of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, that the park should now be renamed and the name, Dr. Dermot Ryan expunged from it.  Let it be called anything, &ldquo;the Children&rsquo;s Park&rdquo;, or whatever, but the late Dr. Ryan&rsquo;s name should no longer be associated with the park, because he does not deserve the honour.</P>
        <P>The heroes in all of this are people such as Andrew Madden, Maria Collins and Colm O&rsquo;Gorman who were brave enough to stand up.  When they were disbelieved, they stood up and continued to speak out.  On the incarceration and treatment of children, where do we begin to put that right for those who have been at the receiving end?  I recall when I was a child and we still hear the church intone, &ldquo;Suffer little children to come unto me&rdquo; and the fact that Our Lord loved children and there was always a special place in the church for young children.  Again, shame on us all, because we are all residents of this State where the most appalling cover-up was carried out by the church.  It had to be aided and abetted by various arms of the State.  That is why I conjure pictures of the &ldquo;gulag&rdquo; in my mind and am reminded of scenes from the former USSR.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Somebody talked on the radio this morning about the footage that accompanied the Murphy report.  One saw a male in clerical garb going into a large dormitory, getting a young boy out of bed, the child kneeling down at the side of the bed, ostensibly to pray.  Instead of joining his hands in prayer, however, he puts his entire face into his hands.  Is the poor child saying, in effect, &ldquo;Oh no, not another day of this terrible abuse.&rdquo;</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Nobody is above the civil law and Canon Law cannot take a superior place over the law of the land.  The Seanad is the right place to say that I hear the church leaders saying that Canon Law is not superior to the civil law, but I am not sure they believe this.  I do not believe they see civil law as being superior to Canon Law.  Going back 12 or 14 years to the terrible scandal for the church when it was revealed that Bishop Eamonn Casey in Galway had fathered a child, I recall the night Annie Murphy was on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; with Gay Byrne, and she was given an awful rough time.  I was shocked, as a young woman living in Ireland, that anybody should be treated like that.  Gay Byrne gave her a hard time and the audience gave her an even harder one, as they jeered and mocked her.   She was brave enough to admit her child had been fathered by a bishop of the Irish Catholic Church.  While I have sympathy for her, I have greater sympathy for Bishop Eamon Casey.  Archbishop Martin said he had no authority to seek the resignation of bishops identified in this report, yet the Irish church saw fit to banish a man like Bishop Eamon Casey for doing what comes natural to any human being, in terms of his being with a woman, to the furthest end of South America. <Col N="284"/> I cannot recall the place to which they sent him.  The church covers up and buries under the carpet what is natural and tries to pass off as being all right that which is unnatural by sending to different parishes clerics who have already violated complete families and communities.</P>
        <P>On the Thursday and Friday following publication of the report every radio programme conducted an interview with a victim of the abuse.  While these people found it so hard to articulate their story they did so in a manner which allowed the listener to understand what had happened to them.  It was obvious these were people with broken lives who were finding it hard to stay in relationships, to maintain work or even live and that many had drug and alcohol problems.  They had been left to suffer while the church got away with covering up the abuse.</P>
        <P>Perhaps now is the time open up the debate on church and State and the involvement of the church in our schools and hospitals in particular.  The State needs to take a proactive approach here.  It is wrong that we, the taxpayer, pay for our schools yet we have no responsibility in terms of what happens to the children in those schools.  Such issues are dealt with by boards of management, the chairman of which is usually the local parish priest or the bishop of the diocese.  What can we expect when these are the people who are dealing with the complaints about the clerics?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I make the point that all clerics, priests and bishops are not bad.  It is for the good ones that we need to continue to support the church.  However, I find that very hard to do having read the Murphy report.  While the scale of the abuse was so bad there are no words to describe it, the scale of the cover-up is appalling and should never be allowed to happen again.  It is time to cut the strings between the church and State.  I look forward to the Minister of State implementing the recommendations of the Ryan report.  I believe when they are implemented Ireland will be a safer place for children.</P>
        <P>We all know children can be abused in their own homes.  We have seen evidence of such abuse often at the hands of their parents.  However, while those mothers and fathers have all been imprisoned, we have yet to see any of the clerics identified in the Murphy report imprisoned for the abuse and terrible pain inflicted by them on this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose I should not preface my remarks by saying I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this report because it is my wish that there was no such appalling situation to comment on.  So be it, we must deal with the report this afternoon. </P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the previous speaker.  I recall being in the Chair for Senator Feeney&rsquo;s contribution on the Ryan report, on which occasion she made an equally sincere and emotive presentation.  Senator Feeney has struck a fair balance in her presentation today.  I would summarise this report as Ireland&rsquo;s dark night of the soul.  It is a report which challenges us to acknowledge who and what we are as a society and people.  The report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin is to a degree almost an extension of the Ryan report.  We are now dealing with a society wherein, apparently, abuse of young children and young adults by men of the cloth and collar was widespread and endemic to a frightening degree.  Obviously, as has been and must be stated by all speakers our first thoughts must be with the victims, some of whom have unfortunately passed away, some the victims of suicide.  To the remaining victims, including those not yet classified, we must offer more than words of consolation.  We must offer them every possible support, including financial and emotional support, and must above all put in place a structure and system of authority and regulation which will assure them that what was imposed upon them, the abuse and suffering they experienced, will never again be experienced by another generation of Irish children.  The greatest monument to current and past <Col N="285"/>victims would be an absolute assurance that this will not be permitted to happen again.  The victims must be to the forefront of our concern.</P>
        <P>We must also recognise that the Irish Catholic laity, of which there are hundreds of thousands, are deeply upset and disturbed by this report.  Very few countries across the globe, with the exception of a few countries in South America, have the same connect between church and State as has Ireland.  While for generations there has been a unique relationship between families and priests in this State, certainties have been removed and doubt has been cast resulting in great suffering among ordinary Catholics.  What they have read and know to be true is deeply and profoundly upsetting.  We must empathise with those people who feel like the rug has been pulled from under them and who are genuinely upset for their church.  The church is the people not priests, bishops or the Pope and the vast majority of people here who have read this report are gravely upset at what transpired.</P>
        <P>We must also recognise the upset caused to the vast majority of clergy across the country, including priests and nuns, who have committed themselves to full Christian living in its broadest and finest tradition.  They are gravely pained by the fact that many of their clerical colleagues were engaged in the shocking abuse of children.  It is important to officially recognise that the vast majority of clergy here, not just at present but through the generations, have done their job professionally and openly.  They, too, are very wounded by this report and the behaviour of their colleagues.</P>
        <P>Where do we go from here?  There have been numerous calls for the bishops who were found wanting in carrying out their duties and who failed to investigate and report to do the necessary and honourable thing of resigning their posts.  It probably will not make a huge difference to victims at this stage but it would be an indication that lessons are being learned.  If resignation of a bishop or bishops would help in that regard that must happen.  Straws in the wind appear to suggest that some of the Catholic bishops will resign.  The business of the Catholic Church is its affair.  It is not an establishment church whereby bishops are appointed by the parliament.  We neither hire nor fire, and we cannot force a bishop to resign his position.  However, such a resignation would be a positive and strong signal and a tiny step in the right direction, and, perhaps, a small building block for the future.  We will await developments.</P>
        <P>The broader questions we must face are about where society goes from here, how it plans for the future and the position of the great debate about church and State.  This country&rsquo;s people come from a tradition of great deference, not just to the church but to the State, schools and all forms of authority.  Generations of Irish people have written verse and sung songs about being downtrodden by the British, but we really are downtrodden by ourselves.  We have always deferred to authority in a way that is quite unique among western European nations.  It is time for Irish people as a society to lose the chains of deference and walk a little taller.  That would be a positive step in trying to create a new relationship between church and State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was reading through the Constitution last night in preparation for a debate in the House on the Criminal Procedure Bill.  The Constitution was carried in 1937 by approximately 685,000 votes to 526,000.  It is supposed to contain the guidelines for how we live as a society, with rules and regulations to ensure that neither rank nor collar will put anybody above the law.  Are we attempting to build a new republic and new society in which everybody has their role and appropriate place of influence?  There have been many issues with the Constitution; there have been many amendments to it and more are projected for the future.  It would be helpful if the Minister and his colleagues commenced preparation for a new constitution.  The 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising is only seven years away.  As a maturing republic, perhaps we need a new constitution in which we can clearly outline our priorities and the parameters of law and behaviour.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P Just="Left">We regularly speak about the need to rebalance the relationship between church and State and the need to examine the education sector, in terms of its ownership and direction.  In the course of a debate on a new constitution we could deal with these matters in a sensitive and inclusive fashion.  The issue of church control of education has been centre stage in national debate.  It was understandable that in the immediate aftermath of publication of the Murphy report there was great demand that church control of education be ended and that the system of patronage be amended.  We must move carefully and cautiously.  The vast majority of people here would still prefer their children to be educated in Catholic schools or within the Catholic ethos.  A balance must try to ensure there is still such a possibility, while, on the other hand, the ownership, control or direction of the educational sphere be more democratic and Department-led.  When shocking reports such as this are produced there is always a great danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.  We must be cautious in planning for the future.  For that reason I favour slightly longer term planning for Ireland as a society via reflection on the need for some major constitutional initiatives, probably leading to a new constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for attending this debate and, most importantly, Judge Murphy, her officials and staff for presenting us with this appalling vista, as it must be described.  I hope, however, it is a document from which Irish society will learn huge lessons.  Inevitably, in the course of forthcoming months and years reports will be produced on sadly similar behaviour in other dioceses.  It is necessary for society that all this is brought out into the open in a transparent fashion.  I hope it will assist the beginning of the healing process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My words are very inadequate, as all words will be under the circumstances.  Our thoughts must be with the victims and our thanks go to those courageous people who led the campaign to highlight the plight of victims.  We must now move beyond word to deed.  Major changes are required across all strata of Irish society to bring help and healing to a generation who lost their youth and in some cases, sadly, their lives.  If we are to make a difference, we must plan ahead.  We will revert to this report again.  I hope we will learn from it and bring healing to the thousands of victims, seen and unseen, heard and unheard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Bradford said, this report portrays an appalling vista.  I join colleagues who have complimented the Minister on the compassion he has shown in his office.  If there is any method by which the recommendations in this and the Ryan reports can be implemented, the Minister could go down in history as one of the people who put this State on the right track.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had a conversation with a woman a couple of years ago, before either of these reports was produced.  She was an alternative therapist and I recall her telling me that Ireland has a great deal of healing to do.  I continuously think of her remark.  I believe she was from Australia; she was not from Ireland.  There was a great deal in what she said.  A number of different organisations in our society have had abusers within those organisations.  The church has been huge in that context in terms of the absolute abuse and appalling behaviour that occurred and the number of paedophiles it contained.  It appears that people tended to go into the church to hide, possibly because of the deference this State paid to Canon Law.  They knew that there was such deference.  We need to get behind the mindset of those who did this.  We need the church to tell us why it reckons paedophiles and abusers gravitated towards its culture and believed they could hide within it.  If we are to move on as a people, the church must answer these questions.</P>
        <P>As politicians and parents, with everyone else in society we must ask why we allowed this situation to continue.  People claim they did not know, but I do not believe them.  When I was 15 years of age, I attended a girls&rsquo; secondary school beside St. Peter&rsquo;s college in Wexford.  Some <Col N="287"/>of the chaps with whom I hung around used to say someone or other was a Fr. Collins&rsquo; boy.  The paedophile ring in the college was cited in the Ferns Report.  Deep down, we knew about all of this, although we might not have had the courage to face it for the past 30 or 40 years.  I agree that we need resignations and that bishops&rsquo; heads need to roll.  This would not be an answer, but it would be a small step that could be taken to show some sorrow on the part of the church, as Senator Bradford mentioned.</P>
        <P>Merely discussing the issue, however, will get us nowhere.  Let us not lose track of where we are.  We need to put systems in place to ensure this situation will not recur.  Whether we are discussing the church, the GAA or, given the number of incidents of child abuse involving coaches at swimming pools, every parent must be able to say his or her child is safe in an organisation.  The State has not reacted to this necessity, which is the message we must take from the report.  The stories it contains are appalling and difficult to read.  Senator Feeney stated she had to put it down several times.  Like me, she probably has not read all of it because it is far too upsetting.  However, we must face up to the fact that it all occurred.</P>
        <P>In the light of the Ryan, Ferns and Murphy reports and the issues about which we have heard concerning the Magdalene laundries, we must deal with the issues raised and put systems in place.  The Minister of State should be a Minister, for which I have been calling for a long time and I know I am right.  If he is to deal with this matter properly, he must have a seat at the Cabinet.  There are cross-departmental and cross-unit responses required from the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children, the HSE and the Garda, all of which are involved in the protection of children.  If we cannot protect them, I do not know where we are going.</P>
        <P>Yesterday in Wexford I attended a presentation by FAB, a domestic violence group, as part of the 16-day campaign against domestic violence and abuse.  A poem was read out, although I do not have it to hand.  It was written by a child of approximately ten or 12 years who describes the hands of a male as being creative and brilliant but asks why the man uses them violently against the child instead of putting them to best use.  I was struck by this poem.  Another was written by a little girl who was being minded by her granny.  I ask for the Chair&rsquo;s forgiveness.  I am upset about this issue because I recently had a baby.  That little girl asked where her mother had gone but received no answers.</P>
        <P>For some time I have been stating we have enough reports.  While I commend Judge Yvonne Murphy and the commission for going through this difficult process and recognise that we need information, there has been a great deal of debate on the questions of church and State and whether we need to leave the church behind and rewrite the Constitution.  These questions are relevant, but if the State is not willing or able to react appropriately by putting systems in place to avoid a recurrence, we are doing nothing.</P>
        <P>I spoke to the principal of a small primary school in south-east Wexford who told me that she had reported three incidences of abuse to the HSE and the appropriate child care officer.  It was clear to her that the children concerned were upset and that something was wrong.  They may have been interviewed, but when she rang the HSE a couple of weeks later to find out whether anything had been done, she was told the case had been closed.  We do not have sufficient resources.  There is no point in those of us on this side of the House pretending that we are doing something about the overall issues involved when it is clear that we are not.  This is a significant issue.  We can build roads and schools, but none of it will make any difference if people are not safe and happy.  We must reverse the order in the way we do things and put procedures in place.  Children are too important to play politics with.</P>
        <P>Other forms of abuse include bullying, harassment and the many variations of domestic violence and abuse.  We have not revisited the issue of domestic violence since 1996, but even <Col N="288"/>that Act is paltry and has many holes.  Last night &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; ran a story on the report of the Law Reform Commission on rape and the small number of convictions achieved in that regard.  The damage the Irish do to one another is unbelievable, but our laws do not protect us from it.  We need to stop discussing the church.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although I cannot find the appropriate section, part of the commission&rsquo;s report states a firm, simple and unmistakable procedure for the promulgation of the law is a basic feature of every coherent legal system.  However, we do not have such a procedure.  The report goes on to state the absence of such a procedure within church law makes the latter difficult to access and its implementation and monitoring of compliance difficult.  The law is not being implemented.  People should be thrown in jail if they have abused others.  State law is superior to Canon Law.  The report provides examples to show the Garda had not faced up to the problem.</P>
        <P>Although we are debating issues of church and State, I have heard many examples where people reported domestic abuse to the Garda but were told that the Garda was not interested in getting involved in incidents in the family home because it did not want to delve into the issue.  That is why matters at Monageer went as far as they did, according to the relevant report.  There are many crimes committed against women and children in the family home because we are not reacting in the appropriate manner.</P>
        <P>It is an appalling vista, but I am amazed by people&rsquo;s surprise at what is contained in the report.  Everyone who has had a Catholic education, which means most of us, knew what was going on.  We have watched films such as &ldquo;The Butcher Boy&rdquo; and others on the Magdalene laundries.  The facts have been known.  Therefore, we need to change our mindset.  Some point out that the report only relates to a certain number of abusers and that there are good priests who do good work, just as there are good teachers, but equally there are teachers who abuse.  There are brilliant parents who go to the nth degree to ensure their children&rsquo;s safety and education and do not allow them to walk home from school anymore.  That we do not believe our children can walk on a path from A to B without being abducted or abused is a damning indictment of us as a people.  We are distrustful of each other, instead of keeping an eye out for one another.  Abuse occurred and is occurring, mostly in the family home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I could go on talking about this emotive issue.  The report is timely.  Yesterday I dealt with the case of an anorexic girl who had to go to Great Ormond Street Hospital because she could not get a bed elsewhere.  She is lucky that her parents have the money to pay for it.  The State does not provide beds for anorexic patients.  A couple of weeks ago I dealt with the case of a child who needed psychiatric help but was in a ward with older people dying from various diseases.  If he had been left there for very long, he might have a case against the State.  That will happen one day.</P>
        <P>District courts have no facilities to deal with the constant flow of cases from domestic violence and abuse of children and all such happenings.  We do not seem to have the compassion to deal with it.  Yes, all the things we are doing as a Government are very important but action on this is probably more important.  We must prioritise it after the budget which will get the economy back on track.  It is as important.  How many more lives will we allow to go down the tubes?  We can throw church members in jail if they are guilty.  We have laws and procedures to deal with that and those people should be dealt with.  If the arms of this State do not deal with them, we have a problem.</P>
        <P>As politicians, let us pledge this immediately.  Let the Minister of State pledge to the children of Ireland that this will never happen again and State procedures will be put in place that will be strong enough to ensure it does not happen again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The speeches this morning have been among the best I have heard in the House.  I say this as one who spent five years as a seminarian in the 1980s until 1990, as a regular Mass-goer and as one who has great faith and belief in God and religion.  The Murphy and Ryan reports leave a sense of anger, bewilderment and need for repentance by the church.   We are in Advent, a season of repentance and looking forward, of hope.  My hope is that as a result of the great work done by the Murphy commission &mdash; I pay tribute to Ms Justice Yvonne Murphy and the members of the commission &mdash; we will have a new church and a new order.  As Senator Bradford rightly said, no words of ours today in this Chamber will give redress to the victims.  At the forefront of all we say and do must be the victims who have had horrendous crimes inflicted upon them by trusted people.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">It is extraordinary that there was a veil of secrecy and, as the report stated, avoidance of telling the truth to avoid scandal and protect the reputation of the church and preserve its assets.  The preamble to the Constitution mentions seeking to promote the common good, &ldquo;with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established with other nations&rdquo;.  We achieved so much in that paragraph of the preamble but lost the fundamental point.  A fundamental break has occurred between the church and its people.  We need a new order.  We must create a new society and a new Ireland because the pillars of our society have cracked and crumbled.  The institutions of our State, through the bad works of politicians, have tarnished all of us, as politicians.  The church has been tarnished.  It behoves all of us, regardless of party politics, not only to try to, but to create, engineer and put in place a new Ireland, where, as Article 40 states, &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>What has happened is something none of us can even comprehend.  I know from talking to victims of abuse that we can never give them their lost lives back.  They have been imprisoned in a cell of hurt, anger and humiliation, not by themselves but by people they trusted.  Reading page 5 in Part 1 of the Murphy report, I found it extraordinary that there is a 2000-year history of biblical, papal and Holy See statements showing awareness of clerical child sex abuse.  I want to see us creating an Ireland of equals where the gospel message, &ldquo;Suffer little children to come unto me for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; is enacted.  The gospel I read and l listen to still has resonance for all of us but the practitioners have lost the faith and trust of the people, and rightly so.</P>
        <P>I make another point as a former seminarian.  I am glad the church has changed its formation policies and the way in which people are admitted to seminaries and trained.  The reality is that there are many good priests and nuns here who are doing and have done tremendous work.  I know from talking to friends from my class in the seminary, in Cork and other dioceses, that they are genuinely outraged at what has happened.  In our right sense of outrage we can lose sight of the fact that there are good people administering works in dioceses across the country today.  We must never forget that the church has broken its special relationship in this State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We hear about Canon Law which I studied.  We need to consider what the report states, namely, that Canon Law appears to have fallen into disuse and disrespect during the 20th century.  Ms Justice Murphy is right.  Bishops and archbishops of Dublin hid under the veil and protection of Canon Law when administration of justice to the victims was what was required.  If we cherish values and cherish each other as individuals, as Senator Bradford rightly said, it is time we had a new constitution that would reflect the new Ireland and the relationship between church and State, that would put in place the idea in a clear unambiguous manner that all of us have duties, responsibilities and roles and must live up to them.  It would be a very good exercise for the Joint Committee on the Constitution to consider creating a new constitution that would reflect the new Ireland, without diluting the role of each of us as citizens <Col N="290"/>and outline our obligation to live up to what we are meant to be &mdash; citizens equal before the law.  We have a responsibility to do this.</P>
        <P>Other Senators referred to the Murphy report being difficult reading.  If one reads both the Ryan and Murphy reports, the stories are human stories that make for very difficult reading.  However, we must never allow either this or the Ryan report to sit on the shelf.  We must never allow ourselves again be in a situation where such things can be allowed to happen.  These reports must be acted upon.  That is why it is important to move and take these reports as a movement for renewal: of the church in its relationship with its people and of the State towards renewal of its relationship and bond with the people.</P>
        <P>It is very easy to criticise bishops and some bishops should resign.  They were aloof and distant and did not act.  We can all tell stories of priests moved from parish to parish, sent to or brought back from the missions.  That was fundamentally wrong.  As the report states, the secrecy that tried to protect the institution of the church at the expense of children was wrong and must never be allowed to happen again.</P>
        <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, Vincent Twomey, Professor Emeritus of moral theology in Maynooth, has written an excellent article about the restructuring of the dioceses here.  We must examine seriously what Professor Twomey, who values people, states in his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning.</P>
        <P>The victims in this report deserve not just our apology or sorrow.  They deserve and require us to act collectively, and they need the bishops to put in place a system to ensure this does not happen again.  I hope this report, in its severity, will be the launching pad for a new Ireland where we can have a society of equals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to the Seanad to listen to the statements on this report.  I echo many of the points made by Senator Buttimer.  We are singing from the same hymn sheet on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know how to discuss this report.  I have scanned it.  I could not read it because the litany of abuse and cruelty in every chapter upset me greatly, particularly as this kind of abuse went on for a period from 1975 to 2004.  I cannot explain my feelings of disgust.  It is difficult to put into words the disgust felt by people.  People who do not have the report but read extracts in the daily newspapers have discussed it at the dinner table and in their local pub.  That discussion is taking place across the entire country.  This abuse was being perpetrated under our eyes and we did not see it.  How did that cover-up take place?  Four archbishops covered up the abuse.  They were arrogant because they had the cloth, and the cloth spoke louder than any words.  The message the church sent out in past years was that it had arrived.  The allegations were against 46 priests, and the State facilitated cover-up.  Successive Governments did not tackle it.  There should be no doubt about that.  The Garda listened to complaints but did not follow up on them.  The vast majority of the church turned a blind eye.</P>
        <P>We are at a crossroads in society.  Society must change.  The political institution has been criticised.  The church has been greatly criticised.  We are saying that society must change in the future.  We are a Republic and nobody is above the law, neither priests nor judges.  Everybody should be equal before the law.</P>
        <P>I grew up in a Catholic family household.  We had priests coming into our household who played cards frequently.  They were lovely people.  Two of my aunts are nuns.  They are beautiful people.  There are many good priests and nuns doing great social work and I have to speak for them as well.  I feel sorry that they find themselves, as do politicians, in a position where one bad apple appears to create all badness.  That is the position we are in currently in terms of <Col N="291"/>protecting the institution of the church.  I do not like using the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo;.  That word must change.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer said that we must change and we may bring in a new constitution.  We must go down that road because the relationship between the church and State has broken down.  They worked together for a long time and now we must consider where we go from here in terms of the church&rsquo;s role in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The priests got lazy.  They were lazy even in their sermons.  They did not give good sermons.  That is the reason the churchgoer moved away from the church.  There are people who are no longer &ldquo;churchy&rdquo;, so to speak.  They are interested in their religion but they are not interested in the church.  I do not know how we can rethink that concept in the future but we are at a crossroads and we must bring in the guidelines and legislation.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on putting that in motion, setting up the guidelines and ensuring the agencies involved with young people, be it the Health Service Executive, our schools, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and many of the other agencies, interact to ensure abuse will not happen again.</P>
        <P>It is horrific that we are here discussing this report.  I am not good at talking on this issue.  I am not able for this kind of debate.  It is too hurtful when I think of the good work church people do and then they are destroyed, so to speak, by these people who had power over young people.  I never want to have to talk on this topic again.  I was a teacher.  I hope that as teachers, priests, nuns and politicians we will do everything in our power to ensure that young people will never again be subjected to clerical sexual abuse.</P>
        <P>I have not much more to say on this but I hope procedures will be put in place to deal with it quickly.  I hope the audit the HSE put in motion last summer will bring about a change and that there will be no more cover-up.  It should all come out now.  I congratulate Archbishop Martin for saying this is the end of the road for the church of the past.  I only hope that the failure to deal with a problem will never happen again and legislation and statutory guidelines will be put in place to ensure that the garda&iacute; and teachers will know what to do in the future.  I hope also that parents will feel their children are being protected by the agents of the State in dealing with problems.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well in taking on board this legislation and these statutory guidelines to ensure we move to a different era and that the church, as an institution, will change to help people, and not only young people.  It has a role to play in society, not as priests in a lordly way, but as ordinary people with a vocation to help those in distress.  That is my wish for the future of the institution of the church.  I want to protect the good priests and the good nuns and tell them that they should continue doing their good work. They should tell the others to get away and that they do not need them in their church.  I ask the good priests to stay with us and fight their case to be part of the church of the future.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am appalled by the latest child abuse report, which relates to the sexual abuse of children by the clergy.  How many more reports are needed before the State starts to act resolutely?  The Ryan report on institutional abuse was published earlier this year.  We have not yet debated the implementation plan for that report.  Mandatory reporting of child abuse has still not been introduced.  Professionals should be protected when they make such reports.  The child protection guidelines have not yet been placed on a statutory footing.  I am sure children here are being abused today.  Terrible reports of abuse are emerging from the direct provision centres.  I refer to the trafficking of under age minors, and so on.  More reports like the Ryan and Murphy reports will have to be published if the State does not act resolutely.  The report before the House should have marked <Col N="292"/>the end of the line.  I would like to raise many serious issues about the Murphy report.  I wonder if I will get answers.  Will somebody respond at the end of the debate?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the legal status of the Murphy report as it stands?  Will priests who sexually abused children and those who covered up and facilitated such abuse by not acting be convicted as a result of this report?  What is the legal status of the report?  I am not convinced that it has a powerful legal status.  Page 44 of the report states that an archdiocese does not &ldquo;have to comply with any regulations or norms that are supervised by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement&rdquo;.  It explains that &ldquo;the precise legal status of the Archbishop of Dublin has yet to be determined by the Irish courts&rdquo;.  It suggests that according to legal advisers for the archbishop, it is by his own discretion that he can establish himself as &ldquo;a corporation sole&rdquo;.  The report explains that &ldquo;a corporation sole is a legal entity consisting of a single person, so that the corporation passes from one holder of a position to the next&rdquo;.  The haziness surrounding the legal position of the archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dublin makes it difficult for any legal action to be taken against the archdiocese or the archbishop regarding clerical child abuse.  The State has to act.  It seems fundamentally wrong that the archbishop and the bishops are responding to Canon Law but not to Irish law.  Our children will be at risk as long as that continues.</P>
        <P>Generations of children have been abused.  Page 45 of the report states that &ldquo;the supervisory role of an archbishop .... has been described by canon lawyers as &ldquo;very, very minor&rdquo;.&rdquo;  Is this a way out?  The Murphy report mentions that in the Ferns Report, there was &ldquo;no evidence&rdquo; of jurisdiction exercised over Bishop Herlihy or Bishop Comiskey.  It points out that &ldquo;every bishop is accountable directly to the Holy See&ldquo;.  The report states that according to Canon Law, &ldquo;each bishop has &ldquo;legislative, executive and judicial power&rdquo; over the church he is entrusted with.  By contrast <i>The Irish Times</i> today reported that &ldquo;Vatican analyst Giancarlo Zizola argued that however much Irish public opinion might struggle to understand the Vatican&rsquo;s &ldquo;silence&ldquo;, there was nothing surprising or scandalous about it&rdquo;.  It quotes Mr. Zizola as saying that &ldquo;when things like this happen in the local church, it is the local church which must assume responsibility&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there is a clear division of responsibility here &ndash; the pope is not the church&rdquo;.  The Vatican is saying it is up to the church in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The legal basis for the approach being taken by the Archbishop of Dublin is that he does not feel he needs to be responsible to Irish law.  We will continue to be in trouble if we do not take this matter into our hands.  My reading of the Murphy report is that everyone is passing the buck.  The Murphy report states that &ldquo;as long as he operates within the canon law, the bishop is free to [operate his church] as he sees fit&rdquo;.  That is very serious when one considers that the report also states that the actions of Bishop Murray of Limerick were &ldquo;inexcusable&rdquo;.  The commission agrees with the view expressed in the Ferns Report that a bishop&rsquo;s personality is reflected in how a diocese is run.  If bishops do not take responsibility, for example by taking action on behalf of victims and refusing to condemn the actions of the erring priests under their wing, what hope can victims have?</P>
        <P>We must protect the good people in the church.  Many bishops are named in this report, including the Bishop of Galway, Martin Drennan, who happens to be my local bishop.  Page 617 of the report states that in 2002 and 2003, &ldquo;Bishop Martin Drennan heard reports that Fr. Guido was indulging in inappropriate behaviour which gave rise to concern&rdquo;.  It continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Bishop Drennan recommended that he attend at the Granada Institute for treatment, but he adopted delaying tactics and the Granada Institute then declined to take him because of <Col N="293"/>his resistance.  In May 2003, he was sent for an initial assessment to a consultant psychologist.  During that assessment he admitted that he was homosexual.  [The psychologist] recommended that Fr Guido not have any contact with children or young people until the assessment had been completed and that he go abroad for treatment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am satisfied that Bishop Drennan took the necessary steps and made the necessary recommendations when it was brought to his attention that the behaviour of this priest was risky.  The priest in question had been acting out, for example by &ldquo;inviting young people to his house for meals and collecting teenagers from pubs late at night&rdquo;.  He had also &ldquo;taken young people to Lourdes and joined them for drinking parties&rdquo;.  While there may be more to it than I know, it seems that the bishop acted when he had received enough information.  I am satisfied that he took the necessary action.  Not every bishop who is named in the Murphy report should be wronged.  If there is evidence that a bishop did not take appropriate action, we have to act resolutely.  I am concerned about the legal haziness associated with this issue.  It seems that each bishop is accountable to himself.  The report makes it clear that it cannot be argued that these bishops were ignorant:</P>
        <P LI="1">Many of those in authority in the Archdiocese had civil law degrees or occupied prestigious appointments in third level education.  Monsignor Sheehy, Bishop O&rsquo;Mahony and Bishop Raymond Field were qualified barristers.  Bishop Kavanagh was Professor of Social Science in University College Dublin where both Archbishop Ryan and Archbishop Connell held high ranking academic posts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These men were very well informed &mdash; they knew the law of the State and the Canon Law.</P>
        <P>On the worrying issue of legal privilege, when Archbishop Connell met a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1995, a document containing the names of 17 alleged clerical abusers and the claimants in each case was submitted.  The commission is of the opinion that this submission was not adequate as it was not done in compliance with the standards of the framework document of 1996.  It is alleged that there were 28, rather than 17, abusers.  Just 17 abusers were disclosed.  When Archbishop Connell was questioned on the matter, his reply was that those priests who were not on the list had not been members of the clergy at the time.  It was a cop-out for him to say they &ldquo;had been laicised&rdquo;.  He justified this omission by saying he would not answer for people who had been laicised.  The Murphy report quotes Archbishop Connell as saying that the disclosure &ldquo;was a beginning and it was a very big beginning because nothing of the kind had ever happened before&rdquo;.  What good is that to victims?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As I am conscious of the time constraints I am facing, I will conclude by speaking about the control of our schools.  As we know, the church is the patron of almost all of this country&rsquo;s primary and secondary schools.  I appreciate that there are other patrons like the VECs and Educate Together.  However, the time has come to consider seriously the role of the Catholic Church in the patronage of primary and second level schools.  Major practical issues arise in this regard such as who would move in were it to move out.  However, Members must agree fundamentally that children can never be placed at risk.  I encourage the Minister of State to examine this issue.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach and compliment him on the discharge of his brief.  He is one of the brighter young people to join the ranks of the Ministers of State.  While I do not wish to be patronising, the truth is the truth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This item on the cl&aacute;r of Seanad &Eacute;ireann gives me absolutely no pleasure.  I am a committed Roman Catholic.  However, as a parent and as a public representative, I must express my revulsion at the findings of this report.  I have been in public life for more than 30 years but never thought I would be obliged to make the utterances I am about to make.  One sad result about this is that so many good priests, nuns, brothers and religious will be tarnished.  People will state cruelly that they all are the same, which is not the case.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the nub of the problem that confronts Members.  I compliment Ms Justice Murphy on compiling this report.  It details some outrageous accounts of abuse of the most vulnerable people, namely, innocent children.  I refer to children who have had their childhood robbed of them and with whom I have been obliged to deal in my capacity as a psychiatric nurse.  I recall one particular occasion in the female admission ward of St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital, Mullingar, when I heard a female patient giving a graphic account of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father.  I also recall a teacher in a school I know very well who was found to be an abuser.  However, that teacher was transferred to a school in Dublin in an area that was considered to be rough.  The problem was not dealt with as this constituted a transfer of the problem rather than an interaction with it.  In other words, the problem simply was moved on.  This is what makes this report and others so damning.  It affects people, irrespective of their status, and examples have been found in recent years concerning doctors, teachers, nurses, brothers, priests and nuns.  In this case, it pertains to the clergy.</P>
        <P>An investigation should be carried out in every diocese and in every parish, if necessary, for the benefit of abuse survivors.  While I could say much about the status of survival in some cases, professional etiquette precludes me from so doing.  I refer to any abused individual in any diocese or parish, the abuse of whom has not come to light.  It would be a grave injustice to such a person not to make an effort to discover such abuse and to deal with the abuser, even in retrospect, because that is the only way one can bring closure to these people that is relevant to the abuse they suffered.  Questions have been asked about the north-eastern part of our island which, regrettably, is not under the jurisdiction of the Government.  I believe that every diocese on the island of Ireland must undergo a full and thorough investigation on the same lines as that which resulted in the Murphy report.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">What makes this problem so repulsive is the conspiracy of silence.  As for bishops who may not have carried out their duties in an appropriate manner or who may have hidden behind the concept of Canon Law, there can be no hiding place for an abuser, clerical or otherwise.  They must be rooted out and dealt with, if only to bring closure to the abused and for the good priests, brothers and nuns, many of whom I know and of whom I have pleasant memories.  During my days at St Mary&rsquo;s College, Mullingar, a wrong hand was never put on me.  I thank the community of Christian Brothers at St Mary&rsquo;s College, Mullingar.  While an individual there rightfully was named and shamed, in the main I can only say the best of my experience of the brothers, priests and nuns with whom I have come in contact.  Members owe it to those good people to expose the wrongdoers.  The bishops who have not taken to task the individuals concerned have not simply failed the abused children but also have failed society and their church.</P><Col N="295"/>
        <P Just="Left">Everyone can point fingers and were I on the Opposition side of the House, perhaps I would be saying the same thing.  However, abuse did not begin today or yesterday.  Members now know it has been ongoing for years and, at long last, it will be dealt with, I hope in an inclusive fashion.  As the old saying goes, it is never too late to do the right thing.  However, the buck has been passed in several sectors of society, including the Garda, the various Departments responsible, perhaps the Government and, as now has been proven conclusively, the church itself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The single point I must make on this sordid saga is that trust has been betrayed massively.  I refer to the trust of parents who committed their children to the care of clergy in respect of serving mass, attending boarding schools and so on.  Such trust has been betrayed and the childhood of all those who were abused has been robbed absolutely.  Moreover, unlike Dick Turpin, the abusers did not wear a mask but were barefaced about it.  As I noted, there can be no hiding place for such people.  Nevertheless, I maintain that one also must strike a blow for the good priests, brothers and nuns because they are innocent parties in this regard.  As I stated, I am a Catholic and proud to be so.  It is the singer that is at fault, not the song.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  Together the Ryan and Murphy reports make for horrendous reading and represent a shameful part of our heritage.  Collectively, we have to feel ashamed.  When we look back on our glory days, our heritage and literary past, we cannot deny that this sorry chapter is as much a part of our heritage and has to be faced up to.  Just as the German people faced up to horrendous crimes of huge proportions in the past, we have to face up to this issue and accept our collective guilt and shame.  It is, tragically, part of our heritage and inheritance.  There is no avoiding that fact.</P>
        <P>The biblical phrase &ldquo;Suffer the little children to come unto me&rdquo; comes to mind.  The individuals who abused children stand condemned.  Their crimes and breaches of trust are unacceptable and unpardonable.  The parts of the State apparatus, institutions and bodies, which were complicit in the cover-up of the abuse must stand condemned also.  That is what I meant by the words &ldquo;collective guilt and shame&rdquo;.  Many of us showed a lack of concern for children on the margins.  Children of all social classes and groups were victims and trust was broken.  To a degree, we did not show enough concern for more vulnerable children, all of which makes us guilty collectively.</P>
        <P>As we solve the problem, we have to focus on the vast majority of good priests and religious who have done very good work.  In many cases they have substituted for inadequate social and State services.  They have been tremendous pastors on an individual basis as people of God and followers of Christ.  They deserve our admiration.  They are vulnerable today and another set of victims because they feel ashamed and a misplaced guilt, as many of us do when we blame ourselves for not doing something.  Those who turned a blind eye and were aware of what was happening stand condemned.  However, there are many good priests who deserve our thoughts, prayers and recognition.  We should salute their good work, what they stand for and thank them.  Many times they have done what the State should have been doing.  They are great people.</P>
        <P>When we look at our collective shame, institutional and individual wrongdoing and identify the good done by many priests, the question which arises is what will happen in the future.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reply in that regard, as it will not be enough to just condemn what has happened.  Steps have to be taken to ensure there will no be repetition and that there will be openness and transparency.</P><Col N="296"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>A number of initiatives were taken of which I am aware and which are identified in the report.  These included the 1977 to 1983 guidelines on non-accidental injury to children; the 1980 to 1997 guidelines on the identification and management of non-accidental injury to children; the 1987 child abuse guidelines; the Children First guidelines of 1999; the duty of care guidelines of 2002; and the trust in care guidelines published in 2005.  All of these documents need to be enforced.  We need to enforce the legislation and guidelines in this area.  We also need to provide backup, which will be important in the context of budgetary constraints.  We should not reduce the number of staff working in this area or our vigilance in the identification of problems.  It is important that we debate the issues raised and recognise our guilt in this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their remarks on this excellent report.  It deals with a disturbing and emotive subject and I thank Senators for the thoughtfulness of their contributions which not only dealt with the report&rsquo;s findings and their implications, as the last speaker stated, but also made clear their revulsion at what the report had revealed.  Above all, the House has paid tribute to the courage of the victims and survivors of child sexual abuse in their fight for justice and outstanding contribution to the work of the commission.</P>
        <P>It is right that we have placed emphasis on the State&rsquo;s response, but the primary focus of the report is on the failings of the church authorities, as Senators have recognised.  No Government in a democracy can or should prescribe how a church should be run.  However, we can make sure all institutions in the State are subject to its laws.  I have no doubt that Senators are determined that is the case.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Healy Eames questioned the status of the report.  It is well known that the commission was set up under statute to establish and report on the factual position and make findings.  The report indicates that, because facts came to the attention of the commission after its finalisation, a supplemental report might be published, something of which we will have to take cognisance.</P>
        <P>The Senator also raised the issue of the primacy of law in the State and referred to criminal and civil law being superior to Canon Law, which is the case.  All persons in Ireland, without exception, are subject to the law of the land and all activities, criminal or otherwise, are subject to the laws we lay down.  As I said when I launched the report, anyone, no matter who he or she is and whether he or she wears a collar, who commits a crime is subject to the criminal law.</P>
        <P>The Vatican response to the request received from the commission of investigation conveyed the impression that it was unwilling to co-operate with the inquiry, which is unfortunate.  With regard to the papal nuncio, I understand the letter he received from the commission earlier this year included an invitation to submit any observations he wished to make on certain extracts from the draft report.  While the fact that he chose not to do so did not impact on the commission&rsquo;s work, it is unfortunate that his failure to reply left the distinct impression that there was a lack of support for its work.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, invited the papal nuncio to meet him yesterday to discuss the commission&rsquo;s report.  This followed a meeting between the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the papal nuncio last week at his request.  In the course of the meeting yesterday the Minister emphasised the deep concern of the Government and the wide public feeling of upset at the unacceptable way in which the abuse of children had been handled by the church authorities.  The Minister asked for the full co-operation of the Holy See in investigations, including the continuing investigations in Dublin and Cloyne.</P><Col N="297"/>
        <P>The papal nuncio said the Holy See was also shocked and appalled at the contents of the report and that it was taking it very seriously.  It was aware of the outrage generated in Ireland by the report.  The seriousness with which it was being viewed was reflected in the request from the Pope to Cardinal Brady and Archbishop Martin to meet him in Rome next Friday.  I welcome these comments from the papal nuncio and the initiative of the Vatican in convening the meeting on Friday.  It is essential that the church authorities at all levels demonstrate a firm resolve and capacity to ensure that the highest standards of child protection are applied, and that there is unambiguous acceptance of the responsibility of the civil authorities to ensure that the rights of children are vindicated and that those who commit offences are held to account whatever their status.  There are distinct but equal responsibilities on institutions of church and State to ensure that vulnerable children are placed first in our approach and actions.</P>
        <P>While there has been a fundamental change in recent years in the way this issue is dealt with in our society, as I have said in the other House there are no grounds for complacency.  It is the duty of Government to ensure that all institutions in the State are subject to the law of the State without exception, above all to the laws which protect children.  The Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure that the old ways of responding to allegations and evidence of child sexual abuse will never return, and the ways we now handle them will be continually updated in the light of developing best practice.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has expressed his sorrow that, as the commission has found, in some cases, because of acts or omissions, individuals who sought assistance did not always receive the level of response or protection which any citizen in trouble is entitled to expect from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He has stressed that protecting vulnerable children must always be a priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that the force would continue to work with the HSE and other agencies to ensure children&rsquo;s safety and was committed to ensuring that the confidence in, and effectiveness of, its investigation methods was such that abusers could not draw a cloak of fear and mistrust around their crimes.</P>
        <P>The report acknowledges the expertise and ongoing work of the Garda domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit.  The work of this unit is now supplemented by a series of initiatives and measures designed to enhance its investigative ability and provide specialist officers countrywide with the skills required to deal with the victims of sexual offences.  These measures include the establishment of a training facility to train senior investigating officers, incident room managers and detectives; training and appointing specialist child interviewers throughout the country; establishing and rolling out dedicated child interview suites in each region; and developing and implementing a youth and children strategy for the period from 2009 to 2011.  These initiatives are designed to bring the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into line with best international practice.  The current Garda approach to child sexual abuse cases is designed to deal sensitively with victims and apply the best investigative methods to secure a just outcome in the courts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The investigation unit undertook a substantial investigation in 2002, following the RTE &ldquo;Cardinal Secrets&rdquo; programme.  The commission has acknowledged that this investigation was effective, co-ordinated and comprehensive.  It resulted in the submission of several files to the Director of Public Prosecutions and following his direction a number of people have appeared before the courts charged with serious offences.  Some of these cases are still ongoing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The victims are entitled to expect that the issue of criminal liability on the part of anyone in authority &mdash; either church or State &mdash; in the handling of these cases will be pursued fully and rigorously.  That will happen.  Assistant commissioner O&rsquo;Mahony and his team will have the full investigative powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in examining the report&rsquo;s findings relating to the handling of complaints and investigations by both church and State at the Commissioner&rsquo;s <Col N="298"/>request.  The focus of the examination will be to establish whether the failing identified in the report amounted to criminal behaviour.  They will pursue their inquiries, without fear or favour, wherever they lead.</P>
        <P>There was reference to the fact that, while the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 introduced an offence of withholding information which might be of assistance in preventing the commission of a serious offence or securing a prosecution, it excludes an offence of a sexual nature from this provision.  This matter was discussed when the Bill was being considered by the Oireachtas.  The view taken then was that if offences of a sexual nature were not excluded in this way, it could lead to the introduction of mandatory reporting in sex abuse cases.  It would not be appropriate to deal with such a complex issue as mandatory reporting in an offences against the State Bill.  The Government does not propose to introduce any form of mandatory reporting at this time.  International evidence suggests that mandatory reporting serves only to swamp child protection systems with high volumes of reports, often resulting in no commensurate increase in substantiated cases.</P>
        <P>Recent reviews of the Children First guidelines have found them to be robust and appropriate.  We now need to focus on having the guidelines implemented on a consistent basis.  The implementation plan drawn up following the publication of the Ryan report states that the Government will draft legislation to impose a duty to comply with the Children First guidelines on all staff employed by the State and all staff employed in agencies in receipt of funding from the Exchequer.  Legislation will also be drafted to provide for sharing of information and co-operation between relevant services in the best interests of children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commission&rsquo;s report and a number of Senators expressed concern about the statutory powers of the HSE to deal with child sexual abuse by non-family members.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will consult further with the Office of the Attorney General to seek clarity on this issue.  However, in the wake of the publication of the Ferns Report in 2005, legal advice was sought from the then Attorney General regarding the powers of health boards, or the HSE as it now is, to investigate and deal with incidents of child abuse perpetrated outside the family.  The then Attorney General was not of the view that the HSE&rsquo;s powers under section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991 are limited to cases of intra-family abuse.  The HSE has stated that it responds to all allegations of child sexual abuse regardless of the circumstances of the allegation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier this year the Government requested the commission of investigation to extend its work to deal with the diocese of Cloyne because of concerns which had arisen regarding that diocese.  The Government believes the work of the commission on the archdiocese of Dublin and its forthcoming report on the diocese of Cloyne will serve the primary purpose of establishing what happened, so that lessons can be learned and remedies introduced.  The Department of Education and Science is examining school patronage in general.  This is a wide-ranging review.  This is in addition to the Department&rsquo;s consideration of new, developing areas, new patronage for schools and international experience in this area generally.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  As Senators will be aware, the committee has presented two interim reports and has over recent months concentrated its deliberations on family law issues.  It has a draft final report under consideration and its deadline for reporting back to the Oireachtas is in a week&rsquo;s time, on 16 December.</P>
        <P>Some of the contributions also referred to the exemption in the Employment Equality Acts to religious institutions and educational or medical institutions under their control.  Such an institution can seek to invoke this exemption only if an employee or potential employee would <Col N="299"/>undermine or crucially affect the values and ethos of that religious institution.  There is to date no case law where an employee or potential employee has challenged the religious exemption or the manner in which a religious institution has determined that its ethos or values have been undermined.  It would be open to an employee or potential employee to seek to show that the action taken by the institution was unreasonable or that it was disproportionate to consider that his or her employment was undermining the religious ethos of the institution.  The European Commission raised some queries with regard to the protection against discrimination based on religious grounds.  Their queries were answered by Ireland and accepted by the Commission in May 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has a clear duty to do all it can to ensure that the abuse so vividly and sickeningly laid bare in the report does not happen in the future and, where it does, that it is responded to appropriately.  Consequently, notwithstanding the positive findings of the commission on current Garda practices, I have requested the Garda Inspectorate as part of its work programme to carry out a review of Garda arrangements for dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse.  Furthermore, while the Ryan report dealt specifically with abuse of children within residential institutions, the Government has asked the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs to consider the commission&rsquo;s report with a view to establishing what actions are necessary in addition to the 99 points contained in the Ryan report implementation plan.  These are just two examples of the action being taken and in addition to that action the Government will not hesitate to take any further action necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again thank Senators for their remarks on the report.  I am glad to say it has been<?oasys _jy ?>well ventilated in the House.  We look forward to receiving the further reports from the commission.</P>

        <P>This debate is particularly timely and an opportunity for the House to focus on the undoubted potential of the agrifood sector to contribute significantly to the recovery of the economy.  First, however, I express my sympathy to all those who have been so badly affected by flooding in recent weeks.  I am aware from my Department&rsquo;s assessment of the impact of the flooding on the agricultural community.  The Government has discussed the issue and agreed to allocate &euro;2 million for a targeted fodder aid scheme which will complement a wider humanitarian aid scheme of &euro;10 million to assist those communities most badly affected.  It is hoped payments will commence in the very near future.</P>

Throughout the year the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, has worked actively at EU level to determine the most effective use of market support measures, notably for the benefit of the dairy sector.  In view of the significance of export markets for Irish food products, the importance of such market support measures cannot be underestimated.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>The potential of the agrifood sector has long been recognised by the Government, but it is all the more important in current economic circumstances that it is kept in sharp focus.  The Forf&aacute;s report, Sharing our Future: Ireland 2025, points to the importance of the agrifood sector realising its further growth potential and maintaining its place as an important part of the national economy and strategic relevance in terms of food security.  The sector is operating in a dynamic environment; if we want to harness its potential, we cannot afford to stand still.  We need a new direction for the sector and new thinking is required on what needs to be done.  More of the same will not be enough.  It is precisely for this reason that my Department and five State agencies &mdash; Bord Bia, Teagasc, Enterprise Ireland, BIM and the Marine Institute &mdash; have completed an enormous amount of work on a new strategy for the development of the agrifood and fishing sectors for the period to 2020.  My Department has long been of the opinion that the agrifood sector should consistently take a medium-term view, to be renewed periodically.  The development of medium-term strategies has been a feature of our work for a considerable time, as evidenced by the previous strategies, Agri Food 2010 and Agri Vision 2015.</P>
        <P>There have been some recent comments, with which I wholeheartedly agree, about the need for a new medium-term strategy; those making them seemed to be unaware of the advanced nature of the work on the Agri Vision 2020 strategy.  The work done to date involved the preparation of a series of papers on the main sectors which are almost complete.  These will give an informed basis to a web-based public consultation process and request for submissions which I hope to initiate shortly.  I take the opportunity to repeat the invitation to all those with a stake in the agrifood sector to participate actively in the 2020 process, stimulate debate and help chart the course for the future.  I know there are no easy answers, but I am convinced that unless the 2020 strategy gives concrete direction to the industry as a whole, it will be a lost opportunity to maximise the potential of the sector.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Agri Vision 2020 strategy maintains the impetus gained from the successful Agri Vision 2015 report and action plan.  The new strategy will take account of current global and market realities, with agriculture and food taking a central place in the major global challenges of food security and climate change.  The plan will focus on the critical issue of competitiveness, the challenges from the global economic downturn, currency fluctuations, climate change and how best to maximise the opportunities arising from a growing international food and energy crops market.  We must also ensure that as much as possible of what we need to eat in Ireland is sown in Ireland and sold for a fairer price.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the competitiveness issues affecting the economy and the particular effect &mdash; especially when combined with currency difficulties &mdash; on the food industry.  The broad thrust of the Government&rsquo;s approach is to take every possible step to help improve our competitive base.  This is not an easy process but is being afforded the highest priority and persistence.</P>
        <P>The establishment of NAMA is a critical step in the Government&rsquo;s efforts to achieve a properly functioning banking system.  We all appreciate the importance of getting credit flowing through the system, particularly in view of the ongoing credit difficulties being experienced in the farming sector.  Close contact has been maintained with the Irish Banking Federation and the major banks, which has given me the opportunity to impress upon them the short-term liquidity difficulties experienced by farmers and the wider industry and, in particular, the need to extend normal working capital facilities to farmers.</P>
        <P>Following a request from the Minister, the European Commission agreed in May to advance 70% of the single farm payment from 16 October to assist farmers experiencing difficulties in <Col N="301"/>the dairy market and other sectors.  As a result, more than &euro;850 million has been paid to 120,000 farmers since last month, a full six weeks earlier than provided for under the rules of the scheme.  The level of advance payment, at 70%, is unprecedented.  Following the issuing of the advance payments, my Department began issuing payments of the balance of 30% from 1 December.  Assuming all applications are cleared for payment, a further &euro;380 million will have been paid to farmers in December, bringing to &euro;1.24 billion the total amount paid between October and December.</P>
        <P>In further recognition of the income difficulties experienced by farmers, the D&aacute;il has approved a Supplementary Estimate for my Department which will allow the advance payment of some &euro;85 million under the farm waste management and rural environment protection schemes which would otherwise have fallen to be paid in the new year.  My Department&rsquo;s expenditure on REPS this year will reach a record level of &euro;369 million, paid to a record number of 62,000 participants.  In addition, spending on the farm waste management scheme in 2009 will be &euro;286 million.  By the end of January, Exchequer spending on the scheme will be approximately &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>The prices farmers receive for their products represent the most important way in which they can enhance their incomes.  Unfortunately, we have experienced a significant weakness in prices achieved for dairy, beef and cereals this year, as well as in horticulture.  We are all aware of the particular difficulties experienced by the dairy sector, although, thankfully, there have been some signs of price recovery in recent weeks.  The past year has clearly demonstrated the value of market management mechanisms which prevented a bad situation from becoming worse.  In the course of last year&rsquo;s CAP health check negotiations we were to the forefront in arguing for the retention of these measures.  As a result of pressure from Ireland and, subsequently, a number of other member states on the Commission, many of these measures were activated to help stabilise a difficult position.</P>
        <P>In addition, in recent months, an increasing number of member states, among which Ireland was a central player, pressed the Commission to address the difficulties in the dairy sector.  The outcome was positive, with agreement on the need to maintain the effective use of market measures, including intervention and private storage aid, as well as the introduction of what will now be a &euro;300 million dairy fund as a means of providing direct support for dairy farmers.  Crucially, we have impressed upon the Commissioner who has accepted the point that there must be a controlled release of butter and skimmed milk powder from intervention stocks to avoid any negative shock to prices.</P>
        <P>One of the key outcomes negotiated in the health check was the agreement to abolish milk quotas in 2015.  In this regard, there is no turning back.  The industry must now deal with the challenges and opportunities presented by abolition and the Minister will play his part.  He is already playing his part, following his agreement to make milk quota available to support a major dairy research project, conducted by Teagasc, aimed at the development of profitable expanding dairy farms as we move towards quota abolition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further forward-looking initiative that has been facilitated by the health check outcome was the opportunity provided by this year&rsquo;s 1% increase to allocate 14 million litres to 70 new entrants to dairying under a new entrants&rsquo; scheme.  These are young farmers who have a genuine future in the industry.  The scheme has been an outstanding success in terms of both the quantity and quality of applicants.  The successful applicants are today participating in their first training workshop, facilitated by Teagasc.  In terms of the further 1% of additional quota that will be available next year, the Minister stated his intention to consider how the scope of the scheme may be expanded to new and recent entrants.</P><Col N="302"/>
        <P>For an industry that exports 85% of its produce, valued last year at &euro;2.3 billion, the anticipated growth in world demand should bring real benefits.  The beef industry is even more dependent on exports with more than 90% of production exported.  As important as export earnings are to the economy, this level of export dependence makes the sector susceptible to fluctuations and trends in international and EU markets.  The global economic downturn has seen consumers curtail spending and a consequential decline in beef consumption throughout Europe this year.  This fall has been especially noticeable at the high-value end of the<?oasys _jy ?>market, a segment of the market specifically targeted in recent years by Irish producers and processors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That being said, the organic sector, although small, has bucked this trend and continues to grow 11% year on year.  With 70% of consumption of organic food coming from imports and a &euro;2 billion under-supplied market in the nearby UK, organic production is increasingly attractive for farmers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nonetheless, as in the dairy sector, the medium-term prospects are encouraging.  Rising population levels, forecasted improved standards of living, growing urbanisation and changing dietary patterns, especially in Asia, are all contributing to increasing food demand.  Furthermore, the European Commission has estimated that EU beef and veal production is expected to decline by almost 5% by 2015.  This will lead to a supply gap within the EU of 600,000 tonnes by 2015, providing market opportunities for efficient market producers.  Irish producers are well placed to benefit from these opportunities.</P>
        <P>Apart from the sectoral challenges and opportunities, one of the most significant issues that will impact on the future of the agrifood industry is the shape of the future Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  While funding arrangements for the CAP are fixed until 2013 under the current EU financial perspectives, all aspects of the EU budget are being reviewed.  This will be followed by negotiations to determine the composition of the next financial perspectives of the EU from 2014 to 2020, including the funding available for agriculture and rural development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the negotiation on the new financial perspectives there will be competing pressures for funds, including pressure for less money overall for CAP as a share of the EU budget and in absolute terms.  In this regard, the recently leaked Commission draft paper is of concern to us in that it advocates major policy changes and lower funds for CAP.  We have serious concerns at some of the options mooted in the leaked document from the Commission on the budget review.  There is speculation that it will be subject to significant rewriting and we will press for that.  We have a particular concern at the notion of co-financing of direct payments.  In current circumstances, this would obviously be unaffordable for Ireland and also for many other member states.  More fundamentally, it would arguably represent re-nationalisation of the only real common policy of the EU.</P>
        <P>Decision making on the financial perspectives will, for the first time, come within the co-decision process where the European Parliament as well as the Council of Ministers has to agree to the results.  This is obviously a more open and democratic process but, as it is new, it leads to some uncertainty about the outcome.  Our overarching view is that we need a strong and adequately resourced CAP after 2013.  This is a point we have pressed strongly in discussions to date and for which there is good support in the Agriculture Council.  In view of the new co-decision making process, we want to work with our MEPs to ensure the best outcome for Ireland and for the Irish agrifood sector.</P>
        <P>Food security and climate change are key challenges to be addressed in the coming years.  By 2030, the planet will need to produce 50% more food, with less land, water and energy as <Col N="303"/>inputs.  Food companies are faced with the challenge of meeting the needs of an ever-increasing population while, at the same time, limiting the impact of their activities on the environment.  On the occasion of the World Food Day 2009, I made the point that we need to consider where our food comes from and our joint responsibility to achieve food security.  Even in a developed country like Ireland it is incumbent on us to consider our own food security and, furthermore, how our natural advantages and expertise in food production can be leveraged to assist in meeting long-term increased global demand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an important and timely debate.  There are obvious challenges facing the agrifood sector but, more importantly, significant opportunities for the growth and development of the sector which is of enormous economic and social benefit to the country, particularly in our rural and coastal communities.  We need to have a serious analysis of the sector based on the facts and realities, not on rhetoric and soundbites.  No more than any other sector in the economy, the agriculture sector has not been immune from the difficult choices the Government has had to make.  No analysis of the sector and its prospects can conveniently ignore the fiscal realities.</P>
        <P>Despite the difficulties in the public finances, the Government is investing a record level of &euro;369 million in funding for REPS.  Within a matter of weeks, total spending on the farm waste management scheme will have reached &euro;1 billion, by an enormous distance the highest ever on-farm investment in the history of the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the future of the pork industry was threatened in December last, the Government acted swiftly to secure the industry by restoring public confidence and by providing a financial facility worth up to &euro;200 million.  These are the actions of a Government committed to securing an industry&rsquo;s future and viability, in this case a production and processing industry worth &euro;1.1 billion employing 6,500 people and 500 pork producing farm families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agrifood industry is worth in excess of &euro;8 billion annually in exports to more than 170 countries.  It has proven itself to be robust and resilient.  It has faced and overcome challenges in the past and no doubt it will emerge from this economically challenging time well-placed and conditioned to take advantage of the undoubted opportunities.</P>
        <P>The 2020 Agri Vision strategy presents an opportunity for everybody with a stake in this most important of sectors to contribute constructively to the development of an updated vision for the next decade.  The sector must be flexible, creative and innovative, and one of the most efficient across Europe.</P>
        <P>I am optimistic and positive about the industry&rsquo;s future, notwithstanding the serious difficulties faced this year.  I am confident about its potential to contribute to the recovery of the economy.  The Government recognises that potential and we want to work with the industry and all those who are involved, from the primary producer right through the chain, to ensure the sector reaches its potential and maximises the contribution it can make to the growth and development of the economy nationally, and equally importantly to many local economies and communities throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House and thank him for his contribution.  In his various presentations here in the past two years he has always been constructive and tried to paint a picture of how it can be with various improvements in Government and European initiatives.  I wish him well in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In one sense the most important point, which he stated here previously, was when he properly reminded us of the value of the agrifood industry, worth in excess of &euro;8 billion with export capabilities to more than 170 countries.  Our political and economic ambitions for agriculture must be no less than the possible doubling of that output, which is attainable.  The Minister of <Col N="304"/>State has provided us with an interesting overview of where Ireland stands in the European and world supply chains.  We recognise that global food shortages are becoming commonplace and that there will be strong growth in demand for agricultural products in continental Europe and Asia.  There is a strong market for Ireland in responding to these requirements and challenges.  We must aspire to doubling our agricultural output in current monetary terms.</P>
        <P>The need for a stimulus plan has been mentioned to turn around the ship of State.  We have seen such plans being introduced in France, Germany and the United States.  It was an easy stimulus plan for those economies to introduce because it was partly based on their respective motor industries.  If we want to do something similar here, it must be based on agriculture.  There would be little point in stimulating other sectors where the result would be imports.  If we can use agriculture in the official stimulus plan for the economy, we can transform rural Ireland and the nation&rsquo;s economic fortunes.  Therefore, we must aim high.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has indicated where we can stand in the future in Europe and the world generally.  Our task is to build that bridge by putting in place the required policies.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s vision for 2020 and beyond, to which we must work towards.  In the short-term, however, we must respond to the current crisis.  From a planning perspective, CAP reform in 2013 is worthy of serious debate both here and elsewhere.  The Minister of State has presented truthfully the frightening possibility of a serious change in European thinking, policy making and the funding available for Irish agriculture.  That is something the Government, the Opposition and our MEPs must work to avoid.  If, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s own words, there is to be substantial renationalisation of funding for agriculture, Ireland will be a significant net loser.  We must all join in assisting the Minister of State and his Government colleagues in that big political project.  We will certainly need to have further debates on the matter.</P>
        <P>This debate is taking place just a few hours before the 2010 budget is announced by the Minister for Finance; therefore, we are speaking in a vacuum.  Obviously, however, there are grave concerns for farmers in advance of the Budget Statement.  The representations we have received most frequently in recent months concern the proposed carbon tax.  I am sure the Minister of State &mdash; wearing his other hat as a member of the Green Party &mdash; could put up a strong defence for the carbon tax.  I do not suppose any politician, on either side of the House, would oppose the general concept of such a tax.  However, the additional burden that will be placed on a litre of tractor diesel and heating oil will need to be negated by some form of rebate.  Unfortunately, farmers cannot walk or cycle around their fields with a plough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>They could use an ox.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State knows, tractors are required for such work and use a lot of diesel fuel.  However, the agriculture sector will not be able to sustain a further fuel price increase.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure there will be a rebate to ease the burden of a new carbon tax.  We need to keep farmers working at this difficult time.  Not surprisingly, there has been profound doom and gloom, given the major difficulties experienced across all sectors.  Input costs arising from the introduction of a carbon tax will have to be dealt with.  We must ensure it is not a financial penalty.  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the continuing rise of the organic sector, which we welcome.  I appreciate and applaud his efforts in this regard.  However, he would be the first to recognise that no matter how successful it is and notwithstanding the scale to which it can grow, it will still be but a small part of the overall jigsaw of Irish agriculture.  The organic sector is a success <Col N="305"/>story, which I welcome, but the vision of the Minister of State and his Department must stretch well beyond the sector into mainline sectors also.  Significant work is required in that regard.</P>
        <P>Large numbers of farmers are affected by the flooding crisis.  Some of the pictures on our television screens and in the newspapers are heart-rending.  The level of assistance being suggested by the Government will have to be increased substantially.  Perhaps there will be a budgetary announcement this afternoon.  Perhaps the Independent Member, Deputy Noel Grealish, has worked his magic wand.  Clearly, we need significant and direct assistance for those affected by flooding.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the REPS which has been an outstanding win-win scheme and success story concerning departmental policy and Irish agriculture in the past decade.  However, there is serious concern that it appears set to be radically reformed and reduced.  I am not fully aware of the Minister of State&rsquo;s thinking on what form a new scheme will take, but our aim must be to ensure the maximum number of participants can enter and qualify for the scheme, thus receiving support and assistance.  The McCarthy report was particularly critical of the REPS and suggested its almost complete shutdown.  However, if one looks at what has been done on farms <i>via</i> the scheme, it includes the physical transformation of the landscape, the protection of habitats and improvement of soil fertility.  It has been a very successful agricultural story.  Under the scheme, the money available is put into circulation almost immediately.  A farmer who receives a REPS cheque is obliged to spend almost all of the money on carrying out further improvements.  I appreciate the scale of the economic crisis and that we must face reality, not live in cloud-cuckoo land.  However, we will tamper with the scheme at our peril.  Its substitute needs to be substantial, not just a scheme in name only.  It must involve money and have a real purpose.  I ask the Minister of State, representing the Green Party wing of the Government, to try to impose his thinking on a new scheme in order that it will make a difference, as I think he would agree, the current scheme has done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We will be spending even more next year on REPS. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>We await information on the parameters of the new scheme, including who can join, how long a person can remain in it and the administrative arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We will know after 15 December.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">It would be remiss of me not to mention the credit crisis which was referred to by the Minister of State.  I noted his comments on NAMA.  If it is to work &mdash; for the sake of the country&rsquo;s economic future, let us all hope it will &mdash; small businesses, including shopkeepers, plumbers, electricians and farmers, will need immediate access to credit.  Bankers claim they are making money available; it seems, however, that those seeking working capital, including farmers, are unable to access it from Irish financial institutions.  Perhaps there will be some type of pronouncement or suggestion in the Budget Statement this afternoon.  There is a political obligation on the Government to place a strong moral obligation on the banks to respond to what has been done by the taxpayer and the political establishment for the banking system.  If that is to be successful, it can only be judged by credit flowing again.  Irish agriculture and many small operators, whether they are contractors, or farmers, in seeking money for stocking loans and so on, are on the verge of shutdown as a result of their inability to access money.  I know the case has been made to the Minister of State a thousand times, but it has to be repeated strongly, if credit is to be made available again by the banks.</P><Col N="306"/>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to wander on, and I look forward to discussing this very important subject again, in the near future, after this afternoon&rsquo;s budget.  We look forward to some positive pronouncements.  The key one for me in the short term would be a rebate on the prospective carbon tax.  We do not want carbon tax to be a shut-down burden, almost, on Irish agriculture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want climate change, either, and we trust the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague is dealing with that matter in Copenhagen, as we speak. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, back to the Seanad.  He has been here on many occasions and has made major contributions.  It is obvious that he has put a great deal of research into his speech today, and he is always positive, which we need to be at present, in dealing with agriculture. </P>
        <P>I value the opportunity to make a contribution to a debate on a sector which is worth in excess of &euro;8 billion annually and supports thousands of jobs.  Before making my main contribution, I pay tribute to the many unfortunate farming families that have been severely affected by the recent flooding.  Coming on top of an already severe year, the catastrophe of the flooding has been a traumatic occurrence.  I commend the farming community across the country for coming to the aid of farmers affected, in supplying them with fodder.  It was good to see that the spirit of communities working closely together is still alive and well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this regard I welcome the &euro;2 million targeted fodder aid scheme, which was quickly put in place by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods, Deputy Brendan Smith.  I would encourage all farmers who believe they are eligible to ensure they apply under the scheme before the closing date, this Friday, 11 December.  It is important that they get their applications in.  All of us in the Seanad are acutely aware that this has been a very challenging year for agriculture.  A series of factors have combined to put severe pressure on incomes, most notably, low commodity prices and difficulties with sterling as well as weakened domestic and international demand.  Some 90% of the beef industry produce, alone, has to be exported and as the Minister of State rightly said, we are very dependent on exports.  Given the state of the world economy, consumption is down across Europe and in Ireland.  I hope people will come back to buying beef and be prepared to pay a reasonable price for it.  If not, many of our beef farmers will go out of production and this will give rise to a shortage of food.  As the Minister of State said, as we approach 2020 we shall have to produce much more food for the markets available, probably on less land.  It is important to emphasise that fact and I am delighted he did.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The dairy sector, in particular, has had a tough year, as has been acknowledged by the Minister.  He has had some notable success at EU level in pushing market support measures.  I remain optimistic about the future of farming and the agrifood sector, notwithstanding the serious difficulties currently being faced.  A cornerstone to ensure that the sector is well placed to develop into the future is the Agri Vision 2020 strategy, which has the potential to be an exciting blueprint to take it forward well into the 21st century.  The Minister is strongly committed to the strategy and I look forward to the development of an initiative that will be a real milestone for agriculture and the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Few here need convincing about the importance of CAP to our farmers.  The debate is well under way about the post-2013 situation and the implications it will have for Ireland.  At this stage I have no reason to believe the outcome will not be positive for this country.  Likewise, <Col N="307"/>the abolition of milk quotas in 2015 holds great opportunity for our dairy farmers.  In this regard, however, it is vital that the industry focuses now on dealing with the challenges as well as the opportunities that milk quota abolition will bring.  Whatever about the future, of immediate and critical importance is the need to assist farmers with cash flow difficulties as much as possible.  The Minister has had much success in this regard in recent times, as has the Minister of State and I acknowledge it in this House.  The Minister&rsquo;s efforts have borne fruit through the early advance of the single farm payment, which has been allocated since 16 October.  A full 70% of the amount due has now been paid to more than 122,000 farmers at a cost of &euro;850 million.  These payments, a full six weeks earlier than provided for under the rules of the scheme, have been of enormous relief to the sector.  Balancing payments were issued last week worth in excess of &euro;380 million.  In total, more than &euro;1.2 billion has now been paid out to more than 122,000 farming families throughout the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was delighted to note in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech that, as a result of the establishment of NAMA he is in consultation with the banks.  As my colleague, Senator Bradford, has said, the banks will have to do better to ensure that stocking loans and the different types of loans farmers need, to keep going, are made available.  The banks must come to their aid and help them in every way possible, not put obstacles in their way, as has been happening.  I am confident the Minister of State and the other Ministers at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will keep pressure on the banks to do that.  It is important and I am delighted he alluded to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is also bringing forward a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;85 million which will go, directly, into the pockets of farmers.  These moneys will allow payments due under the REPS and the farm waste management scheme next year to be paid before Christmas.  Expenditure on REPS this year will reach a record &euro;369 million, paid to a record number of 62,000 participants.  I noted in the cross-fire between the Minister of State and Senator Bradford that the Minister of State said more will be paid out, I hope next year.</P>
        <P>From the perspective of the farm waste management scheme for 2009, &euro;286 million will have been paid by the end of January.  There is no escaping the fact that this has been a very difficult year for agriculture and the agrifood sector.  However, it is a robust and resilient sector and there is every reason for us to remain optimistic about the future.  As our wider economy recovers, built on the back of today&rsquo;s budget, I firmly believe the agrifood sector can play a major role in this recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I appreciate the opportunity to present my party&rsquo;s views on farming and the agrifood sector, which is a vitally important indigenous industry. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Many difficulties face Irish farming and they have been well articulated by my colleagues.  There is the free fall in farming incomes and the collapse in milk and beef prices as well as the problems to do with food labelling, the ever-changing deadlines imposed by the Department for applications for grant aid, the world trade talks and the list goes on.  Cattle farmers are in chronic crisis owing to the flooding and bad spring which required that cattle be rehoused and fed.  The resulting glut of cattle cannot be sold owing to the market forces at work.  No industry has a future if it fails to come up with new methods of dealing with crises in its sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has done more than any group of bureaucrats in Europe to harm this industry.  My long held belief is that this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government has lost touch with rural Ireland, a view regularly expressed to me when I meet people.  The abolition of the farm retirement and installation aid schemes will have a detrimental effect on the rural way of life.  I know the Minister of State will have heard all this before.  These cuts have made and will continue to make farming an unviable option for most, if not all, young people.  Farmers in <Col N="308"/>their late 50s and 60s will not be able to afford to retire.  In turn, without the installation aid, their sons or daughters will not be able to afford to start up in farming, as already evidenced in south Tipperary where there has been much change of mind by people in terms of their careers.  These schemes were meant to assist and entice new people, the next generation, into the industry.  Without the schemes, farming is not an option.</P>
        <P>The Government is allowing an entire indigenous industry and way of life die out.  It is important to note that this industry has been the backbone of the economy for generations, a fact mentioned by the Minister of State in his contribution.  The Government is driving the final nail in the coffin through the removal of these schemes, which is a vote of no confidence in rural Ireland.  It is equivalent to pulling the rug out from under the many farmers who worked hard in poor times to ensure they would have something to hand on to the next generation.  There was a great sense of pride in farmers being able to pass on their farms to their children and being able to trace back their contributions down through the years.  As a rural representative, rural Ireland is important to me.  I do not believe it is good enough to hear Members of this House say one thing on the plinth and then do the exact opposite in this House in terms of following the party line when voting on issues that affect the people of rural Ireland.  There has been much evidence of Members of the Lower House saying one thing when in the Chamber and another at constituency level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rural Ireland relies almost entirely on agriculture.  This is because the Government has failed to invest in these areas of the country.  It has shown no vision in attracting other industries to rural Ireland, a matter which is perhaps a debate for another day.  If farming dies away, so too does rural Ireland.  I have referred previously in this House to farmers&rsquo; markets.  As mayor of Clonmel I had the great pleasure of inviting the Minister of State to the area to discuss where the farmers&rsquo; market might be sited.  Farmers&rsquo; markets are an indication of what good management and local farmers working together can do.  I do not wish to be all negative.  I recognise that positive initiatives have been taken.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s vision of rural Ireland is not good.  Its legacy is that of a boom squandered and a time of unparalleled wealth wasted.  There is palpable anger and fear in the farming community.  I frequently receive calls at my office from farmers who believe they have nowhere else to go and nothing to fall back on.  They believe they have been abandoned by Government.  It is the job of Government to provide the necessary leadership to allay the evident fear and uncertainty.  I am sure I am not the only Member receiving these types of phone calls to my office.</P>
        <P>The agrifood sector is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most important indigenous industries, employing in the region of 50,000 people directly and providing the primary outlet for the produce of 128,000 family farms.  These jobs are dispersed throughout all regions of Ireland, in particular rural areas.  The sector accounts for half of purchased Irish goods and services by the manufacturing industry and just over half of exports by indigenous manufacturing industries.  It is an industry that is vital to the future of the economy.  There has never been a more important time than this special day when more vitality in the economy is needed.  It has huge potential.  Like my colleague in the Lower House, Deputy Sherlock, I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and the Government to be more creative in finding ways to create jobs in the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party recently proposed that employers creating new jobs and taking people off the live register should be given a PRSI break, a proposal that could have a positive impact for small companies at local level in rural Ireland.  We should put in place a scheme that would exempt employers who employ a person that has been unemployed for more than six months and can demonstrate clearly that they are creating a new job from paying employer&rsquo;s PRSI for <Col N="309"/>18 months.  This measure would incentivise the creation of local jobs and would get people back into employment in areas where it is most needed, in particular in rural Ireland.  We should apply more effort and ingenuity in supporting indigenous industry and should never forget that the agricultural sector accounts directly for 5.2% of total employment and indirectly a further 6% in processing, marketing and services, a total of 230,000 Irish jobs, which is no mean achievement these days.</P>
        <P>We need to create a stimulus to encourage farmers to diversify into local needs agriculture and horticultural produce by encouraging and fostering more farmers&rsquo; markets.  I visit the farmers&rsquo; markets in Clonmel and Cahir and when I am away I seek out the farmers&rsquo; markets in the area I am visiting.  I like to visit farmers&rsquo; markets which are amazing places to meet local producers and see their pride in making available to people fresh, locally grown produce.  Traas&rsquo;s apple farm in Tipperary recently received an award for its quality produce.  It is wonderful to visit that farm and to meet the many people who support that industry and appreciate the hard work involved in it.  There is no incentive for those working in agri-related businesses to create jobs.  This is the very sector the Government should be supporting given its real potential in terms of job creation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for listening to my contribution.  I believe not all I have had to contribute has been negative.  I acknowledge the positives initiated by the Minister of State.  I again acknowledge and welcome the &euro;2 million in funding being made available in respect of the fodder aid scheme.  Farmers affected in this regard are truly on their knees.  I do not know what good news the Minister of State can offer this dying breed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Francis O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but the amounts involved have been reduced.  I would like this scheme reinstated in its entirety as it is one of the best schemes available to farmers.  It has greatly improved the countryside as farmers must spend the money on the land and their farms rather than put it into their back pockets and so on.  As I have often stated, there is also a spin-off from this scheme in terms of the products farmers must purchase to do the work or provide employment.  Like my colleagues, I welcome the &euro;2 million for the fodder crisis and the &euro;10 million for the counties affected by the flooding, although it might not be enough when the total amount of damage is assessed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Farmers were having a very bad year before the flooding occurred, with low prices in the beef, pig and dairy sectors.  The low prices are a major blow.  It is very important that farming be supported, particularly given the amount of direct and indirect employment it generates, and that young people be in a position to continue the farming traditions we have inherited from our ancestors.  Today&rsquo;s way of farming is a moderate way.  There are plenty of young farmers in farming today.  It is important that the industry be supported and grown in the years <Col N="310"/>ahead.  The Minister of State referred to the strategies for 2015 and 2020.  The more support the Government can give to farming, the better the country will be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Agriculture has been the backbone of this country for as long as I as well as my father and his father remember.  When things were bad in this country agriculture was there to support it and assist it out of its difficulties.  I hope the Government will do everything in its power for the farmers who are most in need of support, those who have been severely affected by the major floods in recent weeks.  I hope the flooding is over but one never knows when these events will finish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted the Minister referred to the banks.  They have a major role in the farming industry.  The banks are as tight with farmers as they are with other sectors of the community.  The cashflow is very limited, as is the availability of additional borrowing for farmers.  A total of 80% of the products produced by farmers is exported; in the case of beef it is 90%.  Beef, pigs and dairy products are very important for this country at present, as are the amount of jobs created by farming.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his statement and wish him well.  I hope farming will remain at the top of the Government&rsquo;s agenda.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  In fairness to him, he has probably been the best Minister at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in my seven years in the Oireachtas, which is a fairly shocking indictment of where Fianna F&aacute;il stands on agriculture.  He has put in a great effort over his two years in the Department and I hope he can do more in whatever limited time he might have left in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Unlike Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I cannot welcome much of what the Minister of State said.  This is a shocking time for Irish agriculture and farming families.  Leaving aside the recent flooding and the credit crisis, which is crippling small businesses, and farms are small businesses, product prices are lower than they were 20 years ago.  In several sectors, farmers are receiving prices that are below the cost of production.  That is most acute in the dairy sector.  It is a time of little hope.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I come from a farming background.  We can trace the family back over eight or nine generations and it has always been involved in agriculture.  As I am the youngest son, I had to find another career to pursue, but both my brothers are involved in farming and I am still the relief milker at home.  I have had hands on experience in agriculture and dealing with agricultural issues.  I agree with many speakers about the importance of agriculture to the rural economy.  It is the backbone of rural Ireland, and it is an indictment of the last 12 prosperous years that so little was done by the Government to diversify the rural economy and that we are still so dependent on agriculture.  The Government should hang its head in shame in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is also galling that the other source of income in many rural areas was the construction sector, as the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, will be aware.  Many younger people who have left the construction sector were from farming backgrounds and they are now looking to agriculture for their future.  However, at the very time they need them, the Government has suspended the schemes designed to attract new entrants into agriculture.  It is appalling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope for three principal announcements in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s Budget Statement today.  I concur with Senator Bradford about the carbon tax and the devastating impact it will have on agriculture if it is extended to agricultural diesel.  I hope that will not happen and that consideration will be given to this issue.  I hope the Minister will introduce some type of <Col N="311"/>conglomerate scheme that includes the early retirement scheme and the installation aid scheme in order that people are encouraged to transfer farms to younger people who want to get into agriculture, and can do it economically and continue to survive.  The early retirement scheme was very useful and was co-financed by the European Union.  It did not cost the Exchequer much money and it did a very good job.  Now that it has been removed I am aware of many farmers who are in a type of limbo with regard to handing over properties to the next generation.  I hope the Minister will include something about that in his Budget Statement.</P>
        <P>An announcement is due to be made next week about the replacement for the rural environment protection scheme.  It is all very well for Government Senators to state that more is being paid out on REPS this year than in any other year, but in a couple of years nothing will be paid because the scheme will be removed.  I hear that the replacement scheme will be a shadow of the original scheme.  The REPS money was not saved by the farmer or spent on anything other than investing in their farm and ensuring it complied with the scheme.  The money was spent in the local rural economy.  That money has now been removed.  It is an indictment of the Green Party&rsquo;s role in Government that it has overseen the removal of the rural environment protection scheme.  This is an area for which I would have expected it to have great concern, but it has shown scant regard for it in the last 12 months.</P>
        <P>With regard to flooding, I hope the Minister will be able to give some type of commitment to a new scheme of river dredging and cleaning.  We are giving much needed funds to people who have suffered a great deal from the flooding, be they farmers, rural dwellers or urban dwellers, but unless we spend money on ensuring the flooding does not happen again, we will have to give out more money in the future.  It is false economy not to take action to prevent the flooding recurring.  Without angling clubs and some landowners over the last 30 or 40 years, no work would have been done on the rivers in this country.  It is shocking that, last year, one Department gave permission for a dredging scheme on a tributary of the Shannon while the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated that, due to flora and fauna, the scheme could not go ahead.  The flood plain in question has been under ten feet of water for the past three weeks, so the flora and fauna are suffering as a result.  More joined up thinking is required of the Government when pursuing problems in future.</P>
        <P>Electronic sheep tagging has not been mentioned.  It has been brought to my attention that the scheme proposed to be implemented in the coming years has been shown to have a 20% failure rate.  I question the necessity of introducing this tagging.  It will place a burden on already hard-pressed sheep farmers, as the price of sheep meat has gone through the floor.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State offer assurances that the Government will do something to protect the disadvantaged area scheme?  Significant cutbacks to it were announced in recent budgets.  It covers not just the west, but many parts of the country, including my constituency.  I hope the scheme has a future.</P>
        <P>The suckler cow welfare scheme was a good initiative introduced by the Department a few years ago, but it was halved in last year&rsquo;s budget.  Actually, it may have been the budget earlier this year.  We have had many budgets in the past 18 months.  The scheme was halved before it was even introduced.  Beef farming faces a particular problem.  Many suckler farmers are killing their best breeding stock, which will have a serious knock-on effect in terms of the quality of beef produced in future.  The Government must do something urgently to protect breeding stock in the beef sector. The suckler cow welfare scheme was meant to do this, but it has been cut.  It should be increased.  If something is not done, the quality of product will deteriorate significantly over the next few years.  Only when those calves reach 30 months of age or so will we see the knock-on effects. I mention the credit crisis, although other Senators have addressed it.  For many farmers, the early granting of the single farm payment, which I welcomed at the <Col N="312"/>time, has seen the money spent on meeting overdrafts and loans into which many of them entered because of the farm waste management scheme.  Financial institutions got their hands on that money straightaway and it has not found its way into farmers&rsquo; pockets.  I deeply regret that NAMA will not lead to a massive circulation of money within the economy.  All small business people, including farmers, have difficulty in accessing credit, but the Government has done nothing to try to alleviate the problem.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The last area I wish to address is that of multiples controlling farmers&rsquo; products and the difficulties experienced by the latter in getting proper prices.  The time is right for a legislative provision to attack the control of the large multiples.  The three largest control 70% of the grocery sector and are crucifying the manufacturing, processing and agricultural ends.  Fine Gael produced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to address this issue directly.  I ask the Government to do something in the coming months to break the large multiples&rsquo; control over the grocery sector and ensure that farmers get a fair price for their products.</P>
        <P>For the seven years I have been a Senator, labelling has been a constant issue and has not been dealt with by the Government.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, is the most likely man to pursue it.  I hope the Government will take an initiative to ensure that Irish products are correctly labelled as being Irish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am a strong supporter of the idea of food tourism, but I have come up against many obstacles.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a sizable initiative in the south east to try to develop food tourism.  It has developed in many parts of the EU, but there is no tradition of it in Ireland.  Many within the tourism sector do not seem to take it seriously as a product. I ask that the Government take initiatives to ensure that food tourism can be developed across the country. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and the opportunity to make a statement on the agriculture and agrifood sectors.  Like many others, I acknowledge the range of challenges facing both sectors.  Senators referred to climate change, trade agreements, the pressure of large multiples pushing down the prices farmers get for their produce, the CAP reform proposals that have leaked out from Brussels and so on.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that my colleague, the Minister of Sate, Deputy Sargent, has left the Chamber, because I wanted to pay him tribute.  His tenure as the Minister of State with responsibility for food and horticulture in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been important and timely.  It is clear that, in terms of agriculture generally and in the agrifood sector, we need a new vision of how to adapt agriculture to face new and serious challenges.  We need new thinking.  Some of us are stuck on the same treadmill.  I listened to the calls by some Senators.  On the one hand, they tell us not to do anything about climate change, such as implementing a carbon tax, and, on the other hand, they ask the Government to stop the flooding and recognise the latter&rsquo;s appalling impact on farmers and so on.  We must realise that we need to tackle the root causes of these problems.  We cannot continue to throw money away in an attempt to convince ourselves that the old model of farming can continue and that we will somehow get over everything.  We need to introduce new thinking into the sector, which I would argue has been achieved by my colleague, the Minister of State.  In the little over two years that he has spent in the Department, he has put in place and is in the process of putting in place new structures, schemes and so on to encourage the agricultural sector to make the transition to a more sustainable model of farming, which will be essential.  He has committed himself publicly and in the programme for Government to the growth and development of the organics sector.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>Many of the mainstream political parties still view organic agriculture as being a niche area, an add-on to conventional farming.  Much of the major international research highlights the fact that it is a central and growing area of food production and consumption across the world.  A food island like Ireland could exploit many commercial opportunities, giving it a head start in developing itself as a location committed to organic farming.  In the programme for Government, which was agreed a little over two years ago, we set a target of converting a minimum of 5% of acreage to organic farmland by 2012.  I am happy to say that, despite many of the challenges facing the new sector, we have converted approximately 1.25% of farmland to organic and the rate of interest being expressed by those signing up to the main organic farming scheme is encouraging.  There is every reason to believe that, by the end of the Government&rsquo;s term, we will have reached what was an ambitious target for a new sector.</P>
        <P>The organic food production and processing sector is one of the few areas showing steady growth in Ireland and in the countries to which we send most of our conventional produce.  Ireland is uniquely suited to organic farming, as we are a food producing island and have a famous clean, green image.  The European public in particular has grown concerned about the impact of intensive farming on biodiversity and the environment.  At the same time, farmers&rsquo; incomes are coming under pressure from cheap imports.  Farmers are also under relentless pressure from retail multiples to accept less for their produce.  This is an issue we must address.  There is an increase in the concentration of power in the hands of a few large supermarket chains.  It is not peculiar to Ireland; it is an international phenomenon which has fundamentally changed the balance of  market negotiating power in the food chain.  It is a factor, although not the only one, contributing to the declining share of prices received by farmers.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is very clear that competition alone cannot act as the sole mechanism to maintain efficient markets.  The careful and sensitive use of market management measures can help to maintain balance in the market, where appropriate.  The use of such mechanisms can assist in the provision of fair returns for producers.  The Minister of State believes there is a need at EU level to give urgent thought to ensuring markets function well and unfair practices are prevented.  Because the agrifood industry is hugely important to Ireland and the European Union, the Union must safeguard its production base to meet future demand for food, feed and bioenergy.  Retailers must strike a reasonable balance between granting value for customers and giving it to suppliers and producers.  A balance between all stakeholders, including suppliers, producers, retailers and consumers, may be difficult to achieve but the Minister of State and the Government are committed to working towards achieving these mechanisms at EU level.</P>
        <P>As intensive conventional farming becomes less profitable and farmers look for alternative ways to make their enterprises pay, they must consider alternatives such as organic farming.  They also need to look at conventional outlets because of the pressure exerted by the larger retail multiples.  They will have to look at alternative channels, including selling their produce directly to consumers in farmers&rsquo; markets and farm shops and through co-operatives and distribution systems independent of supermarket control.  In addition, farming must become more diversified, producing more varieties of food but also fuel, building and clothing materials.  I refer to the fledgling hemp industry which appears to hold out great promise for farmers.  Hemp is an extremely versatile material that can be used in food products, building and clothing materials and so on.  Teagasc has done a certain amount of research in this regard.  It is innovative and a move we should consider more closely and support.</P>
        <P>I again pay tribute to the Minister of State for the work he has done in many areas.  He has supported farmers&rsquo; markets and helped to ensure local authorities support and provide the <Col N="314"/>facilities such markets need.  He mentioned the growth in demand for organic food.  The Irish organic retail market was estimated to be worth &euro;104 million in 2008, compared to &euro;66 million in 2006 and &euro;38 million in 2003.  There was annual growth of 40% in 2007 and 2008 which compares very favourably with the figures for previous years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are several issues I would like to discuss, one being the threat to organic agriculture posed by genetic modification and GMOs.  However, I do not have time to go into that matter in great detail, suffice it to say the Minister of State has introduced a voluntary labelling scheme.  I agree with Senator John Paul Phelan that country of origin labelling is important.  The Minister of State has championed this issue at EU level within the Council of Ministers, as well as at national level.  It is very important that people know where their produce originates.  When the pigmeat crisis happened, the issue of provenance became very important.  The Minister of State intends to continue to lobby at EU level to ensure country of origin labelling is introduced but among EU member states we are supported only by Italy.</P>
        <P>I, again, welcome the attempts made to promote organic produce by the Minister of State.  We must look in a new way at how we can make farming livelihoods more sustainable.  In this regard, it appears the organic sector holds great potential for farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an tSeanaid chun an cheist t&aacute;bhachtach seo, &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; talmha&iacute;ochta, iascaireachta, coillte, bia agus &oacute;lach&aacute;in de, a phl&eacute;.</P>
        <P>Agrifood is a very important topic, one on which my party colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, is preparing a report for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  With his assistant, Ms Kathryn Reilly, he is putting the finishing touches to the report which will be submitted to the committee next year.  I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agrifood sector is very important to the entire economy.  It is the largest Irish-owned productive sector, accounting for almost 50% of exports from Irish-owned manufacturing enterprises.  Given its regional spread, it plays a significant role in the spatial distribution of development and employment.  Unlike other sectors of the economy, it is multifaceted, with growers, producers and farmers at farm level, complemented by primary processing and added-value ancillary services and industries.  Employment in the sector accounted for 179,200 jobs, or 8.5% of total employment in 2008, according to figures taken from the CSO&rsquo;s quarterly national household survey.  However, in an industry survey by Agri Aware, farming, the food industry and service industries that depend directly and indirectly on agriculture were found to provide approximately 268,000 jobs.  This represents one in seven jobs in the economy.  The fact that one in seven people is in employment either directly or indirectly because of the agrifood sector means we cannot continue merely to refer to it in soundbites.  This is the time for action; unless the Government takes the sector seriously, we are at risk of losing one of our greatest wealth generating industries.</P>
        <P>There is optimism about the future of the sector to stimulate the economy.  We know such optimism is rife but the practical initiatives required to create the basis for a prosperous indigenous industry are deficient.  There are challenges facing the sector in Ireland.  Among these are: changes to the Common Agricultural Policy and WTO arrangements which will fundamentally change the economics of supply and production in Ireland and the European Union.  Increases in business and regulatory compliance costs, coupled with a deflationary consumer food market, mean that manufacturer margins are being eroded.  This leads to products and services being sourced from other low cost jurisdictions.  In addition, the increased concen<Col N="315"/>tration levels and buying power of multiple food retailers, coupled with changes in distribution arrangements, are inhibiting Irish cost recovery.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>In its document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy, the Government advocates the agrifood sector as a major economic stimulus.  My party and I agree.  The sector is dependent on rural and indigenous enterprises and businesses.  However, with just two pages dedicated to this issue, there are no realistic proposals in the document to address how the Government will support the sector.  With a series of proposed cuts to be announced presently in the 2010 budget, how is the sector supposed to develop further?</P>
        <P>The creation of new employment opportunities using indigenous resources should be the main focus of the Government.  It should include actions to develop new rural enterprises and promote the development of new products and processes.  The agrifood sector is indigenous, has a regional focus but is international in orientation.  The value of the sector is most readily visible in local economies, for which the value of production and processing, to which job alternatives are few, is unparalleled.  In 2008 the sector accounted for 10% of total merchandise exports, amounting to a figure of nearly &euro;8.6 billion.  Similarly, on average, it has accounted for around 9% of total exports.  Since Ireland is seen as a green island, there should be greater efforts to capitalise on this image and expand our agrifood exports.</P>
        <P>The embedded nature of the food sector in our economy is demonstrated by the fact that in the period between 2000 and 2008 there was an increase in the Irish raw materials sourced by the food and drink sector but both total manufacturing and total manufacturing excluding food, drink and tobacco witnessed a decline in Irish sourced raw materials.  The Irish economic expenditure is beneficial not only for the national economy but for local economies from which these raw materials are sourced.</P>
        <P>The agrifood sector is an industry with low profit outflow from the country and low import requirements.  However, Bord Bia estimates that as much as 90% of poultry and 60% of pigmeat sales at food service level consist of imported products.  That is accentuated by the fact that import growth to date has been strongest in the meat, vegetables and prepared food categories with <i>per capita</i> increases by 50% to &euro;1,070 from 2000 to 2007.  The lack of initiatives to address these problems is symptomatic of a Government that is willing to talk up the industry but has very little interest in doing anything for it.</P>
        <P>The aquaculture sector is crucial for the local economy in Donegal but that sector is tied up in bureaucracy and administration.  While in theory there is enormous potential to expand exports and create ancillary services and employment onshore, in practise it is not happening.  While we are an island, we might as well be surrounded by a desert for all we are able to capitalise on our resources at sea.  We are all aware of the difficulties with licences and the artificial barriers being created by legislation.  The implementation of European Union directives is creating difficulties for fishermen who just want to get on with their jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There must be renewed focus on this area by Government if we are to lift the local economy in those areas which were once thriving but which, as a result of administration and red tape, have now seen a huge valuable sector for the economy become a shadow of its former self.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh mo shean-chara, an tAire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Killeen.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m freisin leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Sargent, at&aacute; d&iacute;reach imithe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As my colleague, Senator Carty, said, the background is glum in terms of debating any part of the country&rsquo;s economy but particularly agriculture when we consider what farmers have gone through in recent weeks.  Without going into the statistics, agriculture remains a huge contributor to the economy, with in the order of &euro;8 billion in exports to more than 150 countries <Col N="316"/>around the world giving gainful, worthwhile employment to many families, without which they would be forced to look for industrial jobs of which there is none.</P>
        <P>Despite all the doom and gloom, like many other speakers I have the ultimate faith in the Irish farmer.  There is nobody in the world who can farm like Irish farmers.  There is nobody with their resilience, courage, optimism and endeavour, and that is a huge asset for us as a nation.  Despite the glum backdrop, I am confident we are going forward in agriculture and that we can realise hugely optimistic targets such as doubling outcome over several years.</P>
        <P>I did not get an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the flooding.  I, too, extend my sympathy to everybody concerned on what must have been a traumatic experience and which may be an ongoing experience people will suffer for many months.  The experience was brought to mind recently in terms of the unfortunate farmer in the west who was only concerned that there would be fodder for his cattle.  When he was asked about his own needs he said that will come another day.  He was more interested in feeding his cattle than in feeding himself in his marooned state.  That is typical of the Irish farmer.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department for a speedy response to the flooding problems.  The &euro;2 million fodder grant is a small amount of money but at least it was made available immediately and has been of some help.  I hope in today&rsquo;s budget, which we are all awaiting with apprehension, there will be some further aids and supports for farming generally but particularly for farmers in the west and those who were affected by flooding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the reference by the Minister of State to seeking the extension of farm credits because there is no doubt that farmers are suffering and they will become more reliant on credit than ever before.  It was not the farmers who created the problem that led to the setting up of the National Asset Management Agency and it was not the farmers who did the devil with the banks, so to speak.  They have done their work and contributed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and if they borrowed money the farmers paid it back.  There is no question but that they should be prioritised for additional credit in these times.</P>
        <P>Before leaving the topic of the flooding I want to tell a story about it because it is receding from the headlines already and with the budget I am sure it will not be spoken about for a while to come.  We had an experience in north Kerry, where I come from, in the early 1960s.  An independent TD in my town, Paddy Finucane, was the Jackie Healy-Rae of his day because his support was very important for the then minority Government of Se&aacute;n Lemass.  He was able to land fairly big projects but the biggest one he landed was the Cashen and Feale drainage scheme, which was put in place in the early 1960s.  That was a huge success and it restored hundreds of acres to gainful farming but as the years passed the essential monitoring and remedial works that should have been done were not carried out and as a result, ten years ago we were back to square one.  However, as a result of a great deal of pressure from politicians, including me, we got approval for a smaller remedial scheme and that stood to the farmers of north Kerry in recent weeks.  I am aware there was extensive flooding in the Minister&rsquo;s county and throughout the west but Kerry escaped the worst of it.  There must be ongoing monitoring of the schemes put in place, even the new schemes.  They cannot be put in and walked away from.  They have to be constantly maintained and improved, but that is a debate for another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A major issue is the question of farm prices and the under-pricing of farm product.  Despite all our protest and the best the Minister has been able to do, the Tescos and the multinationals are still calling the shots when it comes to what the farmer gets for his or her product and in <Col N="317"/>many cases he or she is not getting as much for his product as it costs him or her to produce it.  Something will have to be done about that and it deserves a separate debate because it is one of the issues affecting farmers, particularly now with the differential in sterling which has made it an even more critical issue for farmers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the good work the Minister has done with his counterparts in Europe in securing a &euro;300 million dairy fund, which will go some way towards alleviating this pricing problem.  I forgot to mention the fast forwarding of the single farm payment, which is a huge achievement for the Minister.  More than 70% of them have been paid, which is unprecedented, and the balance will be paid shortly.  I welcome the reference by the Minister of State to ensuring that the butter and milk products in intervention will be released in a controlled manner to ensure they will not flood the market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been some small recovery in milk prices recently but beef prices are still down.  Beef is clearly an expensive product and Irish beef, because of its high quality, has always been top rated and top priced.  In these recessionary times people all over Europe are starting to consider the cheaper options, and that is something we will have to consider also.</P>
        <P>We are talking about a non-quota situation after 2015.  That will be a monumental change.  We have been living in an era of quotas for the past 30 years and it will be a huge change when they are gone.  I hope Teagasc and the Department will help prepare farmers for that eventuality.</P>
        <P>Food quality has always been our strong point in Ireland.  We proved that when the pork crisis arose recently.  The response by the Government and the entire country was speedy and successful.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, and I endorse everything Senator de B&uacute;rca said about the initiatives he has taken on organic foods, farmers&rsquo; markets, labelling and the other initiatives which are driving Irish quality and giving us the reputation we deserve.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is to be commended on the release of cheese for the poor at this time of the year.  I appeal to housewives and everybody else to buy Irish products this Christmas.  They are better than any others.  I ask them to be patriotic and to buy Irish.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of agriculture needs to be considered in the immediate, medium and long term.  I am confident the agriculture industry will prosper in the medium and long term.  It will be the engine for the recovery of the economy.  There is great potential in the export of Irish food, particularly grass-based food products.  The Agri Vision 2020 strategy will be important in that context.  It is important for us to defend our ground in the CAP negotiations.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the state of the agriculture sector at this time.  Recent CSO figures confirm that farm incomes have decreased by 30% in the last year, on top of an 11% drop in the previous year.  We already knew this because we had heard the stories of the people we represent.  Farming families are facing huge hardship.  It is a real issue for many.  People are having to spend their insurance money and family savings.  They are running up bills in local shops and hardware stores.  That is how bad the farm income crisis has become.</P>
        <P>The suspension of admission to the rural environment protection scheme was a great error on a number of fronts.  It is obvious that it was an error in environmental terms.  I find it difficult to understand how the Green Party can rest easily in this respect, while making an issue of more trivial matters.  It is astonishing.  REPS 4 had great merit as a means of getting money back into the economy.  It funded many activities in rural economies.  It also provided a supplementary income from the European Union.  It seems farmers are to be moved from the rural environment protection scheme to the farm assist scheme.  Large numbers have moved to <Col N="318"/>the farm assist scheme, which is a shocking problem.  On 23 November some 8,681 farmers were receiving farm assist payments and a further 1,771 claims were pending.  I suspect that many in the latter category are among those whose REPS payments were suspended.  The removal of the farm retirement and installation aid schemes, like the reduction in the disadvantaged area scheme, was also an error.</P>
        <P>While we do not object in principle to the imposition of a carbon tax, its application to farm fuel and farm diesel would sound the death knell of the agriculture sector.  That is why we are advocating the introduction of a refund scheme for farmers.  That will have to be done.  My distinguished and erudite colleague, Senator McFadden, will discuss the welfare issues that arise in this context.  We also suggest gas and solid fire fuels, in which coal and briquettes are used, should be excluded from this proposal.  I emphasise that farm diesel should be excluded from the carbon tax regime.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister will have to address a couple of issues in the beef sector.  The Government should take a hands-on approach to the negotiation of a quality payment scheme in beef factories in order that good beef products are rewarded and exports increased.  We have developed a significant 54% dependence on the UK market in the last decade.  I suggest we target the lucrative markets of mainland Europe.  It is shocking that Irish-controlled meat factories in the United Kingdom, in which we have rightly invested &euro;50 million in recent times, are refusing to kill Irish cattle that have been exported.  That means they can pay less for Irish cattle here.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on what is being done about this specific matter.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has introduced the Food (Fair Trade and Information) Bill 2009 to cope with many of the huge issues associated with the things the multiples are doing wrong.  Often farm gate prices do not reflect the cost of production, for example, in the milk sector.  Many dairy farmers in my home county are barely meeting the cost of producing milk.  I ask for our farmers to be supported in the immediate term in order that the industry will have a long-term future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will never allow the heartache of those affected by flooding, the biggest issue I would like to discuss, to go off the agenda.  I have witnessed at first hand the flooding of farms, farm dwellings, farm yards and milking parlours under two metres of water.  It is psychologically stressful and detrimental to the well-being of Irish farming to see, for example, silage bales floating in flood waters.  The &euro;2 million in humanitarian aid provided is a pittance.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to highlight this problem.  He knows from his constituency that there is a great need.  I compliment those who have contributed to meeting that need.</P>
        <P>I suggest farm diesel and solid home fuels should be exempt from the carbon tax proposal which has been leaked to the media, especially in the case of farm families.  Turf cutting for domestic use should be allowed to continue.  I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, has left the Chamber because he needs to understand this deal needs to be renegotiated in order that Irish people can maintain the cultural tradition of turf cutting forever.  I do not think it has ever done harm to this country&rsquo;s flora and fauna.  I suggest those who engage in turf cutting are preserving the countryside.</P>
        <P>It should be a condition of the imminent sale of Greencore Malt that the malting of barley will continue.  I ask the Minister of State to take this on board.  As we have lost our sugar beet industry, we cannot to afford to lose this one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The agrifood sector plays a key role in the economy.  Its high export value gives it the potential to contribute significantly to <Col N="319"/>sustainable economic renewal.  It accounts for approximately 10% of the size of the economy and 66% of our indigenous exports.  Last year it exported food and drink worth &euro;8.2 billion to 170 markets around the world.  Global food demand is growing.  We cannot develop our agrifood exports in the absence of a viable farm sector.  Senator McFadden used her first-hand experience to tell the House that farmers and others in the agriculture industry are enduring hard times.  Farm incomes decreased by 13% in 2008 and are now 22% lower, in real terms, than they were in 1995.  It is worrying that product prices for farmers have fallen significantly this year.</P>
        <P>The agriculture industry, including the export-dependent agrifood sector, is of huge importance to the economy.  Some 270,000 people are employed in the industry, including the agrifood sector and related services.  I am sorry to have to say the Government&rsquo;s closure of the rural environment protection scheme has dealt a serious blow to farmers, particularly lower income cattle and sheep farmers.  More than 30,000 farmers will be forced out of the scheme in the next two years.  Their only option will be to participate in the inadequately funded agri-environmental scheme which might not satisfy EU requirements.  Even worse, it is possible that the loss of the rural environment protection scheme will cause us to lose the potential to market our food as environmentally finished.  There has been a view that the scheme could be used as a marketing tool to sell Irish food in discerning EU markets.  The scheme would stand as a mark of quality, in effect, particularly now that the European Union is moving towards improved food information labels.  In closing down the rural environment protection scheme we are closing off this significant potential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Killeen.  The presence of his ministerial colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, whom I congratulate on much of the work he has done for the food industry, was also welcome.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this topic which is of great importance if we are to get out of the recession.  For many generations agriculture has been the basis of growth and work for the population and the business that kept families going.  However, we must move forward and find a better way.  It has been noted that world food demand is growing at an enormous rate and that in a number of years 50% more food will be required.  In Ireland the dairy and beef sectors are in a state of crisis.  As one of the finest producers of beef and milk in the world, the appropriate marketing is lacking and the Government is falling down in the marketing of Irish products.  While organisations such as the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Limited have done tremendous work, they require some help to market products.  The Government should facilitate organisations such as the agricultural co-operative societies in their efforts to gain markets abroad for the great produce and products produced in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government is falling down in respect of education.  I refer, in particular, to the proposed closure of Mountbellew College, the last agricultural college in the west.  For many generations it has trained farmers, farm managers and agricultural graduates.  Its closure is being proposed at a time when it is operating at full capacity and offering some great courses in conjunction with GMIT, Galway.  It is a highly retrograde step for the Government to stand idly by and allow Teagasc to close the only remaining agricultural college in the west.  Not too long ago there were three such agricultural colleges in the west, as well as 11 or 12 nationally, but that number has fallen to approximately three.</P>
        <P>The Government should be examining this area of education.  I recently read an article pertaining to the Netherlands, in which there are 14 or more agricultural colleges.  Night courses are available in such colleges, as well as courses on every aspect of agriculture, marketing, processing and so forth.  If we are to gain from our agricultural base, education must play a <Col N="320"/>part.  Even at this late stage the Government should tell Teagasc that education is the way forward and that it should train both young farmers and those who will work in the agriculture sector in the years to come.  Such persons need education and a good foundation in agriculture.  While this measure may save &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million in the short term, in the long term such facilities would provide a great basis of education for those who intend to enter this line of business.</P>
        <P>The market gardening sector is one in which millions of euro can be saved through import substitution.  A glance at shelves throughout the country will show that vegetables are imported on a massive scale.  Were the Government to prioritise education and work in close co-operation with co-operative societies, Ireland undoubtedly would be able to substitute the entire range of fresh and frozen vegetables being imported on a massive scale.  I refer to potatoes, potato chips, vegetables and so forth which are being imported in processed, frozen and fresh form on a massive scale.  The Government has not done enough in this regard.  While I must compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, who has done some work in this area, the matter requires urgent attention.  This is a measure that would pay for itself in the long run, were a proper education to be provided and the proper marketing measures put in place.  While I acknowledge it probably would be necessary to put in place the proper processing units on a co-operative basis, it could provide a great foundation, prevent imports and lead to the creation of many thousands of jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Members who participated in the debate, particularly those who were positive in what is a difficult time for farmers, as it is important to send a positive message.  Many Members who considered this topic in considerable detail noted there were good reasons to be positive in the medium to long term.  Senator Bradford dealt with commodity prices, as did virtually every other speaker, and with concerns relating to CAP reform post-2012.  As for the carbon tax, in common with virtually everyone else who mentioned it, he considered the concept to be positive but had concerns about the additional burden in respect of agrifuel costs.  He also acknowledged the positive role of REPS.</P>
        <P>Senator Carty mentioned several issues, including one important subject, namely, the role of the banks which surprisingly was not dealt with by many speakers.  One must acknowledge the positive impact of the guarantee scheme in September 2008 and subsequently the NAMA legislation and the investment in the banks by the Government.  I was interested this morning to hear the Taoiseach being questioned about its cost by a party which had advocated nationalisation of the banks at several times the cost of the strategy that has been adopted.  Certainly, Senator Carty is correct in that there have been enormous difficulties with the banking sector, most of which arose from the difficulties facing the sector.  This issue has been addressed by the Government and will gradually show positive results.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Senator Prendergast mentioned the floods, as did most Members, as well as the negative impact on farmers of bad weather over virtually three seasons.  She also mentioned, in respect of commodities, the glut of cattle and the difficulty with cattle prices.  A theme across the entire debate in the Seanad has been the impact of low commodity prices at a time when there are other difficulties also.  However, I considered the Senator&rsquo;s contribution to be extraordinarily negative, as this is not what farmers need to hear from either the Government or the political classes.  Having attended Council of Ministers meetings across seven or eight directorates in the four Departments in which I have served, I have been enormously impressed by the grasp of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, of the issues involved, as well as his capacity to put across forcefully the Irish viewpoint.  In the last year or so he has <Col N="321"/>convinced doubting fellow Ministers that market interventions are possible in milk price supports and other areas.  He has put in a massive performance as a Minister at European level.  For instance, his handling of the pork dioxin scare this time last year had an extraordinarily positive result because had it gone badly, it would have threatened the entire basis of our exports.  I also have seen him engage in the battle on budgetary discussions and his commitment to agriculture and the outcomes he has achieved have been highly positive.  Senator Prendergast also mentioned the potential of the agriculture and food industries, on which we must work together to try to promote.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien commended the Minister on early payments and drew attention to some policy successes.  Senator John Paul Phelan also mentioned milk prices and the loss of the construction sector as a contributor to incomes in rural Ireland.  One point that interests me when I come into the Seanad is that I sometimes hear Members saying things that reflect what is being said on the ground but which are the exact opposite of what their party spokespersons are saying in the D&aacute;il.  He also mentioned difficulties in electronic sheep tagging.  The agreed European scheme has been introduced in the vast majority of other countries and only Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Ireland continue to be opposed to it.  Despite the success of our 13-digit system, the 12-digit system is in operation in Europe and will come into force here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to the role of climate change and the fact that we need to address it in its entirety and not just pick the pieces which suit us.  She also paid tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, for his work in the organic sector.  I mirror that tribute because having worked closely with him in the past year and a half, the new thinking he has introduced has been very positive.  He has the advantage of being in the Department a year longer than the Minister and me.  New thinking, such as the hemp industry to which Senator de B&uacute;rca referred, is very positive.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty mentioned the report done by his colleague, Deputy Morgan, and the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, something I look forward to seeing.  His approach regarding employment was generally positive and he had an optimism for the future, notwithstanding worries we sometimes have about CAP, the WTO and so on.  The value to local economies is something we need to remember.</P>
        <P>The Senator also mentioned aquaculture.  I do not want to use time here now because I will have an opportunity to speak on a fisheries debate in the not too distant future.  However, there are considerations to be taken into account regarding Natura 2000 sites and the December 2007 European Court of Justice judgment which impacts on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan encapsulated the Irish farm when he referred to resilience, courage, optimism and endeavour.  That is one reason we need to be and can afford to be optimistic.  He and a number of other speakers mentioned multinational companies in the retail sector, something with which the Minister has been dealing very strongly.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, led by the T&aacute;naiste, has also been trying to address the issue.  The sterling differential, which the Senator also mentioned, has posed particular problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Reilly also had confidence in the long term, which I welcome, particularly in regard to the 2020 strategy.  He juxtaposed that against the current hardship in the area, which is something we are all trying to deal with, with some success.  He asked about Irish-controlled beef factories in United Kingdom.  The Minister has taken a very proactive role in that regard.  There are complications and other dimensions which do not lead to an easy resolution of the issue.</P><Col N="322"/>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P Just="Left">On the various REP schemes, it is important to remember that they were always intended to be environmental schemes.  In some instances, there were very substantial costs to farmers and they were never intended as an income supplement.  Arguments in favour of REPS tend to founder on that misconception.  Senator McFadden mentioned the impact of flooding and the loss of feedstuff.  It brings home the threats facing people.  She was concerned that &euro;2 million may not be sufficient to address the problem.  I assure the House it is a matter which will be kept under review.  Senator Mary White outlined the expert value of the sector, which is very positive.  I assure the House REPS is not closed and the current schemes ensure it will continue until at least 2014.  The new scheme, which the Minister will introduce during 2010, will ensure it continues beyond that date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Burke outlined the importance of agriculture and the crisis in commodity prices, in particular in beef and milk.  He attributed it in part to a marketing deficit.  We also need to remember that the economic downturn is not confined to Ireland and has a particular impact on some of the markets to which we traditionally export some of our goods, which do not have the level of demand and consumption they previously had.  He also discussed the role of education and agricultural colleges.  We all acknowledge that education has a particularly potent and positive role in regard to agriculture.  All kinds of new methods are being developed and everything is not done the traditional way.  The Senator, like a number of other speakers, mentioned the importation of vegetables and other food products and how we need to try to counter that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is fair to say that the last two years and this year in particular have been very difficult for farmers.  However, while the medium-term outlook is for an improvement in market conditions for our core products, many farmers are facing immediate cash flow problems.  Therefore, the Supplementary Estimate which was brought forward by the Minister is of particular value.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, said, there is no additional Exchequer funding involved but it comes from savings and additional EU receipts arising in the Department.  The effects of a cash injection of &euro;120 million to the primary farming sector through the rural environment protection scheme and the bringing forward of payments due in 2010 under the farm waste management scheme have to have a significant beneficial effect on farmers&rsquo; cash flow.</P>
        <P>We all acknowledge that the recent flooding has damaged fodder and caused a resulting feed shortage problem on some livestock farms.  This has given rise to financial hardship and to potential animal welfare issues.  In response to this situation, a fodder aid scheme has been introduced to provide some financial support towards the purchase of alternative feed material to replace the fodder damaged by flooding.  Applications were available to affected farmers from early last week and it is hoped that payments to farmers will be issued shortly.  The Supplementary Estimate, while is totally unrelated to the flooding issue, will at the same time provide some increased cash flow in the short term for some of the farmers affected by the flooding and other difficulties.</P>
        <P>One of the issues is the closure of the REP scheme to new applicants.  The scheme was very successful with more than &euro;2 billion being paid to Irish farmers since it was introduced in 1994.  However, there was no option but to close REPS to new applications in July.  The decision was taken against the background of the situation in the public finances, the resources available to the Department and the substantial and continuing growth in the number of REPS participants.</P>
        <P>Despite the closure of the scheme, payments due to REPS farmers for 2009 and 2010 will be the highest ever.  Almost 17,000 applications were received up to the closing date of 15 May 2009, and it is safe to assume they include the great majority of those whose REPS 3 contracts are ending this year.  These applications are now being processed with a view to getting pay<Col N="323"/>ments out as soon as possible.  More than 1,600 extra applications came in between 16 May and 9 July, the date the scheme closed, and these will be processed as applications for 2010.  All REPS contracts will run their full course.  This means that farmers will be receiving payments in REPS right up to 2014.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department will continue to support farmers to improve the environment.  It is planned to introduce a new agri-environment scheme in 2010 which will reduce compliance costs to participants and provide a menu of targeted actions from which farmers may choose.  Funding for the new scheme will include the additional modulation funds which the Minister ensured would be retained for the benefit of Irish farmers in the negotiations on the CAP health check.  It will also include additional matching Exchequer funding.  It is hoped to secure agreement for this new scheme soon.  Subject to the state of the public finances, the aim is to introduce a scheme which will be available to as many as possible of those who will finish their existing REPS contracts in 2010 and 2011.</P>
        <P>However, the longer-term viability of the agrifood industry can only be achieved by improving competitiveness, identifying market opportunities outside the UK and developing strategies for coping with volatility, especially in the dairy sector.  Unlocking innovation potential will be key to the industry&rsquo;s next phase of development.  This will need to be a team effort.  The Department and development agencies have supported investment, marketing and research measures specifically directed to support the development of the food and drinks industry.  More than &euro;180 million in investment aid has been awarded to improve efficiencies and add value under the dairy, beef and sheepmeat investment funds which are operated by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of the Department.</P>
        <P>In terms of smaller businesses, grant aid of &euro;16.7 million was awarded in December 2008 for marketing and processing investment by 66 small meat establishments, marts and horticulture enterprises.  This is expected to contribute to investment of &euro;70 million and will assist the businesses involved to improve efficiency, add quality and value, produce innovative products and develop new markets.  While money is extremely tight, sometimes even a modest amount can leverage a fine result.  In the marketing area, an additional &euro;2.5 million was provided to Bord Bia earlier this year to identify market opportunities within the European Union and work with the industry on developing new products.  This has stimulated new initiatives to deliver market gains, including the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and Bord Bia fellowships, which are placing 25 highly qualified graduates to work in export markets on developing opportunities meeting specific company needs.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for fish marketing was transferred to Bord Bia in June to enable seafood companies benefit from the expertise of a dedicated food marketing agency.  European Union co-funding of &euro;235,000 over three years has been made available to Bord Bia to develop sales of quality assured European Union pork, offal and beef products in Asian markets.</P>
        <P>Senators can readily see that every effort is being made to develop an agrifood industry that is sustainable and capable of developing further in the future.  The Agri Vision 2020 strategy, when finalised, will act as a roadmap for the future development of the industry.  This will only be achieved by all sides of the industry working together and with the support of the Department.  My ministerial colleagues and I are fully committed to working with and supporting the industry through this difficult period.</P>

    <Title>Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2009: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to consider the Bill.  I am pleased to bring the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2009 before the House on behalf of the Labour Party.  The Bill extends the definition of prohibitive commercial practices in section 55 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The Bill adds a new paragraph to the list of prohibited commercial practices.  Under the Bill it will be a prohibited commercial practice to sell or offer for sale a gift voucher with a redemption period of less than five years.  The net effect will be that all vouchers will remain valid for five years following the passing of the Bill, should it be passed.  It shall be an offence under section 56 of the 2007 Act to contravene this provision.  Consumers will have a right of action for damages for breach of the provision under section 74 of the 2007 Act.  It is a short and simple Bill, which we have deliberately decided not to over-complicate by trying to resolve all potential difficulties with gift vouchers and rather deal with one specific matter only.</P>
        <P>I shall outline the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 amends section 55(1) of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to prohibit the issue of a gift voucher with a period of validity of less than five years.  Section 2 is a standard provision.  Regarding financial and regulatory implications, the Bill has no implications for public expenditure, but the protections for consumers will enhance confidence and will have positive economic implications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With Christmas approaching people are considering gift possibilities.  Rather than choosing a gift, many people decide to purchase a gift voucher to present to a family member, colleague or friend.  As we all know the commercial world has convinced many people that gifts should be presented on many other occasions throughout the year.  Gift vouchers are great; I have given and received many in my lifetime.  We are introducing the Bill because in practice many consumers have problems with them.  One common problem with gift vouchers is that they may have an expiry date that may have passed by the time there is an attempt to redeem them.  In many cases the expiry date can be as short as three to six months.  As many retail outlets make gift vouchers available which have no expiry date, there is not a problem with all gift vouchers.  However, just because a gift voucher does not have an expiry date printed on it, does not mean there is no expiry date.  It is not a guarantee of an open-ended expiry date policy.</P>
        <P>The National Consumer Agency&rsquo;s website, <i>www.consumerconnect.ie</i> provides a comprehensive list of outlets together with their gift voucher expiry date policies.  While many good policies have no expiry dates, it is usually the ones with the short shelf-life that cause the problems.  There is no reason for having an expiry date on gift vouchers.  There is nothing perishable about them.  They are usually made of paper or cardboard.  Most importantly, the money has been exchanged for the value of the voucher not for the voucher itself.</P>
        <P>Some dedicated gift voucher companies, who, perhaps, may build in some percentage of non-redeemed vouchers into their business model, may feel that the transition to a five-year expiry date would present them with some initial cash-flow issues.  However, many jurisdictions have moved to outlaw such practices, which is what we are attempting to do today with this Bill.  The US has moved at federal level to prohibit gift cards or vouchers expiring before five years from the date of purchase.  In Canada, different states have different policies.  However, in 1997 Ontario and Manitoba moved to prohibit expiry dates on gift cards and other states are also moving now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although our proposal is for an expiry date of no less than five years, we would be open to argument on Committee Stage that there may be a case for something shorter.  There has been much discussion on the matter of gift vouchers in recent years.  It is now time to address one <Col N="325"/>of those issues.  We are consciously not trying to address other possible difficulties with gift vouchers in the Bill at this stage.  Some of these are: partially used vouchers and varying policies on getting change; change of shop ownership; and possible closing down of the business before an attempt to redeem the voucher is made.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the Bill, the case has been made to me that a distinction might be made between vouchers with a stated monetary value and those based upon an agreed provision of service.  In the latter circumstance, the cost of delivering the service may have escalated over the five-year period and thus it may be unfair to expect the provider to provide the specified service at the rate that was paid.  However, this can be considered on Committee Stage.  There may be merit in a two-tier system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to hearing the contributions of other Senators. I hope the Minister of State will give the Bill his support at this Stage and introduce any amendments he may consider necessary on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and second the motion pertaining to this Bill which is being presented by my colleague Senator Ryan.  I compliment him on his legislation which could enhance the rights of consumers at the stroke of a pen.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing that the Government has failed to act in this area.  For the last 12 and a half years it has caved in to powerful vested interests such as bankers and builders while allowing ordinary consumers to be hung out to dry with inflated prices and poor service.  We need a new and enlightened approach to consumer policy and rights.  A coherent consumer rights policy ensures consumers get what they have paid for and can easily and quickly secure redress when things go wrong.</P>
        <P>We also need to ensure consumer advocacy organisations have a greater role in the policy and decision-making process.  In 1962, in a seminal speech on this issue, President John F. Kennedy described a situation that is unfortunately too often the case in Ireland.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Consumers, by definition, include us all.  They are the largest economic group, affecting and affected by almost every public and private economic decision.  Yet they are the only important group ... whose views are often not heard.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is true that consumers here enjoy greater rights than before, particularly as a result of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  However, we can thank the European Union for that development because much of the legislation consisted of the transposition of the unfair commercial practices directive into Irish law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the issues we must consider is the enforcement of existing consumer rights because consumer legislation will only make a real difference when it is applied and enforced.  Many wronged consumers, when they seek to obtain redress or make a claim, face barriers.  This happens every day.  Retailers try to absolve themselves of responsibility and put people off complaining by forcing consumers to go through complicated and lengthy processes to obtain redress.  Some traders operate a &ldquo;fob off and frustrate&rdquo; policy which is predicated on the fact that people have busy lives and are likely to give up and forget about the complaint.  A classic example is the practice of some airlines to demand an administration charge or insist on customers putting their claims in writing within seven days of any problem they have.  Some businesses appear to think they can cut corners and treat consumers with disdain.  That is a short-sighted approach.  Most consumers are reasonable people.  If they have a problem that is dealt with quickly and fairly, they are likely to provide repeat business.  If they are treated badly and feel their problems are ignored, however, they will bad-mouth the businesses involved, which is no good for anybody.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P>A study by the National Consumer Agency published in August found that even though four out of ten consumers had reason to make a complaint in the past year, almost one third of these did not bother.  One out of every five said they did not want the hassle of complaining, 25% said they did not have the time, another 20% said there was no point in making a complaint, and one in seven said they worried that making a complaint might have an impact on them.  Of those who did complain, two out of three felt frustrated by the whole process.  These data raise real worries about how we deal with complaints in our society.  It suggests that some businesses are not responding adequately to the complaints of consumers and are making the process time-consuming, frustrating and challenging for people who feel they have a complaint that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>We need to consider ways of assisting consumers in obtaining redress.  We have done it before.  The introduction of the Small Claims Court allowed individual consumers to seek remedy in a fairly inexpensive and swift manner.  However, I accept this does not suit every situation.  There are other things we could do.  The Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland has proposed the introduction of a group action procedure.  Group actions &mdash; legal procedures which allow people with similar claims to come together to take cases against the same defendant or defendants &mdash; are growing in popularity across Europe.  Fourteen out of the 27 EU member states have this procedure.  The CAI gives examples in which the group action procedure could be applied, suggesting that cases could be taken against a telecommunications company for overcharging, retailers that are colluding to keep prices high, or an airline for the imposition of unfair charges.  It gives a good example from Portugal in which a group action was taken against a telephone company which was found to have been overcharging consumers over a number of years.  The company in question was, in the end, forced to give refunds to all customers who could produce bills, which more than 70,000 did.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this country, unfortunately, the Government has managed to undermine both the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority at a time when they should be fighting on behalf of consumers.  In October of last year the Government announced the merger of the NCA with the Competition Authority, yet 14 months on nothing has happened.  I call on the Minister to move forward with this reorganisation as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>While the NCA and the Competition Authority have done good work, we must explore whether they are fit for purpose.  The lack of legal action by these organisations in cases in which there has been a breach of law has been disappointing.  In contrast, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has not been afraid to take on the big guns on behalf of consumers.  Last year alone, the ombudsman dealt with almost 6,000 cases, two thirds of which were resolved in favour of consumers, and it is estimated that &euro;45 million has been refunded to consumers since 2005.  Given the positive outcome of the establishment of the ombudsman, we should consider establishing a general consumer ombudsman, such as exists in Denmark, or a high-profile consumer advocate as proposed by the UK Government.</P>
        <P>I make a plea to the Minister for the development of a new approach to consumer policy.  For too long it has been underdeveloped, poorly understood and badly enforced.  A clear consumer rights policy would be good not only for consumers but also for business and for society as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the former Senator Michael Dawson, who I see is in the Visitors Gallery, back to the House.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I commend Senators Ryan and Hannigan on the introduction of this Bill.  I understand it seeks to prohibit the commercial practice of selling, or offering for sale, gift vouchers with a <Col N="327"/>period of less than five years from the date of sale for the purpose of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  Like Senator Ryan, I am a person who has both given and received gift vouchers.  There is no doubt they can sometimes prove beneficial.  We are all aware of practices that occur in certain instances.  For somebody who is celebrating a particular event, who would like to achieve certain things and identifies a particular pattern or structure to which people can go to give their piece to the party, for want of a better description, it can be helpful in providing a bigger picture and allowing the beneficiary to pick what he or she wants.  I refer to somebody who is perhaps celebrating an event in his or her life.  The easiest example to which to refer would be a wedding party, where a person would indicate a list in a shop or that one could buy a voucher in a particular outlet, which can be hugely helpful and beneficial.</P>
        <P>As Senator Ryan mentioned, no doubt there are problems experienced by both the purchasers and the recipients of gift vouchers which probably require even fuller consideration than there is in the Bill, but it is to be hoped the Bill is a starting point.  I would like to think that the House and the Government are committed through a number of actions to outline how best this can be achieved.  In that regard, I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, has to say on how we can address the problems and improve the existing system.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that the Consumer Protection Act 2007, among other things, transposed the EU unfair commercial practices directive, UCPD, into Irish law and that section 55 of the 2007 Act essentially gave statutory effect to the list of the 31 specific commercial practices contained in the annex to the directive which were stipulated as being considered unfair in all circumstances.  The UCPD was a maximum harmonised Community measure and the list of prohibited commercial practices specified in the directive&rsquo;s annex was also exhaustive in its nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my understanding &mdash; the Minister of State may clarify this point &mdash; that as a result,<?oasys _jy ?>it is not open to Ireland to add unilaterally to the list of practices which are prohibited through the EU, as would be the case if this Bill were to be enacted.  However, the UCPD contains a review clause which requires the European Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of the directive, including any proposals to<?oasys _jy ?>revise the directive by June 2011.  It is open to Ireland to seek to add to the list of commercial practices prohibited under the directive and I understand this issue can be considered in the context of any review of the UCPD.  It will be interesting to hear whether the Minister of State is happy merely to seek that particular mechanism or would like to see, as I mentioned, a fuller consideration and a better readjustment to address all the difficulties and problems.</P>
        <P>Seemingly, it is being accepted on both sides of the House not alone that there are problems but that they are encountered by both the purchaser and the recipient.  There are probably others &mdash; those in the voucher business &mdash; who may be in a position to assist the Minister of State and work with him and his office to improve the current system.</P>
        <P>We are not talking about the UCPD alone.  I understand people are aware of concerns expressed by consumers and others about the manner in which some gift vouchers are offered for sale, and especially the difficulties consumers have experienced when seeking to redeem vouchers for related goods or services.  Therefore none of us would be unsympathetic to addressing some of the issues contained in Senator Ryan&rsquo;s Bill.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>My son brought to my attention recently that he was dealing with a gift voucher issue.  When he went to see whether he could utilise a voucher for a sum, say &euro;100, he could not do so.  The best the shop could come up with in the festive season where there was nothing in the shop that met his need was to offer to split the voucher in two so as to have two vouchers to give <Col N="328"/>as gifts.  They would not give him back the money and I suppose in the scheme of things it probably was not a bad offer.</P>
        <P>I am particularly annoyed when I receive a gift in the form of a small sheet of paper indicating that it is voucher for a meal for two in a restaurant and I go to cash it in the company of a friend, wife, partner, neighbour or whoever only to be shown the small print on the back stating it is not redeemable on Thursday or Friday nights between the hours of 8 o&rsquo;clock and 10 o&rsquo;clock.  Such pure nonsense must be addressed.  Cash is king.  If a purchaser pays his or her hard-earned cash for a &euro;100 voucher, that should be honoured left, right and centre as long as the cows take to come home and regardless of the time of day.  That would be my short and simple version of how a voucher should be utilised.</P>
        <P>I have experience of this voucher system and the number of vouchers that are redeemed because my wife has a premises in which she offers vouchers.  It is amazing the number of vouchers purchased which are not redeemed, and this is through a system where, for want of a better description, there are no holds barred.  She uses a system where one gives the voucher which may be cashed at any time.  I understand that the current system allows the retailer to dictate the redeemability of a voucher.</P>
        <P>The sale of items such as gift vouchers or gift tokens should be conducted in as transparent a manner as possible with terms and conditions on such matters as redeemable periods attaching to such items.  I ask the Minister of State and his Department to examine the possibility of making regulations under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 with a view to prescribing specific information to make it as easy as I said.  If it is a voucher, it should be treated as if it were cash.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation and the efforts of the Labour Party to bring an end to what I would deem to be an unfair commercial anomaly.  I very much agree with what has been said by the previous speaker, Senator Callely.  Even though I may not have the option of being here because I am substituting for Senator John Paul Phelan and I must revert to another meeting, I look forward to learning of the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>This is the type of initiative brought forward by Opposition Senators which should be taken on board by the Government.  I can see no reason we would not be in a position to make this minor amendment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">It is an appropriate day to hold this debate.  In the other House this afternoon the Minister for Finance had to introduce a Budget Statement to try to deal with the economic crisis in the country.  We could debate forever what and who caused the problem and what needs to be done to redress the economic situation facing us, but certainly one of the clear matters of concern to the body politic is the lack of competitiveness in the economy.  Obviously, that lack of competitiveness has led to job losses, taxation and revenue reductions.  Some of that competitiveness has been lost because of excessive regulation, bureaucracy and red tape.  This case, where we are talking about the limit being placed on a gift voucher, is part of that same cycle of commercial bureaucracy and retailers using their financial power to extract the last drop from the consumer.  If we are to attempt to turn the economy around and generate trade, income, wealth, profit, jobs and taxes, we must simply shred every last vestige of restrictive practice, and this is one of them.  I concede that it is probably not the biggest issue facing the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  Notwithstanding that, however, a solution for it has been designed and presented to us, which we should accept.  There is no genuine reason gift vouchers should only have a three, six or 12-month shelf life.  Therefore the proposed amendment to the Consumer Protection Act is realistic, workable and worthy of support.  Previous speakers have highlighted cases whereby people receive gift vouch<Col N="329"/>ers and put them away for later use.  To their great disappointment and financial upset, however, they may find that the voucher has expired.  If the small print had been read with a magnifying glass, they would have seen the expiry date.  As we are trying to generate trade and growth in the economy, such restrictive practices should be dropped.  Such practices are not useful or beneficial in any area of commercial life and therefore the Minister of State needs to resolve this problem.  I look forward to hearing what he has to say.  It would be disappointing if the old Irish political style of Opposition proposing and Government rejecting were to apply in this case.  I can see no good reason this Bill cannot be accepted.</P>
        <P>Presumably the Bill would not be retrospective and would apply to gift vouchers issued from the date of the enactment of the amending legislation.  In that case, no retailers could complain that they were suffering as a result of new legislation.  This is a straightforward, black and white case.  It is a good proposal that has been made on quite a few occasions by Senator Brendan Ryan.  Just because it is an Opposition proposal, it does not mean it is either inadequate or erroneous.  In the spirit of the politics we generally have in this House of co-operation and respect for others&rsquo; views, I ask the Minister of State to take on board these good ideas and accept the proposed Bill.  It would be a first for Senator Ryan and his colleagues for such a Bill to be accepted by the Government.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Unfortunately, I think normal politics have been resumed.  Tradition has it that Oppositions propose while Governments reject, but the opposite could equally apply.  As it is unfortunate that this debate clashes with the budget debate in the D&aacute;il, as it might be overshadowed in terms of the coverage it merits.  That is regrettable.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo;  Bill.  The Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2009 seeks to prohibit the sale of gift vouchers where the period of redemption from the date of sale of the voucher is less than five years.  The Bill proposes to achieve this statutory prohibition by way of an amendment to the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  Specifically, the Bill proposes to amend section 55 of the Act by adding to the list of prohibited practices the &ldquo;selling or offering for sale a voucher redeemable for gifts, goods or services which is valid for a period which is less than five years from the date on which the voucher is sold or offered for sale&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>By the insertion of this provision, the Bill proposes to make the practice of selling gift vouchers with redemption periods of less than five years illegal, and render those engaging in this practice liable to prosecution under the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I have some sympathy with the sentiment underlying the Bill, there are several specific reasons I am not in a position to support the Bill.  The most prominent of these relates to the provenance of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 and, in particular, Part 3 of the Act, which includes section 55, as it relates to business to consumer commercial practices.  Section 55 essentially transposed the EU directive on unfair commercial practices, or the UCPD as it is commonly referred to, which included a list of 31 commercial practices deemed to be unfair in all circumstances.  The UCPD is a maximum harmonised community measure, the implications of which I will deal with later in my address.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 3 of the Consumer Protection Act essentially transposed into Irish law European Directive No. 2005/29 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market, as agreed by the European Parliament and the Council in May 2005.  The promulgation of the unfair commercial practices directive was one of the most significant con<Col N="330"/>sumer protection measures adopted by the EU in recent times.  The purpose of the directive is to harmonise the laws of member states with regard to unfair commercial practices, which directly harm the economic interests of consumers.</P>
        <P>The directive essentially regulates unfair commercial practices in the Community in several ways.  First, it provides for a general prohibition on practices which are contrary to the principle of good faith in a trader&rsquo;s field of activity, or are contrary to the standard of skill that a trader may be reasonably expected to exercise in respect of the consumer.  The general prohibition also requires that the practice would be likely to impair the average consumer&rsquo;s ability to make an informed choice about the product or service which the trader is seeking to sell, and also cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision he or she would not otherwise make.</P>
        <P>In addition to the overall prohibition, the directive contained general prohibitions on misleading and aggressive commercial practices.  In terms of misleading commercial practices, the directive set out various considerations to be taken into account in determining whether a particular commercial practice would be considered to be misleading.  The directive also required that the test of impairing the average consumer&rsquo;s ability to make an informed choice and the transactional decision test should be applied concerning the determination of misleading commercial practices.</P>
        <P>Similarly, in the case of aggressive commercial practices, the directive prescribed a number of factors to be taken into account in determining whether a particular practice was aggressive, and that such determinations should be subject to the aforementioned average consumer and transactional decision tests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The directive proscribed a number of specific practices, 31 in total, which were to be considered unfair in all circumstances. This blacklist, which was effectively transposed into law by section 55 of the Consumer Protection Act, essentially relates to practices which were deemed sufficiently egregious as not to require the average consumer and transactional decision tests.  In so far as the 31 specific practices in the blacklist are concerned, they would include particular practices which can seriously disadvantage consumers, such as: representing that a product can cure an illness, when it cannot; representing that a product is able to facilitate winning in games of chance; representing that a trader is a signatory to a code of practice, if he is not; representing that a code of practice has an approval or other endorsement that it does not have; representing that a trader is about to cease trading when he is not; representing that a consumer has won or will win a prize if there actually is no prize; or, if the consumer has to make a payment or incur a loss to claim the prize; failing to comply with a consumer&rsquo;s request to leave the consumer&rsquo;s residence; persistently failing to comply with a consumer&rsquo;s request to cease communicating with or sending unwanted or unsolicited representations to the consumer; and establishing, operating or promoting a pyramid promotional scheme.</P>
        <P>While a significant number of the 31 practices proscribed in the directive would most likely have been caught by the provisions of existing Irish consumer protection law, some would not.  Accordingly, the transposition of the directive by the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 provided significant additional protections for Irish consumers against unfair commercial practices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have advised the House, the key issue concerning the unfair commercial practices directive is that &mdash; unlike previous Community measures in this area, such as the directives on misleading advertising and door-to-door selling, which lay down minimum standards with<?oasys _jy ?>which member states must comply &mdash; the UCPD is a maximum harmonisation measure.<?oasys _jy ?>Effectively this precludes member states from going beyond the provisions of the directive by <Col N="331"/>adopting additional or more extensive protections within the field harmonised by the directive.  In this regard, it is important to note that the list of 31 practices deemed under the directive to be unfair in all instances, is an exhaustive list.  It is not open to Ireland to unilaterally add to the list by amending section 55 of the Consumer Protection Act, as is proposed in this<?oasys _jy ?>Bill.</P>
        <P>The only way in which the blacklist can be modified is by way of a revision of the UCPD itself.  The directive commits the European Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of the UCPD and on any proposals to revise the directive by June 2011.  Member states will have an opportunity in this context to make proposals to amend the directive, including its blacklist of prohibited commercial practices.</P>
        <P>Though the maximum harmonisation nature of the directive limits the legislative discretion of member states, this limitation must be seen in light of the advantages of harmonisation both for consumers and traders.  Consumers benefit from the fact that they can rely on a common set of protections when they make purchases in any member state of the Community, whether on-line or in person.  They do not have the burden of trying to establish what protections apply under the national legislation in force in another member state.  Traders who wish to sell goods and services in other member states benefit similarly from the fact that a common set of rules applies across all 27 countries.  This is a real benefit to a country as reliant on the export of goods and services as Ireland and of particular value to indigenous small and medium-sized enterprises which wish to access markets in other member states but do not have the specialist legal and other resources available to larger firms.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of European law which may impinge on this area is the current proposal for an EU directive on consumer rights which was published in October 2008 and is the subject of intensive discussions at the relevant Council working group.  In this regard, the House may be aware that I established the sales law review group in November 2008 to report to me on several issues relating to consumer and commercial law, taking into account the implications of the proposed directive for national consumer protection law.  The review group&rsquo;s report which was published in June is a thorough, expert analysis of the provisions of the proposed consumer rights directive.  The proposed directive will have a major influence on the future of Irish consumer law and it is important that we are in a position to fully understand its provisions and their implications while discussions on the proposal are still ongoing.  The review group&rsquo;s report is a substantial input into the Irish response to the proposed directive and its contents have already been of significant benefit to the officials of my Department involved in discussions on the proposal.</P>
        <P>Aside from the considerations of European law, I am, as I said, not unsympathetic to the sentiments underlying the Bill and particularly the difficulties consumers can experience when seeking to redeem vouchers they may have bought or received by way of gifts.  Undoubtedly, gift vouchers and tokens offer alternative and flexible purchasing and selling channels for consumers and traders.  Their popularity, particularly around this time of year, is in no small measure due to their flexible characteristics in that they allow people to purchase goods and services as gifts for recipients who can choose to avail of the goods and services at a time best suited to the recipient.  Unfortunately, the prepayment nature inherent in gift vouchers also can bring particular problems for consumers.  These problems can range from expiry dates that have lapsed to having a voucher for a shop that has closed down, something which, unfortunately, is more common in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that the periods for redeeming vouchers differ from trader to trader.  In some instances traders may stipulate that a consumer has up to a specific period from the date of purchase to redeem a voucher and in others traders are more flexible and willing to <Col N="332"/>extend the expiry date, if requested.  Often, however, difficulties arise because the purchaser or, more usually, the recipient of the voucher is not aware that the expiry date for the voucher has passed.  This can be due to either the expiry date not being particularly transparent in the terms and conditions accompanying the voucher or because no expiry date is stated on the voucher.  It could be put in a drawer and forgotten about, and then pulled out later.  If a man then wants to take his wife out for a meal and the voucher is found to be out of date, this can be very embarrassing.  In so far as the latter situation is concerned, the Consumer Protection Act provides that traders who omit or conceal material information or provide such information in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner may be engaging in a misleading commercial practice.  Accordingly, consumers who cannot redeem a voucher on the basis of the trader&rsquo;s reliance on the voucher having passed the expiry date, despite the consumer not being informed of any such date, may wish to exercise their rights under the Consumer Protection Act to take an action before the courts on the basis that the trader may have engaged in a misleading commercial practice.</P>
        <P>Some commentators have suggested prohibiting traders from imposing redemption periods on gift vouchers or requiring that redemption periods be of a minimum of five or ten years duration.  For my part, any suggestion of imposing a statutory obligation that a trader must honour a gift voucher into the future would be problematic and inimical to both the interests of the trader and the purchaser of the voucher.  Such an obligation on the trader would effectively amount to an open-ended liability which the trader would have to carry into the future.  In the case of the purchaser or recipient of the voucher, the greater the effluxion of time between the purchase and redemption of a voucher the greater the likelihood that the monetary value of the voucher will increasingly erode.  If there is an inflationary aspect in the economy, obviously the value of the voucher will diminish over time.</P>
        <P>While the Bill is not proposing the abolition of redemption periods for gift vouchers, it is proposing that where a trader does seek to impose such a period when seeking or offering for sale a gift voucher, it must be of a period of not less than five years duration.  Again, the imposition of such a lengthy period of redemption may not, for the reasons mentioned, be in the interests of traders, purchasers or recipients of gift vouchers.  The interests of all parties would be better served by making the redemption period attaching to a gift voucher as transparent as possible.  In this regard, I have requested my officials to examine the issue of transparency with a view to considering the possibility of making regulations under section 50 of the Consumer Protection Act.  Such regulations could require that specific information be given on the terms and conditions attaching to the sale or advertisement for sale of gift vouchers, particularly in relation to the redemption periods and conditions attaching to the voucher.  The House will be aware that I am preparing legislation to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  I have asked my officials to examine the possibility of including specific provisions in this legislation with a view to building on the existing levels of consumer protection in the area of gift vouchers, subject to consistency with EU law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The House may be aware that the National Consumer Agency has produced a guide to gift vouchers which can be accessed on its website <i>www.consumerconnect.ie</i>.  The guide gives valuable advice to consumers on the purchase of gift vouchers, particularly on issues such as the different types of vouchers and gift cards available in the marketplace; the various expiry or redemption period policies operated by different traders; consumers&rsquo; rights in relation to partially used vouchers; the importance of keeping vouchers safe; consumers&rsquo; rights where the trader closes down or there is a change of business; and specific issues in relation to travel agent vouchers.  Given the characteristics of gift vouchers, the guide encourages consumers <Col N="333"/>when purchasing vouchers or gift cards to minimise their risk by buying vouchers that can be used at more than one outlet or chain such as shopping centre vouchers or gift tokens issued by trade associations; using a voucher as soon as possible; looking for a gift voucher that has a clear expiry policy; always checking the terms and conditions and taking special account of the expiry date; what happens to any unused portion and whether it can be used in every outlet in a chain.</P>
        <P>The agency&rsquo;s overall advice, issued as recently in a public statement as last Friday, 4 December, on gift vouchers is that they should be treated the same as one would treat cash.  Consumers contemplating purchasing gift vouchers may wish to consult the agency&rsquo;s on-line guide in order that they are in a position to ensure the value inherent in the voucher can be enjoyed by the recipient.  I understand the agency also intends to consider this matter further with a view to possibly issuing guidelines under section 90 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to traders on particular commercial practices regarding the sale or advertisement for sale of gift vouchers.</P>
        <P>Raising the issue of gift vouchers and the concerns surrounding the manner in which some vouchers are sold and offered for sale is timely in the run-up to the festive period.  I have outlined to the House the avenues for redress currently open under consumer law to those who experience difficulties in relation to particular aspects of the sale of gift vouchers.  I accept that this is an area that merits further consideration.  I have advised the House of the work ongoing in my Department, particularly on the possibility of making regulations prescribing specific consumer information that should accompany the sale of gift vouchers, and also the work being undertaken by the National Consumer Agency.  It is my intention to ensure this work continues to progress having regard to developments at national and EU level.  I have also outlined to the House the various actions the Government is taking on the issue of gift vouchers.  The House will see, therefore, that consumer protection is a matter which the Government takes seriously.  I have to ask the Seanad, however, to oppose the Bill, as it is not open to Ireland to unilaterally add to the list of prohibited commercial practices prohibited under the unfair commercial practices directive, given its maximum harmonisation nature.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  It is timely, given the many people who are purchasing gift vouchers as presents for the festive season.  A sizeable number of vouchers are never drawn down, but there cannot be a continuous liability on a trader.  There has to be an expiry date.  There is an obligation on the recipient to use the voucher in order that a trader will not have an ongoing liability for an indeterminate period.  In effect, the longer the duration the greater the likelihood of a voucher being left in a drawer and forgotten about.  When a person eventually finds it, he or she may find that the issuing chain has closed down, moved or been taken over.  There is an onus on people to inform themselves and to be conscious &mdash; this also applies in the context of websites &mdash; that the purchase of a gift voucher is essentially a transfer of cash and should be treated as such.  People should also read the terms and conditions attached to the purchase of gift vouchers.  We encourage companies and businesses providing gift vouchers to ensure consumers are fully aware of the terms and conditions that apply in that regard.</P>
        <P>While I am on my feet speaking about gift vouchers, I thank Members in advance for them and wish them all a happy Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  I wish to make some points in support of my colleague, Senator Ryan.  Making vouchers redeemable for five years benefits the issuer and consumer.  Having in place specific legislation is also likely to benefit both parties.  As Senator Ryan stated &mdash; this was also mentioned by the Minister of State &mdash; issuers operate differing and often inexplicit terms.  Customers are often confused or <Col N="334"/>misunderstand the terms under which the voucher is issued.  A common problem is that people do not understand that vouchers have a limited life or that the product or service in respect of which they apply is only available for a limited time.  While I am aware of this, it must surely create uncertainty in the customer&rsquo;s mind.  I believe it is safe to assume that potential sales are lost because of this.  Clear rules in regard to the obligations on the issuer and the rights of the consumer are likely to increase sales by improving customer confidence.  In this regard, this legislation would be useful.</P>
        <P>Not alone would the Bill improve consumer confidence, it would encourage retailers and service providers to develop creative and imaginative ways to attract business through a range of voucher options.  There is no reason the range of goods and services that can be purchased with vouchers could not be expanded.  For instance, the Post Office offers a voucher which applies to numerous retailers and services.  There is scope for expanding this principle so that vouchers for complimentary products can be issued, for example, where parents pay for a honeymoon as a wedding present or a person buys a voucher for car hire, visitor attractions and so on.  This is quite common in the US but not so common here yet.  This suggests that creative thinking on the part of businesses is required.  God knows we need a little innovation in this regard.</P>
        <P>A lead on this is being taken at a local level with chambers of commerce in many towns operating a system during the Christmas period which allows people to buy gift vouchers which can be used in participating shops.  I see no reason a countrywide scheme along these lines cannot be developed to operate all year round.  This would help small downtown businesses attract trade from the multinationals in the out-of-town shopping centres and retail parks.  All our towns are now suffering a lack of investment due to the location of larger shopping centres on the edge of towns which offer free parking and other associated benefits.  Clonmel is an example in this regard.  I am aware we have bucked the national trend by being the only town this year to open not one but two shopping centres.  The Showgrounds shopping centre, with Marks &amp; Spencer as the anchor tenant, was opened in the latter part of this year by the Taoiseach.  We are delighted Clonmel is now a wonderful shopping town.</P>
        <P>There is an increasing need for Irish retailers to protect themselves from the threat posed by Internet shopping.  Members will be aware that yesterday was the busiest day of the year for Internet shopping in terms of the timeline for deliveries to consumers before Christmas.  Everybody was warned that yesterday was D-day in that regard.  It seems inevitable that just as the price of goods has decreased during the past 20 years because they are sourced from low-wage economies, these economies will develop their Internet retail capability in the coming years.  We will need to monitor this.  Those in recorded music and book sales know all about this threat and all the evidence suggests this will expand into other areas of the retail sector, putting added pressure on retailers here to add value to their offering.  One of the ways of doing this is through legislation which gives consumers confidence that vouchers bought in Ireland will be redeemed and that they have the weight of the law on their side.</P>
        <P>There are further ways in which issuers would benefit through vouchers being redeemable over a longer period.  Vouchers redeemed some years after purchase are very much in the interest of the retailer who receives cash.  Vouchers also act as a form of credit provided by the consumer to the issuer.  They are, in effect, interest-free loans to the retailers because the cash is received before the product or service is provided.  In the event that someone waits some years to redeem their voucher, the issuer, owing to inflation, which is expected to return sometime next year, could get an added margin.  For instance, a voucher bought for &euro;100 tomorrow and redeemed in three years&rsquo; time will purchase less owing to inflation.  That is not a universal benefit because in some cases the voucher is for a specific product or more often a service. <Col N="335"/> Where the voucher has a cash value, which is the most common, the issuer could be quids in.  A five-year time limit on the redemption of vouchers is not something that retailers and service providers should fear.  As Senator Ryan has shown, longer redemption terms are feasible and have been introduced successfully in other countries.  I thank the Minister of State for listening to my contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I begin by thanking the Labour Party first for accommodating Private Members&rsquo; time in the past fortnight and second for introducing this Bill.  It is timely in the sense that it addresses an important consumer issue that has a particular poignancy at this time of the year.  I admit I have occasionally indulged in the art of present giving through vouchers.  However, it must be accepted that it is the least intimate form of present giving.  I am not too sure it should be encouraged in any society.  The only people who really gain from the production of vouchers are retailers.  The Labour Party Bill deals with an important aspect in terms of the redemption of vouchers.  However, as the Minister of State indicated, a greater value is lost through people forgetting to redeem them.  Even for those who do redeem vouchers eventually, the cash value of the product or service for which they are using the voucher has reduced in the time they have taken to redeem it.  There is no way the retailer loses in this situation.</P>
        <P>It appears every retailer up to and including petrol stations has a voucher system.  I wonder how many people will be honoured by that type of present this Christmas.  Given events of the Budget Statement in the past hour or so they might have a particular value now.  I am persuaded both by the need to correct current legislation as proposed by the Labour Party Bill and the Minister of State&rsquo;s argument in regard to how such change can be brought about.  We have had commitments from the Minister of State this evening in terms of impending consumer protection legislation that can incorporate much of what is suggested in the Labour Party Bill.  It appears there is an even greater legislative bar in terms of what we can do unilaterally in this area given our commitments in terms of the European Union.  The draft proposal in terms of a new EU consumer protection directive is a document into which the Government, informed by our own political system, can have an input.  The Minister of State highlighted the effect of the Council working group in this area.  The Labour Party is to be commended on its proposals in this area.</P>
        <P>If and when the Government is prepared to introduce amending legislation and to bring about amendment of European legislation in this area, a wider issue needs to be considered.  As mentioned by several speakers in this debate, we are speaking about the conversion of currency through the production of vouchers.  If we are speaking in terms of consumer rights and protection, we will need to ensure that currency has maximum value.  If it is being abused in regard to the terms and conditions being attached and if consumers are not being properly informed as to their rights and entitlements in regard to how the maximum value can be obtained from vouchers, either the system of consumer protection or the legislation that informs it is in need of change.</P>
        <P>I noted in the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution a willingness to take on board many of the ideas included in this Bill and an acceptance that the legislation is in need of constant revision.  I am not sure to what extent the Labour Party wishes to progress its legislation but the better vehicle for getting the ideas it is articulating into legislation is to take the Minister of State at his word and await new legislation which he will produce in the near future.  The House can then see how the Labour Party&rsquo;s ideas can be put into it.</P>
        <P>Once again, I thank and congratulate the Labour Party for raising this issue and having an influence on eventual change in the legislation in this area.  Holding Second Stage of this Bill tonight was the subject of unfair comment on the Order of Business in recent days and that <Col N="336"/>should not be allowed to remain on the record of the House.  It is an interesting and important Bill that highlights an area where legislative change is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I hope he will accept the Bill as I am aware he has expressed sympathy for the principle of it.  As Senator Boyle said, there has been some criticism of the timing.  The timing of the introduction of the Bill is perhaps unfortunate in that it clashes with the budget, but it is appropriate that it be debated in December.  It is the busiest month for gift voucher purchases and research shows that the week before Christmas is the time when most gift vouchers are purchased.  The week after Christmas and the month of January is the time when gift vouchers have the highest redemption rate.</P>
        <P>We are also aware that a large number of gift vouchers are not redeemed by consumers, thereby giving a major gift to retailers but an unfair one.  There is a serious lack of consumer protection in this area.  I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber earlier to hear the Minister for Finance deliver his Budget Statement.  The Minister&rsquo;s critical aim in the budget, with which we all agree although many of us are critical of the way he is pursuing it, is to boost consumer confidence, ensure an increase in consumer spending and thereby try to bring about an economic<?oasys _jy ?>recovery.</P>
        <P>All Members have heard from representatives of the restaurant industry, which is beleaguered, and the retail sector, which is also under pressure, especially in the Border counties where it is suffering as a result of cheaper prices in the North.  There is huge pressure on retailers and restaurants, but these are two of the main sectors in which gift vouchers are purchased.  One small but important way to boost consumer confidence and spending is to create a sense of goodwill, in the season of goodwill, about gift voucher purchases.  Many people are put off buying gift vouchers because of the difficulty with redemption.  The expiry date is often as short as six months.  I have seen many vouchers which must be redeemed within six months, which can be difficult for people.  In addition, traders often do not make it easy for consumers to redeem gift vouchers.  I will describe later my recent experience with a gift voucher which will show how difficult it can be to redeem them and the importance of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said a number of times that he is sympathetic to the principle of the Bill.  He acknowledged that there is a serious issue of consumer protection and unfairness to consumers.  However, he was critical of the implementation mechanism in the Bill which he said is inappropriate under the European directive.  If he thinks it is not the right mechanism, that is fine.  If he could indicate that he will bring forward similar legislation, it would be a step in the right direction and would demonstrate that he is taking the issue seriously enough to deal with it in similar terms in other legislation.  That would be an important concession but I did not hear him make it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State accepted there is a problem and pointed out that the periods for redeeming vouchers differ from trader to trader.  That is the issue we are trying to address in the Bill.  The period for redeeming vouchers can be as short as six months.  Some traders, although the number is limited in Ireland, have no expiry period for the gift voucher, but that is very much the exception.  It occurs in other jurisdictions.  In this country, the trader can set any expiry period they wish.  I received a gift voucher for a hotel in Ireland which I will not name.  It became almost impossible to redeem it within the 12-month period.  The hotel insisted that it would have to be spent over two nights of a weekend rather than one night, as suited us.  That example shows the difficulty for consumers in trying to redeem gift vouchers.  Where there is a tight expiry period the trader can make redemption almost impossible.</P>
        <P>One might argue that it is not in traders&rsquo; interests to make it so difficult for people to redeem vouchers because it does not inspire confidence among consumers in the service offered by the <Col N="337"/>trader.  Frankly, many traders might lose all interest in redeeming vouchers because the money has already been paid up front.  Once the voucher has been purchased, the trader has made his money and, in a sense, it is against his or her interests to redeem it.  That gets to the core of this problem.  Other than a general idea of creating goodwill and ensuring trust among consumers in their service, there is no particular commercial interest for a trader in redeeming a voucher.  If, for example, a hotel or restaurant has sold a voucher, it has made its money and it will simply cost it to honour or redeem the voucher.  That is the reason one finds, in practice, hotels imposing specific rules on the holders of gift vouchers which make it difficult for them to redeem the vouchers and the reason the issue of gift vouchers is so unbalanced without regulation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s reference to the National Consumer Agency guidelines.  The agency helpfully provides guidelines on its website for consumers who have purchased gift vouchers or have been given them.  They suggest that consumers use a voucher as soon as possible, look for one that has a clear expiry policy and so forth.  It is striking, however, that the onus is placed on the consumer.  It is a little like, in the criminal law context, the advice given to people to avoid becoming victims of muggings.  I recall a memorable advertising campaign in London some years ago.  Prominent advertisements were displayed which showed a person using a mobile phone on a street with a shadowy character looming behind them to grab the mobile phone.  The message of the advertisement was not to use one&rsquo;s mobile phone in public.  It was laughable.  All of us use our mobile phones in public all the time and we have a right to expect to be able to do that without being mugged.  To imply that the person using the mobile phone is in some way responsible if they are mugged for doing so sent out all the wrong signals.  In fact, I have used that advertisement in criminology class as an example of a victim-blaming strategy that sometimes occurs in crime.</P>
        <P>It is obviously a different context but the National Consumer Agency guidelines appear to blame the consumer for the failure to redeem the vouchers, telling them that it is up to them to check the expiry date and use the voucher as soon as possible.  Of course, consumers, myself included, lose vouchers and they are not redeemed, but many more are not redeemed because the expiry period has elapsed &mdash; the consumer might not even be aware that there was a specific expiry period &mdash; or the trader has attached difficult conditions to honouring the voucher.</P>
        <P>It might appear to be a small point but this market has enormous value.  I have looked at some of the data available.  In 2006, for example, the gift voucher or gift card market in the US was worth $80 billion.  It is estimated to be worth approximately &pound;3 billion in the UK in 2009.  I have tried to find studies on redemption rates.  The estimates that are most easily available on the Internet show that 10% of vouchers are not redeemed.  I have heard of other studies relating to book tokens which show a higher rate of non-redemption.  However, even if the rate is 10% and 90% of vouchers in the US were redeemed in 2006, there was still an enormous gain for retailers of approximately $8 billion.  Retailers unfairly, as it were, made $8 billion on the back of consumers because they sold vouchers that were never redeemed.  Some of the non-redemption was clearly the fault of the consumer, but some of it could have been due to the difficulties imposed upon the consumer by a lack of a clear expiry period, a short expiry period or other conditions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was particularly interested in the American situation where no uniform standards are imposed on vouchers.  Fees or other conditions can be imposed for redemption.  Some firms have moved to advertise no fee no expiry policies to try to encourage consumers to purchase gift vouchers.  This seems to be a novel approach but it relies upon the goodwill of individual traders.  Key to this issue is the lack of any commercial benefit to a trader in encouraging people to redeem their gift vouchers.  It is the other way around since the trader will have made <Col N="338"/>money without providing the service, books, meals or hotel nights.  Clearly, there is an imbalance.  There is a lack of protection for the consumer who bears all of the onus of ensuring the voucher is redeemed.  There is no real obligation on the trader and no uniform standard has been set in Ireland or the US in terms of expiry periods and conditions for redemption.</P>
        <P>Some provinces in Canada have passed legislation to regulate gift vouchers and, for example, ban expiry dates and the practice of imposing fees.  We should follow this model.  The Labour Party Bill presented to the Minister of State provides an excellent example of a relatively straightforward way of doing this, namely, it would not be possible for a trader to sell or offer for sale a voucher redeemable that is valid for a period less than five years.  This clear rule and restriction on traders could be imposed and would go some way towards redressing the imbalance felt by consumers.</P>
        <P>There is some interesting literature on the philosophy of gift vouchers and whether it is better to receive a bad present, but one that is individually chosen, or a gift token.  I do not like receiving gift tokens because it shows a certain lack of thoughtfulness.  When one receives a token, it is of greater benefit if one sees that there is an expiry period of longer than 12 months.  In practice, it is difficult to remember in every case to spend or redeem a gift voucher within a short period.  When expiry periods in many cases are as short as six or 12 months, something is wrong.  We must address the imbalance through legislation and I urge the Minister of State to accept the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the fact that the Labour Party has introduced the Bill at this particular time of the year.  It is important that we raise the awareness of gift vouchers and people&rsquo;s entitlements.  The Minister of State gave a comprehensive reply and I do not intend to recite it all, but the Government is concerned that the sale of items such as gift vouchers and tokens should be conducted in as transparent a manner as possible.  The Minister of State and his Department are examining the possibility of making regulations under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 with a view to prescribing specific information, including information regarding the period in which a voucher must be redeemed.  This information would accompany the voucher&rsquo;s sale and advertisements.</P>
        <P>The sellers of gift vouchers are practical people and allow more than the stated time, particularly in the hospitality sector, including restaurants and hotels.  In my part of the word, such sellers are good.  I know of a case in which a voucher was four years old but the hotel honoured it.  Perhaps the situation in Dublin is different given the volume of business, but sellers are practical in the west.  If one telephones them to say that one will not be able to make it within the 12 months, they will normally allow a further period in which to cash the voucher.</P>
        <P>I was surprised by Senator Callely&rsquo;s remarks as I had never heard of small print on a voucher in the west to the effect that it could not be used on a Thursday or Friday night.  Those who are giving vouchers should come west and buy their vouchers as presents there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Although the Minister of State, Senator Bacik and others have covered a certain matter, it is important that I do so again.  The National Consumer Agency produced a guide to the types of vouchers and gift cards available in the marketplace.  One in particular, a travel agent&rsquo;s voucher, should be examined.  A number of travel agents have gone out of business and more may follow.  We should be careful in this respect.  If someone gets a voucher, <Col N="339"/>he or she should try to use it as soon as possible.  It is not easy.  For example, I have a voucher at home that has probably passed its expiry date but I still intend to use it before the end of January.</P>
        <P>That the Minister of State cannot accept the Bill is unfortunate, but I agree with him that the Labour Party has done a service in bringing the issue to the fore at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend Senator Ryan on his research ahead of this Bill and on introducing it in the House.  It is one of those issues that exercises everyone&rsquo;s mind at one stage or another.  Unfortunately, when we get over the initial reaction to an individual situation, we tend to move on and forget about the problem&rsquo;s root cause.</P>
        <P>This matter affects us all.  No one in the House has not been affected by the manner in which shelf life has been applied to vouchers.  It is unjust and unfair and should be illegal.  As a consequence of a booming economy, people realised that this would be the case and were cognisant of the fact that if they issued vouchers with a shelf life for their goods, the money spent buying the voucher was no longer legal tender after six months, 12 months or two years.  I was rifling through a list of the companies and outlet stores that apply shelf life and those that do not.  Quite a number do not apply any expiry date, which is welcome, but others apply dates of two years, 12 months or, in many cases, as little as six months.</P>
        <P>We are living in straitened times and a difficult budget was just announced in the Lower House.  In the past two years, we have come to learn that disposable income has diminished and people have lost their jobs, with a consequential reduction in their income levels.  After this budget, basic social welfare rates will be cut by 4%.  It will be said of the budget that pensioners were left alone, but that is wrong.  They were the first group singled out by the Government in the supplementary budget that abolished the Christmas bonus, equating to a 2% reduction in the rate of the old age pension.  Considering all of the above, it must be borne in mind that people have less disposable income than they used to.  It is incumbent on the Government to consider the Bill&rsquo;s merit and outlaw some of the activity that is robbing more money from people&rsquo;s pockets.</P>
        <P>This entire matter relates to consumer issues and the rural economy.  I spoke to a lady last week who said she generally used the Christmas bonus to buy Christmas presents for her grandchildren.  That bonus is now lost to the local rural economy because it no longer exists.  That is a considerable loss to this economy.  If one replicates that throughout many other towns and villages, one will find the local economy suffers.  It is not as if people used to save that kind of money.  They did not but used it for expenditure particular to the season.</P>
        <P>The Government must take the issue on board.  This kind of practice is unfair and unjust.  The evidence suggests that it is those on lower and middle incomes who are the victims in this situation.  We can offer examples of corporate fraud, areas where checks and balances were not in place and the consequent fall-out from that lack of regulation.  We can look at where it did not work.  This is one area where it might.  The Government should look at the merit of this Bill and take it on board.  It would be an enormous shot in the arm for people at this time of year.  There must be sanctions, too, for people who take advantage of the fact that vouchers may not be redeemed.</P>
        <P>I apologise for missing the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening comments.  I have no doubt they were congratulatory of the Bill.  As he is a fair-minded person like the rest of us, I am sure the Minister of State supported it.  I hope he will see his way to flexing his ministerial muscle and ensuring this will become Government policy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As I said, unfortunately, the harmonisation nature of the directive gives member states very little discretion regarding this legislation before the House.  I commend Senator Ryan and the Labour Party on introducing this Bill, especially in view of the time of year.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to a number of issues regarding the psychology of purchasing vouchers in the first place.  As a man, the major concern I have is that vouchers often get one out of a very difficult corner.  In my experience of buying gifts from time to time, one can get away with shoes, handbags, perhaps a ring, and vouchers, but when it comes to buying clothes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>When one goes into Brown Thomas or an equally high-end store, invariably one ends up going to the gift voucher department because otherwise one might be under some pressure if one bought an item in the wrong size.</P>
        <P>Seriously, reference was made to our blaming the consumer.  We are trying to advise the consumer and make him or her aware of the risks that arise if one does not look at the terms and conditions of a voucher.  The other interesting aspect that emerged is the rate of redemption and whether it is as high as 10%.  I believe it is higher in some areas.  That is a major problem.  We have all opened a drawer after two or three years and found a voucher in the bottom wishing us a happy Christmas or birthday.</P>
        <P>It was asked whether the Government proposes to introduce legislation.  We will do that with regard to the amalgamation of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority and have asked our officials to consider including in that legislation provisions that may address some relevant issues.  Again, such measures must be compatible and in accordance with the harmonisation nature of the EU directive.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Equally, with regard to the unfair commercial practices directive, there is a mechanism in place whereby a blacklist can be added to or amended.  A report is to be brought from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers by 2011 concerning this directive and the 31 blacklisted items.  Additions and subtractions could be made at that stage and there would be an opportunity for member states to put forward their views.  That is scheduled for June 2011, which is somewhat distant, as the Senator noted.  However, with the amalgamation of the two agencies, there may be some room to ensure we can make regulations that are more protective of consumers&rsquo; rights.  I wish it were possible to accept this Bill but I am prohibited by the constraints put on me by the various directives and their harmonisation nature.</P>
        <P>Because of the Christmas season, people should be careful.  It is a pity this item is overshadowed by the budget which will probably take more prominence on the front pages tomorrow as opposed to this very important debate.  These issues should be aired publicly to make people conscious of their rights and entitlements and, equally, to make them aware that when they purchase a voucher, they should read the small print and advise the recipient of the terms and conditions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive statements at the opening of the debate and its conclusion.  There was some criticism yesterday concerning the timing of the Bill which I will address.  This Bill was due for discussion two weeks ago, as the officials and the Minister of State may be aware.  On that occasion the Labour Party ceded its time to the Leader to allow for a comprehensive discussion on the flooding situation.  Last week the Green Party asked us to switch with it for tonight and consequently we are discussing <Col N="341"/>the matter in the Chamber now.  If Private Members&rsquo; business had not been ordered for tonight, we would not be here but it was, it is our turn and we are dealing with the matter.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that, as a result of comments by Senator Quinn, we are almost obliged to apologise for introducing the legislation but I do not apologise in any way for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State again for his comprehensive response to the Bill.  He cited the need for EU approval for it because if such legislation were enacted in Ireland, it might not be compatible with EU legislation.  However, our legal advice was that approval could be sought post-enactment, not necessarily at the time of publication.  Our advice is that this is either not an issue or, if it is, it can be overcome.</P>
        <P>I thank the various contributors.  Senator Carty said sellers are practical people and offered good advice on how consumers should deal with gift vouchers, but this does not eliminate the problem.  There is plenty of good advice at <i>www.consumerconnect.ie</i> but this means trying to get around the problem rather than addressing it.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Callely for his contribution which broadly welcomed the principle of the Bill.  He talked about the nonsense connected with gift vouchers.  It is that nonsense that prompted my party to introduce the legislation.  We believe it is robust, specific and worthy of acceptance.  On behalf of Fine Gael, Senator Bradford welcomed the initiative.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that many retailers are flexible.  We know that.  As Senator Carty said, many retailers will extend the shelf life of vouchers if a consumer goes back to them.  The problem arises because some retailers are not flexible in that regard and will not modify the terms.  Trying to deal with such outliers is what prompted this legislation.  In 75% to 90% of the time the situation is fine and there is no problem with the retailers.  We wished to deal with an acknowledged problem, one that has been discussed for years in many fora, most recently on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio programme.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said he intended to make regulations which will deal with some aspects but he has not committed to dealing with the shelf life issue and stated there might be a problem associated with it.  In addition, there is no timeline for taking such action.  The Minister of State may come back to it in 2011 and address some of the issues but this does not deal with the issue.</P>
      
        <P>Senator Boyle supported the principle of the Bill because of the need to correct the problems.  He agreed with the need to do something but wondered if this were the way to do it and had some sympathy with the Minister of State&rsquo;s position.  I thank my colleagues in the Labour Party for their commitment and their contributions to the debate.</P>
        <P>This legislation is necessary.  It needs to be enacted soon.  This has been a problem for too long and the Minister of State should be aware that it is happening in other jurisdictions.  The United States and Canada have moved to address it.  There are no examples of Europe moving to address it yet but that does not mean we cannot lead the way in terms of what needs to be done in Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland has given much good advice which I will not repeat here but in the context of the problem, people must be careful.  This is a time when people will purchase gift vouchers and we would advise them to be very careful and to keep receipts.  The Bill we propose is based on what we have identified as a need in this area.  I rest my case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to highlight the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, to ensure access to export credit insurance for exporters.  I am sorry the T&aacute;naiste is not present for this debate.  It is not unusual for a senior Minister to be absent in these circumstances.  It is nice to see the Minister of State is here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am the Minister of State with responsibility for international trade and commerce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That is even better.  I acknowledge that for the first time, a Minister of State represents an improvement on the senior Minister.  The matter I am raising is very relevant in light of this afternoon&rsquo;s Budget Statement.  If the economy is to come out of recession, <Col N="343"/>it will be led by exports.  It is important for the Government to recognise the need to help exports and exporters in any way possible.  That appears to be lacking in today&rsquo;s budget, specifically in the area of export credit insurance.  Exporters need to be protected, particularly in the indigenous area.  I am not attempting to look for protection, in the form of export credit insurance, for the multinationals that account for a large proportion of our export figures.  They do not need it and it is not relevant for them.  We need to encourage and give some sort of certainty to indigenous industries that need the sort of protection that is afforded to similar industries in other European countries.  The Netherlands and France, for example, have provided this necessary protection, or similar protection, to exporters.  If our exporters are to compete on a level playing field with those countries and others, it is imperative that export credit insurance be made available to them so they can export their produce with the kind of protection we are talking about.</P>
        <P>I have not seen the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  I am not aware of the complete contents of the report produced by KPMG, which was commissioned in August of this year to conduct a review of this area.  It would be very helpful if he were to release its contents so we would know what has been decided.  More importantly, the Minister of State should tell us what action he intends to take as a result of the review.  Does he intend to sit on the review and do nothing about it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reviews are not really meant to be written to delay matters although they often have that effect.  While I do not suggest this to be true in this case, they report what is expected of them, delay a decision and are a waste of money.  This is because having been given instructions, reviewers often instinctively sense what Ministers, employers and paymasters want as a reply and they write to orders.  While I do not necessarily suggest this is so in this case, it would be useful &mdash; I cannot understand the reason the Minister has not done so &mdash; to release this review to public attention and scrutiny and therefore to public debate.  It is unfortunate the senior Minister in this Department sat on another review in the case of F&Aacute;S, when it would have been better had she released it earlier rather than sitting on it until the last minute.  Consequently, I ask for the release of this review in order that it can be debated.</P>
        <P>The importance of the export industry lies in the incredible number of jobs it supports, particularly in the food and drink sectors.  While it is difficult to be certain, approximately 50,000 people are employed in those sectors.  Moreover, approximately 60,000 people are employed in the distribution sector and a great number of others are affected.  For example, 120,000 farmers also are dependent on this industry.  All these people need the kind of security that a small sum spent on export insurance would provide.  I ask the Minister of State to regard this not as a matter for contemplation or review, but as a matter of urgency to help employment in the sectors, to assist the economy to recover and to provide the sort of confidence that is absolutely necessary at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A State export credit scheme was established under the Insurance Act 1953, which provided export credit insurance for exporters to cover against the risk of non-payment for their goods by buyers abroad and to encourage the export of Irish goods and services.  The scheme covered a wide range of risks up to 1991, when the Government decided to phase out State involvement in the provision of certain types of cover following a comprehensive review.  In 1997, a further review was completed by my Department on the operation of the restructured scheme with a view to establishing whether and to what extent there continued to be a need for State involvement in this area.</P>
        <P>This review established that, in the six years since 1991, the private market for short-term cover had developed considerably and that the then current insurance exposure levels imposed on the State were disproportionate to any benefit they might give to exporters.  As a result, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, announced <Col N="344"/>in February 1998 that the State was withdrawing from the provision of export credit insurance with immediate effect on the grounds that there was no longer any necessity to expose the State to significant and avoidable financial risks in the provision of export credit insurance and that the risk which insurance of this sort imposed on taxpayers was disproportionate to any benefit it gave to exporters generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the following ten years the commercial market for credit insurance operated satisfactorily as exporters were able to get cover on the commercial market.  However, approximately one year ago, some market failure in the commercial market developed due to the international financial upheaval across all financial services and insurance houses.  As a result, insurers began raising premiums and, in some cases, providing highly limited cover or withdrawing cover entirely.  The lack of affordable export credit insurance was then strongly highlighted by exporters as a significant problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, commissioned Forf&aacute;s to undertake an assessment of the position at the start of this year.  The Forf&aacute;s report concluded that the suggested insurance top-up scheme proposed by the industry would not be self-financing, as claimed.  It also concluded that the implementation of such a proposal would cost the Exchequer significantly in respect of default losses, administration and auditing or monitoring or both.  In addition, it was established that the number of companies potentially benefitting would be quite limited because State intervention in topping up existing policies would not be of benefit to any company the cover of which had been totally withdrawn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of this Forf&aacute;s report, it was therefore considered desirable to undertake a full-scale forensic evaluation of the credit insurance industry, which would draw on and analyse data from commercial insurers.  It was envisaged that the process also would involve consulting key stakeholders, including companies that had been affected.  In July last the Department commissioned international consultants KPMG to undertake this study.  KPMG carried out a rigorous analysis of a significant amount of data, supplied in confidence by the insurance industry, which facilitated a thorough assessment of the credit insurance market in Ireland.  A comprehensive picture of the market was established.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The KPMG report, finalised in October last, established that only 4% of Irish exports are insured.  It also found that the introduction of a State-backed short-term top-up scheme, whereby the risk period was less than two years and the market was prepared to provide partial cover, would be expensive and would cost at least &euro;1.7 million annually.  Moreover, this sum would rise significantly, up to tens of millions of euro annually, were different levels of intervention to be provided.  It was established that the impact would be small and that a negligible number of jobs would be supported by such an initiative.  The concentration of cover which was identified also is obviously unsatisfactory from a spread of risk standpoint.  In addition, it was found that there are indications that this market is showing signs of recovery.  It appears to be evident globally that insurance houses and financial services markets are beginning to stabilise.  Some activity is evident and people are able to get some cover again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Government has a responsibility to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, a commitment of large-scale funding to an initiative with marginal benefits for industry and high level risks to the State, would be foolhardy.  Accordingly, based on the overwhelming weight of evidence in the KPMG report, the Government decided last month that a State-supported scheme of short-term export credit insurance should not be introduced.  It must be appreciated that in these difficult times, the Government must carefully assess whether new proposed schemes and initiatives justify the expenditure involved.  In this case, on foot of the report and based on forensic analysis, it clearly would not.</P><Col N="345"/>
        <P>There has been some comment that other European Union member states have introduced state-supported schemes.  This development was, of course, fully considered.  Each such scheme must, under European Union state aid rules, be approved by the European Commission and such approvals have included a condition that the level of premiums to be paid by companies under any such scheme should be a multiple of regular premium levels in order not to distort the commercial market.  These high premia have made such schemes highly expensive for business and, as a result, take-up has been less than anticipated in many countries.  In some cases, other restrictive conditions also have been imposed such as, for example, the destination countries which can be covered.  In several countries, including both France and the United Kingdom, alterations to the schemes were necessary to encourage companies to avail of them.  In the case of the United Kingdom, its Government last month signalled its intention to discontinue this scheme at the end of this month because signs of market recovery are now evident.</P>
        <P>The KPMG report also suggested that the Department should investigate a possible medium-term intervention where the risk period is more than two years.  This is highly distinct from short-term cover in which the risk period is less than two years.  It also should be appreciated that most Irish exports do not fall into the medium-term category, which caters more for large projects or infrastructural goods and services, but it may be relevant to some companies.  My Department is considering this option in the context of the action plan for trade, investment and tourism, which is being prepared at present, as recommended in the smart economy strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The wider issue of credit availability for business is much more significant and work is under way to address this issue as part of the bank recapitalisation process.  I am sure the Senator was watching the debate on the budget in which the Minister for Finance outlined clear proposals in the context of using his powers under the NAMA legislation to address the issue of making credit flow freely across the broader economy and in particular towards small to medium-sized businesses.  The bank guarantee scheme, the banks&rsquo; recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the passing of the National Asset Management Agency Act all are aimed at this goal.  The National Asset Management Agency Act has been strengthened further by a Government amendment providing the Minister for Finance with the power to issue guidelines to the participating institutions in the NAMA process on lending practices, as well as procedures to improve the flow of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises and, if necessary, to other sectors.  Under the recapitalisation scheme, additional measures were introduced to support SMEs, including a commitment to increase lending capacity to SMEs by 10%.  How much time remains?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to refer to an issue Senator Ross raised in the context of the report&rsquo;s publication.  The insurance companies opened up their books to KPMG on the assumption that it would be completely confidential.  This information is highly commercially sensitive and the insurance companies were not obliged to provide the information.  They volunteered the information provided that it was given under a confidentiality clause.  Both the Department and KPMG signed it and, consequently, they are honour bound.  I believe the Senator would accept the reasons these insurance companies would not be able to allow this information to enter the public domain.</P>
        <P>I could discuss a few more areas in this context, but we are probably moving slightly off the issue of export credits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, it is important to indicate the reason the KPMG report is not being published.  No conspiracy theories are involved in this regard.  It simply is a basic fact pertaining to commercial sensitivity.  The Department and KPMG sought out the insurance companies, which assisted and co-operated in giving the information on the context of the market and the conditions surrounding export credit.  This is the reason it cannot be published.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief but I am entitled to ask a question.  I do not accept that commercial sensitivities are a good enough reason for not issuing the report.  Would the Minister of State consider releasing it with the commercially sensitive parts redacted?  If there are commercially sensitive elements they could be removed, as happens with many other reports, and let the findings and the reasons for them be released to the public.  KPMG can remove any commercially sensitive parts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department and KPMG entered into legally binding agreements.  This information could not be released.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Ignore that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The broad thrust of the report quite clearly indicates that export credit insurance or the top-up system which was proposed by some people in the export business simply were not viable.  There is now an upturn in that market.  It is quite possible that commercial houses and insurance houses will be able to provide that cover in future and that there will be no need for the State to get involved in short-term export credit insurance.  I mentioned there is also a medium-term issue which the Department is examining.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the short term, we believe there is an upturn.  Some articles written in Sunday newspapers recently reflected the fact there is confidence.  I was in London yesterday where we met insurance and banking companies promoting Enterprise Ireland companies.  They were very confident that this market has stabilised and commercial activity was again beginning to happen.</P>

There is a complete meltdown in the processing of grants State-wide and that is something we need to recognise.  I asked seven weeks ago for a process to be put in place to ensure every student in the State would be temporarily registered so there would be no threats against them that they would be unable to sit their examinations or access computers, libraries or photocopiers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, since then we have seen no action from the Government.  Young constituents of mine who are in third level education and are trying to become the professionals of tomorrow have failed their courses because they could not get access to laboratories and many laboratory classes.  They will have to resit their exams next year.  It is terrible how the State and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, have abandoned these young people.</P>
        <P>Earlier today I received a reply to a parliamentary question we tabled, which asked the number of applications yet to be processed by each local authority and VEC across the State.  The most recent figures the Department has are from 27 November.  They show that Donegal VEC has the third highest number of applications yet to be processed, behind Dublin city and Cork city VECs, with 1,358 applications yet to be processed.  As the Minister of State may know, Donegal VEC has closed its doors to the public this week to try to deal with the collapse of the student grant system.  It is not the fault of the staff.  The Minister acknowledged seven weeks ago that the recruitment and overtime embargo is part of this problem.</P>
        <P>When a cap on the public sector is announced on budget day, people might think it is a good idea but now 1,358 VEC applications have not been processed.  Some 117 other applications have not been processed by the county council.  This issue affects students who are in third level education who should have had the small sum which comprises the maintenance grant paid to them in September to help them through their third level education, but in reality the payments will not be made until after Christmas.</P>
        <P>This is an urgent matter because the Letterkenny Institute of Technology issued a letter to some 600 students who had not paid their registration fees, which the college has to collect.  The problem is that the vast majority of the 600 students concerned should not be paying the registration fee because they will receive a maintenance grant when the applications are processed.  The institute has written to all students who have not yet paid their registration fee and stated they have to pay &euro;500 of it before 11 December.  The letter states failure to pay the fee will result in examination results being withheld, computer accounts and library cards being suspended and access to medical facilities being withdrawn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a terrible situation, which the institute has been forced into as a result of the grants application meltdown.  The latest information from the Department is that some 22,000 applications in the State have not been processed.  I asked seven weeks ago if the Department can contact all the third level institutions and temporarily register all students, which I ask for again.</P>
        <P>It is not their fault.  They do not have the money to pay the registration fee.  They should not be paying it in the first place.  They should have received their maintenance grant in September.  The universities also need their money, but need to acknowledge there has been a systems collapse and that until the 22,000 applications are processed, all students should be allowed to avail of the basic services of the college such as access to a photocopier and medical facilities.  I ask the Minister to take those concerns on board and look forward to hearing his reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to outline the position of the <Col N="348"/>Department of Education and Science on applications by students for funding under the student support schemes.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the house that the Department of Education and Science funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students.  These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  The higher education grants scheme is administered by local authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by VECs.  Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed condition of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968-1992 provide for the making of grants by local authorities to enable persons to attend approved courses of higher education.  The process whereby local authorities assess eligibility and make grant payments under the higher education grants scheme is provided for under these Acts.  The organisation and management of student support grant schemes is a matter for individual VECs and local authorities.  It is acknowledged that some students are experiencing delays in the processing of their grant applications.  Every effort is being made by local authorities and VECs to ensure students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.  It is understood the awarding bodies received an unprecedented number of applications this year and that they are still receiving late applications on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>The Senator will appreciate that, in the context of the current economic circumstances, difficult choices had to be made by Government to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In that regard, the Senator will be aware of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector.  The Minister acknowledges the difficulties VECs and local authorities are experiencing because of the moratorium which may, in some instances, be affecting the processing of grants.  Our difficult economic circumstances mean tough choices had to be made to control public expenditure.</P>
        <P>Apart from the pressures associated with the volume of applications, a significant number of outstanding grant applications have not been processed in full because they are incomplete.  The Minister would like to remind students and their parents to return all necessary supporting documentation as early as possible to help the awarding bodies to make prompt decisions on entitlement.  The Higher Education Authority, on behalf of the Minister, has asked institutions to be flexible in respect of the payment of the student services charge for those still awaiting a decision on their grant application.</P>
        <P>Letterkenny Institute of Technology issued a letter to all students regarding outstanding fees as it is approaching the end of the first semester and not all students are entitled to grants.  Where a student is not entitled to a grant, the letter provides for flexibility and payment of the student services charge may be made by instalments.  Letterkenny Institute of Technology will continue to extend the maximum flexibility to students awaiting a decision on their grant application who are experiencing financial difficulty.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>While I welcome the response of the Minister of State, it misses the core point.  I have a copy of a letter received by 600 students.  I argue a high proportion of these students will receive a maintenance grant when their applications are processed and that, <Col N="349"/>therefore, they should not be required to pay the fee in the first place.  However, Letterkenny Institute of Technology is asking them to pay it by this Friday.  The letter contains four bullet points indicating that failure to pay will result in a student&rsquo;s examination results being withheld; his or her computer accounts and library cards being disabled, and access to medical facilities being withdrawn.  These four threats have been made.</P>
        <P>My purpose in raising the matter was to establish if the Minister or departmental officials would contact all third level institutions to ask them to show maximum flexibility and issue no more threats to students, as it is not their fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The brief question has been asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of them will not have to pay the registration fee.  It is a systems collapse which I hope will never happen again.  The Department should indicate who is at fault and that it should not happen again.  Students who want to receive a third level education should not be threatened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that the difficulties are being compounded by the moratorium on staffing.  The Higher Education Authority, on behalf of the Minister, has asked institutions to be flexible in respect of student service charges for those still awaiting a decision on their grant application.  Specifically I said Letterkenny Institute of Technology would continue to extend the maximum flexibility, where possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State for coming in to the House, as he has line responsibility for the subject matter of the motion.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year the Minister of State and his departmental officials indicated their intention to modify the community development programme which was created to support and resource local communities during the recession of the 1980s and early 1990s.  We are now facing closure, amalgamation or a threat to stop people&rsquo;s community-based activities.  Last week the CSO reported that one in seven people was at risk of poverty.  I pay tribute to those involved in the community development projects in Ballyphehane, Togher and Mahon.  We need development projects based in the community that allow local people to be responsible for and responsive to the needs of their communities.  Community projects empower local people.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister of State is centralising the bureaucracy away from local communities at a time when disadvantaged communities need support more than ever.  It is a regressive move.  If the line indicated in the McCarthy report is taken, it will reduce the number of structures, have an adverse effect on community-run projects and take away what has been built and developed by local voluntary management boards.  Members of these boards are not aloof or inanimate; they are living in a community.  They are vibrant, know what is happening and have great empathy.  The individuals running the boards in Ballyphehane, Togher and Mahon in Cork South-Central are wonderful people, as are the two co-ordinators.</P>
        <P>Community development project teams work with people most adversely affected by poverty and their exclusion from efforts to promote development and be an active force will have an impact.  They know the needs of their communities.  The boards contain volunteers who are being forced to make a choice between funding and autonomy.  The Minister of State has made no attempt to allow people to opt or buy in to protect local structures and the assets of the communities that provided them.  The McCarthy report proposes a cut in the community development budget which we have seen in today&rsquo;s budget.  We are taking responsibility for <Col N="350"/>the budget away from local communities and centralising it, which is wrong.  I would like to hear the Minister of State expand on his proposition regarding the integrated structure and the removal of autonomy from local boards.</P>
        <P>It is important to pay tribute to community development projects as part of which a range of programmes are provided.  They are key playmakers in the social inclusion programme.  As the Minister of State knows, there is a geographical spread and the projects are run by voluntary boards, the members of which know what is happening in and know the needs of their communities.  They are working with fellow citizens to build sustainable integrated communities, be it in education, anti-poverty, social inclusion, promotion of back to education and literacy programmes.  I use the example of the projects based in Ballyphehane, Togher, with which I am familiar, and Mahon.  Those involved have a very good grasp and understanding of the needs of local people and have worked to increase the level of participation in the community and promote a sense of belonging.  If one attends on any of the prize-giving nights for FETAC or other awards, one will see that there is a great sense of community, a great awareness of what is happening and a great participation rate.</P>
        <P>We can talk about the social and economic costs, but we need to communicate with and consult the National Community Development Forum, NCDF, and the Community Workers&rsquo; Co-operative.  We cannot quantify the work being done on the ground.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s plans to integrate responsibility need to be slowed down in order that there can be consultation to bring the best of people with us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  My Department was established against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures and agencies through which local and community development schemes and programmes are delivered.  The Department inherited many local and community programmes that had been established and operated under different Departments.  There was an inherent danger of fragmentation of services and the diffusion of resources.  The cohesion process initiated by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to address these concerns resulted in a dramatic reduction and simplification of local delivery structures for a range of rural development and community development programmes.  However, my Department still has a wide agenda of reform to advance.  The next phase which is under way concerns improving and joining up the outputs of programmes, as well as further consolidating structures.</P>
        <P>As I outlined previously to the D&aacute;il, my Department has seen the need to redesign its community development and social inclusion programmes, particularly the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, and community development programme, CDP, drawing on best international practice, and to support their ongoing evaluation.  The LDSIP and the CDP are the Department&rsquo;s two main social inclusion and community development programmes.  They both have a community development element and are delivered through separate local delivery structures.  These programmes come to an end on 31 December 2009 and will be superseded by a new programme, the local and community development programme.  The Centre for Effective Services recently presented the outline of the new programme to me, which I accepted.  The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  This will be underpinned by four high level goals: to promote awareness, knowledge and uptake of a wide range of statutory, voluntary and community services; to increase access to formal and informal educational, recreational and cultural development activities and resources; to increase people&rsquo;s work readiness and employment <Col N="351"/>prospects; and to promote engagement with policy, practice and decision making processes on matters affecting local communities.  The new programme will preserve elements of good practice from the existing CDP-LDSIP programmes and will enhance monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  Further work by the Centre for Effective Services on more detailed aspects of the programme is ongoing in light of consultation with and feedback from various community sector groups.</P>
        <P>Before proceeding to establish a single programme across the CDPs and partnerships, my Department undertook an evaluation of individual community development projects, many of which span two decades, with quite diverse activities.  The objective of the review is to identify those projects that produce tangible, appropriate benefits for the communities they serve.  The vast majority of projects fall into this category and funding will be available, subject to budgetary constraints, through the new programme in 2010.  This work is now completed and I understand the outcome will shortly be notified to all concerned.  For those projects that do not come into this category, continued funding from the Department will not be available.  However, an appeals mechanism has been put in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure no one here questions my commitment, or that of my Department, to local and community development.  The new integrated programme is a major step forward and I am particularly pleased that, notwithstanding severe budgetary constraints, the case we made for the new programme was accepted in determining allocations and its potential value was recognised.  On that basis, we were able to secure major funding for the programme for 2010.  In that context, I am pleased to say the Minister and I have been able to ring-fence funding for CDPs that are continuing and maintain funding for these at 2009 levels.  In few other areas of public spending has it been possible to do this.</P>
        <P>We have taken care in the design of the implementation process for the new programme and allowed more than enough time to ensure the objective of integrated service delivery can be achieved.  Once CDPs sign up to the new programme, the first tranche of 2010 funding will be provided.  This allows for service continuity from day one.  A process of engagement will begin in early 2010, with the CDPs and local development companies or partnerships agreeing at local level how the programme is to be delivered for the rest of the year.  My Department and Pobal will be providing a range of supports to ensure the process is successful.  At the same time, all stakeholders will be working together to put in place a plan to ensure integrated service delivery and structures for the period after 2010.  My Department and Pobal will also be supporting that process and working with all key stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The Department has set out a model for integrated service delivery and structures at a local level and I am aware there is opposition to these among some CDPs.  However, we have said repeatedly that it is up to the CDPs and the local development companies to bring forward other models.  We have also stated repeatedly that if those models are better than ours we will accept them.  So far, no one has come forward with any such models, although there is plenty of time yet.</P>
        <P>It may be that CDPs simply want the current arrangements to continue, but this is not an option.  Up to now, we have had two separate programmes delivered by separate companies.  From 1 January 2010, we will have one integrated programme and for that we need integrated service delivery and structures.  I am aware that CDPs have concerns about assets, the impact on local service delivery, local buy-in and accountability.  Every one of those issues, and any other issues arising, can be addressed fully in the implementation process I have outlined.  There will be time to address all of this in 2010.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that no decisions are required on any of these issues until mid-2010 at the earliest and even then the objective will be to secure local agreement on all issues <Col N="352"/>before any final decisions are taken or implemented.  If that is not already clear to CDPs, my Department will clarify these matters in the next few days when offering funding under the new programme for 2010.</P>
        <P>The way forward is for CDPs to sign up to the new programme.  In this way they can take the real opportunity they now have to continue the good work they are doing in their communities and to have a positive influence on the delivery of the new programme.  Those who have at heart the best interests of the communities we serve will recommend early sign-up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are two problems with the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  The availability of funding is conditional upon signing up; if groups do not sign up they will not get their funding, which is wrong.  There has not been proper dialogue and consultation with the CDPs.  There is also the outstanding question of the removal of the voluntary boards and assets, which has not been addressed.  It is important to put this in context.  The CDPs have said they are willing to engage in consultation and I appeal to the Minister of State to do the same at this late stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant to the issue of assets, and many others, that the implementation phase runs for a year, particularly because there is a wide range of issues involved.</P>
        <P>We have been considering this issue for a few months.  The Senator referred specifically to the McCarthy report.  It is important to point out that the funding made available to our Department in today&rsquo;s budget allows the single integrated programme to go ahead.  If what was recommended in the McCarthy report had been implemented today we would not be having this debate.  There is adequate time to deal with the issue.  I encourage all groups to accept this is about community development.  We have a variety of structures and we are trying to implement a single integrated programme which will benefit the communities we all strive to serve.</P>
