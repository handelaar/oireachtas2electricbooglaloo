	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give approval to allow the Dungloe and Glenties sewerage schemes, County Donegal proceed to tender stage and set a time frame for completion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, with regard to the dental treatment benefit scheme, to accept that the State has an obligation to offer dental coverage to 2 million people and that the abolition of this scheme would have a negative effect on public health and cost the Exchequer &euro;112 million per year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to recognise the level of domestic violence and its implications for our society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make a statement on his plans to integrate the community development programme and the local development social inclusion programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline how funding can be secured for a private road in a major residential area, namely, Derrydonnell North, Oranmore, County Galway, to alleviate current and future flooding.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill, Mullen, Keaveney and Buttimer as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected for discussion, the matters raised by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill, Mullen and Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Healy Eames as <Col N="206"/>the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  Senator Buttimer may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re regional fisheries boards, back from committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2009 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 and to adjourn not later than 4 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 3, Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 but not before 4.20 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent days the Government has shown nothing short of endemic incompetence.  We have a divided Cabinet and the pattern of failure seems to go on and on.  The Government failed to manage the boom and now is failing to inspire confidence.  Families and parents want nothing more than to have confidence in the country.  They do not want to see their children emigrating.  If the Government were to inspire confidence or show leadership, the people would row in behind it but we are not seeing this.  </P>
        <P>I refer to Mr. Peter McLoone&rsquo;s article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He lists the reforms that were on the table last week and refers to &ldquo;Long-sought changes like the extended working day, which would deliver more flexibility&rdquo; in the health service.  We read in the newspapers today about a man in Beaumont Hospital who did not receive the treatment he needed when in the hospital, with tragic consequences.  I wonder what his family thinks about the lack of reform in the health service.</P>
        <P>Mr. McLoone refers to &ldquo;increases in day care, community health services, outpatient and diagnostic capacity&rdquo; and lists all the reforms discussed.  Why were these reforms not on the table in the past 12 years?  Why are they being discussed at the 11th hour, given that they are so badly needed to provide the front-line services we need in health, education and every other sector?  It is an absolute disgrace and a complete indictment of the way the boom has been managed by the Government.  There was a lack of focus on reform which is clear for all to see considering what was on the table last week.  It has left those in front-line services in a very distressed state and means those trying to access services are getting less than they should.</P>
        <P>People are very frightened and upset about what will be in the budget tomorrow.  I reiterate my call for the protection of child benefit and services for the vulnerable.  There should be a focus on creating and maintaining jobs because this is critical to the thousands who are now unemployed and the companies trying to retain staff in employment.  I ask the Leader to respond to these points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader state whether we are to have a debate on the budget tomorrow?  I have been in this House for 16 years and, to the best of my knowledge, we have had a debate on every budget within an hour of its announcement.  It seems unusual that we are to debate the expiry dates of gift vouchers, an issue which I am sure is very important.  However, if the House is to receive the recognition it needs, we should not be debating gift voucher expiry dates within an hour of the announcement of the budget.  I urge the Leader or the Labour Party to address this.  This is not a day on which to talk about the budget because I hope we will have plenty of time to do so tomorrow.  </P>
        <P>I was impressed to read in the newspapers today that the President had recognised the female garda&iacute; &mdash; the term &ldquo;bean garda&rdquo; is no longer acceptable &mdash; of 1958.  What impressed me more was the high standing of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the almost 80 years of its existence.  In a <Col N="207"/>worldwide survey of the levels of trust and confidence in police forces the Garda had the highest rating, at 83%.  However, this level of trust and confidence in the force is in serious danger of being lost if the Garda decides to lead the way in the difficulties it is forecasting on foot of tomorrow&rsquo;s budget.  I urge it to ensure it does not stretch the law too far.  Let some other body lead the protest.  If the Garda wants to follow, it may then make a decision on so doing, but it worries me a great deal that the Garda could take action of questionable legality.  I urge it not to do so.</P>
        <P>The report by Dublin Friends of the Earth, entitled Through the Roof, refers to the energy certificates that are obliged to be displayed in every public building.  They are displayed in only 20% of public buildings.  It is hoped they will be displayed in 33% by the end of the year.  Acting on this policy could save a substantial sum of money.  On the day after the commencement of the climate change conference in Copenhagen it seems we are slipping up in this area very badly.  I urge the Minister responsible to ensure we take the steps necessary to certify our public buildings both to save money and set standards that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  We are setting a standard way below what is expected.  If the United Nations conference in Copenhagen sets new standards, we will not even reach the old ones.  Let us make sure we act on the matter immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind colleagues, including Senator Quinn, that the Labour Party does not order the business in this House, that is a matter for the Leader.  </P>
        <P>While I have no objection to having a debate on the budget tomorrow or any other day, we have probably the same likelihood of being listened to on the budget as we have on the issue of gift vouchers, that is, somewhere approaching zero.  However, if there is to be a debate, let us have it.  At the risk of returning to what is sometimes described as &ldquo;navel gazing&rdquo; on our part in the Chamber, it again raises the issue of the farce we have had in the House in recent weeks.  There have been calls for Opposition Members to come in and bring forward their budgetary proposals in order that they might be listened to and that the Government side can respond.  There has been a parade of so-called debates on the budget in the past six weeks which, in fact, do not constitute debates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald quoted from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  The newspaper contains another interesting piece by Ms Elaine Byrne on the question of what the Parliament is doing and its role in the budgetary process which approaches nil.  Ms Byrne describes what will happen in the other House tomorrow as a theatrical exercise in parliamentary voting fodder.  She is correct.  If the D&aacute;il is being rendered irrelevant regarding the budget, what can we say about this House?  What expectations do we have for ourselves as politicians that we can make any difference to the future of the country when there is no serious attempt to ensure scrutiny of budgetary matters in this House or the Government does not provide for a proper debate or engage with Members of both Houses?  It is no wonder people see the Houses of Parliament as amounting to no more than an opportunity for Members to vent a particular prejudice such as whether they are against or in favour of the public service.  That is what the House has been reduced to by the actions of the Government in failing to engage with Members on the budget.  In the past 24 hours there has been leak after leak, which is the manner in which the budget is being communicated to the people.  The Government wants to see where the lines of resistance are through the media, write the final speech and then announce the budget in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  I am sorry if I sound cynical about debates in this House.  As the Leader knows, every time there is a debate I participate in it and have no difficulty in doing so.  However, such debates are not taken seriously.  It is a case of the emperor&rsquo;s clothes, in terms of this and the other Chamber because people are starting to wonder what is the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="208"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The House should at the earliest possible opportunity discuss the Budget Statement to be made tomorrow in the other House.  It is important that the timing of the debate be such that it will allow this House to be heard to maximum effect. The tradition has been to speak on the budget on a Wednesday evening at a time which clashed with the speeches of Opposition speakers in the other House.  Speaking on it early on Thursday morning would mean we would clash with the speeches of the party Leaders in the other House.  The earliest opportunity outside these periods would be the correct time for the Seanad to have its voice heard.  While I accept where Senator Alex White is coming from in terms of his own views on the matter, having such an opportunity will give the Seanad an opportunity to influence policy.  We must remember that tomorrow the Budget Statement will be made and legislative effect to what will happens on foot of that statement through the Finance Bill will not be given until late January and early February.  There is scope to contribute to that process, as the Seanad has shown itself capable of doing in the past.</P>
        <P>That agreement has not been reached through the social partnership process is something of which we also need to be aware and return to at another opportunity.  The issue has been raised on the Order of Business on a regular basis.  However, it is not enough that short-term agreements are reached between the social partners and the Government.  It is important that such agreements are credible.  If they are not credible to the people from whom we are borrowing money, it will affect our ability to borrow money and the terms on which we borrow it, which means we would do the country a disservice.  That is why decisions need to be made and hopefully will be made in the context of tomorrow&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business &ldquo;that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs come to the House to discuss the appalling social welfare fraud that was so well documented on last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I congratulate &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; for being able to uncover so much fraud.  Why can we, the State and the Department in particular not uncover such fraud?  It is estimated that &euro;2 billion has been over-claimed.  Some unfortunate families are about to lose child allowance.  There has been an increase in the cost of briquettes and petrol, which will affect the ordinary honest to goodness person and yet people are blatantly working while claiming social welfare.  What is being done about it?  Fine Gael believes in having an integrated identity card to stamp out PPS number fraud.  I cannot understand why that does not happen.  The Minister must come to the House to explain to us as representatives of the people.  I dispute Deputy Alex White&rsquo;s negative attitude to the Seanad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>We must represent the people who have elected us.  We should use this forum to shout loudly about such things as social welfare fraud.  I ask the Leader to take me very seriously and get the Minister here this evening.  We should cancel everything else.  If we can save &euro;2 billion by putting our heads together, then it is worth it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very disappointed at the reaction from the Opposition and from various commentators over the weekend to the intervention by the Taoiseach on the public service pay talks.  As a former trade union activist, I have always subscribed to the idea of partnership.  Where an acceptable deal cannot be agreed, somebody needs to lead.  On this occasion the Taoiseach showed the kind of leadership the country was seeking for which the people applaud him.  If it had gone the other way and we had come up with a half-baked agreement I am sure the Opposition would tell us that Peter McLoone was running the country. <Col N="209"/> The Opposition looked for leadership and got it.  They now know who is running the country and it can only get better from here on in.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend I travelled to a function by taxi.  I was so impressed by the taxi and its driver that I booked him for a return journey in the morning.  His taxi was a spotlessly clean Mercedes and he obviously looked after it with pride.  When I complimented him, he told me that unfortunately under a nine-year rule introduced by the Commission for Taxi Regulation he will need to get rid of that taxi at the end of the year and purchase a new vehicle.  More than likely he will downgrade the size and quality of his vehicle.  He asked me to raise this valid matter here.  There should be an appeals procedure for a vehicle that is nine years old.  There should be annual vetting of all taxi vehicles.  It is possible to have a 2009 vehicle that is filthy and tiny or the kind of vehicle in which I travelled, which is even better than the Leader&rsquo;s vehicle.  We should seek an appeals procedure to get fair play for our taxi drivers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was astonished to hear people on the Fine Gael side apparently praising the trade union proposals because during their discussion with the Government, Fine Gael consistently undermined and attacked them.  This point scoring reduces politics considerably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator misunderstands.  Trade union reform needs to be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would make people cynical because the time for this type of point scoring is over&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not point scoring.  The Senator misunderstands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as I hope is the time for the indecent spectacle we witnessed of allegedly Independent Members using their momentary leverage to secure local advantage for their own little parishes.  I find that disgusting when the entire country is facing a difficulty.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue of child abuse again.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that no church is above the law.  That is factually incorrect.  Yes, they are.  The churches are above the law.  They have been placed above the law by this Parliament and nothing is done about it at all.  Let us first of all nail that lie.  Let us then consider the consequence, which is that the Government is involved in the continuing, systematic, deliberate and knowing abuse of children.  It is doing so by exempting the churches from the operation of equality legislation, inhibiting the anti-bullying programmes in schools and so on.  It is also doing so in the terms of the partnership Bill, as proposed, in which the rights of children are specifically excluded, leaving them in a situation where they can be adopted by one member of a gay couple but left in limbo or returned to an institution when the adopting parent dies.  That is a disgrace.  I publically accuse the Government of knowingly, deliberately and cynically engaging in child abuse.</P>
        <P>What is the fate of the Bill on electroconvulsive therapy?  I am sure Senator Boyle will have noticed in today&rsquo;s newspapers that the records of psychiatric hospitals show this practice is still continuing with a considerable percentage being involuntary.  I know the Senator&rsquo;s Bill has gone a certain way with support from all sides of the House.  When will it be completed?</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is one of the finest police forces in the world, as I have said here on many occasions when we have had tragedies in which members of the force lost their lives.  The Garda stood by the State from the day of its inception.  Its members have put their lives on the line and their families have been threatened on many occasions.  In the new order and with the excesses of more affluent times the Garda is at the forefront in the fight against crime, drugs and anti-social behaviour.  Any Member who knows members of the force knows what they have to put up with.  The State owes them a huge debt of gratitude.  It would be a pity, therefore, if anything distracted from that proud record of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope garda&iacute; will reflect on this, no matter what problems they have or frustration they feel in the current economic climate.  Any distraction from or undermining of the record of a police force that cannot be compared with that of any other police force in the world because it is so good would be unfortunate.  As I have so many friends in the force, I ask them to rethink about what is happening and avoid taking a collision course with the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the manner of the breakdown of the social partnership talks and what we have learned since, it amply demonstrates Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s point that the Government has consistently bungled public service reform over many years.  It has professed its belief in social partnership which can be used constructively.  We have made proposals to the Leader and through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the social partners be brought into the House to assist them in their role.</P>

	<P>Senator Quinn is correct that the Leader is breaking with established practice.  In the 12 years I have been a Member of the Seanad the House has had a debate a few hours after the making of the Budget Statement.</P>
        <P>I second Senator McFadden&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  It is a colossal blunder if the level of social welfare fraud is possibly &euro;2 billion.  Savings on such a scale would bring us half way towards what the Government will I hope achieve tomorrow.</P>
        <P>A serious matter has arisen with regard to NAMA.  It seems the valuers engaged by the agency are speaking out.  I am not too sure about the appropriateness of this but they claim the discount will be much greater than was anticipated.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I also compliment the Taoiseach on his stand last week with the stakeholders on how best we could move forward and the notion of the 12 days&rsquo; unpaid leave.  In view of my own past profession, I could not see how it would work out and I compliment him for taking the lead and stating that was not a runner.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White suggested today that we were not having debates here, and I agree with him.  We have had statements, which will lead up to the final day tomorrow.  What do we mean by a debate?  A debate, to me, is a question and answer session.  I have no difficulty if we can <Col N="211"/>conduct it so that we will be able to draw conclusions, but we all know that no matter what way a debate ends there will be some in favour and others against, and that is the idea of the political parties.  I am apprehensive about these new concepts on debate versus statements that we are trying to bring forward here.  Neither is a good idea for the future.  However, I am open to further discussion on this.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Today I read about the National Education Welfare Board, which is a new board set up to deal with school attendance.  I am not so sure that board is working well.  Perhaps in the new year we should have a discussion on how this board works, how it co-ordinates with the HSE, the Department of Education and Science, the teachers, the home-school link, and so on.  I hope this is not another one of these quangos that do not fulfil their role.  It was meant to integrate all of the other services dealing with students with absentee issues, students with discipline problems, and students who are being fostered and are just out of HSE care, and how all of that works.  Perhaps in the new year the Leader would find time to have a full debate or &mdash; I hate to say the word &mdash; statements.  Whichever way we want to work it, maybe we would have a discussion on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on domestic violence in light of the fact that we are nearly at the end of Women&rsquo;s Aid&rsquo;s 16 Days Campaign to highlight the need to eliminate violence against women.  We need a debate in this House on the way in which legislation, in particular, could be amended to ensure greater protection for victims of domestic violence and to ensure also greater applicability of preventive measures.  I ask for that debate and I note others colleagues on both sides of the House have asked for it too.  Such a debate in this House is long overdue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a related matter on which we could have a debate, perhaps at the same time, that is, the treatment of rape cases in court.  I was present yesterday at a conference run by the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland, which is to be commended on its commissioning of a study on rape and its treatment within the legal process, which was produced by Dr. Conor Hanly from NUI Galway and a team of researchers there.  The shocking findings of this extensive study carried out by Dr. Hanly was that two thirds of rape cases reported to the Garda are not brought to trial, in other words, the DPP only prosecutes in one third of cases reported to him as rape.  That is a matter of serious concern.  We also need to look at the way in which it appears crude stereotyping of rape victims rules out in some cases the prosecution of reports of rape, and that also is a serious concern.  Other matters highlighted during the conference included the drinking culture and the impact of binge drinking, in particular, on cases of rape.  We need to look at the issue of rape and its treatment within the legal process, and at how we can improve legislation to ensure that the trial process is carried out in a better way and that we see a higher number of rape cases prosecuted.</P>
        <P>The Civil Partnership Bill, which was introduced in the other House last week, will be debated in this House in due course.  I welcome the introduction of some measure of legal recognition for same-sex couples but, in my view and in the view of the Labour Party this falls far short of equality for same-sex couples.  A number of us, Senators Hannigan, Norris and myself, were involved with the civil partnership train from Belfast to Dublin which highlighted the inadequacies in the Civil Partnership Bill.</P>

	<P>Many couples, young and not so young, are having difficulty paying their mortgages.  I am sure my colleague Senator Butler will be aware of what I am talking about.  Perhaps early in the next session there might be an opportunity for Senator Butler to put his innovative and helpful views to the House on this matter.  </P>
<Col N="212"/>
        <P>In co-operation with our spokesperson on health and children, Senator Feeney, I ask the Leader to organise a debate on diabetes.  On the car radio earlier today, I heard Pat Kenny interviewing a well known personality who is in hospital with a condition related to diabetes.  In the previous Seanad I spent two years trying to get a debate on this subject.  As everybody knows, diabetes is one of the major contributors to hospital time and drawing down health services.  Everything must be done to heighten public awareness of this condition.  People must realise that, in the main, life-style and diet contribute to it.  I would welcome such a debate if the Leader can arrange it in co-operation with the responsible Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange for an urgent debate on public service reform.  I was taken aback recently by the tone and content of some of the public utterances from union leaders.  It was my understanding from the benchmarking process which began many years ago that, to address the gulf that supposedly existed between private and public sector pay levels, the unions would row in behind a programme of modernisation and reform across the whole public sector.  Late last week, however, one got an indication of how badly skewed and unbalanced the relationship had become between the Government and the unions when union leaders effectively told elected representatives to &ldquo;butt out&rdquo; of the negotiations, and that we had no role to play in offering any opinions or comment on those talks.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend there was another indication of how badly skewed and unbalanced that process had become when the unions began to say they had a comprehensive and worthwhile package of reforms on the table, but that it was not accepted by the Government.  That package of modernisation and reform was the very same one we agreed many years ago as part of the benchmarking process.  It galls me to think that the unions somehow consider that this package is now in their gift to give to the Irish people, or not as the case may be.  That is why we urgently need a debate in this House on that matter.  It is not in the gift of the unions to decide whether they want to provide taxpayers with the public service they deserve.  It is an absolute entitlement and right of every single taxpayer to have that reform now, not later.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to provide time for the House to discuss public service reform, including efficiency, productivity and staff mobility.  It might also be appropriate to discuss what progress and savings have been made on procurement, which was an issue that was to be addressed this year, as well as ICT standardisation and curtailment of the decentralisation programme.  I would greatly appreciate it if the Leader could first obtain the information concerning the latter part of my question, as well as arranging time for a debate on public service reform. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The one lesson that can be learned from Mr. McLoone&rsquo;s listing of the reforms that were on the table last week, is that we did not successfully negotiate the benchmarking process a few years ago.  It is clear from the list of reforms that Mr. McLoone set out last week that the Government flunked benchmarking.  It is also very clear that on successive occasions since the benchmarking process, the opportunity to achieve public sector reform was missed.  This now needs to be addressed.  For that reason I support the calls for an immediate debate in this House on the whole subject of public service reform. </P>
        <P>Similarly there is need for a real debate on the issues raised in last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, on social welfare fraud, because there are significant media leaks today and yesterday that suggest we may have a lowering of children&rsquo;s allowance.  Children&rsquo;s allowance was the one direct payment to children.  In many problematic homes it ensured that children at least got fed and clothed.  It should be sacrosanct and preserved.  The way to preserve it is to address social welfare fraud.  My colleague, Senator McFadden, has brought this issue <Col N="213"/>succinctly and clearly before the House today and it is an extraordinarily serious matter.  If, on the one hand, we ignore fraud and fail to competently address it while on the other hand proceeding to take from children a direct payment that provides food and clothes for them, along with their basic needs, that is a travesty of justice.  It does not follow that because a home is middle class or a family appears to be well off, on the surface, that the children are getting their rights.  Children are often abused in what might appear to be a &ldquo;well off&rdquo; home.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to attack children.  It is certainly wrong, when a bit of administrative competence could otherwise resolve the problem.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I read in the health supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning an article on bullying  in schools.  I was shocked to see that boys as young as six to nine years of age are being bullied in the most horrific manner.  In many cases parents are not even aware of what is going on.  I raise this because I again want to ask the Leader not to forget about having a debate on mental health when we come back in January, particularly mental health in adolescents and young people and the lack of ringfenced beds.  What starts with the bullying of a six or nine year old in a school classroom or a playground can often lead to much more difficult problems.</P>
        <P>I support my colleague, Senator Glynn, in seeking a debate on diabetes, particularly now that this is again in the media.  It is sad that we only talk about this when our attention is drawn to it by someone in the public eye who is suffering, while nonetheless, wishing that person well.  I recall a debate in the last Seanad, perhaps three and half years ago, and I was astounded at the information shared during that discussion.  Many men tend to put diabetes-related ailments down to other factors and do not have it attended to quickly enough.  However, as Senator Glynn has said, a little knowledge is a good thing.  In a situation such as this, knowledge is king.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn queried whether the introduction of the Labour Party Bill tomorrow night on gift vouchers, might not, perhaps, be too trivial.  We would like to see the debate widened to include consumer issues in general, which is very relevant coming up to the Christmas period when many people will spend a great deal of money.  It is very important that we highlight the whole issue of consumer rights. </P>
        <P>Senator Quinn might recall that we tabled this Bill a few weeks ago, but gave way to allow a debate to be held on flooding, which was then a major problem.  We are certainly happy to postpone tomorrow night&rsquo;s debate if the Leader can get the Minister for Finance into the Seanad to discuss the budget.  We shall give way and have the debate on gift vouchers another night.</P>
        <P>However, there is a fundamental point to be addressed on the relevance of this House and how trivial we are.  I saw in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that of all the Private Members&rsquo; Bills introduced in the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State, only about 40 were accepted by the Government, compared to several hundred in the UK over the same period.  There is, therefore, an issue with how relevant the Government regards not just this House, but the D&aacute;il, as regards Private Members&rsquo; Bills.  The Seanad can be more relevant if the Government would take on board some of the Bills that come forward.  Tomorrow night&rsquo;s Bill on gift vouchers should not be contentious.  It makes sense and protects the rights of consumers.  I ask the Leader to find a way to allow his party to support the Bill tomorrow night.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek a debate on benchmarking.  Senator Norris has raised the issue of upward only rent reviews which has led to the anomaly of high rents, in particular in city areas, which has resulted in many premises remaining vacant.  Despite the fact that landlords would have preferred to have tenants in occupation, the law provided for upward rent reviews only.  This law has since been amended.  Similarly, in regard to benchmarking, we cannot allow <Col N="214"/>a situation where there is an upward review only.  Where the State is moving forward in togetherness, that is fine but where there must be retrenchment to ensure all citizens do well, there is a case to be made for a downward review in benchmarking.  In that respect, I am conscious that there are people who are availing of tax and pension breaks and various reliefs, even though they are earning significant sums of money and paying no tax.  In other words, the State is facing a tax wedge in respect of wealthy individuals.  Surely, it is wrong that there is such a wedge in respect of people who are earning large sums of money.  They can well afford to do without it in this difficult time.  We must ensure we protect those who need protection.  There is no point in Members saying &mdash; it is wrong to use this expression &mdash; the Government is making an attack on children.  That is simply not true and it is not anybody&rsquo;s intention to do so.</P>

	<P>I join Senator Quinn and others in asking the Leader to arrange a debate on the budget tomorrow night following its announcement in the D&aacute;il.  In my seven years as a Member of this House we have always had such debate.  I do not believe it is particularly fair to ask the Labour Party to suspend the debate on its Private Members&rsquo; Bill for a second time.  Members will be aware it suspended the discussion on the Bill a few weeks ago to allow statements to be made on the flooding.  There is no reason we cannot have a debate on the budget tomorrow following completion of Private Members&rsquo; business at 7 p.m.  I do not agree with Senator Boyle that we should have a discussion in January or February.  However, we should discuss the budget following its announcement tomorrow to allow Members to give their views on the proposals announced by the Minister for Finance.  </P>
        <P>I join colleagues who have expressed regret at the announcement made yesterday by the Garda Representative Association of its intention to ballot its members.  I respect the role played by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a fine force and an important part of the State set-up.  However, I appeal to union leaders to pull back from the brink whereby the force would effectively be breaking the law.  I do not believe that position can be squared with its role as enforcer of the law.  It should reconsider its position.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Fitzgerald and others who have raised the issue of public service agreement and express my shock at what I heard from the Government side today.  Everybody in this Chamber, the Lower House and people on the street knows that the Taoiseach was prepared to do a deal at any cost last week.  However, following the return of the Minister for Finance from elsewhere in Europe, a number of backbenchers developed a backbone and a large number of members of the general public expressed the opinion that the deal on the table was not worth agreeing to at any cost.  In terms of rewriting history, namely, that it was the Taoiseach who put it up to the public sector unions, nothing could be further from the truth.  The real position should be spelled out.</P>

        <P>I echo the call made by Senator McFadden that the Leader invite the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to appear before the House.  We are talking about the misappropriation of &euro;2 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  It is not the developers or the bankers but ordinary citizens who are defrauding the State of that amount.  The Minister should come to this House to answer Members&rsquo; questions on the matter.</P>
        <P>Why has the Minister for Finance not come to the Seanad to discuss social partnership despite repeated requests that he do so by Senator Bradford, myself and others?  This is a House of the Oireachtas but we have had no opportunity to have an input into the talks that ended in catastrophic failure last Friday.  The Government has failed to protect the worker and the citizen.  It has put citizens who work in the public sector at war with those who work in the private sector.  We now have war in our society which has been created by bad leadership from the Government.</P>

	<P>With regard to the Minister for Foreign Affairs being denied access to Gaza, will the leader invite him to the House to discuss the issue of Gaza?  Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money is being given to the Palestinian authorities in overseas development aid to rebuild Gaza&rsquo;s infrastructure, water and sewerage system, which are in dire condition.  Many people are suffering there at present.  For the Israeli Government to deny access to Gaza by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs is lamentable, to say the least, and a disgrace, particularly after its invasion 12 months ago and killing of up to 3,000 people.</P>
        <P>Opposition Members have raised the issue of welfare fraud and quoted the headline figure of &euro;2 billion.  That is a sensational and fantastic figure, and I hope they all feature on the front of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> tomorrow as a result.</P>

	<P>They are trying to extrapolate from the 10% or 15% who are fraudulent in high risk categories, such as child allowance to non-nationals.  We have all encountered such cases.  However, one cannot say there is a fraud rate of between 10% and 15% among pensioners.  That is not the case.</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, was quite clear this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the Department is looking at a 10% to 15% fraud rate in some high risk categories of social welfare.  In other categories, such as pensions and fuel allowance to pensioners, there is not that level of fraud.  The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme was excellent and we applaud it, but there is already huge investigation of fraud.  There have been huge savings of up to &euro;500 million so far this year through the Department and the Minister improving investigation.  Most importantly, the headline figure put forward by &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; was extrapolated incorrectly.  It is incorrect to suggest that &euro;2 billion can be saved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Daly&rsquo;s request for a discussion on Gaza at some stage in the future.  However, I wish the situation there was as simplistic as he has presented it.  The issue of Gaza and the Middle East in general is very complicated, to put it mildly, and <Col N="216"/>there are two sides to the story, both historically and politically.  The idea that bashing one side will somehow solve the problem is very unrepresentative of the real situation.  However, we will return to that issue on another occasion.</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator McFadden, about the urgent need for a debate on potential social welfare fraud.  As a people, the Irish have a very uneasy relationship with both paying taxes and claiming social welfare.  Let us be honest; there has been a traditional view that if one can get away with something, so be it.  It is a type of gold medal in cute hoorism if one manages to evade taxation or claim social welfare fraudulently.  I hope in the current environment of genuine economic distress, with the country on the verge of bankruptcy, the nation will be more mature in its response to taxation and social welfare issues.  I am not sure of the figures for social welfare fraud or whether last night&rsquo;s programme indicated the correct figures.  If social welfare moneys are being claimed fraudulently, it amounts to theft from those who need them more urgently &mdash; the elderly, children and those in need.  Therefore, I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s call for the Minister to address the matter.</P>
        <P>I support the call made by my colleagues for a debate on public sector reform.  Last week union representatives highlighted the areas in which they considered progress could be made, but I must ask why it has taken 20 years of partnership to reach these conclusions.  I hope they were being genuine and that the reform options put on the table last week are still on it.  As Senator Cannon expressed so well, the people deserve no less.  With the Leader, we should champion that debate.  I am tired of requesting that we lead it.  If the Leader wants the House to be relevant, he should allow us to take on board the issue of public sector reform.  Let us talk and listen to the stakeholders and debate the issues involved.  That should be the role of this House in the next few crucial months.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris spoke about other Senators speaking for their parishes.  I do not know much about that, but one payment we should all support is child benefit.  Last week I met the group Protest Against Child Unfriendly Budget and spoke to Treasa Dovander.  I believe most sensible people recognise the folly of attacking child benefit.  In 1986 the report of the Commission on Social Welfare clearly pointed out that child benefit was the State&rsquo;s way of recognising children as a public good and society&rsquo;s willingness to transfer resources from households without children to those within which children were being reared.  The Government &mdash; led by Fianna F&aacute;il I regret to say &mdash; attacked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I would like to refer briefly to a point raised by Senator Norris who wastes no opportunity to suggest the church is somehow above the law in certain areas.  That is not true.  The legislation on equality in employment has been drafted to allow organisations in the health and education sectors to protect their ethos.  Nothing could be more consonant with reason than this.  For that reason, there is good reason to ask that the civil partnership legislation that will be brought before this House be examined closely also.  It would facilitate an inclusive society in which rights would be provided.  People with conscientious difficulties would be accommodated as far as possible.  This is about tolerance and a genuine spirit of liberalism which I hope will prevail in the debate on the subject in the new year.</P>

	<P>I support my colleagues who have called for a debate on the budget.  I make this call in reference to what happened in Greece today.  For the second day in a row Greece has suffered huge losses in its stock market and seen the price of its government bonds and the cost of borrowing rise again.  This is very relevant to what is happening in Ireland.  If the bond markets and hedge funds get what they want from Greece or if the Greek Government shows the necessary resolve to sort out the national finances, the next country at which everyone will look will be Ireland which is next on the list.</P>
        <P>We need to see strong leadership on the part of the Government tomorrow.  We also need discipline.  I support the comments made by Senator John Paul Phelan.  Other colleagues praised the Taoiseach earlier, but the dogs on the street know he was rolled by the Cabinet on the issue.  They know that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste wanted to implement a deal that neither reflected the wishes of the people nor those of the Cabinet.  That is the backdrop to the budget which will be announced tomorrow.  Not only will the people be listening to the budget but people outside the country who will have a huge effect on our economic security will be watching too.</P>
        <P>We hear Member after Member talk about the need for better coverage of the proceedings of the Seanad.  An exciting initiative is being taken in that regard in which a live blog is being made featuring all the contributions of Senators today.

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to come to the House to debate social welfare fraud.  The national broadcaster did a good job last night by throwing a spotlight on this area.  We all agree that resources in that Department should be re-allocated to investigations.  Indigenous industries such as agriculture and fishing are inundated with inspectors and some of these could be redeployed to this area and save the State an amount of money.</P>
        <P>The Common Fisheries Policy will be re-negotiated at EU level very soon.  It is important that this House should make a contribution to the general debate on this area.  Most of the fisheries organisations have made their submissions to the EU already and this is a good opportunity to redress the many problems in the Irish fishing industry.  Many of our coastal communities have been decimated.  We are an island nation with considerable natural resources that could be exploited if managed properly.  It is important that views should be heard from all sides of this House on this issue.  Irish fishermen deserve and need to be heard.  They feel they have been sold out by past Governments, among which I include my own party because it, too, has been in power since the formation of the European Union.</P>
        <P>This is a genuine opportunity to redress the imbalance Irish fishermen and coastal communities are suffering.  I urge the Leader to allow adequate time for a good debate on this very important issue of national importance.  It will generate jobs and reinvigorate our coastal communities.  I hope the Leader can make time for this important debate before Christmas or early in the new year.</P>

Most of the comments had their source in one publication.

However, because of the untimely death of one of our colleagues we lost one week in our rota.  When I was devising the rota for the autumn-winter session, I allowed for the Independent Senators to debate, as usual, on the evening of the budget.  It is not the Leader&rsquo;s fault on this occasion.  Party leaders and Whips know they are pushing an open door in this House regarding anything the Leader can do.  Consensus has been the order of the day in my leadership and I am proud of it.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issue of social welfare fraud, I, too, compliment &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; on its magnificent programme.  It may not have been correct in all details, as some Senators noted.  The House will have an opportune time next week to discuss what is taking place in social welfare and the difficulties social welfare officers are experiencing.  We will debate social welfare in the House on two days next week with regard to the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.  I invite all who called for this debate today, who had very good suggestions on PPS identity cards and other matters, to bring these points up on Second Stage of the Bill next week.  Regarding points made by Senators Quinn, Boyle and Donohoe, I have already outlined the issues regarding statements on the budget.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Phelan complimented the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its high standing in our community.  A figure of 83% is a very successful percentage and I join the Senators in their view.  The State owes a serious debt of gratitude to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the wonderful work it has carried out since the foundation of the State.  I call on everybody responsible to look seriously at the challenges facing our country and consider the leadership required.  I ask them to get around the table with everybody concerned.  Nobody wishes to go on strike or out on the streets.  I hope this does not take place.  I would like to be associated with the call that everyone should rethink his or her position and value the contribution made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the talks taking place at the Copenhagen summit.  We will have a debate on climate change in the House on Thursday.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan raised the issue of the taxi regulations and the nine year rule.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister.  The Senator highlighted his experience in the capital <Col N="220"/>last Friday night and I will endeavour to have the Minister meet him in regard to his strong views on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.  That issue will receive further consideration in the House on Thursday from 11.30 a.m. until 1.30 p.m.  On the Bill about which the Senator inquired, I understand it will be brought back to the House in March.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s views on the National Asset Management Agency and property values, I will make inquiries of the Minister on that matter also.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on the National Education Welfare Board.  I will have no difficulty in allowing time for a debate to take place.  It is a worthy call and is made at an opportune time.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on domestic violence.  I have already agreed with Senator Corrigan that there should be a debate on the issue.  Senator Bacik also expressed strong views on the experiences of the unfortunate women who experience rape.  I will have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate on this issue also.</P>
        <P>The Civil Partnership Bill is before the D&aacute;il and when it concludes all Stages, it will be taken in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Senators Glynn and Feeley called for a debate on the incidence of diabetes.  I, too, heard the personality mentioned speak on the radio as I travelled here this morning.  It was uplifting to hear him in such high spirits again because he has given us all a laugh from time to time over many years and I wish him well.  I will have no difficulty in agreeing to a debate on the issue in the early spring session.  As Senator Glynn said, it is one of the greatest challenges facing most of us.  It is also a lifestyle issue.  The Senator also raised the issue of mortgage debt management, a topic on which Senator Larry Butler has produced a worthy document.  The House should debate the potential solutions.  Therefore, I will have no difficulty in allowing time for a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely looked for an update on the decentralisation programme.  I will have inquiries made in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeley outlined her serious concerns about bullying in schools and called for a debate on mental health.  I will have no difficulty in allowing time for a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on benchmarking and referred to the upward only rent review clause in legislation.  I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has signed an order which will come into operation in February to change this law by eliminating this clause.  I will have no difficulty in allowing Members to debate the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called on the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss social partnership.  The Minister took Committee and Report Stages of the last finance Bill that was before the House for our consideration on the banking sector and the setting up of NAMA.  I will have no difficulty in making that call to the Minister.  Any time he has been asked to come to the House he has done so, if available.  As we all know, he will be in the D&aacute;il most of the day tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Senators Daly and Bradford called for a debate on the situation in Gaza with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, present.  I will have no difficulty in allowing such a debate to take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coffey called for a debate on the Common Fisheries Policy and the fishing industry in general.  I have already given a commitment to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan that this debate will take place.  It did not take place due to the untimely death of Senator Peter Callinan.  The issue was due to be debated on the Wednesday he was laid to rest.  I will have no difficulty in allowing a <Col N="221"/>long debate to take place because it is such a serious issue for the country.  The potential for growth is huge and I want to allow as much time as possible for the debate to ensure colleagues can make a contribution with the Minister present.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping in the House.  Senators may speak only once on the grouping.  I remind Senators that the only matter which may be discussed is the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>Two amendments arose which are entirely technical or drafting in nature.  They concern the removal of three entries in Schedule 1 on page 30, the inclusion of which would have caused the term &ldquo;appropriate, appropriate Minister&rdquo; to appear rather than the term &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo;.  It appears that initially it was felt the appropriate place to insert this was in the Schedule.  Subsequently it was possible to put it in the main body of the Bill.  If these two parts were to be retained in the Bill, the term &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; would appear twice.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  That the Bill was introduced here is a great recognition for the House.  The amendments today are technical.  I appreciate this type of legislation.  It is a very positive Bill.  By and large, it has been welcomed in its passage through both Houses.  It is great that the Bill will now go before the President.</P>
        <P>I will not make a Second Stage speech on Ireland being located on one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, which lies off our south west coast.  The Bill does not directly affect this but it is a bee in my bonnet that there are several wrecks in Bantry Bay and Berehaven<i>, </i>and the<i> Kowloon Bridge</i> lies off the Stag&rsquo;s Head, a wreck which should never have happened.  It is historical and I do not want to take away from the salient features of the Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill, my colleague and the Acting Chairman for its quick and safe passage.</P>

I hope the improvements it will bring will be obvious in the near future.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for engaging with us.  Those who work during the dark hours and see the various <Col N="224"/>amendments which need to be made is evidence of the public sector at work.  I am satisfied the Bill has been concluded.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Before we commence Report Stage, I remind Senators that each Senator may speak only once, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  In addition each amendment on Report Stage must be seconded.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 6 are cognate and may be discussed together.</P> </Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 1</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, to delete lines 9 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p1- ?>&ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; has the meaning it has in section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009;&rdquo;.</P>
     
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I am amending the references in the Bill to the word &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; to ensure the term has the same meaning as that used in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  According to that Act the term is to be interpreted as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; means the transmission, relaying or distribution by electronic communications network of communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals, intended for direct reception by the general public whether such communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals are actually received or not;</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a comprehensive definition that includes electronic transmissions.  I believe Senators will agree we should seek uniformity and consistency in the meaning of these issues and that definitions should reflect advances in technology.  The term arises in this Bill in two circumstances.  The first instance relates to the victim impact statement, which may contain material that is not appropriate to such a statement.  The Bill enables the court to make an order restricting publication or broadcast of the offending material.  The second instance relates to restrictions the court may impose on the publication or broadcasting of details relating to the granting of retrial orders.  It is part of the safeguards surrounding those orders and is designed to prevent any prejudice to the subject of the order especially in the course of a retrial.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, line 36, after &ldquo;person,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;or any offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We had a full debate on the amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister might recall &mdash; certainly my notes indicate &mdash; that he accepted in principle the merit of the amendment, which proposes to extend the type of offence to which the victim impact statement procedure would apply beyond those offences involving violence or threat of violence to cover other offences within the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.  I believe the Minister accepted that <Col N="225"/>offences involving the infliction of, for example, emotional harm or psychological harm on victims could be covered.  I believe I mentioned offences such as the abduction of a child under section 16 of the 1997 Act, which it seems to me probably would not be covered under the current definition.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister accepted in principle that these sorts of offences should be covered by the victim impact procedure and he indicated he would introduce a similar amendment or certainly an amendment to extend the definition of harm in this context.  I am disappointed he does not have an amendment under this heading.  I did not press the amendment on Committee Stage because I understood he planned on introducing something similar.  I do not see why there should be a problem with it because it is very much in keeping with the spirit of the legislation and simply extends the type of offence to which the victim impact procedure could apply.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator wishes to ensure that offences that cause emotional distress to the victim are included in section 5(1) in addition to the types of offences already specified.  I had hoped to introduce an amendment on Report Stage but I am not ready to do so because we require more time to define in clear terms the type of impact and the scope of the offence that might give rise to such an impact.  I propose to introduce an amendment in this respect in the other House and then obviously report that amendment back to this House.</P>
        <P>We must have certainty as regards the offences to which this section applies.  We can achieve this either on the basis of an objective test or by reference to specific offences.  The objective test criterion can be achieved fairly readily in cases where violence in the sense of physical violence is used.  However, emotional distress is less amenable to an objective determination.  The level of distress will vary greatly from one victim to the next and from one circumstance to the next.  Basing an entitlement on a very subjective criterion could lead to a legal argument at sentencing hearing as to whether section 5 applies in a particular case.  Such a development would not be in anyone&rsquo;s interest, least of all the victim.</P>
        <P>It seems unlikely that we shall be able to find some reasonable objective test that can specify the degree of emotional distress to be endured by a victim before an entitlement to make a statement arises.  Therefore, the best approach is to identify certain specific offences where physical violence may not always arise, but which can be said with a high degree of certainty to cause emotional distress.  My amendment will probably adopt that type of approach.  By way of example, the offence of harassment in section 10 of the 1997 Act would very likely be included, as would other such offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.</P>
        <P>I accept that the Senator&rsquo;s amendment offers the certainty that I believe is required.  However, as I outlined on Committee Stage, many of the offences in the 1997 Act already come within the category of offences, including violence or threat of violence, to which section 5 already applies, thus creating duplication and making the amendment unsuitable for acceptance as is.  I agree in principle and shall introduce an amendment in the other House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for indicating his acceptance of the principle of the amendment and also for his indication that he will introduce an amendment in similar terms in the other House.  However, I am disappointed that he could not have had the amendment ready for Report Stage in this House, given that it has been fully debated in this House.</P>
        <P>I also believe that my amendment has the benefit both of certainty in terms of the offences it would cover and also of encompassing the issue of psychological or emotional harm.  Of <Col N="226"/>course &ldquo;harm&rdquo; as defined in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, includes non-physical harm.  The Minister will be aware of the need to ensure co-ordination across criminal legislation.  Inserting a definition based on the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act &mdash; in other words encompassing those offences under it &mdash; might be the best approach, rather than using this new definition that does not have a straightforward relationship with the 1997 Act.  The definition currently provided for that is an offence involving violence or the threat of violence.  There is a problem with different definitions of different types of offence and a lack of co-ordination between statutes.  I was really trying to co-ordinate with existing legislation and create some certainty.  I ask the Minister to consider using my wording in his amendment in the other House.  However, I will not press the amendment given what the Minister has said.</P>

The amended text takes account of instances where the victim has died either as an immediate result of the offence or where the death occurs at some remove in time from the attack.</P>
        <P>The family may, in these cases, speak not only about the impact of the offence on the family but in addition speak of the impact on the deceased in the period between the offence taking place and his or her death.

	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the principle of amendment No. 4 on Committee Stage and tabling his own amendment.

It may only arise in a small number of cases but it is an important principle.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment wants to make it clear that there should be no need for a warning to be given by a court to a person giving an impact statement.  This has to do with the ruling of Mrs. Justice Fidelma Macken in the Court of Criminal Appeal in the O&rsquo;Donoghue case in which she suggested the court might warn relatives that they would be in contempt of court if they went outside certain parameters.  It should not be necessary for such a warning to be given.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage I said I would not accept this amendment in that it already states the law as it is.  The question as to whether the courts&rsquo; responsibility to forewarn or direct a victim who is to make a statement about the scope or content of a statement should be set out in statute can be traced to the controversy several years ago where the mother of a deceased added additional material at the end of her impact statement which was not notified to the prosecution or defence legal representatives or sentencing judge.  The additional material attracted enormous media coverage, adverse to the person convicted of the offence concerned.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the Court of Criminal Appeal, as part of an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions for review of the sentence handed down in the case, made several important albeit <i>obiter</i> remarks as to how sentencing judges should approach victim impact statements.  The case in question is the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Wayne O&rsquo;Donoghue 2006.  The court expressed a view that the victim impact statement should be submitted to the judge and the legal representatives of the prosecution and defence in advance to ensure it contains nothing untoward.  The remarks of the court serve as a useful function in highlighting the dangers associated with the uncontrolled delivery of additional material in the statement.  However, it must be emphasised the remarks were <i>obiter dictum</i> and are therefore binding.  The case does not, therefore, place any obligation on the sentencing judge to give such a warning.</P>
        <P>Section 25(5) deals with this issue but from a different angle.  It gives the court discretion to prohibit the publication of all or part of the statement in the interests of justice.  Breach of such a prohibition is a criminal offence on the part of the publisher and broadcaster.  The mechanism will mitigate the worst effects of any departure but it would be preferable if unfounded allegations against the accused were not aired in the first instance.  If the sentencing judge considers a direction or warning is appropriate in a particular case, that option and discretion should continue to be available.  I know the Senator is not aiming to rule it out completely but the amendment proposed merely reflects the law as it operates and is, therefore, unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment would not rule out a discretionary warning by a judge.  It is an indication that it is not necessary for a court to give a warning.  It is inappropriate that there should be any sense that victims&rsquo; families would be singled out in this way.</P>

	<P>Section 5 of the 1993 Act places a mandatory obligation on a judge to take account of victim impact evidence with regard to sexual and violent offences, even where the victim of the family chooses not make an oral statement about the impact of the offence.  In response to amendment No. 2, I plan to table an amendment in the other House to deal with the already mentioned categories of offences in which such a mandatory regime is most appropriate.  This statutory obligation does not prevent a judge from taking victim impact evidence into account in other cases if he or she considers such evidence would be helpful in determining the appropriate sentence.  Judges always have had this discretion and creation of a mandatory obligation in certain categories of cases does not alter that discretion.  Creation of a mandatory obligation in certain categories of offences does not alter this.  My view remains that this amendment is not necessary.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 10, line 48, after &ldquo;competent&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and suitably trained&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to add an extra layer of qualification to the intermediary provided for in section 6 which inserts a new section 5A into the 1993 Act which allows questions be put to a child or person with a mental disorder through an intermediary who in a court&rsquo;s opinion is competent to act as such.  It is appropriate to add the term &ldquo;suitably trained&rdquo;.  The giving of evidence of a child or a person with a mental disorder is a sensitive area.  It would be useful for a court to have some indication as to competence.  &ldquo;Suitably trained&rdquo; adds an extra safeguard.</P>
        <P>I complimented the Minister and the Courts Service on Committee Stage on the excellent new facilities in the criminal courts complex.  One of those facilities is the new room where children may give evidence through a live television link.  The facilities are hugely improved and make the experience of giving evidence much less traumatic.  It is equally important that the intermediary is both competent and suitably trained and that a court would be satisfied of that before appointing one.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, after line 48, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;7.&mdash;In an application under this section the court may make such order as it sees fit to facilitate legal representation of a person in respect of whom an offence has been committed or a family member as appropriate, where it is appropriate to do so.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes to give power to the court to make an order to facilitate legal representation of a person in respect of whom an offence has been committed or a family member where the person in respect of whom the offence has been committed has died, &ldquo;where it is appropriate to do so.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This arises out of research into the need for separate legal representation for rape victims, in particular, that I carried out with a team from Trinity College Dublin in 1998.  Following that research there was an amendment to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to allow for legal aid to be granted and a counsel to be appointed where a certain application was made by the defence in a rape trial or a sexual offence trial.  Therefore, there is already some limited legal representation provided for, in that respect and, more generally, through the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, to provide advice to complainants in rape or sexual offence cases.</P>
        <P>This amendment seeks to broaden that principle somewhat to allow a court make an order in other cases to facilitate legal representation.  It is a matter in which there is increasing interest by victim support groups, particularly, as I stated, arising out of rape trials, but it has got a more general application also.  I would ask the Minister to consider incorporating this at this point.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated on the last occasion that he felt there might be an impediment to full legal representation, and that is not sought here.  It could be, for example, a more limited representation purely to provide advice, as is currently provided for in the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 in respect of victims of sexual offences.</P>

	<P>The amendment states &ldquo;legal representation&rdquo;, not &ldquo;limited legal representation&rdquo;.  If one was to allow this, as it were, one might ask: how long is a piece of string?  There would be all sorts of arguments as to what was the intention of the Legislature if we were to include this.  Legal representation, in effect, would mean the full gamut.</P>
        <P>I am advised that there are constitutional impediments to separate full legal representation for the complainant for the duration of the trial.  The weight of legal advice available to the Department is that full separate legal representation would tilt the balance of a trial before a jury to such an extent that it would conflict with Article 38.1, which states that &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission supported this view in its report on rape, and Mr. Justice Flood in the People <i>v</i>. MC, Central Criminal Court, 16 June 1995, intimated that making an injured party an independent party in a criminal trial would be doubtful constitutionally.  The legal advice available to the Department at the time the Sexual Offences Act 2001 was being prepared was that full separate legal representation in the presence of a jury would, in the words of the Law Reform Commission in its 1988 report on rape, which I mentioned a moment ago, deprive the accused of &ldquo;the long-standing benefits of a criminal trial conducted in due course of law&rsquo;&rdquo;.  The circumstances in which complainants are entitled to avail of legal representation are therefore of necessity very narrow.</P>
        <P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides an example of where it might arise.  The measures introduced by that Act represented a serious effort to allay some of the concerns of complainants in rape trials without breaching the fundamental principle of an accused&rsquo;s right to a fair trial.  I do not propose to make any alterations to the present position on legal representation in the criminal process.</P>

        <P>The Minister, in his response on the previous amendment, simply read out the same note he read out on Committee Stage, and I know what he will state on this one as well.

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, for example DNA evidence or an admission by the person concerned&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the first amendment dealing with Part 3, which in some ways makes the most significant departure from current criminal procedure, which creates the new exceptions to the rule against double jeopardy.  I stated already on Committee Stage that we need to ensure that the exceptions are drawn strictly given that this is such a departure from our current principle, that somebody who is acquitted cannot be retried on the same charge.</P>
        <P>The amendment, which we discussed on Committee Stage, seeks to specify the sort of evidence which is constituted in the phrase &ldquo;new and compelling evidence&rdquo;.  The idea is that by specifying what sort of evidence might constitute new and compelling evidence, we would offer some sort of limitation and, I suppose, lay out a marker that this would be something that could be done only in rare and exceptional cases.</P>
        <P>In drafting this amendment, I have drawn from the balance in the Criminal Law Review Group report and also from the English legislation.  The Bill specifies that such evidence is reliable, substantial and implicates the person concerned with a high degree of probability in the commission of the relevant offence concerned, and the amendment would add, &ldquo;, for example DNA evidence or an admission by the person concerned&rdquo;, which are two of the types of evidence that might be most likely to constitute new and compelling evidence.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister gave a full response on the last occasion stating that it was not appropriate to specify types of evidence.  He also stated that DNA evidence might not, in fact, constitute new and compelling evidence.  He is correct about that, but the amendment does not state that it would.  It merely states that such is the sort of evidence that might come to light and if it fulfils the other tests, could then constitute new and compelling evidence.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider, if not this specific wording, at least some wording to create a guideline as to the evidence that might be considered to be new and compelling in these exceptional cases where an acquittal is being reopened.</P>

	<P>I will not repeat what I said on Committee Stage, but &ldquo;for example&rdquo; is probably not a great phrase to use in a criminal law code from the point of view of certainty and clarity in the interpretation of legislation.  The amendment only states the obvious.  If it is to be considered new and compelling evidence, that is a matter to be determined by the court in a particular case.  It may or may not include DNA evidence or admissions by persons involved, although it more than likely will, particularly in the context of old cases being reviewed.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the court to decide.  Therefore, inserting the phrase &ldquo;for example&rdquo; is not necessary in this type of criminal legislation.  </P>

	<P>As I said, I am not wedded to the precise wording proposed, the wording used by the criminal law review group, but I accept that it was not drafting legislation.  It gave these two examples of the specific evidence that might constitute new and compelling evidence.  As the Minister acknowledged, it is likely that evidence on the basis of which acquittals will be reopened will include DNA evidence or an admission.  It would have to be of that high level.  Obviously, an admission would constitute reliable and substantial evidence that would implicate the person concerned with a high degree of probability.  While using the phrase <Col N="232"/>&ldquo;for example&rdquo; might not be the best way of putting it, it is important to have some parameters as to the evidence that would form the basis for the reopening of an acquittal.  </P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, line 38, after &ldquo;Court&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;if satisfied that the Director has given the person concerned all reasonable notice to facilitate his or her appearance and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I tabled two of these three amendments on Committee Stage and the Minister pointed out that I had omitted one related amendment.  Therefore I tabled a third, but they are all, essentially, along the same lines.  These are amendments relating to section 8, where the Director of Public Prosecutions is applying for a retrial order where a person has been acquitted, and section 9, where the director is applying for a retrial where there was a previous acquittal.  The third one relates to the actual hearing of the retrial.  In all those cases the amendments seek to ensure <Col N="233"/>the court would only proceed to hear and determine an application in the absence of a person where it was satisfied not only that it was in the interests of justice to do so &mdash; the Minister&rsquo;s wording &mdash; but also that the Director had given the person concerned all reasonable notice to facilitate his or her appearance.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage I pointed out that any of these applications could be made some years after a person had been acquitted.  The person, in the meantime, clearly is regarded as innocent in law and therefore has no obligation to make his or her address known to the Garda or the authorities since he or she has been acquitted.  It might well be that it is impossible or very difficult to track down the person.  That is why it is important the court should be satisfied that the DPP has made all reasonable attempts to track down the person before it proceeds to hear and determine an application of this importance in his or her absence.</P>
        <P>I was concerned on Committee Stage that the Minister had used the term, &ldquo;absconding&rdquo; about a person against whom a retrial order is being sought under any of these sections.  I pointed out that &ldquo;absconding&rdquo; was not the appropriate term to use because the person might simply not be capable of being found, not through any deliberate attempt to avoid having to turn up in court but simply because a free person would have been entitled, for example, to have gone abroad in the meantime.  It is a useful extra safeguard for the person who has been acquitted and in respect of whom these applications are being made.</P>
        <P>Again, given the radical nature of the departure from the current rules of criminal procedure that Part 3 represents, it is important to ensure the DPP&rsquo;s office has an obligation to make all reasonable attempts to track down a person against whom it is seeking a retrial order under any of these sections.  I ask the Minister to agree to take on board, if not in these precise terms, the principle that the DPP&rsquo;s office should be legally obliged to make all reasonable attempts to facilitate the appearance of the person against whom it is seeking these retrial orders under any of these three sections.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I believe we are not a million miles away from each other.  What we are trying to do, as far as possible, is to ensure the acquitted person, by purposely absenting himself or herself or arranging a situation whereby he or she is not available to the court, in effect can veto the application being made for a retrial.</P>
        <P>As is the case, the court must be satisfied that in all the circumstances it is in the interests of justice to proceed and that the hearing may go ahead in the person&rsquo;s absence.  The legislation as drafted addresses that situation by applying the requirement on the court to consider all the circumstances and to then apply the interests of justice test to ensure there is an independent consideration by the court of whether the prosecution gave the subject of the application or appeal reasonable notice in regard to his or her appearance.  The issue is well addressed in the legislation as drafted and as such the proposed amendments are not necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I should have said the amendments relate to sections 8 and 9, applications for retrial and, section 23 which deals with prejudice prosecution appeals.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that where a person who is aware the order has been made purposely absents himself or herself the subsection will allow the court to proceed to hear and determine the application in his or her absence.  I am not disputing that.  The amendments do not seek to prevent the court from hearing applications or appeals under section 23 in the absence of the person.  </P>
        <P>The amendments provide that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be obliged to give the person concerned all reasonable notice.  It may be, as the Minister stated, that the courts <Col N="234"/>will read that in because they already have the test that they can only hear in the absence of the person where it is in the interest of justice to do so.  One would hope that they would read that in.  However, it is important to oblige the DPP to give the person concerned all reasonable notice.  Clearly, if the person then purposely absents himself or herself the court can proceed to hear the application in his or her absence if it is in the interests of justice to do so.  The amendment does not seek to prevent the court from hearing the applications or the appeal in the absence of the person but places an extra obligation on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Given the enormous new powers being given to that office under sections 8, 9 and 23 this provides for a little balance in the interests of the acquitted person.  I stress again that the term &ldquo;acquitted person&rdquo; refers to a person who has already been through the criminal justice process and has been acquitted and there is therefore an extra onus on us to ensure balance and safeguards for such persons where the Director of Public Prosecutions is being given these extensive and radical new powers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 12<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, line 10, to delete &ldquo;, on or after the commencement of this section,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Although I raised this matter on Committee Stage I did not table an amendment because I wanted to hear what the Minister had to say on it.  The issue relates to the abolition of the double jeopardy rule and to whether such abolition should be retrospective and prospective.  I have considered the Minister&rsquo;s response to this on Committee Stage and believe the amendment now tabled by Fine Gael deals with the concerns raised by him in terms of interference with court decisions and the Judiciary.  The Minister&rsquo;s objection to the suggestion of retrospection was based principally on the separation of powers, to which I will come later.</P>
        <P>The abolition of this rule can be retrospective or prospective.  It is permitted by the Convention on Human Rights.  It is applied in the United Kingdom in its 2003 Act and in other common law jurisdictions such as New South Wales, which has introduced retrospection in abolishing the double jeopardy rule.  The fundamental point is that the change being made in criminal law is procedural rather than substantive.  Accordingly, there can be no constitutional or other impediment to applying the abolition of the double jeopardy rule retrospectively or prospectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The UK Law Commission report of March 2001, which is quoted in the report of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, chaired by Gerard Hogan, SC states that there is the spectre of public disquiet, even revulsion, when someone is acquitted of the most serious crimes and new material such as that person&rsquo;s own admission points strongly or conclusively to guilt; that such cases may undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system as much as manifestly wrongful convictions; and that the erosion of that confidence caused by the demonstrable failure of the system to deliver accurate outcomes in very serious cases is at least as important as the failure itself.  In announcing the change in the law in England, the Home Office underlined the point that it is important the public should have full confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to deliver justice.  That is the essential point in my putting forward this amendment.</P>
        <P>The Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group states that clearly there must be safeguards when we are making this change in the double jeopardy rule.  The report states that the review <Col N="235"/>group considers that while strong arguments can be made against general appeals against jury verdicts on the evidence, those arguments do not rule out the desirability of appeals where new or newly discovered facts provide compelling evidence of guilt.  The review group stresses that to avoid interference with the jury decision on the merits, safeguards would have to be introduced in the form of (a) an exacting threshold for the obligation such as that the evidence is compelling, for example, DNA evidence or a confession to the offence, (b) advance judicial approval for the application and (c) the setting aside of any acquittal in the State prior to the question of a retrial arising.  The report further states that it seems clear that a new trial could not occur in circumstances where there was an extant jury acquittal by a jury in the State or an acquittal by the Special Criminal Court on the merits; that the obvious form of mechanism for both avoiding conflict with an extant acquittal and securing advance judicial approval for the retrial would be by analogy with the right of the accused to apply for a review by the Court of Criminal Appeal of an alleged miscarriage of justice under section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1993 to provide for a similar procedure to apply for prosecution appeals.  It refers to mutuality in this situation, namely, a person convicted can appeal and apply on the basis of a miscarriage of justice under the Criminal Procedure Act 1993 but the DPP cannot.  The report further states that under such a procedure the prosecution would apply to the Supreme Court for an order quashing an acquittal in circumstances where, as with an application by the defence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, it is alleged that a new or newly discovered fact shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice.  The report in providing for safeguards does not suggest that one of those safeguards be that the abolition of the rule cannot be made retrospective.  It goes on to examine Article 2.4 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Protocol 7 and concludes that the review group takes the view that the European Convention on Human Rights would not be breached by a provision along the lines of the United Kingdom legislation as the convention allows both appeals against acquittal and the re-opening of acquittals following new evidence of a defect in the procedure.  That is important because, as we know, the UK law provides for retrospection.  The amendment is formulated so that it is the courts that ultimately decide on the issue of whether a new trial would take place with regard to an acquittal in the past, before the Act was amended.  Arguments can be advanced as to why that would be unfair or otherwise to a person who has been acquitted.  However, they are arguments going to the merits of such an application, not to whether there should be an absolute bar on dealing with acquittals that occurred before this legislation is passed.</P>
        <P>We discussed the constitutional principles to some extent on Committee Stage.  The Minister referred to a number of cases, including Buckley <i>v</i>. Attorney General 1950.  In that case, generally referred to as the Sinn F&eacute;in case, the Oireachtas attempted to directly interfere in judicial proceedings.  In the Howard and Others <i>v</i>. Commissioners of Public Works case, powers were retrospectively being granted by the Oireachtas, which would have affected a case already decided.  I do not believe this case law is pertinent or on point on this issue.  There is no interference with the functions of the Judiciary.  It is similar to the abolition of the double jeopardy rule &mdash; it is for the court to decide whether to set aside an acquittal and whether to permit a second trial.  Why there should be the distinction between cases which have occurred after the passing of this legislation and before it is not clear.  It is the court that should ultimately decide this question.  The issue of the separation of powers, therefore, does not arise.  There is full respect for the jurisdiction of the court to determine and decide on these matters.  The legislation with this amendment merely provides the framework by which that can take place.</P>
        <P>What is most important is that the change is procedural.  It does not create a new offence.  Murder is murder whether the procedural change at issue is prospective or retrospective.  The change does not interfere with the constitutional right to a trial in due course of law.  The Minister said Senators should consult the authorities on this issue.  I refer to one case, the <Col N="236"/>Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill 1975.  In reference to the Supreme Court under Article 26, Chief Justice O&rsquo;Higgins at the time delivered an opinion relating to Article 31.8, which requires trial in due course of law.  He defined that as:</P>
        <P LI="1">[F]air and just treatment for the person so charged, having due regard to the rights of the State to prosecute for the offence charged and to ensure that the person so charged will stand his trial.  The phrase &ldquo;due course of law&rdquo; requires a fair and just balance between the exercise of individual freedoms and the requirements of an ordered society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is a balance between the rights of society and the rights of the accused.  There is no suggestion that where an acquittal is set aside for a very serious crime, the person could not receive a fair trial.  All the safeguards are there.</P>
        <P>However, that is not at issue.  With regard to the authorities on constitutional law, Mr. Gerard Hogan SC is the author of Kelly&rsquo;s Irish Constitution.  The suggestion, in essence, is that making the abolition of the double jeopardy rule retrospective is in some way retrospective penal legislation and, therefore, infringes Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution, which states that the Oireachtas will not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.  Murder or other serious crimes are not being made retrospective.  They are already in the criminal law and the retrospective application of this procedural change does not change that.</P>
        <P>Mr. Hogan&rsquo;s book refers to some pertinent cases regarding retrospection.  In Magee <i>v</i>. Culligan 1992, the Supreme Court held that Article 15.5.1&deg; constitutes:</P>
        <P LI="1">[A]n expressed and unambiguous prohibition against the enactment of retrospective laws declaring acts to be an infringement of the law, whether of the civil or the criminal law.  It does not contain any general prohibition on retrospection of legislation, nor can it be by any means interpreted as a general prohibition of that description.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the key cases on this issue, M <i>v</i>. D and Gilligan <i>v</i>. Criminal Assets Bureau:</P>
        <P LI="1">[B]oth Moriarty J and McGuinness J respectively rejected the argument that the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, s 9 infringed Article 15.5.1&deg;.  This section enabled the High Court to direct a respondent to file an affidavit specifying the property which he owned or controlled and his income and sources of income for a period up to the last 10 years.  In <i>Gilligan</i>, however, McGuinness J pithily disposed of the Article 15.5.1&deg; argument:</P>
        <P LI="2">The Oireachtas has not, by this definition, declared any act to be an infringement of the law which was not so at the date of its commission.  The acquisition of assets which derive from crime was not a legal activity before the passing of the Act of 1996 and did not become an illegal activity because of the Act of 1996.</P>
        <P LI="1">In <i>Haughey v. Moriarty</i>  Geoghegan J said that even if the new provision for costs contained in the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1997 had been applied retrospectively to the plaintiff, he did not consider that this would have amounted to a breach of Article 15.5.1&deg;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Mr. Hogan continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Somewhat analogous issues were also examined by the Supreme Court in <i>Minister for Family Affairs v. Scanlon</i> where the issue was whether a new provision of the Social Welfare Acts permitting the recovery of wrongly paid social welfare entitlements could apply retrospectively.  The Supreme Court held on its proper construction that it did and rejected the <Col N="237"/>submission that such a construction was potentially unconstitutional.  Fennelly J observed that, unlike <i>Hefferon Kearns</i>, the right at issue which was liable to retrospective abridgement was a statutory right which was subject to conditions.  The Oireachtas had retrospectively tightened these conditions, but this was not a breach of Article 15.5.1&deg;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Mr. Hogan concludes:</P>
        <P LI="1">The combined effect of <i>M, Gilligan, Haughey </i>and <i>Scanlon</i> appears to be that retrospective legislation dealing with essentially procedural, remedial and adjectival matters falls outside the scope of Article 15.5.1&deg;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That makes my case.  The change here is procedural and therefore not caught by Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution, which is the Minister&rsquo;s concern.</P>
        <P>If we accept that we cannot make this change retrospective, the Minister is saying, in effect, that a person acquitted of a serious crime has a legitimate expectation, even if his or her acquittal was wrong, a miscarriage of justice, obtained by deceit, fraud or perjury or even intimidation, that he or she cannot be charged and tried again to ensure justice is done.  That argument is somewhat absurd.  We made a procedural change in criminal law in the Criminal Justice Act 1984 when, under section 25 of the Act, we moved from a requirement of unanimity to a majority verdict of 11 or ten in serious criminal cases.  Does this mean the provision could not apply to the trial of indictable offences committed before this procedural change came into effect?  Does somebody who committed a serious crime who is now being tried on the majority rule argue that he has a legitimate expectation or vested interest that there would be no change in the procedure in criminal law matters and would be unfairly prejudiced by such a change?  That is somewhat absurd.</P>
        <P>What is argued here is a procedure whereby one can deal with a miscarriage of justice, as under the Criminal Procedure Act, where an accused who has been wrongly convicted, such as when Frank Shortt, uses this procedure to ensure that miscarriage of justice is corrected.  The Director of Public Prosecutions should be in a position to correct such a situation on behalf of the victim of a crime or society at large.  There is a balancing of rights and that is what we are talking about here.  Which is the superior right: the legitimate expectation of an accused not to be tried again for a crime which, based on new and compelling evidence, points overwhelmingly to guilt, or the right to life of the victim or his or her family, the right to the proper administration of justice, the requirement that crime be prosecuted and the need to correct a miscarriage of justice whenever that occurs?  In the hierarchy of rights, I would think the right to life takes precedence.</P>
        <P>The choice for the Minister is a policy one.  It is not a choice dictated by the parameters of constitutional law.  The essential distinction one must grasp is that between procedure and substance, procedural and substantive change in the criminal law and the mutuality in dealing with miscarriages of justice.  There is endorsement for this approach in the European Court of Human Rights, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>When we discussed a Bill I put forward in this House dealing with the exclusionary rule, the Criminal Law (Admissibility of Evidence) Bill, the Minister argued it was best to leave this matter to the courts to decide.  In our debate on 10 December 2008, on the issue of what is or is not constitutional and where there can be debate on such issues, the Minister stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">[M]y preference is that time be allowed for those arguments to be ventilated before the Supreme Court in a suitable case.  I made my views in this regard known, in July this year, to the Attorney General who, I understand, in the context of the statutory consultations which take place from time to time between the Attorney General and the Director of Public <Col N="238"/>Prosecutions, DPP, and permitted by section 2(6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974, raised this matter in September.</P>
        <P LI="1">I understand that the DPP is very conscious of the benefits of identifying cases in which the scope of the decision in the Kenny case [which concerns the exclusionary rule] can be argued so as to clarify the circumstances in which the rule applies.  While the lodging of an appeal in any individual case is, of course, solely a matter for the DPP and appeals can take some time to be heard and adjudicated on, I believe this course of action should be allowed time to come to fruition.  In the event that the arguments are put to the Supreme Court and it takes the opportunity to reaffirm the court&rsquo;s analysis in the Kenny case, we will need to think again and look at other options.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What the Minister suggested in that case was that we should allow the courts to determine these issues and determine the jurisprudence.  That is what I am arguing in this case.  I suggest it is left to the DPP, in a suitable case, to decide, if he deems it appropriate, to reopen and seek to set aside an acquittal or retrial of a criminal case whenever he finds the opportune and appropriate time.  Then the courts can decide, as is their function, on the constitutionality or otherwise of allowing such a retrial or whether justice would be done by permitting such a retrial.  This is why I say we do not interfere with the Judiciary and the judicial function.  We allow and permit the courts, by the amendment I have tabled and the manner in which it is formulated, to make that determination.  There is a presumption of constitutionality in the laws we pass in this House.  Therefore, I fail to see where the impediment is in this case.</P>
        <P>I want to refer to something that encapsulates many of the arguments I have made to allow for retrospective application of the abolition of double jeopardy.  I refer to the UK Law Commission report on double jeopardy and prosecution appeals with regard to the retrospective effect of the change in the procedure in the United Kingdom, contained in the 2003 Act.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We consider that the arguments in favour of giving the exception retrospective effect are powerful.  Substantive retrospective criminal legislation renders an act, which was legal when it was performed, subsequently illegal.  In the case of the procedural change we propose, [which is why I say it is procedural] the alleged act was already a crime.  The new procedure merely makes it possible (or easier) to bring the offender to justice, a desirable outcome whenever it is achieved.</P>
        <P LI="1">Further, if the new exception were not retrospective, it could well be a number of years before it could be used.  In deciding to recommend a new exception we have taken account of the fact that, in recent years, we have seen considerable advances in forensic science, particularly in DNA analysis.  It is the possibility of bringing these new techniques to bear on materials from old cases that it is likely to constitute a major source of cases said to fall within the new exception.  If there were no retrospective effect, the potential advantage in being able to bring these new techniques to bear on materials from old cases would be lost.</P>
        <P LI="1">Furthermore, if the exception was not retrospective, arbitrary distinctions would be drawn between persons who happened to have been acquitted before and after the relevant date.  This would open up the prospect of public outrage where new evidence came to light and the exception would otherwise have been available ... In such cases, we do not believe that a person against whom there is compelling evidence of guilt should be protected by a mere accident of timing.</P>
<Col N="239"/>
        <P FLI="0">The report quotes two members of the committee that debated the issue .  The committee&rsquo;s view is represented by Mr. Martin Linton MP.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">We think that it should apply retrospectively.  As I understand it, the principle is that it would be wrong to change the law so that someone is punished retrospectively for doing something that was not an offence at the time.  However, we are talking about people who knew that they were committing crimes, lied in court and got away with it.  Such cases are entirely different from those with which the retrospectivity principle intends to deal in law.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Mr. Paul Stinchcombe MP said:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am always slow to support retrospective enforcement, but I can conceive of nothing more self-evidently appropriate than where the sole purpose of the legislation in question is to prevent past miscarriages of justice.  The double jeopardy rule has been an integral part of our criminal legal system for many centuries, but the time has now come to relax it in order better to protect the integrity of the system and of the citizens of this country.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The report goes on to analyse whether the retrospective effect would infringe the European Convention of Human Rights.  It found that would not be the case.</P>
        <P>One respondent in the submission to the commission suggested the change proposed was not merely procedural because it would impose a potential liability to face criminal conviction and punishment on those immune from them.  The commission commented:</P>
        <P LI="1">We respectfully disagree.  The crucial question in our view is whether the effect of the change in the law is to expose the defendant to greater liability than he or she might reasonably have expected at the time of the alleged offence, not some later time when the defendant had been acquitted of it.  In our view the clear answer to that question is that it would not.  The defendant&rsquo;s exposure is to have been convicted of murder, both at the time of the alleged offence and at the time of the retrial.   On the other hand, we recognise that acquitted defendants will have organised their lives on the justified basis that they would not be troubled by criminal proceedings a second time. [This is an important point to which I referred.]  This is a serious concern, the more so in the light of our revaluation of the importance of finality in criminal proceedings.  Although in our view the arguments in favour of retrospective effect are compelling, we accept the force of this particular concern and we seek in our recommendations to provide some recognition of their force.  Where the new evidence was already in the hands of the authority at the time when the new exception came into force, we would expect an application for a retrial to be made with all reasonable despatch or not at all.  If, moreover, the court hearing the application thought it would be unjust to reopen the acquittal because the defendant had acted in reliance on the assumption that it could not be challenged, there is an argument which a defendant might wish to advance in order to persuade the court to refuse a retrial on the grounds that it would not be in the interests of justice, or thereafter at the retrial to seek to persuade the court to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process.  We do not suggest that the date of an acquittal should be wholly disregarded but only that there should be no absolute bar on retrospective application of the exceptions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is, therefore, a policy choice for the Minister and the Government whether to allow for the prospective and retrospective application of the change in the procedural law to allow for a retrial in certain exceptional cases.  While I agree with the principle of the Bill and the safeguards included in it, it is defective in not allowing for the possibility of retrospective application and allowing the courts to make the decision on whether an individual case involving an acquittal before the passing of this Bill came should be retried.</P>
<Col N="240"/>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the Minister.  I have set out the views of the pertinent authorities, including one of the foremost such authorities in this country, Mr. Gerard Hogan, SC, on why the retrospective effect of the abolition of the double jeopardy rule would not constitute an infringement of the Constitution, either Article 15.5 or Article 38.1 or any other.  On that basis, I will press the amendment.</P>

        <P>When we speak of miscarriages of justice, it is normally with regard to people who have been wrongly convicted.  However, we can take as an example the murder of a member of our family and subsequent acquittal of the accused.  It might be discovered later that the acquittal was the result of deceit, fraud, perjury or intimidation.  Are we to suggest it would be in the interests of justice that the person concerned could not be tried again?  I have heard these words used on numerous occasions throughout the debate.  If one were to ask the question of the general public, a large majority would say there should not be such an outcome.  If the acquittal were made on the basis suggested, they would say there should be a procedural change.  We are seeking such a procedural change.  Let the Director of Public Prosecutions decide.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Regan, has done a tremendous amount of research.  I ask the Minister to give great thought to what he stated on the matter.  If the amendment cannot be accepted in this House, further thought should be given to the subject before it is  envisaged that this law will be enacted.  It comes down to the fundamental act of fairness and justice; as stated, it would be &ldquo;in the interests of justice&rdquo;.  It is in the interests of justice that we propose the amendment.  If a relative of mine, the Minister or anybody else in the House was murdered by somebody &mdash; I use the example of murder, although there are many others &mdash; and new evidence was discovered afterwards about the person concerned, it would be in the interests of justice that he or she be tried again.</P>

	<P>I am very taken by the arguments made by Senator Regan and supported by Senator Cummins.  I also support them.  I know the Minister very much appreciates the arguments made because in the past he said he was conscious of the added benefit retrospective effect would bring.  I strongly urge him to bring further thought to bear on the subject in the light of all the arguments advanced.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The UK Act of 2003 was referred to, with the argument that there is no constitutional impediment.  Without rehearsing the arguments again, it is only in cases where there is new or conclusive evidence in which a court would be able to decide on the matter of a retrial, whether on grounds of DNA evidence or an admission.  It would be a matter for the courts to decide.  There is total respect for the validity of court verdicts.  This would apply only where new evidence was found and brought forward.  I am taken by the arguments quoted with reference to Mr. Gerard Hogan, SC, and his belief this would not infringe the constitutional position.  For all these reasons, therefore, I look forward to hearing the Minister speak on the subject.  I hope this will be the outcome because people feel very strongly about the matter.  I know the Minister very much appreciates this because he told me as much in a letter he sent me some time ago.  In the light of all the arguments made, he may have further thoughts on the matter which I look forward to hearing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke already on Committee Stage to the effect that I did not agree with Senator Regan on this matter.  I have listened to his persuasive arguments in favour of his amendment but I stand by what I said earlier.  This is such a radical departure from the current long-standing rules of criminal law and the principle against double jeopardy I do not believe it would not be appropriate to make it retrospective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment which has been presented in a comprehensive, persuasive and compelling fashion by Senator Regan.  Senator Bacik stated her concern that the proposal would overturn a tradition and a system that has been in place since the foundation of the State but the legislation, which provides for retrial, is an overturning measure in terms of where we are coming from legislatively.  We are asking if we should extend that retrial possibility in a retrospective fashion.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister is putting in place a new law from his Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but the question we must ask him to reflect upon and what we must ask ourselves to determine is where justice and natural justice lies in the body of this legislation.  As I and I am sure some of my colleagues said either last week or on Second Stage, if the legislation currently proposed is passed and if the provision for retrial is prospective rather than retrospective, we are, possibly for the first time in the history of this State, devising a system of justice which will have two categories of victims and two categories of crime, namely, victims against whom crimes were committed previously and victims against whom crimes may be committed next month, next year or two years from now.  That is a dangerous precedent.  It is a wrong to claim that in the Ireland of 2010 there can be two different types of victims.  That is something to which the Minister must give deep reflection.</P>
        <P>We are also putting in place what I would describe as a general amnesty.  We are now stating that in unique and exceptional circumstances, and it should be exceptional, unique and thorough and every possible safeguard should be put in place, that the courts and not the Oireachtas, the Minister, the Taoiseach or Members of this House or the other House will be in a position to consider a retrial.  We are also putting a limit on the types of cases which can be retried and saying that people who may have committed offences last year, the previous year or two or three years ago, even where new, compelling, exceptionally accurate evidence is available, will be granted an amnesty.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins mentioned a miscarriage of justice.  Those are strong words in this Republic because we are aware of cases where Irish people were victims of a gross miscarriage of justice.  Time after time this House, this Oireachtas and our Government highlighted such cases and stood on the side of those against whom miscarriages of justice were perpetrated.  I recall the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four cases.  Sadly, there have been many other cases.  The miscarriage of justice in this respect would be applicable in a different set of circumstances.  Victims and families are still suffering, yet we are saying there is no recourse to a retrial.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Minister would examine our amendment not just as a political presentation from an Opposition party but as a genuine attempt to make good law and a proper statement on the type of society in which we live.  It is not about overturning the Constitution.  As a person who is not a constitutional expert I asked the Minister last week to point out to me where in the Constitution is there any section which would deem our proposal to be repugnant.  I do not believe there is such a section.  As was pointed out by Senator Regan and, I believe, Senator Cummins, Article 15.5 states: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;.  That is not what we are attempting to do.</P>
        <P>We are speaking of the very few exceptional cases of crimes which were criminal matters 12 months ago, two years ago and five years ago.  We are not talking about new crimes.  We are <Col N="242"/>talking about the opportunity for the courts, in cases where substantial new and almost irrefutable evidence is available, to have the possibility of a retrial with all the necessary checks and balances in place.  We are not talking of show trials.  If a retrial was to be put in place, obviously the defendant or defendants would have the absolute rights to which they are entitled but I find it difficult to accept that the law as is being proposed would draw a clear line in the sand and create these two categories of victims, families and other sufferers, namely, those cases from 2010 onwards and those people against whom grave crimes would have been committed in recent years.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the need for us to examine thoroughly and reflect deeply on this fundamental matter but having read the Minister&rsquo;s contributions and interventions last week on Committee Stage, if he is to be fair he would have to concede that the legal body of opinion presented by Senator Regan in particular shows clearly that there is no constitutional or legal restraint on us.  It is simply a question of the type of legislation that we, as a House of the Oireachtas, want to implement.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.  This amendment and, more importantly, the Minister&rsquo;s response to the amendment, will imprint on his Department and on his tenure in office his absolute thinking in regard to victims, the rights of victims and the willingness of the State and the Judiciary to pursue cases where miscarriages of justice took place.</P>
        <P>Moving somewhat from this legislation, in the Minister&rsquo;s clear statements yesterday concerning the possibility of industrial difficulty and chaos in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na he spoke for the entire nation.  He pressed the correct buttons, so to speak, and called a spade a spade.  He spoke about responsibilities, justice, honour and truth.</P>

	<P>I ask him to do the same in regard to this legislation.  For the Minister to do the right thing in this instance, he will have to give the most serious reflection to Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  He should declare that we will not have two categories of victims, or two categories of crime, in this republic.  No amnesty should be available to the perpetrators of crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for raising this issue.  Senator Bacik set out the factual position in a frank and honest manner.  As a politician, I might like to move in the direction proposed by the Fine Gael Senators.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Senator Regan&rsquo;s assertion that this is a policy issue.  I have to proceed on the basis of the legal advice given to me by the Attorney General, who is the Government&rsquo;s legal adviser, rather than the advice of barristers like Mr. Gerard Hogan SC, for whom I have good respect.  The Senator referred to a number of cases I raised.  He said they are not relevant.  I do not accept that.  The principles enunciated in those cases are very relevant.  They go to the very core of what we are about.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan also undertook some research on the views in the UK in this regard.  It is true that the UK uses a procedural justification for this.  While our system is similar to the UK system in many cases, it diverges from it in the sense that we have a written Constitution.  Article 38.1 of the Constitution states that: &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.&rdquo;  The phrase &ldquo;in due course of law&rdquo; means, in effect, the law subsisting at the actual time when a person was convicted or charged or when the offence was caused.  It is quite clear that the applicable law at the time of the trial does not allow for the reopening of an acquittal in any circumstances.  Therefore, a new trial on the basis of a law that <Col N="243"/>was not in existence at the time of the first trial is more than likely to be regarded as not being a trial in due course of law.</P>
        <P>While one&rsquo;s heart may say one thing, and we all have sympathy for individuals in certain high-profile cases, of which Senators on the other side of the House are aware, one cannot make law on that basis.  One has to use one&rsquo;s head to make laws that are based on the solid legal advice available to us.  It is clear to me, on the basis of the advice I have received from the Attorney General, that we must have regard to the constitutional phrase &ldquo;in due course of law&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If I were to accept this amendment, there would be a clear danger of this legislation being referred to the Supreme Court for adjudication under Article 26 of the Constitution.  If it were to be knocked down in such circumstances, as Members on this side of the House and on the Labour Party benches believe it would be, the entire Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 that is being proposed by the Government, and for which I take credit, would be lost.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford responded to the comments I made yesterday.  He exhorted me to make a name for myself in this regard by making these provisions retrospective.  As much as I would like to do that, I have to proceed on the basis of what is possible and will stick.  All the advice available to me, in addition to my own knowledge of the criminal law, suggests that one cannot try again to convict somebody, after he or she has been acquitted, on the basis of a law that was not in existence on the relevant occasion.</P>
        <P>I do not accept Senator Regan&rsquo;s suggestion that this is a procedural matter.  That is the UK argument.  This goes to the core of the status of a person who has received an acquittal.  The Constitution provides for fundamental rights of due process.  It is wrong to suggest that this is merely a procedural matter.  It is a question of an individual&rsquo;s innocence or guilt, freedom or detention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it justice?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>One person&rsquo;s definition of justice may differ from another&rsquo;s.  Senator Bradford asked me to state where this issue is covered in the Constitution.  I used the words &ldquo;constitutional framework&rdquo;.  The advice I have received from the Attorney General is that any attempt to allow cases in which there have been acquittals to be reopened retrospectively would involve a fundamental breach of the separation of powers.  Although the Constitution does not contain the words &ldquo;separation of powers&rdquo;, there is a long line of judicial authority to the effect that the Constitution is founded on the doctrine of the tripartite separation of the powers of government.  That is why I used the phrase &ldquo;constitutional framework&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Having regard to this doctrine, it is well established that the Oireachtas cannot alter or reverse a finding of the courts as in doing so, it would be trespassing on the judicial domain.  I take some credit for the fact that I might become the Minister who has changed the time-honoured rule prohibiting double jeopardy.  We cannot pass a law that has the effect of overturning existing acquittals.  As I have said, to do so would be to trespass on the judicial domain, in effect.  If we bypass the existing law, potentially we will change cases that have already been decided by the Judiciary.  If we make it prospective, it is obvious that it will apply only to any offence that is committed after the date of the commencement of the Act.  If a person is acquitted of involvement in an act that occurs after that date, a decision on whether the case can be considered for a second time can be made on the basis of judicial decision only.  If we do it retrospectively, as proposed by Fine Gael, we will potentially change cases that have already been decided on by the Judiciary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It would only be done on the basis of new facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="244"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a complete trespass on the judicial domain.  At present, people who are accused of crimes but acquitted in due course of law are entitled to the irrebuttable presumption of innocence.  Under the existing law, a judgment of acquittal means, in effect, that a person who is acquitted cannot be prosecuted again in any circumstances.  If we assume that were permitted under the Constitution, however, and if this Bill were to operate retrospectively, the effect of a decision to acquit would be altered.  This would represent a gross interference by the Oireachtas and the Executive in the role of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>Legislation like the Bill before the House that allows for cases of acquittal to be reopened in exceptional circumstances would not involve the setting aside of a specific judgment, it would involve altering the status of that judgment.  The effect of such a law would be to reduce for everyone who has already been acquitted the value of that acquittal.  The new legislation would make it possible for each of those people to have his or her conviction reopened.  In such circumstances, an acquittal could not ever be said to represent finality.  I am advised that the constitutional value of finality of acquittals can be altered by statute, but only in ways which are consistent with that value.  Any such statutory change must respect cases which are already closed.  The approach adopted in the Bill is line with that requirement.</P>
        <P>Apart from the fundamental objection to retrospection, there is also a strong argument that to change the status of an acquittal retrospectively and provide the possibility of interference with the verdict of a court, where that possibility does not exist at the time of the person&rsquo;s trial, would infringe Article 38.1 of the Constitution which states a person has a right not to be tried on any criminal charge save in accordance with law.  The applicable law at the time of the trial would not have allowed for the reopening of an acquittal in any circumstances, and therefore a new trial on the basis of a law which was not in existence at the time of the first trial is likely to be regarded as being other than a trial in due course of law.</P>
        <P>It is not correct to say that I am deliberately adopting a cautious approach or that I am reluctant to test the limits of the Constitution.  If I wanted to accept this amendment, it would more than likely be challenged by the lawyers of affected people.  As this measure breaks the rule concerning the separation of powers it is, in effect, the Legislature interfering in already decided cases.  It would be referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution and would fall.  It would, in effect, do away with the view of the Oireachtas, namely, that we should allow, in very limited circumstances, a change in the rule against double jeopardy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not accept Senator Regan&rsquo;s comments on the cases I quoted earlier.  The issue of retrospective reopening of cases was examined by Mr. Justice Lynch in Howard and Others <i>v.</i> Commissioners for Public Works in 1994 where he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Oireachtas cannot alter or reverse that finding or the declaration and injunction made on foot of same.  To attempt to do so would contravene the constitutional separation of powers in that the Oireachtas would be trespassing on and into the judicial domain.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is a very pertinent judgment.</P>
        <P>The issue of the presumption of innocence was referred to by Mr. Justice Henchy in People<i> v.</i> O&rsquo;Shea and quoted by Mr. Justice Hardiman in DPP<i> v.</i> Independent Newspapers.  Under the existing law the effect of a judgment of acquittal is that a person so acquitted can never be re-prosecuted in any circumstances.  Were the proposed law to alter that position by operating retrospectively, the effect of the judicial determination would be altered.  The Oireachtas cannot change cases which are already decided by the Judiciary in our courts under our Constitution.</P>
        <P>The principle of Buckley <i>v.</i> Attorney General from 1950, also known as the Sinn F&eacute;in funds case, was referred to by Mr. Justice Keane in the Supreme Court decision in Pine Valley Developments <i>v.</i> Minister for the Environment.  He said, &ldquo;While there would clearly be no <Col N="245"/>constitutional objection to the Oireachtas altering the general law, setting aside a adjudication by competent court was another matter&rdquo;.  It is a very clear decision in that respect.</P>
        <P>In the case of DPP<i> v.</i> Quilligan in 1986 the Supreme Court allowed an appeal from a directed acquittal in the Central Criminal Court.  A question then arose as to whether the Supreme Court, in such circumstances, has the power to order a retrial.  The majority of the court ruled that no order should be made in that instance.  However, two judges of the majority, Mr. Justice Henchy and Mr. Justice Griffin, went further and ruled the court had no jurisdiction to make such an order.  They said the rule of <i>autrefois acquit</i> means that if an accused duly and successfully raised the plea that he or she had already been tried in a court of competent jurisdiction acting within that jurisdiction for the offence now charged, and he or she was acquitted of that charge in that court, a second trial for that offence may not take place.  They went on to say that this rule, which is sometimes referred to as the rule against double jeopardy, is but an aspect of the canon of fundamental fairness of legal procedures inherent in our Constitution.</P>
        <P>In the case of D.S.<i> v. </i>Judges of the Circuit Court and the DPP, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of a High Court judge prohibiting a third trial of a person for the same offence where in two previous trials a jury had disagreed.  While the facts of this case are different from the issue under consideration here, it is difficult to believe that the Supreme Court would decide that it was fair potentially to undermine retrospectively the status of acquittals obtained prior to the coming into force of the Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The arguments which have been made regarding the situation in the United Kingdom have been examined by the Attorney General but there is a fundamental difference between treating this as a mere procedure and treating it as we are required to under our Constitution where Article 38.1 refers to &ldquo;in due course of law&rdquo;.  Any change would affect the status of the judicial decision which was originally made and it would be inherently unfair to and against the principle of the right to a fair trial of a person who must be treated in accordance with the law pertaining at the time of the offence.  He or she should not be affected by some legislative changing of the goalposts by a subsequent Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>As much as we would like fairness and justice and while many heart-rending cases have been portrayed and postulated, we have to determine what the position should be under our Constitution.  People ask why we do not take a chance and pass the Bill.  Senator Regan stated there is a presumption of constitutionality.  If there is, why are hordes of lawyers in the Four Courts on a regular basis trying to pick holes in the legislation the Oireachtas has passed?  We must guard the Bill against any challenge.</P>
        <P>There cannot be any possible chink in the armour of retrospection in regard to criminal law.  In effect, the amendment asks the Oireachtas to change the goalposts.  It is a time-honoured principle of criminal law that people can only be convicted on the basis of the law pertaining at the particular time the offence was committed and not on the basis of subsequent law passed.  Such a view drives a coach and four through all precedence, our Constitution and all the human rights of a person who may or may not have been acquitted or convicted.</P>
        <P>Despite what the heart might say on this issue, I did not make this decision lightly.  We examined it very carefully in conjunction with the Department and the Attorney General.  We returned to the Attorney General on a number of occasions on this issue and the advice has always been that we cannot introduce such a provision in terms of criminal law in a retrospective way.  It must be done in a prospective manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has his mind made up on this matter and perhaps it was made up before the debate on the Bill commenced today.  The Minister is making the wrong policy choice.  I have attempted not to be political about this issue.  Following on from <Col N="246"/>the Committee Stage debate, I returned to the authorities on this issue.  The Minister is wrong to attempt to adjudicate on these constitutional issues.  It is for the court to decide.  The amendment proposed is designed to enable the courts to adjudicate on these issues.  It is for the court to administer justice and to take a decision on the balancing of constitutional rights.</P>
        <P>The case law on the separation of powers to which the Minister refers is not pertinent.  There is no suggestion in the amendment on the double jeopardy principle that any specific cases are being interfered with by the Oireachtas, which was the case in both the Buckley and Howard cases, on which the Minister relies.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s position defies logic.  The change is procedural, just like the change in the majority required of juries in indictable offences.  No one accused or acquitted of a crime could rely on the law subsisting at the time of the crime to determine he or she would not be tried based on a jury majority.  The Minister is misreading the law and is presuming to adjudicate on these constitutional principles rather than doing what he proposed we all do in respect of the Bill I proposed on the exclusionary rule, that is, leave it to the court to decide these matters in a suitable case which could be identified by the DPP.  The Minister has chosen to do the very opposite in this case.  It is this inconsistency that I find difficult to comprehend.</P>
        <P>The Minister suggests it is not a procedural change and that is just the British excuse.  He refers to the fact that our law is distinct from that of the United Kingdom in that we have a written constitution and he implies that, in some way the UK criminal legal system is inferior and, therefore, cannot be relied on to provide a guide to legislation here.  However, the Law Commission in the United Kingdom identified the changes being made to the double jeopardy principle and tested them against the European Convention on Human Rights and the protocol attaching thereto and found that the amendment in UK law in 2003 was compatible with human rights principles.  Therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s view that what I propose would conflict with such principles is simply unfounded.</P>
        <P>The Minister refers to legal advice.  We are not privy to it and can only argue the case on its merits.  The Minister referred to the possibility of a reference to Article 26.  What would be wrong with it in respect of such an important issue?  It is a question of the sound administration of justice and bringing people to justice in exceptional circumstances where there is a facility for the courts to revisit cases where there have effectively been miscarriages of justice.  The Minister, in this Bill, is blocking such a possibility.  He is loading his arguments in many instances, particularly by suggesting any reference would mean the whole Bill could be struck down.  The issue is that of retrospection and that is what may be tested.  There is no interference by the Oireachtas in specific former cases where there were acquittals.  It is a facility and an enabling provision for the court to decide on these matters.</P>
        <P>It is a policy choice and the Minister has got it wrong.  It is for the courts to balance conflicting rights.  The message the Minister is sending out is that, in the case of an individual who has been accused or committed, notwithstanding the fact that the judgment in favour of an acquittal might have been obtained on the basis of fraud, perjury or intimidation, no court can revisit his acquittal.  The message from the Minister to somebody acquitted, notwithstanding compelling evidence that would suggest a retrial is warranted and that the acquitted may be guilty, is: &ldquo;If you can get away with it, good for you.&rdquo;</P>

We must copperfasten any legislation we pass.  The Government must accept the advice of the Attorney General on the basis that it is given based on his knowledge of the law, precedent and the Constitution.  The Government cannot decide to second-guess his advice and reject it, thus running the risk of exposing the taxpayer to a substantial charge on the Exchequer in the event that we get it wrong.  The advice is the fail-safe and this was the case when Senator Regan&rsquo;s Government was in office for many years.  I do not accept his contention that this is a policy choice.  It is not a policy choice but one based on the legal advice of the Attorney General and on nothing else.  If it were merely a policy choice, we would make a decision based on what our hearts, rather than our heads, would say.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan has not answered the difficulties that arise and merely states the provision is procedural and that it is a facility to allow a court to reopen a case.  It is, in effect, prejudicing those people who have already been acquitted by the courts.</P>

The Deputy says his measure is not specific but it potentially in every specific case turns over or changes decisions already handed down and that conflicts with Article 38.1 and with the issue of the separation of powers in that we would in effect be intervening.  It would be a terrible precedent that would be used subsequently in relation to other legislation; that we can pass a law and in effect override previous decisions, perhaps just in a general way, that had been handed down.</P>

The Legislature just cannot do this.  It would be wrong.  Neither Gerard Hogan nor any other person in the balance in the criminal law review group in any way suggested there should be retrospection in this regard.</P>

        <P>The Senator has asked what justice is and what is fair.  We need to have due respect for the human rights of all people, including those who have been acquitted of very serious offences. <Col N="248"/> Passing a law to look after those who feel aggrieved is not a way of proceeding just because we think it is the right thing to do and know in our hearts there are some very hard cases.  One tampers with the principle of retrospection in criminal law at one&rsquo;s peril.  No society which regards itself as democratic would allow a Government on a whim or because it had a large majority in the Oireachtas to change cases already decided just because it thought it was the right thing to do.  The State clearly, validly and correctly has provided for a separation of powers between what the Judiciary does and what the Government or the Oireachtas does.  That should remain the case.  It would be a sad day for the Oireachtas if anything was done that led to a diminution of this.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 18, lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;, the Attorney General or the Director&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The wording to this amendment is different from the one I tabled on Committee Stage on section 14, an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court.  On Committee Stage, I agreed the amendment could be better drafted.  I have since redrafted it to encompass what was raised during those proceedings.  The Minister was sympathetic to my point.</P>
        <P>There is a clear imbalance in the section as currently drafted because an appeal lies by the acquitted person or the Director of Public Prosecutions from a determination of a court under section 10.  As I said on Committee Stage, in practice it would only be an appeal by the acquitted person because section 10 specifies a decision will be made in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions for a retrial order.  If the acquitted person were appealing from a determination of the court under section 10, it is inappropriate that the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions would have a role in certifying that the determination involved a point of law of exceptional importance before an appeal could be taken.</P>
        <P>I suggested to the Minister on Committee Stage that it would be more balanced and fairer to the acquitted person if it were simply at the discretion of the court.  I want to leave it up to the court to make the determination or certify that it involves a point of law of exceptional public importance so that the appeal can be taken.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to section 29, appeals, but he did accept in principle that the appeal provided for in that section is somewhat different.  It relates to an application for a retrial order where someone has been acquitted.  It is a new and radical departure from our current principle that a person shall not be retried following an acquittal.  Given that this procedure under this Part is entirely new, we must ensure the acquitted person is treated as fairly as possible.</P>
        <P>I am willing to accept there should be filtering mechanisms in section 14 and that an appeal cannot be taken as a matter of course.  It is wrong, however, that one of the parties involved, indeed the party in whose favour the decision is made, should have a role in certifying before an appeal can be taken by an acquitted person.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated a certain willingness to accept this principle on Committee Stage.  I will not press the amendment if he indicates he will accept it, even as an amendment in the other House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The appeal to the Supreme Court provided for in section 14 is intended to be available to both parties, the acquitted person and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the case of the acquitted person, he or she may wish to appeal in the event of a <Col N="250"/>retrial order being made by the court under section 10.  In the case of the DPP, he may wish to appeal in the event that the court refuses to make a retrial order.</P>
        <P>The appeal is not a full appeal.  It is confined to certified points of law of exceptional public importance in which there is a public interest in taking the appeal to the Supreme Court.  This is the same filter that applies in the case of appeals from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court under section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act 1924.  Such a filter is necessary, otherwise our final court of appeal would be overwhelmed with cases, many of which may be lacking in merit.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment concerns who may issue the required certification.  Her amendment seeks to remove the possibility of the DPP or the Attorney General certifying a point of law with the result that the court alone would be eligible to certify.  I understand that this proposal is motivated by the desire to rectify the apparent lop-sided nature of the section in this regard but, in fact, the provision is not lop-sided.  The acquitted person can call on any of the named parties, the court, the DPP or the Attorney General, to issue the necessary certificate.  Equally, in the event that the DPP wishes to appeal, he may certify a point himself or call on the court or the Attorney General.  Removing the references to the DPP and the Attorney General would have the effect of narrowing the options available, not only to the DPP but also to the acquitted person.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the section does provide an inequality of position in that the DPP, as a party to the proceedings, can certify the appeal himself while the acquitted person cannot, but that inequality comes from the different role of the DPP and is not unconstitutional discrimination or an inequality of arms.  The DPP, aside from having an interest in the particular case, has an interest in ensuring the law is clarified for future cases.  It is to be presumed the DPP will exercise his discretion appropriately.  Equally, it can be presumed that the Attorney General, who is a constitutional officer, would exercise his discretion appropriately as well.</P>
        <P>It must be recognised that the DPP and the Attorney General, as public officeholders, have a specific role to play in safeguarding the public interest.  Permitting the court alone to certify could potentially restrict consideration of what is a desirable point, and that is in the public interest a key element of the basis on which an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court.  Having looked at it, we decided that the proposed amendment would be a negative for the acquitted person and would be against safeguarding the public interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for giving it his considered attention.  As he stated, it is a lop-sided provision, especially if the DPP himself is appealing.  Although section 10 provides for the court to make the retrial order, I suppose the DPP could appeal.  In that situation, it seems even more unbalanced that he would be the one then certifying that the determination involves a point of law of exceptional public importance.</P>
        <P>I am not sure my amendment in fact restricts the acquitted person&rsquo;s options.  In practice, the acquitted person is most likely to apply to the court for this determination.  One can foresee that it might become almost a formulaic exercise, and I hope that does not happen.  My amendment would have been a preferable option.</P></Speaker>

        <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, line 35, after &ldquo;section&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
<Col N="251"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, and only where the Director of Public Prosecutions is contemplating the making of an application for a re-trial order under <i>section 8 </i>or <i>section 9 </i>of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This arises out of Committee proceedings which did not include this amendment.  In the debate on section 16, however, I stated that I would table it on Report Stage.  I expressed concern about section 16 and the wide-ranging powers it appeared to give the Garda in terms of arresting an acquitted person, and I expressed concern about the potential for the Garda operating a fishing expedition, essentially seeking to obtain the new and compelling evidence required.  There is a requirement that a superintendent or somebody of a rank superior to superintendent would apply to the court first, stating that he or she had information which was likely to reveal or confirm the existence of new and compelling evidence, but that is not a sufficient safeguard for the acquitted person.  I would prefer to give the DPP a specific filtering role in respect of the operation of section 16.</P>
        <P>What I have proposed is not to undermine section 16 altogether or to oppose the section as I did on Committee Stage because while the Minister explained fairly the purpose of section 16, there is still a requirement for an additional safeguard.  I propose that there would be a safeguard in section 16(1) that a person could be arrested again in accordance with this section &ldquo;only where the Director of Public Prosecutions is contemplating the making of an application for a re-trial order under <i>section 8 </i>or <i>section 9 </i>of this Act&rdquo;.  In other words, I am giving a role to the DPP in the first instance in filtering this mechanism so that it cannot simply be a garda operating on his or her own behalf and that there must already be in contemplation by the DPP the making of an application for a retrial order.  It seems that it is important to ensure against the sort of fishing expeditions about which I speak, and particularly because this section will allow an acquitted person to be arrested and then detained for up to 24 hours and questioned or interrogated during detention, even where he or she has already been tried and acquitted for a criminal offence.</P>
        <P>It is a radical departure that section 16 proposes in terms of new powers for the Garda and I would ask the Minister to consider a safeguard of this nature to ensure the DPP will have a role in making a decision of some kind before the Garda can apply to the District Court for the permission to arrest and detain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The effect of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment is that a superintendent could make an application to a judge of the District Court for an arrest warrant under section 16 only where the DPP is contemplating the making of an application for a retrial order under sections 8 or 9.  This would suggest to me that there is some confusion about the scope of section 16.</P>
        <P>The arrest power in section 16 does not apply to section 9; it is confined to section 8.  The references to &ldquo;relevant offence&rdquo; and &ldquo;new and compelling evidence&rdquo; in the section make clear that these concepts only arise in the case of section 8.  As I outlined during the Committee Stage debate, its purpose is to allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to further investigate information that has come to its attention since the person&rsquo;s acquittal which is likely to reveal or confirm the existence of the new and compelling evidence.  It goes without saying that an application by the DPP under section 8 to have an acquittal quashed and to have the person retried must be based on new evidence that has not been properly verified by garda&iacute; to ensure its reliability and substance.  The DPP cannot contemplate an application under section 8 until the existence of the new evidence has been established.  Requiring the approval of the DPP before an application for the arrest warrant can be made under section 16 would be akin to putting the cart before the horse.</P>
<Col N="252"/>
        <P>I accept that the arrest of a person in connection with an offence of which the person has already been acquitted must be seen as an exceptional event and must be subject to safeguards.  That is why section 15 prohibits the use of many standard Garda investigative powers other than as provided for in sections 16, 17 and 18.</P>
        <P>Sections 16 and 17 require judicial authorisation of the arrest of the acquitted person in connection with the offence of which the person has been acquitted.  It must be emphasised that before issuing an arrest warrant, the judge must be satisfied on information on oath provided by a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the member has information regarding the relevant offence in respect of which the person was acquitted which has come to the attention of the Garda since the person&rsquo;s acquittal and which is likely to reveal or confirm the existence of new or compelling evidence on the person&rsquo;s suspected participation in the relevant offence for which his or her arrest is sought.  The test requires the judge to have regard to the exact threshold that must be met to ground an application for a retrial on the basis of new and compelling evidence under section 8.  I am satisfied that such independent oversight provides a strong safeguard against any misuse of power.</P>
        <P>Finally, if the approach proposed by the amendment were to be included in section 16, a similar approach would have to be included in section 17.  Section 17 deals with an acquitted person who is already in prison for an offence.  As is the case with section 16, such a person may only be arrested in connection with his or her involvement in the offence for which he or she has been acquitted pursuant to a warrant issued by a District Court judge.  Notwithstanding that the person is in prison, the same safeguards should apply.  This would be the approach taken in the Bill as it stands.</P>
        <P>Section 16 is an essential section.  Without it we might never be able to bring an application under section 8 based on new and compelling evidence.  Section 16, as drafted and when taken in conjunction with section 15, strikes the proper balance between respecting the status of the acquitted person and the need to investigate and verify new evidence.  Therefore, I could not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept the amendment in principle, although I take his point that section 9 should not be included.  I also take his point that it would require a similar amendment to section 17, as well as to section 18 which allows for a search warrant.  It is set up as an exception to the general safeguard provided in section 15.  I drafted the amendment as a result of proceedings on Committee Stage because I considered it was an important principle to be included in the Bill.  It is to ensure the Director of Public Prosecutions would filter, make or contemplate a decision before the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would move to seek an arrest or a search warrant in respect of an acquitted person.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment was debated on Committee Stage, and I believe the Minister accepted it in principle then.  It is based on the expert group report on balance in the criminal law.  Page 248 of that report recommended a similar wording to qualify where the with-prejudice prosecution appeals may be taken.  It is simply to say that these would arise where the decision is made on a question of law which gives rise to a directed verdict &mdash; I apologise for the typo in the amendment &mdash; or which prevented the jury from considering evidence which was properly admissible or a misdirection of law to the jury.

There is some uncertainty about the hearing before the Supreme Court, but in an earlier hearing the court gave an indication that in dealing with what are called hybrid cases, namely, ones that may be tried as summary or indictable offences, the District Court was entitled to refuse jurisdiction if it was of the view that the offence was not a minor one.  However, the court appeared to say that there was no procedure to permit the District Court judge thereafter to return the accused for trial on indictment.</P>
        <P>I understand there is likely to be a further hearing on the matter very soon.  However, if the earlier indications were to prevail, it will be necessary to table an amendment that would clarify the position.  It was always understood that where a District Court refused jurisdiction, it had powers to refer for trial on indictment, so we shall be tabling an amendment dependent on what happens in the Supreme Court decision.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for spending his time in the House on this Bill.  I was not happy with the responses to the different amendments I had tabled, both on the rights of victims and on the double jeopardy rule, so I shall wait for the next Bill to see whether any amendment I put forward might be accepted by the Minister.  None the less, I thank him for dealing with the Bill from beginning to end, and also the officials who assisted in its preparation.</P>

	<P>I, too, thank the Minister for taking this Bill through the House.  We have had some very constructive and useful debates on the provisions within it.  I am particularly grateful to him for accepting my amendment on the victim statements, thus ensuring a family can give evidence on the impact of the offence upon somebody who has died following an injury and having survived for some time.  That is an important principle.</P>
        <P>I am also grateful to the Minister for accepting in principle the amendment we have just discussed on the with-prejudice prosecution appeals.  I hope he reflects on some of the other amendments I tabled.  Perhaps the relevant changes could be made during the D&aacute;il debates.  I am grateful to the Minister for accepting my amendments and I welcome the important new safeguards for victims in this Bill.</P>

I strongly believe that <Col N="255"/> issues are well argued and teased out when they come to the Seanad.  Senator Regan may believe I have been down on him in that I have not accepted any of his amendments.  However, the fact that we have such good debates in this House is, I believe, yet another reason &mdash; I hope the Senator takes this in the best spirit &mdash; the Seanad should not be abolished.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An  Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, to the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  It has been a while since we had the opportunity to engage in a formal or informal chat in this House, although we chatted many times when I was a Member of the Lower House.</P>
        <P>Domestic violence is a serious issue.  It is interesting that people associate this issue with females and that one in five women in Ireland will experience domestic violence.  The Women&rsquo;s Aid, 16 Days of Action campaign, which is drawing to a close, has been good.  It is important, therefore, this issue is brought to the fore in this and the other House, as it is every year.  I commend those people in my constituency, including in Inishowen and Letterkenny, who work on behalf of women in County Donegal who experience domestic violence.  I am not suggesting domestic violence relates exclusively to females but it is in the main females who are so affected.  As pointed out in the campaign, one must consider that this might be happening to one&rsquo;s mother, sister or friend.</P>
        <P>It is important people are listened to and are not judged.  They must also be allowed to make decisions and be assisted in making those decisions and encouraged to attend their general practitioners, the Garda, solicitors or anyone from whom they might reasonably expect help.  We have only recently learned of the awfulness of clerical sexual abuse.  Previous to this we have had reports on various types of sexual abuse.  Domestic violence is sexual violence against partners.  We must find a mechanism, be it in the domestic violence or sexual abuse field, which encourages young people and adults to come forward and admit what is happening.  It is too late to do so 20 or 30 years on, whether such abuse is in the home or outside it.</P>
        <P>I was shocked to hear on Saturday that a majority of people do not report that they have been raped.  I was eager to come into this House and speak about this issue.  However, this morning I heard a report to the effect that many people who reported rape had engaged in binge drinking.  There appears to be an attempt to link both factors and to assume that because a person drank alcohol, she had left herself open to being raped.  This has as much an implication for domestic violence as it has for any other rape situation.  It has been proven that most rapes occur between two people who know each other.  No one knows each other better than do partners and husbands and wives.</P>
<Col N="256"/>
        <P>Some of the statistics we have heard during the 16 Days of Action campaign are that 25% of all violent crimes reported involve a man assaulting his wife or partner and that physical violence is right up there in terms of the types of violence involved.  Domestic violence has massive implications for society, including social &mdash; I am glad the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is present in the House this evening &mdash; in terms of obtaining housing to keep people separate from each other to ensure the abuse does not continue.  There is much evidence to suggest the time when people are separated is as dangerous as any other time.</P>
        <P>I am not sure whether the Minister&rsquo;s response will include answers to the types of issues raised by Women&rsquo;s Aid.  An issue of concern to them is that the national budget for 2010 is under threat.  The national freefone helpline and support services are a lifeline for people living with domestic violence.  This organisation experienced cutbacks in funding in 2009 and believes that national and local domestic violence support services could be under threat of cuts of up to 18% in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre dealt with 9,487 counselling calls in 2008, 86% of which were from females.  I could provide statistics that would keep us going for an hour.  However, I have only five minutes in which to deal with this issue.  I want to place on record that I value the work being done in regard to domestic violence.  When I heard that a domestic violence support service was to be established in my constituency I thought it would not work and that people would not use it.  However, it is being widely used, although this is not necessarily a reflection on society in the county.  It is important that we recognise that people are only now confident to admit what is happening in their homes.  For many generations, people did not speak about what went on in their homes because it was an admission of some darker deed.  However, these types of darker deeds in our society are now coming into the open.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform consider the issues being raised under the Civil Partnership Bill 2009 and their implications, according to Women&rsquo;s Aid, for cohabitants and their children.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.  While I know this issue is not centrally related to her Department, it touches on some areas of it.  We should use every opportunity to encourage people to use all available resources to ensure this is not allowed to continue within society as an acceptable form of treatment of any woman.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this important issue.  Domestic violence is a problem throughout the country and it is important to talk about it at all times, but particularly during the international 16 days of action opposing violence against women.</P>
        <P>All of us, and particularly the Government, take the problem of domestic violence very seriously.  It has serious consequences for the victims, the majority of whom are women.  In addition, children always suffer in those situations.  Due to its hidden nature, and I was glad to hear Senator Keaveney mention that people are using services, the majority of victims are reluctant to report it, so it is a crime which can be difficult to tackle.  It is recognised that State and non-governmental organisations are doing good work in addressing the problem and in meeting the needs of victims.  That work is appreciated as it delivers vital services to domestic violence victims.  It involves major organisations and local groups, as Senator Keaveney said.  Some of the family resource centres offer facilities, support and counselling for victims of domestic abuse.</P>
<Col N="257"/>
        <P>However, more work needs to be done, particularly in co-ordinating the work of the many organisations concerned.  The organisations include Departments, State offices and agencies as well as non-governmental organisations at national and local level which deal with victims of domestic violence.  Recognition of the need for co-ordination led to the establishment in June 2007 of Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Cosc is an executive office within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which is dedicated to ensuring a whole-of-Government response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence against women and men, including older people living in the community.</P>
        <P>Cosc&rsquo;s main priority is the preparation of a national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The wide range of State and non-governmental organisations dealing with such violence is assisting with the development of the national strategy.  Those organisations responded to the call for submissions on the strategy and participated in subsequent rounds of consultations.  Work on preparation of the strategy is well advanced and the strategy is expected to be submitted to Government early in 2010.  The strategy will set out a cohesive plan to further develop actions to prevent and respond to the violence concerned in coming years.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to clarify the level of domestic violence.  The hidden nature of the crime and the reluctance to report it make it difficult to obtain prevalence data.  We have, however, empirical data on the prevalence of the problem in the National Study of Domestic Abuse published by the National Crime Council in 2005.  According to the study 15% of women and 6% of men have experienced severely abusive behaviour from their partner at some stage or on some occasion over the course of their lifetime.  The percentage is much higher if minor incidents are taken into account.  The study found that 29% of women and 26% of men suffer domestic abuse at some stage in their lifetime where severe abuse and minor incidents are combined.  In other words almost a third of all women and a quarter of all men experience some form of domestic violence at some stage.  This underlines the seriousness of the problem and the magnitude of the task in tackling the problem.</P>
        <P>Increasing knowledge about the problem is key to making progress on dealing with it.  In 2008, Cosc carried out a survey of attitudes of the Irish public to domestic abuse and it came up with some interesting findings.  One of the main outcomes is that a large majority of the Irish population exhibit high levels of awareness of the problem of domestic abuse.  People perceive domestic abuse to be a common and increasing problem.  They have a broad understanding of what constitutes domestic abuse and they regard it as unacceptable.  I share the concerns Senator Keaveney raised regarding comments about alcohol.  Alcohol is never an excuse for a perpetrator and it is certainly never a justification for a victim.</P>
        <P>These are broadly positive findings and in terms of responding to domestic abuse the study showed that people feel responsible and are willing to intervene if they witness domestic abuse.  However, if the victim is somebody outside the family circle, such as a neighbour they do not know well, people are reluctant to become involved.  An understandable concern or fear of making things even worse is the main reason given for not becoming involved.  The survey provides a baseline for understanding public attitudes to domestic abuse in Ireland.  Cosc is using this survey to inform work being undertaken to improve the system of prevention and response to domestic violence.  This includes the development of accessible information for members of the public, to assist them in understanding and being prepared to take appropriate action to counter these crimes.  A practical example of such information is the details of local and national support services on Cosc&rsquo;s website at <i>www.cosc.ie.</i></P>
<Col N="258"/>
        <P>The Government is committed to tackling the problem of domestic violence.  That commitment is reflected in the priority being given to the preparation of the national strategy.  It is expected that the strategy, once finalised, will drive greater progress in dealing with this serious problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her substantial response.  She put on record the difficulty for children in these situations, although it was not included in her script.  In developing the strategy the Department should focus on getting people to talk, be it the neighbour or the person involved, with the idea that children are at the core of this and experience it.  They are often a minor player in the issue but their attitudes are scarred for life.  They can then possibly become the perpetrators in the next generation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm as bheith mall.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; gn&oacute;thach agus n&iacute; raibh a fhios agam go raibh an Bille le cr&iacute;ochn&uacute; chomh luath.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to raise the issue of sewerage schemes for two towns, Dungloe and Glenties, within the Glenties electoral area in west Donegal.  Glenties is a beautiful town and the home of Patrick MacGill.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government proposes to bundle the two schemes.  A set of documents for the design, build and operate contract was submitted to the Department in April 2009 by Donegal County Council seeking approval to proceed to the next stage.  The documents included provision for the construction of a new waste water treatment plant in both towns, with two pumping stations in Dungloe and one in Glenties, as well as other associated works.  An application is also being made for a second contract, which includes the replacement and rehabilitation of parts of the network in both towns.  That will be made to the Department in early 2010 by the county council.</P>
        <P>At this stage what is being sought by the council to proceed with the next stage, relating to the construction of the treatment plant and associated works, is the approval to seek tenders.  The water and environment section of Donegal County Council informs me that if approval was forthcoming, it could proceed immediately.  Obviously, an associated and additional application will be made early in the new year by the council in respect of the network pipe work that would link up to the treatment works.</P>
        <P>The two towns have experienced development in recent years, particularly Dungloe.  Glenties is in urgent need of the upgrading of the sewerage plant given the proximity of the Owenea River, which is traditionally associated with salmon fishing, and the detrimental effects the current lack of adequate sewerage facilities are having on the river.  In highlighting this matter, I hope Donegal County Council will receive a positive response from the Department shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank an Seanad&oacute;ir Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill as ucht an &aacute;bhar seo a thabhairt &oacute;s comhair an T&iacute; inni&uacute;.  The Dungloe sewerage scheme and Glenties sewerage scheme are being advanced as a joint scheme under the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2007 -2009.  The proposed scheme involves construction of new waste water treatment plants and pumping stations.  It is envisaged that procurement of the waste water treatment plants will be by the design-build-operate model, and the schemes are being bundled to obtain a more competitive tender.  The contract documents are currently under examination in the Department.</P>
<Col N="259"/>
        <P>The length of time it takes to advance a water or sewerage scheme to completion largely depends on the nature and complexity of the scheme and the statutory processes involved.  The Department&rsquo;s involvement at individual stages of schemes in the water services investment programme can vary from two to four occasions depending on the value of the scheme.  It approves the local authority&rsquo;s design brief and preliminary report for all schemes and, in some instances it also approves the contract documents.  In the case of design/build/operate contracts the Department additionally approves the local authority&rsquo;s tender recommendation.  This involvement at key stages is necessary to comply with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s capital appraisal guidelines and the Department&rsquo;s obligations relating to management and oversight of Exchequer expenditure.  Local authorities have responsibility for all other aspects of a scheme, including the appointment of consultants, statutory planning and other processes, site investigations, the acquisition of lands and wayleaves, the tendering process, the appointment of contractors and the carrying out of works.  The time taken to advance a scheme will depend largely on how quickly these processes are completed.</P>
        <P>The priority to be accorded to schemes in Donegal county is a matter, in the first instance, for Donegal County Council.  Last July local authorities were asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to my Department by 23 October.  The Department is considering these assessments which will form a key input to the development of the 2010-12 water services investment programme.  In conducting their assessments local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression in the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.</P>
        <P>The 2010-12 programme will be a three-year rolling plan for the provision of major water supply and wastewater infrastructure.  Strategic environmental and economic objectives have provided the rationale for investment in water services infrastructure since 2000.  With the changed economic climate and the completion of the first cycle of river basin management plans by local authorities in the near future, there is a greater need than ever to focus on these key priorities.  The 2010-12 programme will do this by prioritising projects that target public health and environmental compliance issues, support economic and employment growth, and offer best value for money.</P>
        <P>The Department expects to publish the 2010-12 water services investment programme early next year.  It will work closely with Donegal County Council to advance priority schemes identified in the programme.</P>

    <Title>Dental Services. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  T&aacute;imid uilig ag s&uacute;il le cloiste&aacute;il cad iad na himpleachta&iacute; d&aacute; Roinn &oacute;n gc&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is am&aacute;rach.  The background to the matter I am raising is the proposal made in the McCarthy report that the dental treatment benefit scheme, DTBS,  or the PRSI scheme as it is commonly known, should be abolished.  The scheme is an insurance scheme that operates on the basis of contributions made by workers in the expectation that they will receive benefits in return.  I have benefited from it myself.  It is crucial that the Government rejects the recommendation set out in the McCarthy report and instead upholds the DTBS.</P>
        <P>Approximately 2 million workers and their family members are entitled to dental benefits through their contributions to the PRSI scheme.  The DTBS offers them the highest standards of quality care and valuable discounts to the market rate for any items not covered fully under the scheme.  Last year over 400,000 people visited their dentist for an annual examination <Col N="260"/>under the scheme.  In addition, there were over 1.5 million treatment items such as fillings and extractions availed of by patients.</P>
        <P>Oral health and oral health preventive measures are important to the overall health of a person and contribute to a reduction in the down the line cost to the State.  Annual examinations and regular dental treatment provided under the DTBS can help in identifying early indicators of systemic diseases such as oral cancer, diabetes, heart disease and gum disease and can help to indicate low birth rates and premature births.  Oral cancer causes more deaths nationwide than melanoma, leukaemia or cervical cancer.  On average, three new cases are identified by dentists every week.  Early detection of abnormalities can make a huge difference to a person&rsquo;s life expectancy, as oral cancer can be cured at a rate of 90% when discovered early.  In recent decades the dental health of the population has improved immensely.  The DTBS is the single best scheme available for the nearly 2 million people that it serves and is arguably the single greatest contributor to this improvement in dental health.</P>
        <P>Abolition of the scheme would have a negative effect on public health and cost the Exchequer &euro;112 million a year, as estimated in the research of Dr. Brenda Gannon, a health economist at NUI Galway.  The Irish Dental Association commissioned Dr. Gannon to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the scheme.  Her analysis shows the significant benefits that accrue from the scheme and that its abolition would eventually double the cost to the State.  Her research also shows that the return on investment is extremely beneficial and that the benefits outweigh the cost of the scheme by a multiple of between two and 2.6.  This means the return on investment is roughly 2.5 times the cost to public finances.</P>
        <P>The abolition of the DTBS would result in a deterioration of the dental health of citizens. It would intensify the divide between those who can afford dental care and those who are indebted to the many advantages the scheme has to offer.  It would also contribute to a lengthening of waiting lists in many areas, while in others people would forgo seeking private insurance, leading to a lack of work for dentists.  Furthermore, the ESRI has found that there is a markedly lower attendance rate at dental clinics among lower income groups, a situation which will only be exacerbated by the abolition of the DTBS.  Its abolition would be hugely unfair.  It would be akin to paying house insurance for years and then being told cover was being withdrawn.  If the McCarthy report recommendations proceed, despite the many years of significant contributions by hard working individuals, they will be deprived of the benefits provided under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The main aim of Government intervention, as well as the goal of the dental benefit scheme, is to improve overall dental health of the population and allow access to everyone to oral examinations and basic treatments.  I request, on behalf of the Irish Dental Association &mdash; I acknowledge the excellent material I received from its chief executive, Mr. Fintan Hourihan &mdash; and those who have participated in and benefited from the scheme &mdash; ordinary citizens &mdash; that it remain active and be left intact.</P>
        <P>I was recently in a popular shop, Past Times, a shop into which I like to call frequently to indulge my taste for nostalgia.  I looked at an old compilation journal of sports magazines for young people.  I find it interesting to look at old photographs, including old sports photographs.  People now look different.  Often in old photographs we can see that people in past generations suffered from poor health.  Sometimes the effect of illnesses such as TB is visible in people&rsquo;s faces and often one notices that people had poor teeth.  We have moved on so much in terms of the overall health of the population and it is visible that people now enjoy better dental health.  I would hate to think we would take regressive steps and return to a situation where <Col N="261"/>we would see increasing numbers with inferior dental health.  I hope the Government sees the value in the scheme and recognises the good it does for the population.  I also hope it recognises better dental health is one of the many benefits we enjoy as a result of improved health care and that the scheme should be left intact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  As mentioned, the PRSI scheme goes towards dental benefits but also towards optical benefits.  However, its main use is that people can qualify for unemployment assistance and other benefits, the most valuable of all being a pension.  The DTBS is a PRSI-based scheme that provides assistance in the provision of dental treatment for those who satisfy the qualifying conditions and their dependent spouses.  Eligible customers receive assistance towards the provision of services such as annual examinations and biannual scaling and polishing and a grant towards the cost of fillings.  To be eligible to benefit from the scheme, a person must have paid a certain number of PRSI contributions.</P>
        <P>The scheme is one of a number through which the State supports or directly provides dental care.  The Senator was right when he mentioned the improvements made in recent years in the standard of dental care and oral hygiene.  The scheme sits alongside the provision by the Department of Health and Children of dental care under the medical card scheme for customers on low incomes.</P>
        <P>The qualifying PRSI conditions vary with age.  For the majority of customers, those aged between 25 and 66 years, the requirement is a minimum of 260 qualifying contributions paid, plus 39 paid or credited in the governing contribution year, which for this year would be 2007.  Slightly different rules apply to those under 25 years and over 66 years.  Anyone qualified at aged 60 years retains his or her entitlement for life.  Pay related social insurance is a contribution towards much more than dental treatment.  It also covers other entitlements such as pensions, disability, invalidity and unemployment benefits, etc.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The dental treatment benefit scheme operates on the following basis.  Any insured person or a dentist on his or her behalf must check with the Department if he or she is qualified to receive treatment.  This can be done by telephone, fax, e-mail or completion of a claim form.  Once approval has been given, either verbally or in writing, treatment may be provided by a contracting dentist.  Treatment must begin within three months of approval being given and be completed within nine months.  Once treatment has been completed, the dentist submits a final application form detailing the treatments provided and the customer&rsquo;s confirmation that treatment has been completed.  Payment is then processed and issued directly to the dentist concerned.  More than 675,000 applications, relating to 1,450,000 treatments were received in 2008 and an increased number of applications are expected by year end.  The scheme cost &euro;60 million in 2008 with more than &euro;13.5 million expended on examinations, &euro;16.2 million on cleaning teeth and gum treatments and &euro;17.5 million on fillings.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The dental treatment benefit scheme is paid from the social insurance fund, SIF.  Although the fund has operated a surplus since 1996, this position began to change last year when expenditure had to be partially funded from the accumulated surplus.  Expenditure continued to exceed PRSI and investment income to the fund this year and it is expected that the accumulated surplus will be completely exhausted in the first half of 2010.  It is estimated that the Exchequer will be required to subvent the fund by around &euro;1.2 billion next year.</P>
        <P>The expenditure pressures on the fund will continue in the future.  In the short term there are increased demands on jobseekers benefit, estimated at &euro;1.7 billion in 2010, and on insol<Col N="262"/>vency and redundancy payments, estimated at &euro;318 million next year.  The progressive aging of the population is another factor leading to increasing expenditure on the State pension contributory and transition.  It is estimated that there will be only two workers for every pensioner in 2050 compared to six for every pensioner now.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes specifically refers to the scheme and took the view that given the other pressures on the social insurance fund continuation of the scheme is no longer affordable.</P>
