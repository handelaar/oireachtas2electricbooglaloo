	<P>I have notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to comment on the importance, in his view, of media studies ensuring students exposed to historical events spun on a 24-hour basis by media channels with their own agendas are helped evaluate what they hear in a critical manner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to advise whether the major capital programme or the devolved scheme is the preferred option for the delivery of the accommodation needs of a school, details supplied, in County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline her negotiations with pharmacists and to put in place a contingency plan given the reported intention of thousands of pharmacists to withdraw from contracts with the Health Service Executive, which will affect medical card patients and many others using the drug payments scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to consider the establishment of microcredit banks similar to the system successfully existing in the developing world as a means of providing credit to the poor in the current economic climate and to counteract the exploitation of people by money lenders.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and have selected the matters raised by Senators Cecilia Keaveney, Fidelma Healy Eames and Jerry Buttimer to be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Nicky McFadden may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is not just the economy that the Government cannot manage, but the business of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  How else can one explain what is happening today in the Seanad, with all Stages of two Bills being taken?  It would appear from the way the Leader has announced the Order of Business that there is no break between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Bill.  It is extraordinary that we are expected to take all Stages without a break.  The precedent is to have a break of a number of days when legislation is initiated in the Seanad, as is the case with that Bill and the other Bill all Stages of which are being taken this evening.  That breaks with precedent and it is not good practice.  It smacks of mismanagement of legislation by the Government.  Why this unseemly rush at the end of term?  Why take a break if this legislation, which requires proper scrutiny by both Houses, must be passed?  Why must it be dealt with in a short timeframe?  I ask the Leader to respond to that question.  Will the Leader clarify whether there will be a break between Second Stage and Committee Stage to allow Members to submit amendments and have them published?</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two national issues on which I would like the Leader to respond, the first of which is the electricians&rsquo; strike, the impact of which on jobs and the economy generally is an appalling vista in terms of the potential damage that could be done.  I ask that the Government appoint a mediator to ensure this strike, which has many consequences, does not continue.  The second issue is that of gun crime and the recent innocent victim of gun crime, Wayne Doherty, whose last poignant words were &ldquo;Tell Karen and the children I love them.&rdquo;  We must ensure better targeting of these criminals to ensure this type of behaviour on our streets does not continue week in week out.  This is the 16th gangland murder this year and it is completely outrageous.  People, in particular those in the local community, are numbed this has happened.  Gangland crime has serious implications for the country and we must provide more resources for garda&iacute; at local level and enact strong legislation in this area.  I am sure the Leader will bring that message from this House to Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Health and Children the changes in the provision of respite services at Cherry Orchard Hospital?  Many people are concerned about the changes in this service.  Residents in the Lucan, Palmerstown and Clondalkin areas depend on it and the changes are causing great hardship to families whose elderly relatives attend the centre.  I ask that front line services like this are protected.  I would be grateful if the Leader would raise this issue with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

On my behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I extend a welcome to them and sincere good wishes for a very successful visit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be opposing the Order of Business in regard to the management of the work of the House today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal as I share her concern about the manner in which the business of the Seanad is being ordered.  We saw the Seanad at its best last week during the debate on the Local Government (Charges) Bill 2009 on which Senators, particularly on the Fine Gael side, raised relevant points and proposed amendments.  We are today seeing the Seanad at its worst, with a whole range of business put before us at very short notice, all Stages of which are to be taken together.  This undermines the argument we continually make about the relevance of the Seanad, that it is the Chamber wherein legislation is properly scrutinised and where questions that might not be asked in the other House are asked.  The Seanad&rsquo;s ability to do its important work is limited when legislation is rushed through the House at the end of term in the manner proposed today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no rushing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This takes away the best argument for the relevance of the Seanad to our national life.  I would have no difficulty in the Seanad meeting for a couple of extra weeks to allow us to consider properly legislation that is put before us, in particular legislation in respect of criminal justice which impacts on people&rsquo;s civil rights, while attempting to respond to the very justified concerns of citizens about violence, gun crime and so on in our society.  We do no service to the people when, in response to the anxiety we all feel about gun crime, we introduce hardline legislation to give the illusion we are being tough on crime when what is proposed does not significantly address the problem, as is the case with some of the measures on handguns, and I will be tabling amendments to them.  We must do better than that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Leader is a consummate diplomat.  There are two definitions of the word &ldquo;diplomat&rdquo;.  The American version defines a diplomat as someone who says &ldquo;nice doggy&rdquo; until he can find a rock, and the other version defines a diplomat as someone who tells a person to go to hell in such a way that he or she looks forward to the trip.  I am always taken by the Leader&rsquo;s response when he is asked for a debate on a particular topic.  He says he has no problem arranging it.  Last week I asked for a debate on the need to insert a section on end-of-life care into the corporate service plan of the HSE.  The Irish Hospice Foundation is doing great work around quality standards for hospice-friendly hospitals for end-of-life care, which has been developed with the support of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  There is also a good national audit of end-of-life care in hospitals in the light of the hospice-friendly hospital standards.  Unless we get a section on end-of-life care into the corporate service plan of the HSE, however, it will be impossible to realise the goals that are necessary if we are to have hospital care appropriate to those in end-of-life situations.  We must hear from the Minister for Health and Children that she wants a section on end-of-life care in the corporate service plan of the HSE.  I ask the Leader, who is a very accommodating gentleman, to give the House a commitment that we will hear from the Minister on this important subject and to give a date for such a debate in the House.</P>
        <P>There was some confusion last month when Senators Bacik, O&rsquo;Toole and I were talking about various surveys of the wishes of parents on the ownership and management of schools.  We were quoting from different surveys but I assure the House that the latest survey published by Red C commissioned by the Iona Institute affirms yet again that three quarters of the public <Col N="752"/>support the right of parents to send their children to a variety of publicly funded schools, including church-run schools, so there has been no change in public opinion on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, will be opposing the Order of Business for the reasons outlined by Senator Fitzgerald.  I made exactly the same points last week.  Unfortunately on the basis of my experience, I do not believe the Leader has the slightest intention of responding in a positive manner to the points made by the Opposition on the ordering of business.  He did not respond to my point last week, which has been repeated today, when I asked why the business in this House cannot be ordered in a manner throughout the year where legislation is paced to ensure important areas such as criminal law are debated publicly before being dealt with properly in both Houses.  I do not understand why that cannot be done.  Notwithstanding that I am one of those Members the Leader repeatedly refers to as relatively new, I cannot see why he does not address that important issue and give Members an explanation.  Perhaps it is because there is no explanation other than that the Government, with the support of the Leader, has little or no respect for the role of this House on important legislation.  That is the conclusion to which I have come.</P>
        <P>My party leader made it clear today that there ought to be Government intervention in the electricians&rsquo; dispute.  When the parties get back around the table, as they undoubtedly will, and we hope it will be sooner rather than later, they will come to an agreement but people are entitled to expect that when an agreement is arrived at, it will be observed.  That is the difficulty at the moment.  There is a dispute because a tried and tested means of determining pay in the sector has been jettisoned by the employers.  People went before the Labour Court and had the matter dealt with over a period of weeks but are now being told that the conclusion of those solemn negotiations is to be thrown out of the window.  Why should people not be sceptical about negotiations and agreements when that happens?</P>
        <P>There have been many calls on the trade unions to exercise restraint and there will be more before the hour is out.  They should exercise restraint, but the employer bodies also need to exercise restraint, including in the language they use.  It is simply not good enough for the head of the CIF to describe people who are exercising their rights as lunatics.  He might consider for one moment, in view of the current economic circumstances, the contribution some of his own members have made to the catastrophe we now face.  He might look a little closer to home to find the lunatics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Mullen on the subject of end-of-life care.  People who have given a contribution to the country all their lives find there is no plan for them at this time.  We must ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss the incorporation of such plans into the HSE service plan for those who are at the end of their lives.</P>
        <P>Today we saw a discussion in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the imposition of a blanket ban on recruitment at third level institutions by the HEA, which is of concern.  However, it would be worthwhile to have a discussion about how we will rationalise courses that may have to be dropped at third level.  Perhaps before the academic year starts in the autumn we could have a discussion on the recruitment ban for part-time and contract staff as well as on funding.  We may have to rationalise courses but we should discuss how this is to be done and whether it is possible, for example, to have fewer courses and perhaps modules incorporated into long-term courses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the pharmacy Bill, I ask the Leader to reply to a specific question on the problem which has been brewing over the last number of weeks.  Small pharmacists are not entitled to major discounts when they buy drugs from wholesalers.  Larger <Col N="753"/>chains get bigger discounts; in other words, when they buy one packet of the drugs they dispense they may get one or more packets free from the wholesaler.  It has been a long-standing issue within the pharmaceutical trade that small shopkeepers cannot compete with large chains because they do not get the same discounts.  In all the debate about the Minister, Deputy Harney, cutting wholesale margins to pharmacists, she has never once alluded to that practice.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister on my behalf to investigate whether the practice can be altered, made more public or made illegal so that all pharmacists can compete on an equal footing and we know exactly what the margins are within the trade.  Otherwise a number of pharmacies will go broke regardless of whether the Minister continues her present course of action or changes it radically.</P>
        <P>I add my support to the comments of other Members about the Order of Business.  We are only paying lip-service to the deaths of innocent people when we treat important legislation on crime in such a dismissive way by rushing it through quickly.  Fear, intimidation and violent crime is spreading across our country like a plague and we should try at least to give dignity to the victims of these crimes by having a decent debate in the House on this legislation and not dismissing it in such a cavalier fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The House should be pleased the Israeli authorities have released Mair&eacute;ad Maguire and Derek Graham, who will be flying back to Dublin this evening.  They have been deported from Israel for carrying out humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip, which is unfair.  I commend them and their colleagues on their efforts on behalf of the people of Palestine and hope they will continue their campaign to achieve justice in that region.</P>
        <P>Will there be an opportunity during Friday&rsquo;s debate on the OECD and IMF reports to go through all the parties&rsquo; manifestos for the last general election?  I am particularly interested in examining the Labour Party document, but finding a copy of it is like trying to discover the third secret of Fatima.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader indicate how much time will be allowed for us to go through the Labour Party manifesto, The Fair Society?  It is a well produced and colourful document which makes the interesting observation that the broad macro-economic outlook for the Irish economy is positive.  It also observes that the economy has &ldquo;continued to perform well in recent years&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not having that debate today.  The Senator can raise the matter on Friday.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in calling for a debate on the impact on the economy of the disastrous strike by electricians.  It seems there is an outbreak of catastrophic idiocy on both sides and a complete lack of understanding of the serious situation the nation faces.  It is almost as if warfare broke out on the <i>Titanic</i> between the sailors and the orchestra over possession of the lifeboats while passengers were left to drown.  It is time for the Government to intervene in this deplorable situation in whatever positive way it can.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald and others who complained about the ordering of business in this House.  We never seem to know on which days we will meet, for what hours and what we will discuss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With the greatest respect to the Leader&rsquo;s diplomatic skills, on which Senator Mullen discoursed so liberally, this uncertainty leaves us somewhat bemused.  The attitude towards the allocation of time for some of the extremely serious legislation which we will debate this week and next amounts to mere window dressing.  As I said last week, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 is probably unconstitutional and certainly infringes the human and civil rights of the general population.  I applaud the Irish Council for Civil Liberties which has done us a great favour in the analysis it has provided, despite being the subject of general attack on the airwaves.</P>
        <P>The way in which this important legislation is being dealt with is entirely unacceptable.  It will be guillotined in the D&aacute;il, which means amendments will not be reached and Government amendments will automatically be passed.  We are wasting our breath debating it in this House next week because the D&aacute;il will have risen by that stage.  There is absolutely no possibility of any amendments we may table being accepted.  Therefore, there is no point in being here for that debate.  As such, I suggest that Opposition Members absent themselves and let the Govern<Col N="755"/>ment get on with it, which may render the Bill unconstitutional.  I hope these benches will be empty next week to highlight this scandal.</P>

	<P>I condemn the strike by electricians, specifically the approach taken by the Technical, Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU.  This strike may potentially do more damage to the economy than that caused by the banking crisis.  It will put thousands of people out of work in the construction business because no members of allied trades can enter major sites.  If this matter is not resolved without delay, we will have a major problem on our hands within a week.  I appeal to the Leader to request the Minister to make contact with both the TEEU and the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.  I was appalled to hear Jack O&rsquo;Connor state he would support an all out strike.  That is an outrageous statement.  What would damage the country more than an all out strike in which every company in the country is closed down?  All businesses are tied to the electrical industry, which is extensive.  This issue is so serious that it warrants immediate intervention to get both sides around a table and ensure the labour relations machinery is used to secure a sensible settlement.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s comments on the issue.  Inability to pay forms part of the national wage agreement and the contractors have already stated they are unable to pay the increase.  That is the reason the problem has arisen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

	<P>I join other Senators in expressing my delight that we can expect the return of Nobel Peace Prize winner Mair&eacute;ad Maguire this evening.  She is not the only winner of the Nobel Peace Prize to have been held in captivity.  Aung San Suu Kyi entered her 5,000th day in captivity last Sunday.  United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, who will <Col N="756"/>be in the House later, expressed his dissatisfaction about the case and called for Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s release during a visit to Burma at the weekend.  The Oireachtas must ensure the Minister for Foreign Affairs exerts pressure at the highest levels of the Burmese Government to release Aung San Suu Kyi as soon as possible. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak about the electricians&rsquo; strike, although I take a much different perspective from previous speakers.  A report in the media has suggested the electricians were offered a deal on the basis of an immediate 10% cut in pay followed by the commencement of negotiations.  If this report is true, it amounts to an ultimatum rather than negotiation.  Given the responsible approach taken by the trade unions to date in this difficult crisis, it would surprise me if they were to change fundamentally their attitude, which includes calling for an all out strike.  If the report is correct and an ultimatum was given, a fundamental trade union principle is at stake and the union in question will have been placed in an impossible position.  In that case, I would understand the reason the trade unions feel as they do.  The ultimatum must be withdrawn and simultaneously the electricians should return to work.  We are in a crisis and everyone must put their shoulder to the wheel in these difficult times.</P>
        <P>On the Shell to Sea campaign, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the necessity for the development of the Corrib gas field.  A great deal of misinformation has been disseminated, including exaggerated claims by the Shell to Sea campaign that the gas field is worth in the order of &euro;500 billion.  Recently, 18% of the total shareholding in the Corrib gas field was sold for &euro;100 million.  That places a value on the field.  Let us not have exaggerated claims or fear-mongering.  While I did not concur with Senator Norris on this issue, his description last week of a machine appearing off the west coast was wonderful.  The imagery he used made it seem as if Dr. Evil&rsquo;s machine in the James Bond movies was gobbling up the satellites.</P>

	<P>Other speakers referred to the 25% cuts that have been arbitrarily imposed on small pharmacies.  The Leader should ask the Minister for Health and Children to talk to the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  An independent body recommended that these matters should be dealt with on a phased basis.  There was a recommendation that they should get away from branded medicines and deal with generic medicines.  There is much that can be done.  No one wants to see job losses resulting from the closure of small pharmacies.  All this is needlessly under threat with many other things that are going wrong in the economy, which Senator Butler and others mentioned.  I am sure the Leader will agree that the Minister for Health and Children must engage in talks and I ask him to have a serious word with her about this situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In normal circumstances, as a life-long trade unionist, I would vigorously defend the trade union movement and support its right to strike.  In the case of the current electricians&rsquo; strike, I accept they have the right to do that, but there is no other way of describing the present strike except as economic lunacy because the number of people who are being directly affected by this will run into thousands.  Many of them will have no connection whatever with the electricians&rsquo; union.  These people will be put on protective notice, jobs will be in danger and business will be lost.  In addition, there is a possibility that we will have an all-out strike.  It seems as if the reality of the economic crisis has still not hit home in this case.  I am not taking the blame off employers.  If there is a possibility of arriving at some solution by bringing both sides together, so be it, but that is not the issue.  It is that a group again resorted to strike thus endangering the economic advancements which were being made to try to correct the present crisis.  Describing this in some kind of a softly, softly way only prolongs the absence of the full knowledge of where we are at the moment.  I see that the media are responding along the lines I am stating.  I do not believe there will be any public sympathy for what is happening at the moment.  I support the idea of mediation in this case, but the trade union movement was wrong to strike and endanger so many jobs at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask the Leader about the Order of Business?  I am shocked that he proposes to have all Stages of the two Bills to be taken today.  The one I am dealing with is the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Bill.  What are the standards in this House?  We have supported the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in much of the legislation he is putting through the Houses, but we have sought adequate time to scrutinise it, make suggestions and table constructive amendments.  The Minister and the Leader are treating this House with disdain and contempt.  The Leader has defended the function and role of the Seanad, but he is now making the best case for abolishing the House.  If we cannot fulfil our role of scrutinising legislation, we should not be here.  I support the leader of my group in opposing the Order of Business.  I ask the Leader to reflect on this and to reconsider hearing all Stages of what is a very important Bill, as it can lead to the imprisonment of people for non-payment of debt.</P>
        <P>There have been calls for the Government to intervene in the electricians&rsquo; strike.  I think this is between the employers and the employees or between the employers&rsquo; organisations and the unions.  It is for them to sort this out and not for the Government to intervene.  In my experience, where the Government has intervened in industrial relations, it has been at a price to the taxpayer, the public finances or the competitiveness of the economy.  The employers and unions <Col N="758"/>should sort this out and the normal industrial relations machinery of the State should come into play.  The Government should stay away from this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I spent the day in Dingle yesterday, and I ask the Leader for a debate on the fishing industry.  There is too much regulation at national and EU level of inshore and deep sea fishing boats.  The latest regulation is to put more safety equipment on board the boats, but the cost of this is prohibitive and so the fishermen will be put out of business.  We will have the safest fishermen in the world as they will all be onshore because they will not be able to afford to implement the regulations we have devised.  EU regulations on Cromane mussels and fish processing make such work uneconomical.</P>
        <P>We instructed the HSE to engage with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union last January, but this did not happen in a meaningful manner.  The Thatcherite tactics of the HSE must be discussed in more detail.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, when he will bring the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 to the House?  I refer particularly to the provision whereby a person suffering from economic hardship who cannot get a loan or a mortgage can apply to the council for an extension to his or her planning permission without having to go through the entire planning process again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are three barbers on Grafton Street with signs advertising free haircuts today.  I am not sure whether anyone will avail of it but it reminds me of the value they place on their jobs.  I told the story a couple of weeks ago about a young woman in Limerick who told an employer she would happily work for nothing if only she could get a job.  A couple of months later, he was able to say that she was so valuable to him that he could give her a job.  I mention this because it is with sorrow that I see what is happening with the current strike.  There must be no understanding of the damage that is going to be done to the country.  Foreign direct investment is a very competitive marketplace, and we have competitors in that area.  When a company is planning to invest in Ireland and it is torn between locating here and somewhere else, the people in that other place will tell the company that it would be mad to go to Ireland given the way we are behaving during the current crisis which is closing the <Col N="759"/>operation of so many businesses.  I urge those who have created this strike to get back to work and open negotiations once they are back.  It is not possible to think otherwise.  We should be ashamed of ourselves and we should be deeply in sorrow at the action that has been taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the sentiments expressed by the last speaker about the strike action being taken by electrical contractors.  While there is a time and place for everything, the action is sending out the wrong signal at this challenging time.  My understanding is that the public is totally opposed to the strike.  People are surprised electricians have chosen to take this action.  The unions need to show leadership and courage at a time when their mettle is being tested.  This is an acid test for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in particular.  It needs to ensure that action taken is appropriate.  We all know what is necessary.  It has been made clear by a number of Senators on both sides of the House.  If the union does not recognise what is required in this case, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should direct it in a way that helps to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned that over 1,100 pharmacists have tendered their resignations to the HSE on foot of the dispute about proposed reductions in fees.  Can the Leader clarify whether the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association&rsquo;s industry agreement with the Government continues to represent the foundation of this country&rsquo;s medication costs regime?  Is a non-generic policy being pursued?  Can the Leader tell us how much the high-tech scheme is costing?  Can he indicate whether the Minister&rsquo;s door is open to the Irish Pharmaceutical Union if it wishes to make reasonable proposals for cost savings on the pharmacy issue in order to prevent disruption of dispensing?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in objecting in the strongest possible manner to the way business is being ordered in the House.  It is totally unacceptable to propose to rush such important legislation today and throughout the week.  Even though we have gone through weeks in this House without any legislation being brought before us, a raft of legislation is being introduced this week.  It is no way to run the House.  The Leader must take responsibility for the haphazard and sloppy ordering of the business of this House throughout this term in particular.  I ask him to reconsider what he has proposed today.  He might point out that this is the last or second last week on which this House will meet before the summer recess, but that is no excuse where legislation of this importance is concerned.  Perhaps my appeal to the Leader to rethink his position in this regard will fall on deaf ears.</P>
        <P>The electricians&rsquo; dispute will be fixed.  I hope that will happen sooner rather than later.  I call on both sides to come together and use the machinery that is in place to solve this problem, which will have a devastating effect on the country if it is not solved quickly.  If the T&aacute;naiste needs to intervene to help both sides to come together, she should do so.  This dispute needs to end now, rather than at a later stage.</P>

I accept that the Minister of State is doing his best to make progress.  Last week, before he went to Vietnam, I asked the Leader to invite him to come to this House to update Members on the matter.  I invite all Senators to join me in asking the Leader to set aside 15 minutes to allow the Minister of State to update the House on the progress being made with the bilateral agreement.  Hundreds of families are waiting.  Last week, I spoke to people who told me they are working on Vietnam time as they wait to hear whether <Col N="760"/>progress has been made with the agreement.

        <P Just="Left">I want to comment on a report <i>in The Irish Times</i> today about 12 house repossessions in one day, the highest number to be dealt with by the High Court in a single sitting.  It is a disaster if people begin to lose their homes.  I and colleagues in this House have spoken about the need for the Minister for Finance to intervene with the banks to provide solutions and find new ways for people to hold on to their homes.  If we do not address this phenomenon, we are looking down the barrel of a gun because a person&rsquo;s home is everything to him or her.  Other countries are doing it, for example, the UK has introduced mortgage support schemes.  It is time we did this as well.  We have given a great deal to the banks.  Now let the Minister put the boot in and get the banks to work for the people who have been paying them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in criticising the management of the Order of Business this week and next week.  It is not just that we are looking for more time to whinge about particular measures of criminal justice legislation.  These are very important items of legislation for victims of crime, for those who may be charged with crimes and for all of us in society.  When a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell, was putting what became the Criminal Justice Act 2007 through the Oireachtas, a letter from the Irish Criminal Bar Association alerted him during the course of the debate to a fundamental flaw in the Bill, which was amended as a result.</P>
        <P>It is very important for the sake of ensuring robust criminal justice legislation in particular that we are given adequate time to deal with the Bill.  I ask the Leader to give the House some indication as to what time we have to debate this most important Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill, which it seems may be before the Seanad at the beginning of next week.  We have already had the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill rushed through.  We shall have the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill tomorrow and that is not to speak of the other important Bills we have to deal with today, tomorrow and Thursday.</P>
        <P>I join others in welcoming the return of Ms Mair&eacute;ad Corrigan-Maguire and Mr. Derek Graham from Israel.  This House needs to condemn wholeheartedly the action of Israel in kidnapping them, when all they were trying to do was to bring aid to the beleaguered people of Gaza, who have been suffering so badly since the Israeli bombardment and who still cannot rebuild their homes and lives because of the ongoing blockade.  We need to ensure this issue remains under debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am grateful to Senator Mullen for clarifying the matters he said Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I had been confused about concerning family choice as regards children&rsquo;s education.  I do not believe we were confused, but very clear about the figures as regards what families want for their children.  What parents want is choice, which they are not getting at present, with more than 90% of schools at national level controlled by the Roman Catholic Church.  However, I am very envious of Senator Mullen&rsquo;s ability to produce a new survey for every particular mood or view he wishes to express.  I wish I had that same capacity.</P>

        <P>This is a tragedy for that family and community and as my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, said, there have been 16 deaths such as this in recent times.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that families are losing their loved ones.  This gentleman was in the wrong place at the wrong time, somewhat like Mr. Shane Geoghegan, and the crime bosses are getting away with it.  While I support the Government in this legislation to wipe out these crime bosses, the Seanad must be relevant and allowed to debate this very important legislation.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to ensure that our amendments are debated, because we want to discuss this and put these thugs behind bars.  The Seanad should have a say in this.  It has become clear, however, that we are to debate this next week when we will be talking to ourselves, as there will be nobody here to hear what we have to say.  This will mean our amendments will fall on deaf ears.</P>

	<P>Colleagues have expressed views on the TEEU strike.  I agree with the call for everyone to get around the negotiating table.  Our country is in a serious dilemma.  The challenges facing the world economy and challenges facing the country need everyone&rsquo;s full support.  I know a number of TEEU members who are hard-working decent people.  They have a genuine grievance as Senator Hanafin has said.  The state of the economy has completely changed in the past two years.  It has transformed.  Not in one&rsquo;s wildest dreams could we have imagined the challenges as Senator Quinn outlined to the House and the horror stories we are all hearing.  All colleagues have come across people who have no chance of having work to do in two weeks, let alone two months.  With all of those matters to be considered, I call on everyone to get around the negotiating table in the national interest and see what can be done because agreement must be negotiated regardless of what happens.</P>
        <P>Regarding the tragedy of the horrific murder of Wayne Doherty, I join colleagues in sending the sympathy of this House to his widow, Karen, and all their family.  It is shocking and horrible.  As I have often said the fear needs to be put back into the law.  It does not matter if it is 5 a.m. that we take legislation in the House dealing with the portfolio of justice; we certainly intend to stay in this House.  Holidays do not come into it, which is why the House will sit for two days next week.  If we want to sit the following week we will do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald asked me to pass on her urgent concerns regarding respite care in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  I will certainly pass on her views to the Minister.  We will take the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the House today.  Senators Mullen and Ormonde spoke about end-of-life care and in particular the good work the hospice movement does.  It was suggested that end-of-life care should be included in the HSE&rsquo;s corporate plan.  I fully support the sentiments expressed by the Senators.  They may wish to bring it to the attention of the Minister, who will be in the House later this afternoon.</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on the imposition of a blanket ban on recruitment at third level institutions by the HEA.  I will certainly pass her views on to the Minister for Education and Science.  We will of course allow this debate to take place as early as possible.  With so much legislation to be processed, naturally it must take precedence.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, Coghlan and Daly called on the Minister for Health and Children to become involved in the pharmacy issue, given the dilemma in which small pharmacists find themselves with 1,100 having tendered their resignations to the HSE.  Senator Twomey referred to the discounts available to the multiples but not available to small family pharmacists.  This is a serious crisis and a serious challenge to the service that is available and has been given for generations by small family pharmacists on a seven-days-a-week basis.  I fully support the Senator&rsquo;s sentiments and I intend that we would discuss the matter with the Minister present before the recess and get an update.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called on me to announce to the House the speaking time for Friday&rsquo;s debate to allow all manifestos to be discussed.  Today, his manifesto on the agenda was the Labour Party manifesto.  Last week it was the Fine Gael one and I have no doubt he will move along the line of parties in the House.  Today the leaders of the groups agreed to have 15 minutes for spokespersons and ten minutes for other Senators.  I will extend it if colleagues feel it is not enough.  I want to allow all Senators to be able to make their contribution on the IMF and OECD reports in the all-day debate on Friday.</P>
        <P>I join Senators Leyden, Norris and other colleagues in welcoming Mair&eacute;ad Maguire and Derek Graham back from Gaza and congratulate them on the great work they did there.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on the Shell to Sea campaign.  He outlined to the House the &euro;100 million paid for an 18% shareholding, indicating what a wonderful gas find there has been off the County Mayo coast.  I have no difficulty in having a debate on the matter after the recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly called for a debate on the challenges and difficulties of the fishing industry, as have Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and McCarthy on many occasions.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly asked when the planning and development Bill will be before the Houses.  It is a Seanad Bill that will be initiated in this House.  I understand that hopefully it will be before this House in October.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn pointed out the serious challenge facing all those in employment and all those who have just lost their jobs.  I agree with the sentiments he expressed.  All the matters he mentioned can be discussed in the House this Friday.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames called for an update on the position following the visit to Vietnam of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews.  Some 350 families are depending on a successful outcome to the negotiations, which the Minister of State is endeavouring to achieve.  I am sure all Members read yesterday&rsquo;s newspaper article on this matter.  I will obtain the up to date position on this matter and will do my utmost to arrange for the Minister of State to come to the House to update us on it before the recess if possible.  I will try to get an up to date response on the matter for Senators and advise them of it on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>

Friday is an important day on which we can make our position on the IMF and OECD reports known in the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for his comment.  When I left the House on Friday afternoon I did not realise I would be back here so soon.  The House will be aware that the Bill flows from the issues raised in the recent High Court judgment in the McCann case in which the applicant successfully challenged the constitutionality of section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.</P>
        <P>The High Court delivered its judgment on 18 June last and the Minister, following close consultation with the Attorney General, decided not to appeal that decision but to move quickly to apply the principles contained in it to the old legislation in order to provide a definite and reliable method of dealing with debt enforcement.  These short but important amendments will be of benefit not just to creditors but also to the individuals who are falling into debt.  In these often distressing circumstances, delay and prevarication are not helpful approaches.  The earlier a person faces up to his or her difficulties and engages positively with creditors, the easier a manageable solution can be achieved for both parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The High Court found that the existing legislation lacked a number of necessary safeguards in circumstances where a person is at risk of imprisonment.  The judgment stated that while this process had traditionally been regarded as a civil matter, its effect was akin to a criminal one and the debtor was entitled to similar protections.  There was particular concern that the 1940 Act did not appear to require a person to be heard by a court before being imprisoned.  Following a default on an instalment order made by the District Court, a creditor could apply to the court for a committal order and even in the case of the non-appearance of a debtor, committal orders could be, and were, granted by the District Court.</P>
        <P>The absence of an obligation to attend the court gave rise to difficulty, given that in the legislation the obligation was on the debtor to show that his or her failure to pay was not simply because he or she chose not to.  The court had to satisfy itself that the debtor, if he or she appeared, had proved that their failure to pay was not the result of wilful default.</P>
        <P>The High Court also took issue with the fact that no option was open to a court to grant legal aid to a debtor at risk of imprisonment, although it should be remembered that it was open to a debtor to apply to the Legal Aid Board for civil legal aid.  The provision I am now proposing will replace the existing section 6 and amend sections 8 and 9 of the 1940 Act.  The effect will be to insert a number of safeguards to the provisions under which a court may hear an application or grant an imprisonment order against a debtor who has failed to comply with an instalment order.  It will also provide that a debtor against whom an imprisonment order may be made will be entitled to apply for legal aid.</P>
        <P>The Bill still allows for the possibility of imprisonment, and there are those who will think this is harsh.  The Minister gave detailed consideration to that issue.  However, we have to live in the real world and consider the effect of abolishing imprisonment on the process of debt enforcement between two contracting parties.  Without detaining the House with statistics, the data made available by the Courts Service and the Prison Service demonstrate eloquently the effect of the ultimate sanction of imprisonment in dealing with debt.</P><Col N="770"/>
        <P>In the first six months of this year the Courts Service estimated that there were approximately 4,300 applications to the District Court for enforcement orders.  In the same period 186 people, less than 5% of the total, were imprisoned.  The average imprisonment period is 20 days.  The majority of people who may ignore every other step of the process find the means to pay their debts when faced with the threat of imprisonment.  It should be remembered that this process is always preceded by an instalment order granted by the court.  It can be seen that, under the 1940 Act, only a very small percentage of debtors were subject to the sanction of imprisonment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The aim of this Bill is ensure that people who cannot afford to pay will not be subject to imprisonment and that those who can, but simply choose not to, may face imprisonment.  The Government view is that this sanction is a necessary aid to creditors who find it increasingly difficult to collect on moneys owed to them, in particular in this challenging economic climate.  The legislation is mainly utilised by small creditors, including shops, businesses and credit unions which are struggling to maintain their trade and employees.  I would be loath to add to their troubles by abolishing the persuasive sanction that enables them to recover their debts.  I will now outline the provisions of the Bill to the House.</P>
        <P>Section 1 is a standard provision regarding definitions.  Section 2 is the principal provision which inserts into the 1940 Act a new section 6 setting out the process by which the District Court will deal with the summons and hearing and specifying various safeguards and criteria which will in future apply to the granting of a committal order.  There is a minor typographical error in this section and Senators should by now have seen the amendment which will deal with it.  Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances where a creditor may apply to a District Court clerk for a committal order.  As I have pointed out, this will follow on from an earlier court process in which an order for payment by instalment will have been granted.  Where the debtor fails to pay these instalments or one of the instalments, the creditor can make an application under section 6.</P>
        <P>Subsection (2) sets out the details that will be contained in the summons.  These measures concentrate on making the debtor aware of the consequences if he or she fails to attend.  It should be noted that the Bill provides for personal service of the summons, which will be a matter for the creditor.  Subsection (3) provides that where a debtor fails, without reasonable excuse, to appear in answer to the summons, the judge can either issue an arrest warrant to enable the Garda to bring the debtor before the court at the earliest opportunity or may adjourn the hearing.  Senators will note I have tabled a minor amendment to tighten this provision by substituting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  This will remove any doubt that there are two options open to the court and will effectively channel a court towards the provisions and protections in subsections (6), (7) and (8).</P>
        <P>Subsection (4) provides that where a debtor is arrested he or she should be brought before a court as soon as possible. Subsection (5) provides that where a person is arrested and brought before a court under the bench warrant issued under subsection (3), a date shall then be fixed for a hearing and specifies that the judge shall make clear in plain English to the debtor his or her entitlement to apply for legal aid, the consequences, including imprisonment, of failing to comply with the instalment order or failing to appear for the hearing on the date fixed.  Subsection (6) deals with the judge&rsquo;s explanation in circumstances where the debtor attends on foot of a summons, namely, the entitlement to apply for legal aid and the consequences, including imprisonment, of failing to comply with the instalment order.</P>
        <P>Subsection (7) sets out the options open to the court if it is satisfied that the debtor has not complied with an instalment order.  This may be treated as an application for a variation of the existing instalment order.  While this option currently exists, I understand it is seldom availed <Col N="771"/>of.  Clearly, this is a good option for the creditor and the debtor as some payment is better than no payment.  By setting it out clearly here, the take-up of this option may be increased.  Subsection (7)(<i>b</i>) provides that the court may request the parties to engage in mediation.  What we have in mind here is increased use of the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which provides such a valuable service to those in difficulties.  Government funding of MABS in 2009 is in the order of &euro;18 million.  The service provides an extremely effective service to people in trouble, with more than 90% of callers to the helpline finding that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline adviser.  Other options open to the court include the making of a committal order, which may be postponed until such time as the judge thinks is appropriate, thus giving the debtor a further opportunity to make payment, or may come into effect straight away.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsection (8) sets out in detail the standard and onus of proof and the criteria that must be applied by the judge before making an order for imprisonment.  Senators will note that we have included the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.   This is to take account of the High Court&rsquo;s view that the potential effect on the debtor is the same, namely, he or she may be imprisoned and therefore a high standard of proof is required.  The onus will be on the creditor to establish the case.  This may include showing the court that the debtor is wilfully refusing to pay and has no goods that may be attached in lieu of the debt.  This is included specifically to establish that imprisonment really is the last resort.  Subsections (9), (10) and (11) are self-explanatory.  Subsection (12) is designed to protect the proceedings from a debtor who fails to attend the court hearing.  I am grateful to the Labour Party for its suggested amendment on this point.  I believe we are trying to achieve the same result and I am prepared to accept its suggested wording.  We can deal with this when we reach Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Section 2 inserts a new section 6A which grants power to the court to consider an application for legal aid.  This will operate on a similar basis to the current criminal legal aid scheme.  It provides for an entitlement to apply to the court for a debtor&rsquo;s legal aid certificate and sets out the circumstances in which it can be granted.  Consideration was given to simply referring to the Legal Aid Board as it is currently possible for persons to apply to it for assistance in such matters. However, again bearing in mind that the end result can be imprisonment, it was felt more appropriate to leave the granting of legal aid as a matter for the court to decide.  It is not our intention to provide for large fees.  Obviously there are financial implications for extending legal aid in this way.  Regulations are being drafted and my officials are engaging with the Law Society to ensure that the scheme is structured to restrict the cost to the State as much as possible while allowing for a fair rate to be payable to solicitors for their work.  This represents a new avenue of business for the profession which I appreciate has been experiencing its own difficulties.  I believe this will be suitable work for recently qualified solicitors.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal is that a rate will be struck on a per case basis.  The Department will monitor the impact of the provision and it is proposed that the arrangement will be reviewed once it has been in operation for two years.</P>
        <P>Section 2(2) applies the provisions of the amended section 6 to section 8 of the 1940 Act which deals with applications for enforcement proceedings for default of payments due periodically &mdash; for example, maintenance orders.  I am also bringing forward an amendment to section 9 of the 1940 Act to render more workable the power of the Minister to release debtors where necessary.  I do not see this provision being used frequently as it has been rarely used in the past.  The issue of whether remission should apply to debtors has been raised &mdash; traditionally it has not applied &mdash; and it will be examined further in due course.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that the Law Reform Commission is engaged in a root and branch examination of the debt issue, on which it will publish a discussion paper in September.  This will be followed by the commission&rsquo;s annual conference in November, which is also centred on <Col N="772"/>this topic.  All this work will lead to the publication of a major paper next year in which it will make recommendations for an indepth reform of this area, which is undoubtedly overdue.  The commission has lengthy experience of broad consultation and produces excellent workable solutions in complex areas.  I have no doubt it will take into account the jurisprudence and research produced this week by FLAC.  Any other issues arising in this area can be considered in that context, including necessary amendments to the District Court rules.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate our objections to the procedures being followed by the Minister of State and the Leader of this House in the scrutiny and passing of legislation, which is most unfortunate.  This is serious legislation which involves potential imprisonment of people for non-payment of debt.  Serious issues were raised in the judgment of Laffoy in the McCann <i>v. </i>Judge of Monaghan District Court on 18 June.  It is suggested that this legislation should be dealt with in one day in this House without adequate time following Second Stage for reflection and consideration in terms of tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State said that matters will be considered later, but no time has been provided by Government, or by the Minister of State, to allow consideration of the Bill. </P>
        <P>We are dealing with the fall-out from the aforementioned judgment in which it was held that the provisions of section 6 in particular of the Enforcement of Court (Amendment ) Act 1940 concerning attachment and committal was unconstitutional on two grounds, namely, it failed to comply with the constitutional right to fair procedures inherent in Article 40.3.1&deg; of the Constitution and it failed to comply with a constitutional right to liberty guaranteed by Article 40.4.1&deg; of the Constitution.   I appreciate that this Bill is an attempt to deal with this and the implications of that judgment.  It fails, however, in the important material respect of complying with the judgment, findings and ruling of Ms Justice Laffoy.</P>
        <P>The court held that section 6 of the 1940 Act was unconstitutional with reference to fair procedures.  The judge found there was no basis for treating a person facing the possibility of imprisonment for three months for non-payment of debt at the suit of a creditor differently from a person facing a criminal charge and the possibility of the imposition of a criminal sanction.  In her view there were three fundamental safeguards which had to be in place before the court could properly, and without violating the constitutional rights of a debtor, make an order for the arrest and imprisonment of that debtor.  Those three safeguards were that the debtor be present before the court, unless he or she has consciously understood that arrest and imprisonment is a possible outcome of the application and absented him or herself; that the debtor be apprised by the judge of his or her entitlement to legal representation and provided by the court with a means of obtaining legal aid at the expense of the State if he or she is impecunious and incapable of representing him or herself; and that the court applies fair procedures in the hearing of the creditor&rsquo;s application and does not make an order for arrest and imprisonment unless it is satisfied that failure to pay is due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect.</P>
        <P>On all of those grounds the court found that section 6 of the 1940 Act was unconstitutional.  Section 6 as originally enacted expressly envisaged that an order could be made imprisoning a debtor, notwithstanding that the debtor did not appear and, further, the judge had no jurisdiction to compel the attendance of the debtor with a view to ascertaining whether his absence was due to a conscious decision or otherwise.  It is clear the proposed subsections (3), (6) and (7) of section 6 attempt to deal with that.</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>The second issue is legal aid.  The judge held that the Bill was unconstitutional with regard to the guarantee of fair procedures.  No jurisdiction was conferred on the judge to grant legal aid to the debtor if he or she did not have the means to retain a lawyer to represent him or her.  Again, the new section 6, especially in subsections (5) and (6), attempts to deal with that.</P>
        <P>Another fatal defect of section 6 of the 1940 Act was that the burden of proof rested with the debtor to establish that the inability to pay was not due to his or her wilful refusal or culpable neglect and that there was no stipulation that the standard of proof was that of a criminal trial, namely, beyond reasonable doubt.  Again the Bill attempts to deal with that situation, with the standard of proof provided by section 6(8) that of beyond reasonable doubt, and the burden rests with the creditor rather than the debtor to establish that the failure to pay is not due to a mere inability to pay or to wilful refusal or culpable neglect and that the debtor has no goods that could be taken in execution under any process of the court by which the judgment order decree for the debt is given.</P>
        <P>The issue of imprisonment being a last resort was given great emphasis in the judgment.  The judge held that in circumstances in which a debtor had some resources to meet the debt, a statutory scheme that did not require the creditor to seek redress by attaching those resources did not impair the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as little as possible.  This was a point made by the plaintiff in the case, that it would have made more sense to attempt to attach the debtor&rsquo;s resources, such as social welfare payments, thereby rendering the application for committal a last resort, something required by the application of the doctrine of proportionality to the constitutional right to liberty.</P>
        <P>It is on this point that the Bill fails &mdash; the proportionality test.  It fails to take full cognisance and account of the judgment of the High Court in this respect.  It retains imprisonment not as a last resort but as a fundamental part of the scheme and merely deals with the constitutional impediments in the existing Bill.  The High Court judge stated that the judge is not entitled to make an order for committal unless he is satisfied the debtor has no goods that could be taken in execution under any process of the court by which the judgment order decree for the debt was given.  There is no provision in the Bill for the attachment of earnings.  This is the fundamental basis of Fine Gael&rsquo;s objections to the Bill and the manner in which it has been drafted.  This is why adequate time should be given for consideration of the Bill if we are to deal properly with the judgment which has been given and the defects in the 1940 Act.</P>
        <P>The judge on page 84 of her judgment, wrote that, as the plaintiff&rsquo;s case illustrated, a statutory procedure for enforcement of debt under which the debtor may be imprisoned without there being a positive requirement that the court determine if non-payment is due to an inability to pay before making an order for arrest or imprisonment is not only futile in terms of securing the creditor&rsquo;s remedy, it imposes unnecessary expense both on the creditor and the State.  If the warrant for the imprisonment of the plaintiff had been executed, the plaintiff would spend a month in Mountjoy Prison.  The credit union, however, which its counsel described as a not-for-profit co-operative financial service provider governed by the Credit Union Act 1997 as amended, would not have received &euro;5,658 or even one brass farthing from the plaintiff.  The credit union would have borne the cost of the proceedings for the instalment order and the application for the order for arrest and imprisonment.  The State would have borne the cost of two District Court sittings, the execution of the warrant and the accommodation of the plaintiff in Mountjoy Prison for one month.  That is the main defect in the Bill.  It still does not provide for an attachment of earnings procedure.  In that regard, it fails to adhere to the provisions of the judgment.</P>
        <P>Section 6 as originally enacted breached Article 40.4.1&deg; of the Constitution in that there was no process similar to order 46(b) of the District Court rules requiring personal service of an <Col N="774"/>order with the penal endorsement before attachment and committal could take place.  The failure to require such a process of attachment and committal for the enforcement of a judgment was, according to the judge, unacceptable because it did not represent as minimal an impairment of the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as was possible.  Order 46(b) of the District Court rules concerns attachment on a committal on foot of a failure to comply with an order other than a monetary judgment.  To comply with that procedure, a person with the benefit of such an order must serve the person in breach of that order with a copy of the order personally with the penal endorsement thereon, yet this requirement does not apply to the enforcement of monetary judgments.</P>
        <P>It is not germane to this Bill that there is a similar problem with Order 44 of the High Court rules, in that it contains a similar distinction between the enforcement of a judgment for an amount of money on the one hand and orders generally on the other.  That is a matter I will invite the Minister of State to address, although it is not central to this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill attempts to deal with this requirement of personal service of an instalment order with a penal endorsement, and that is acknowledged.  The new concept in the Bill is welcome.  There are various stages one can go through in terms of dealing with the issue of payment and individuals meeting their debtor obligations.  The new section 6(7) introduces the concept of mediation where appropriate as well as the making of an order fixing a term of imprisonment and the postponement of the execution of that order until such time and under such conditions, if any, as to the payment of the outstanding debt and costs, as the judge thinks fit.  The lack of a further intermediate step of attachment of income from earnings or social welfare payments is the flaw in the legislation.  If the emphasis was placed on attachment of income or other payments which may accrue to the debtor, this would obviate the need for imprisonment.  When one considers that in a single year 2,000 people might be sent to prison for failing to pay fines or debts &mdash; I do not have the breakdown of these two categories &mdash; one can see that the notion of attachment is far more preferable.  It is also vital to adhere to the provisions of the judgment with regard to prison being an option of last resort.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals with the defects in the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 concerning the constitutional right to fair procedures.  Jurisdiction is conferred on the district justice to take various steps to ensure that no order is made without the engagement and presence of the debtor, unless he or she decides not to engage in the process, and a right to legal aid for suitable persons is established.  Furthermore, the onus of proof in establishing that the debtor&rsquo;s failure to pay is attributable to the debtor&rsquo;s wilful refusal or culpable neglect is on the creditor rather than the debtor, which is welcome.  The standard of proof is that of a criminal trial &mdash; that is, beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of personal liberty, the requirement of the new section 6(8)(<i>b</i>) that the creditor establish beyond reasonable doubt that the debtor has no goods that could be taken in execution under any process of the court by which the judgment, order or decree for the debt was given does not include a garnishment or attachment-type option, which is a flaw.  This option is precisely the form of alternative order referred to by the plaintiff and Ms Justice Laffoy in the judgment as being necessary to ensure that imprisonment is a last resort.  Providing for this &mdash; we have tabled detailed amendments in this regard &mdash; would obviate the need for imprisonment of people who are unable, or at least not immediately able, to pay their fines or debts.  I refer again to Order 44 of the Rules of the Superior Courts; this issue should be addressed.</P>
        <P>In the current economic context, we are opposing this Bill because it provides no real alternative to imprisonment for debtors struggling to repay their debts.  Many people are under increasing pressure to pay their debts in the current downturn, and with more than 400,000 <Col N="775"/>people unemployed and living off social welfare, the chances of such people finding themselves in difficulties increases significantly.  Our prisons are becoming more and more overcrowded and it is costly to the State in terms of court time and expense.  Creditors gain nothing from people being sent to prison for non-payment of debt.  The attachment of earnings procedure should be followed to address this.</P>
        <P>We do not wish to send to prison those who are unable to pay their debts.  The current procedures allow for them to be put in prison in such circumstances without providing a mechanism to allow them to meet their obligations over a reasonable period and within their capacity to pay.  That is where this Bill fails on grounds of efficiency and fairness.  Ms Justice Laffoy highlighted in her judgment the constitutional provision of proportionality.  Prison should be a last resort.  If the proposals on attachment which we intend to put forward on Committee Stage are accepted, this would obviate the need for imprisonment in practically all circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for the debate on this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to resolve the need for legislation arising from a judgment of the High Court on 18 June in the McCann case, which found that section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 is incompatible with the Constitution on a number of grounds.  I am somewhat surprised that this judgment was not appealed to the Supreme Court, but that is a personal view.  The grounds were primarily that the debtor was not required to be present in court, no provision was made for legal aid to an indigent debtor at risk of imprisonment and the reversal of the burden of proof meant that the debtor might be imprisoned simply because he or she could not prove that his or her failure to pay was not the result of willful default.</P>
        <P>It would be great if this process of incarcerating people for non-payment of money, particularly small sums of money, could be eliminated in our civil and criminal justice system, but I am not sure whether that will ever come about.  I am interested in a comment made by the Minister during his opening statement:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the first six months of this year the Courts Service estimated that there were approximately 4,300 applications to the District Court for enforcement orders.  In the same period 186 people, less than 5% of the total, were imprisoned.  The average imprisonment period is 20 days.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I accept the total number of people who are imprisoned is a small percentage, but it is still too high.</P>
        <P>Is a pattern emerging in the various District Court areas, of which there are 21 in the Republic, and, if so, how many orders were granted?  The Minister probably does not have the answer to this, but we will deal with the issue again later.  I would like to obtain a breakdown by District Court area.  In my experience as a practising solicitor, I came across judges in various jurisdictions who had different views on these issues.  Most of the judges I dealt with were careful and cautious in granting committal orders for non-payment of debts.  However, they could also be compassionate.  Normally, in such procedures, one is served first with an order asking one to provide a statement of means.  For many of those who provide a statement of means in which it is clear they cannot pay or can pay very little, the judge can be understanding.  I have often heard District Court judges say in open court, to their credit, that they will not send somebody to prison for non-payment where it is clear the debtor cannot pay.</P>
        <P>In contrast, there are people out there who wilfully refuse to pay.  I heard recently, although not in my capacity as a lawyer or a Senator, about an argument between a couple who had separated in which the man, who was relatively wealthy, said the woman would get a penny from him only over his dead body.  There are people who have such a stern attitude.  In such circumstances, where people have the wherewithal to pay whether in the case of maintenance <Col N="776"/>orders or otherwise but do not pay because of a personal grudge between debtor and creditor, the threat of imprisonment must be retained in our justice system.</P>
        <P>However, I compliment the Minister and his officials on their attempts in this legislation to strengthen the position of debtors.  The provisions of this Bill will replace section 6 and amend section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.  Section 2(1) substitutes an amended section for section 6 of the 1940 Act which itself replaced section 18 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926.  Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in which a creditor may apply for a summons under this section, that is, where a debtor has failed to comply with an instalment order made by a court under section 17 of the 1926 Act.  We must always bear in mind that an instalment order will have been served before an application for a summons can be made.  In my experience, judges will invariably adjourn proceedings for up to eight weeks to allow the debtor to come before the court.  In this respect, the committal system has not been abused.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsection (2) specifies the details that must be contained in a summons.  Subsection (3) provides that where a debtor fails to appear on foot of a summons, a judge may issue a bench warrant or adjourn the hearing.  This will serve to strengthen the hand of the unfortunate debtor.  As another speaker observed, there are already undoubtedly many such persons &mdash; and may be many more in the coming months and years &mdash; who will face court proceedings.  The issuing of a bench warrant will ensure the debtor is brought before the court.  We must take into account the human circumstances of these cases.  I have met people, for example, who are under pressure to continue making maintenance payments to a separated partner.  There are other people with severe social problems who move from one rented accommodation to another or who are forced to move in with parents or a sibling.  It is important that the court and the judge are satisfied that the debtor knows what is going on.  A District Court judge will not readily issue a bench warrant unless he or she considers it necessary.</P>
        <P>Subsection (4) provides that a debtor arrested under subsection (3) shall be brought before a court as soon as possible.  I suggest that, as far as practicable, this should happen within 72 hours.  It is unfair for such persons to be detained for an unreasonable period.  This is a matter of particular concern in rural areas where District Court sittings may take place as infrequently as once every two months.</P>
        <P>Subsection (5) provides that where a debtor is arrested and brought before the court under the bench warrant issued under subsection (3), that a date shall then be fixed for a hearing.  The subsection specifies that the judge shall make clear to the debtor his or her entitlement to apply for legal aid, the consequences, including imprisonment, of failing to comply with the instalment and that he or she must attend for the hearing on the date specified.  This addresses the weakness in the existing legislation.  The Bill, whether rushed or not, must be complimented in this regard.  It reflects the spirit of Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment that no person should be imprisoned willy-nilly and without account being taken of proper procedure.</P>
        <P>Subsection (7) sets out the options open to the court if it is satisfied that the debtor has not complied with an instalment order.  I am aware of cases where a statement of means has been filed and it is obvious the debtor is out of work and cannot meet his or her maintenance payments, credit union loan repayments or whatever.  Judges sometimes adjourn such cases for six or even 12 months to allow time for the debtor to improve his or her circumstances.  A particularly important provision in this legislation is the entitlement to free legal aid.  I am not sure what the financial implications of this will be for the Department of Finance.  I understand there are currently some 9,000 applications per year.  However, sin sc&eacute;al eile.  The important consideration is to ensure people are not unjustly imprisoned.  Subsection (8) sets out the standard and onus of proof and the criteria that must be applied by the judge before making an <Col N="777"/>order of imprisonment.  This is another important arrow in the bow of District Court judges in ensuring there is a proper burden of proof in such cases.</P>
        <P>Subsection (9) provides that a debtor who is the subject of a postponed imprisonment order and whose circumstances have changed may apply to re-enter the matter.  This too provides an important safeguard for debtors in response to the appropriate and valid judgment of the High Court.  Subsection (10) makes the same provision as subsection (9) for a debtor who is imprisoned and also provides that he or she may be released immediately on payment of the debt plus costs.  This is another positive aspect of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I will conclude with some general points.  It should be made compulsory through legislation, apart from District Court rules, that a debtor should file a statement of means at whatever stage.  It is important to note that the committal of a debtor to prison does not result in an extinction of the debt.  In other words, having served seven, 14, 21 or 28 days a prison, a debtor will emerge to face the same debt.  Therefore, neither side gains from the imprisonment.  I ask the Minister to consider specifying a minimum threshold of debt below which a person cannot be imprisoned in any circumstances.  It is unacceptable for a person owing as little as &euro;100, &euro;200 or &euro;500 to be committed to prison for seven or 14 days, with the attendant costs to the State.  I understand this issue is being examined by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>Imprisonment for debt makes little sense from any perspective and the consequences for the person concerned are severe.  The imprisoned debtor will clearly be unable to secure any earnings while in detention, thus making him or her less likely to be in a position to make repayment.  For the person committed to prison there is an enormous stigma to endure.  I have spoken to a person who was refused a visa to visit the United States because the Garda PULSE system had recorded his committal for seven days for non-payment of debt.  This person had only served one day of that sentence before repaying the debt.  Being imprisoned even for seven days on a minor financial matter, with the subsequent criminal record, has huge implications for an individual.</P>
        <P>I concur with colleagues that Committee and Report Stages should be staggered over this week and next.  However, those who are bound must obey, and I do not intend to disobey the Whip.  By and large, the Bill represents a positive response to Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s decision.  As such, it accords with our role as legislators.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, stated in the course of his introduction, &ldquo;The aim of this Bill is ensure that people who cannot afford to pay will not be subject to imprisonment and that those who can, but simply choose not to, may face imprisonment&rdquo;.  We all support that objective.  However, Senator Regan makes the valid point that we want to ensure this is good legislation.  To rush through all Stages of the Bill with so little opportunity for debate is sinful.  I urge reconsideration in this regard.</P>
        <P>I expressed concern in this House some weeks ago regarding the position of a man who has deserted his family and against whom a maintenance order has been made.  Could such a person exploit this legislation in some way to avoid making payments?  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to an attitude taken by some people to the effect that their debts would only be repaid over their dead body.  This approach is sometimes taken in cases of a personal nature.  I ask the Minister of State to put my mind at rest on the issue.</P>
        <P>Last year, 276 people were sent to jail for an average of three weeks for non-payment of civil debts.  In one case, a debtor was sent to prison over a debt of &euro;1,700.  The cost to the <Col N="778"/>taxpayer for the three-month sentence imposed on the individual in question was &euro;20,000.  The free legal advice centres, FLAC, carried out a survey which revealed that a high number of debtors &mdash; 79% &mdash; had dependent children.  That most of those who were imprisoned for non-payment of debts were aged between 40 and 50 years dispels the myth that the most indebted group is in a younger age bracket.</P>
        <P>The United Nations Committee on Human Rights drew attention to Ireland three times in this regard.  In its view imprisonment is an inappropriate response to debt.  While reform is necessary, the Bill has the potential to become a quick fix solution because it is not ideal for addressing the fundamentally flawed and outdated legislation which has been in place since 1940.  I ask the Minister of State to put my mind at rest on this issue also.</P>
        <P>A report by FLAC entitled, To No One&rsquo;s Credit,<i> </i>examines the debt enforcement procedures of the courts through the eyes of debtors caught up in the process.  The report shows that new solutions are required to meet the current test of unprecedented personal over-indebtedness we have experienced in recent years.  The money advice and budgeting service, MABS, has indicated it has an unprecedented number of new clients.  It is estimated that only one in five debtors attends hearings to assess his or her ability to repay debts and decide whether imprisonment should follow his or her failure to pay.  The reason for this low figure must in part be that such hearings take place in open court, usually near to where the debtor lives.  In FLAC&rsquo;s experience, such a public place naturally puts off participation.  Moreover, only 50% of participants in this process have legal representation.  In light of these figures, the Minister of State has provided a good explanation for the steps being taken in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The lack of access to advisory services at an early stage &mdash; before the person&rsquo;s financial circumstances worsen &mdash; is also a barrier.  Only one in three of those who managed to engage with their problem at court level had any contact with court staff or officials.  Among the findings of the FLAC report is that three out of four of those surveyed failed to understand the language of the legal documentation served on them.  For this reason, the Minister of State should accept an amendment to preclude such circumstances from arising in future.</P>
        <P>The FLAC survey also found that the overwhelming majority of those surveyed did not understand the consequences of the court proceedings being threatened by the lender.  The enforcement of court order legislation is in need of a complete overhaul as opposed to adjustments forced upon the State by the High Court decision of Ms Justice Laffoy.</P>
        <P>Non-payment of debt is expensive to the State and has a terrible effect on those involved.  The system in place for debtors is inherently unfair.  The wider debt enforcement overview will be reported upon by the Law Reform Commission later this year and I look forward to examining its recommendations for addressing this important issue.</P>
        <P>The free legal advice centres have called on the Government to consider a South African style national credit Act to ban irresponsible lending to protect vulnerable debtors.  Two years ago, the South African Government established an agency to implement new consumer laws in a bid to curb reckless lending and reduce over-indebtedness.  This model should be examined more closely in light of the major problems being experienced here with loan sharks and other financial lenders to whom people are increasingly turning and who may legally charge interest of 180% on loans.  Some of the problems are caused by such practices.  The model could provide a means of avoiding cases coming before the courts in the first instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing time with me.  While I welcome the debate on this legislation, I concur with the criticisms expressed by Senators Regan, Quinn and O&rsquo;Donovan regarding the brief time provided to debate this important Bill.  It is a terrible <Col N="779"/>shame that the House is rushing through all Stages in one day, given the significant impact the Bill will have on many people. </P>
        <P>I have called many times for a debate on prison policy and noted also that far too many people are being locked up in prison for minor offences.  This legislation relates to persons who are being locked up despite not being convicted of offences under the criminal justice system.  As Senator Quinn pointed out, 272 people were imprisoned last year for civil debts, that is, non-payment of debt.  He also helpfully added that Ireland&rsquo;s approach to this issue has been criticised at international level.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the Minister of State&rsquo;s figures show that in the first six months of this year alone, 186 people were imprisoned for an average period of 20 days for non-payment of debts.  Three weeks is sufficient time for a person to lose his or her job.  Further, the person&rsquo;s children could be sent into care and mortgage and other debts will mount up during the incarceration period.  As other speakers noted, matters can only get worse in the current circumstances as more and more people find themselves unable to pay their debts and ultimately face the threat of imprisonment, even with the undoubted improvements offered by the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the free legal advice centres for their briefing and the report, To No One&rsquo;s Credit, published this week on recommendations for change.  As FLAC pointed out, while the Bill contains welcome changes necessitated by the McCann judgment, it does not go far enough in that it still contemplates imprisonment as a sanction for debtors.  Although it will improve the current position, it is akin to placing a sticking plaster to an open wound, namely, our shameful policy of continuing to imprison people because they cannot or do not pay their debts.</P>
        <P>FLAC, in its comprehensive report, suggests that we move towards the removal of imprisonment as an option in debt cases and instead employ effective non-penal remedies to enforce compliance with civil debt judgments.  Senator Regan and FLAC proposed that attachment of earnings legislation be considered as an alternative solution.  Other methods, including sanctions available on the criminal side, such as community service orders, could also be employed.  There is no reason imprisonment must be used as a sanction in these cases.</P>
        <P>Many of us are uncomfortable about moving those who owe civil debts into the criminal system.  While we all accept that sanctions must be available, it is the nature of the sanctions that must be examined.  The sanction of imprisonment is, as I have outlined, counterproductive because people who are imprisoned can no longer earn money to repay debts they may owe and their position is likely to worsen while they are in prison.  They may, for instance, lose whatever employment they have or their children may be taken into care.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that the comprehensive reform of the debt repayments system promised by the Minister has not been undertaken in the 69 years since the passing of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act in 1940.  This was at the start of the Second World War.  It is also extraordinary that the House will rush through criminal justice legislation in a matter of hours when it has taken us nearly seven decades to come to some overall reform of the system.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Law Reform Commission is working on this issue and will produce a consultation paper on debt enforcement.  We know much of what will be in that paper and, from the work done by FLAC, we know much of what is happening.  As I indicated, more than 200 people were imprisoned last year, a figure that appears likely to double this year given that 186 people have already been imprisoned for an average of three weeks in the first six months of 2009.  We are aware of the problems that exist and that the system is not working.  We should, therefore, seek to improve the system and move away from criminalisation.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes many welcome measures.  Unfortunately, while it appears it will at least reduce the likelihood of imprisonment of a debtor in his or her absence, figures on the problem <Col N="780"/>are lacking.  The Courts Service estimates that only one in five debtors takes part in debt enforcement proceedings.  I have been present in District Courts where committal orders were made in the absence of the debtor.  While this may not occur as a matter of routine, under current circumstances judges regard this course of action as the only option available to them.  The figure I provided is an estimate from the Courts Service.  FLAC has pointed out the need for statistics to be gathered on the number of committal orders granted, and on the percentage of debtors who attend, fail to attend or have legal representation.  We simply do not have those data, but we can certainly estimate that a small number of debtors are currently involved in the courts process.  To have debtors criminalised in their absence is, as the High Court has found, a serious flaw in the current system.  It is welcome that measures will now be put in place to ensure it is more likely that debtors will appear in court.</P>
        <P>I have tabled an amendment suggesting that the court summons should include information in ordinary language for debtors explaining that they may a seek a variation of an existing instalment order at the hearing they are required to attend.  It should also provide information, in ordinary language, of the consequences of not appearing at any future committal hearing and the possibility of variations being granted at those hearings.  The amendment is based on a wording that FLAC has proposed and deals with the serious problem where debtors are not appearing in court.  It is to ensure relevant information is provided to them at the earliest stage.  I am conscious that in subsection (5) the Bill provides that the information will be given by the judge where the debtor is arrested and brought before the District Court, but that is too late.  According to FLAC, that information should be provided then, but should also have been provided at an earlier stage.  I urge the Minister of State to consider accepting something like the amendment I have proposed.  Its wording may not be the most elegant, but something to the same effect should be accepted to ensure the debtor is provided at an early stage with information as to the consequences of a failure to appear at that early stage, and the possibility of seeking variations.  It appears to FLAC, and it is clear from the evidence we have, that people are simply not clear as to what procedure is being instituted when a committal summons is made.  I would like the Minister of State to deal with that amendment in his response.</P>
        <P>We need to move away from criminalisation.  I am slightly concerned at the altering of the onus of proof.  It is certainly welcome to see that the creditor must now establish the reason for the debtor&rsquo;s failure to pay instalments &mdash; that it must not have been due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  That is welcome but I am slightly concerned about the insertion of a criminal standard of proof.  We should instead be moving away from the criminalisation of this area rather than towards it.  On Committee Stage I will also address the amendment we have just seen concerning a new section 9, which provides that a Minister may consult a judge.  I have some concern about the appropriateness &mdash; indeed, the constitutionality &mdash; of that procedure given that the judicial function is spent, in a criminal sense, once sentence is passed.  I accept that is not quite the case here, however.  FLAC has suggested that if we are to criminalise in this way, at the very least debtors should have some possibility of remission on a sentence.  There are a number of issues that need to be dealt with, but the better approach would be to move away from the criminalisation that essentially is still at the heart of this Bill.  That is why I will be opposing the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  This short but none the less important Bill has arisen because of the case taken by Ms McCann against the Monaghan District Court justice with regard to an infringement of her constitutional rights and in particular the fact that the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 was incompatible with the Constitution.  The High Court decision was on three grounds: that the debtor was not required to be present in court; no provision was made for legal aid for the debtor, especially <Col N="781"/>one at risk of imprisonment; and the onus of proof was on the debtor, which could lead to a situation where imprisonment evolved because the debtor was unable to prove that his or her failure to pay was not a result of wilful default.</P>
        <P>In addressing these issues, this short Bill amends sections 6, 7 and 8 of the 1940 Act.  It will have the effect of ensuring that where a debtor does not appear, the court can issue a summons to ensure he or she appears.  If the debtor still fails to appear, the court can issue an arrest warrant.  The Bill enables the court to hear the debtor and be satisfied the debtor has wilfully defaulted or otherwise and that all possible steps have been taken to recover the debt, including instalment orders and mediation, which is an innovation within the structure of this legislation.  The Bill safeguards the debtor in that the court will not imprison him or her unless it is satisfied he or she has the means to pay.  The Bill will ensure the debtor will be aware of the risk of imprisonment and that his or her entitlement to legal aid is also made known to him or her.</P>
        <P>We can all cite hardship cases in response to people who appear before the courts.  However, like any legislation, especially in this area, it is a fundamental question of balancing the rights of the debtor with those of the creditor.  I think we would all agree, as many Senators have said, that imprisoning debtors is extremely costly to the State.  In fact, their imprisonment does nothing to satisfy the payment of the debt to the creditor.  We must also be aware that for every genuine person who finds him or herself in difficulty, there are those who are quite happy to play the old soldier and exploit the legal system to the umpteenth degree.  In this regard, perhaps the Minister of State can clarify a point.  When a person is imprisoned for non-payment of a debt, does the obligation to pay the debt continue after their release or is it expunged with the prison sentence?</P>
        <P>With regard to balancing the rights of debtors and creditors, the Courts Service statistics clearly show that the threat of imprisonment is an effective deterrent to encourage people to pay where they have the resources to do so.  It is imperative such deterrents are in place.  Creditors are now finding it increasingly difficult to recover debts.  It is only right and proper that their rights must be protected.</P>
        <P>I note from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech that the Law Reform Commission is examining this area and is expected to publish its report in September.  The commission has had wide-ranging consultations on debt enforcement.  To me, the concept of attachment is a good one in that it obviates the need for imprisonment and the costs that go with it.  Senator Quinn illustrated that cost clearly when he said that the recovery of a debt of &euro;1,700 would cost the State and taxpayers approximately &euro;23,000 when the debtor was imprisoned.  Obviously that does not make sense for the State or the creditor.  Attachments to income, whether earnings or social welfare payments, are highly desirable.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to the entitlement to free legal aid, I note that some negotiations are being entered into in that regard.  I am a long time critic of exorbitant legal fees which arise from a lack of competition within the legal profession, particularly the Bar.  This has given rise to fees that unfortunate clients are bound to pay, yet they are not in a position to negotiate a price as one would do in the normal commercial world.  That area must be tackled effectively because up to now the State has failed miserably in that regard.  In some ways we have probably compounded the difficulties with the arrangements we made for tribunals.  We are still paying tribunal barristers &euro;2,250 per day for basic, mediocre administrative work.  I do not think that is sustainable or defensible, especially in a situation where others have to step up to the plate, given the economic difficulties that we have.</P>
     
        <P>I was taken with some of the recommendations in the submission made by FLAC, especially the recommendation on the new section 6(2).  This provides that the summons requiring the debtor to attend would ask why the instalment order is not being complied with and would set <Col N="782"/>out that the debtor has failed to comply with the order, that imprisonment is a possibility and that the debtor may be arrested if he or she fails to appear at the hearing.  FLAC makes the point that the provision does not inform the debtor that the committal hearing may be used as an opportunity to vary an existing instalment order.  That might be a useful addition to the Bill and perhaps the Minister might look at it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the change in section 6(3) from the discretionary &ldquo;may&rdquo; to the mandatory &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  On section 6(7), FLAC makes the point that the inclusion of mediation is obviously very welcome, but that there might be some reference to MABS to give some direction to the court on where the mediation process might be assisted.</P>
        <P>Further onuses placed on the creditors showed that the debtor has no goods which could be taken in execution.  Will the Minister of State explain how that can be met by the creditor in circumstances where it might be very difficult to determine, other than by using the sheriff?  FLAC makes the point that using the sheriff in those circumstances seems to be somewhat excessive and questionable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The High Court judgment that has led to the necessity to amend this legislation is most welcome.  I do not share the view expressed by colleagues that it was a decision the State ought to have considered appealing.  I cannot understand the basis on which the State would consider appealing this judgment.  When one reads the judgment, one is almost inclined to ask how the law could have been stated like that.  How could a debtor be imprisoned without any positive requirement that the District Court would first have to decide whether the non-payment was due to an inability to pay or a refusal to pay?  It seems to be a fundamental point.  It is not an area of the law with which any of us was familiar until it came out in this judgment.  I cannot understand how it could possibly be the law or how it could be justified as the law.</P>
        <P>It also seems basic to many people that fair procedures should be available for a hearing dealing with the possible imprisonment of a debtor before the courts.  How could it possibly have been the law that such decisions were made in circumstances where there was no real opportunity for the debtor to be heard and for fair procedures to be applied to the hearing of his or her case?  There is a number of other basic points in the judgment that were of fundamental importance to people&rsquo;s rights.  It seems to be entirely wrong for the State not to accept the ruling that has been made.  I am glad that the Government has proceeded to amend the legislation and to deal with the strictures of the decision of Judge Laffoy in that case.</P>
        <P>While I accept the necessity for the Oireachtas to address the implications of this judgment, no satisfactory explanation has been given as to why it must be dealt with in one day.  It is something of a spectacle for us to be considering a Bill such as this over a few hours.  Let us consider the work by bodies such as FLAC and the expertise that such bodies can make available.  We do not have to agree with everything they say, but they can open our eyes to aspects of the issue that did not immediately strike us.  FLAC published a report on indebtedness and quickly put together a briefing for our assistance in this debate so it is easy to see that it has a great level of expertise.  To respond to FLAC&rsquo;s detailed analysis by dealing with this Bill in a couple of hours is simply unacceptable.  It offends not only FLAC, as that is only one body, but also democratic accountability.  As Senator Regan said on the Order of Business, conducting the debate in this way on such an important issue is just one more nail in the coffin of the Seanad as a forum for parliamentary scrutiny.  I appeal to the Leader at this late stage to consider not proceeding with Committee Stage.</P><Col N="783"/>
        <P>Senator Bacik has seen some of the very genuine proposals brought forward by the outside organisations that I mentioned, yet we have to scramble amendments together within a few minutes and go back and forth to the Bills Office.  We will sit next week so why can we not have Committee Stage then?  This decision was made in the High Court on 19 June so one more week will not cause the sky to fall in.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan and Bacik spoke about the need for us to have a more wide-ranging debate.  It may be that these amendments cannot await the wider debate on the use of imprisonment in the enforcement of debts.  I am not as persuaded as Senator Walsh and others by the statistics that we have been given on the District Court.  The Minister of State told us in his speech that there were approximately 4,300 applications for enforcement to the District Court in the first six months of the year and that in the same period, 186 people were imprisoned, less than 5% of the total, and that the average imprisonment period is 20 days.  The clear conclusion was that this proves that the threat of imprisonment is a deterrent for all those other people who then paid up.  I do not accept that this constitutes full proof of the point.  It bears further scrutiny and I am glad the Law Reform Commission will look at it.  If somebody who has not paid a debt is threatened with imprisonment and subsequently pays the debt, that may strongly suggest to the Minister of State and others that the existence of the threat was the reason they paid.  Frankly, I do not believe it follows that it was the reason they paid.  It is worth scrutinising further.  It takes time to complete the process of making enforcement orders, entering judgments and going through the enforcement procedure.  During that period, people can realise the seriousness of the situation they are in and take steps to discharge their debts.  I do not think the existence of the threat constitutes the high and unanswerable level of proof that is being argued for.  It is not necessarily the only reason a person might decide to pay a debt.</P>
        <P>I agree with other Senators that there is considerable scope for us to consider non-custodial approaches to the enforcement of debts.  Regardless of whether we are a far more sophisticated society than we were in 1940 &mdash; I might have to think again about that one in light of some of the things we now know &mdash; it is certain that more sophisticated means of ensuring debts can be discharged are available to us nowadays.  The State obviously has an interest in ensuring people who are owed money ultimately get paid.  As Senator Regan has pointed out, a developed system of attachment of earnings has evolved over recent times.  I know it is difficult in some cases.  People who work in family law know that attachment of earnings is not always available because of the income situation of some people, including the self-employed.  It is not always the answer.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik mentioned other forms of sanction, such as community service orders.  We need to consider other means of putting pressure on people who owe money to pay up.  It is a little crude for us to continue to rely on what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has referred to as the &ldquo;whip hand&rdquo;.  I understand what he means.  We should not rely on the old-fashioned threat of sending people to the slammer if they do not pay up.  It seems to be a little unsophisticated.  It certainly bears further scrutiny and examination.  I have always been deeply uncomfortable with the notion that the sanction of prison should be used as a means of enforcing a debt.  I accept that the Minister of State has said it is intended that this sanction should be used as a last resort.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan that District Court judges, most of whom are extremely humane, will always try to avoid sending people to prison.  While it is important that our judges are compassionate, I do not think the law should rely on the compassion of judges.  The law should be clear.  It should be possible for people to ascertain what it means, to have a stake in it and to support it.  We should not simply leave it to the discretion of District Court judges, who may or may not be compassionate in particular circumstances.  To send people to prison for not paying their debts offends against many people&rsquo;s sense of what it right, fair and appropriate.</P><Col N="784"/>
        <P>While I welcome many of the changes that are proposed in the legislation, I lament the fact they do not go far enough.  They deal with just one aspect of the problem.  We need to remind ourselves that vulnerable citizens are involved in many, if not most, of these cases.  We saw that in the McCann case.  Some people have serious difficulties with basic interaction with the courts.  I accept that has been addressed to some extent in this Bill.  Clearer information should be given to people about the extent to which they are exposed when their cases are heard before the courts.  I welcome the important development in this legislation, whereby the right to legal aid is clarified.</P>
        <P>I do not know why Senator Walsh always feels tempted to start a discussion on tribunals.  I do not think many of those who have appeared before the tribunals have availed of legal aid.  The Senator always takes a cut at the Bar when he gets a chance.  I assure him that many barristers work for an awful lot less than the amount to which he constantly refers in the context of the tribunals.  Many barristers and solicitors who do good work under the legal aid scheme are not paid anything like the sort of figures conjured up by Senator Walsh from time to time.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  A former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform once said that if one is not radical, one is redundant.  Unfortunately for him, he was made redundant.  The essence of what he was saying was that when one has a chance to do something about an issue, one should think about it radically.  At the very least, one should examine such matters broadly to see if they can be changed.  This legislation gives us an opportunity to consider the imposition of fines in a different manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Historically, people have been thrown into jail when they have incurred debt.  When one could not get access to the money, goods or services of one&rsquo;s debtors, one made them pay up by threatening them with imprisonment or by throwing them into jail and forcing their families to pay up.  We are using the opportunity presented by this legislation to maintain the <i>status quo</i> that has existed for the past 200 or 300 years.  There is nothing radical about saying we will throw people into jail if they do not pay up.  The Government should have used this opportunity to consider whether there is a different way of proceeding in cases of this nature.</P>
        <P>People end up in debt in two ways &mdash; indirectly, when they lose their jobs or their ability to earn money and thereby pay their debts; and directly, when they decide they do not care less about their debts.  People in the first category can be pursued through the courts when their debts need to be recouped.  People in the second category contributed to the housing crisis in the United States when they defaulted on their first mortgage payments.  Similarly, certain people in this country defaulted on their second or third car financing payments.  It is clear that many people who end up in this position have decided to throw caution to the wind so they can get what they want.  They have no interest in discharging their debts one way or another.  I suggest that people in this latter group are probably in the minority.  The legislation before the House might be needed to threaten such people with jail if they do not pay their debts.  I emphasise that those who could not care less are in the minority.</P>
        <P>Many Senators have spoken about the tendency for people to say &ldquo;over my dead body will I give up any of my money&rdquo; when their families, marriages or partnerships break up.  In many cases, people do not go to court to get maintenance payments or orders against their former spouses or partners.  They know that if payments are ordered but not made, they could be left in a much more difficult position.  For example, they might not qualify for social welfare payments on the basis of the so-called maintenance orders that are made by the courts.  It is often easier for them to forget about their ex-partners and get the State to pay for their upkeep and that of their children instead.  The Government should have proposed the reform of this system.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>The manner in which people are paid has changed over the last 200 years.  Nowadays, many people have forms of income, goods or property that could be relatively easily accessed by the State, if necessary, if minor changes were to be made to the law.  It may be more difficult to access such moneys in the case of the minority of people who are self-employed or who do piecemeal work.  Most people have a regular income.  Some of the clients about whom I am talking get their income from the State.  It seems logical to take the Fine Gael approach &mdash; to seek an attachment to earnings order &mdash; in most cases.  Our legislation should facilitate that to be more easily done.  Most of these people are paid by the State, or are receiving monthly cheques or payments into their bank accounts from other employers.  There is nothing to prevent the Government from trying to secure faster access to such direct payments when that is required.  It may be possible to do the same thing in the cases of people who are self-employed or have an irregular income stream.  Many such people own property or other things of value.  If the State made more legislative changes over time it could get quicker access to a person&rsquo;s assets to make him or her pay up.  The only option that the State has allowed itself over the last 250 years is to throw people into prison.</P>
        <P>Other aspects of the legislation should be examined, such as attachment of earnings orders or how property and goods may be confiscated.  There may be constitutional issues in that regard, and no doubt the Minister of State will point these out when he is responding.  Nonetheless these are the areas the Government should be looking at.  If somebody has no property, regular income or savings that may be accessed, he or she will never be in a position to pay, either under this legislation or any provisions that we might propose.  In effect, these are lost cases.  Therefore the argument for throwing people into prison is both old-fashioned and out of step with what might be regarded as the modern way to run a justice service.  It is not just a question of affronting people&rsquo;s human rights, not even in terms of an extreme right wing perspective, as regards getting value for money and delivering a good service.  We should move away from just throwing people into jail and look at other remedies in terms of getting access to their incomes or property and using those assets to pay off whatever debts they may have incurred.  Normally, these are the people who are probably slow to pay up anyway.  Many others, who just find themselves in difficult positions, are willing to do something to address their problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  However, I deplore the fact that the Minister of State, who is a decent man, is complicit in undermining the constitutional role of the Seanad, since we will not have proper time to investigate this issue fully and table appropriate amendments.  I shall not go on about this, though, because it means I would be wasting my time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This matter needed to be addressed for a very long time.  The House will know that I have tried various methods to attack the situation whereby people were being put in jail for debt.  For example, on the Broadcasting Bill I said &mdash; the then Minister of State in charge agreed &mdash; that it was appalling that people were being put in jail on a regular basis, including a woman in Cork with a family of young children, on the basis of non-payment of a television licence.  The Minister of State then indicated that this Bill would be brought before the House and that it was more appropriate to deal with this type of question here.</P>
        <P>I was surprised to have been the only Member of the Oireachtas to attend a very good briefing by FLAC.  I commend the Free Legal Aid Service and I know some of its representatives are in the House today.  It performed a very useful service by giving detailed and clear briefings to all of us.  There may be many reasons why my colleagues could not attend, and I am aware they were circulated with the brief, which in some ways is just as good.  However, by not being there they missed part of the human face.  It was very striking to listen to the calm and dignified story of Ms Mary Coughlan, a remarkable artist.  She spoke about her experience <Col N="786"/>as an artist because the entertainment business suffers a series of fluctuations and people are not always careful.  We know of so many tragic stories in show business, where people do not always read the small print in the legal documentation.</P>
        <P>Ms Coughlan signed something quite blissfully having made, as she said, a transmission almost instantly from very poor rental accommodation to a magnificent palatial house in Baily, with tennis courts and all the rest until suddenly, one day, two years into her enjoyment of these premises, she found herself in debt.  Suddenly there were bailiffs and she was threatened with jail.  Only the intervention of Sir Richard Branson, who was on the point of signing her for a major record deal, saved her.  He managed to negotiate with the bank, and she was very happy to give the name, National Irish Bank.  One has only to look at the way NIB operated so disgracefully itself, so shame on it for pursuing someone such as that.  The interesting point is that Ms Coughlan had neither the competence nor the muscle to extricate herself from this situation.  Sir Richard Branson did and managed to negotiate what amounted to a 50% deal.  He paid off half the debt and that excused the entire deal, but Ms Coughlan is still left with the aftermath because her credit rating is gone.  She is paying &euro;1,800 a month rent on a three-bedroomed house in Bray, which is significantly less than the mortgage she would be paying on a proper house for her family, with all the amenities.  No bank will give her the money, however, because her credit rating is gone.  That is an appalling situation and I hope this will be taken into consideration as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much of this legislation was spurred by the McCann case in the High Court, as the Minister of State indicated in his speech.  I commend not only the principle in this case but also the Northside Community Law Centre.  It was only with the law centre&rsquo;s assistance that this remarkable and courageous woman was able to take her case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislation is clearly intended to remedy some of the defects highlighted by the McCann case.  Unfortunately, however, although the changes are welcome, they only really look at the last step in what FLAC describes as the complex and less than user-friendly procedure that takes place in open court and is need of comprehensive reform generally.  I say to the Minister of State that the first step is very good, but we need an urgent and more comprehensive review of the entire situation.  I recommend to his attention, as I am sure others have, the very detailed submission by FLAC, called To No One&rsquo;s Credit.</P>
        <P>The changes in the Bill will mean that in some circumstances it will put an end to the imprisonment of a debtor in his or her absence from the court.  That was an appalling business.  However, the Government with the other hand is creating a situation with the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill where exactly that can happen, so there is an incoherence in its approach.  The onus of proof is being altered so that it is now up to the creditor to establish the debtor&rsquo;s failure.  In other words, it is important that guilt is no longer assumed on the part of the debtor.  The Bill provides for some degree of legal aid.  Section 2 sets out to amend section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 and the intention is that a debtor will be obliged or encouraged to attend the court etc.</P>
        <P>Since there is so little time, it would be helpful if, because under this new legislation the judge is capable of varying an instalment order, there should be a clear statement to the effect that a debtor &ldquo;may&rdquo; seek such a variation.  This should be made clear to debtors at all times, but in the Bill this does not necessarily happen.  However, I very much welcome the fact the intention in law is to ensure people are informed of the situation in clear and ordinary language.  Subsection 6(3) empowers the District Court judge, where the debtor fails to attend, to issue a warrant.  Again we have one of these classic &ldquo;may&rdquo; versus &ldquo;shall&rdquo; situations and perhaps my colleagues have spoken on this.  However, this is a dangerous area and I appeal to the Minister of State to examine and amend it.</P><Col N="787"/>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know whether the appalling manner in which business is handled in this House means that this cannot necessarily be amended here.  Nonetheless, I ask the Minister of State to introduce an amendment because the consequences could be very serious.  If the judge may do something, that implies, linguistically, that he or she may not do it.  If neither of these options is exercised, then it appears the debtor could still be imprisoned or an order could be sought to that end.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not criticise the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s percussion techniques.  Given the nature of the recent High Court decision that brought this amendment Bill into being, this Bill has to be narrow in focus.  There is a legal situation that must be remedied and the Bill has been put forward in this regard.  That does not mean there is no need for wider and more comprehensive legislation.  The Members of the House are right to put those reservations on board and seek such legislation at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Imprisoning people for debts is something many Members of this House and members of society believe is an unnecessary punishment in the times we live in, although in some circumstances it cannot be avoided.  There is a certain irony, given the times we live in, that there are those in our society, particularly in white collar crime, who have accrued far higher levels of debt but who remain untouched and unpunished.  Given what is likely to happen in our judicial systems and, hopefully, in our prosecution systems in the next few years, I will let that inference lie because this House has no business referring directly to those matters.</P>
        <P>The history of penal institutions in this country once saw debtors&rsquo; prisons as separate buildings.  We have come a long way from that, and the degree of people being imprisoned for debt is now a lower proportion of those imprisoned.  In line with the request made in this House on many occasions, particularly on the Order of Business on many days, about the nature of imprisonment, we must ask questions about how we can bring the level down to the nth degree.  We also need to have a debate on debt, what qualifies as debt, how people are brought into judicial proceedings and what they are being asked to repay.</P>
        <P>In recessionary times we know people are being asked to use lenders of last resort and the nature of debt compiled by individuals who are brought before some kind of judicial assessment is that people are being asked to repay debt that is many times the original principal because of high and unsustainable interest levels.  As a result, we need better definition in our legal code to ensure that if this option is being considered, and it is one which should rarely, if ever, be considered, it is not on the basis that a person is being asked to pay for something he or she never borrowed in the first instance.</P>
        <P>As we examine the ethics and morals of our financial institutions and those involved in the often odious business of moneylending, these questions should inform a debate such as this.  Given the nature of putting in force corrective legislation on short notice on foot of a legal decision, we do not have the time and opportunity to do it before the end of this session.  In <Col N="788"/>requests for amendments and requests for legislation to deal with attachment of earnings, I hear a call for wider legislation in this area.  As and when the House, with a Governments sponsored Bill, approves this legislation tonight, I ask that such legislation would come into being at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

	<P>Please do not comment on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I was taken by his remarks and I agree with what he said.  He spoke of reservations, ethics, morals and responsibility.  Let him accept the amendments from this side of the House.  As Senators Alex White and Regan said, let us not have a rushed day here.  His speech is nothing but an apology for the Government.  He does not stand up for what he believes in and he should vote with this side of the House.</P>
        <P>We need to remove the threat of imprisonment and we also need the threat of sanction.  On this side we advocate ending the use of imprisonment in debt enforcement.  Debt rescheduling and mediation should be the norm.  I accept there must be a sanction overhanging the issue.  Debt enforcement has implications and those who default must repay.  I was involved with a credit union on a supervisory committee for a number of years and I understand the predicaments and precarious positions people get themselves into.  In many cases we are talking about the most vulnerable in society, people who end up going to moneylenders and being forced into all sorts of difficulties.</P>
        <P>The judgement we refer to has forced changes and the Bill reflects this.  I compliment the Free Legal Advice Centre on its document and Senator Regan on his detailed amendments which will be before the House later and on his speech in the House this afternoon.  I hate the word &ldquo;debtors&rdquo; because we are talking about people.  The majority of people in debt acknowledge their debt and understand they must repay.  Between 40 and 50 people are in prison on any given day to pay a fine, with a total of 2,000 people per year.  I will return to the cost of that.</P>
        <P>The Bill, which is a result of the McCann case, proposes that we amend section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act.  Fine Gael, as Senators Regan and Twomey have pointed out, oppose the Bill as it retains imprisonment as the final option for non-payment of a civil or contractual debt and offers no alternative to imprisonment for debtors.  We need an alternative.  Senator Boyle spoke about being in recessionary times.  People are under increasing pressure to make ends meet.  On top of that, some people find themselves in debt in these economic times.  More than 400,000 people are on social welfare and dependent on the State.  They are trying to live a life with some type of food, clothing and the means to pay bills such as heating and energy costs and they end up in difficult and dire financial situations.  All of us in our clinics and private lives have met people who are struggling.</P>
        <P>Through Senator Regan we have proposed instalment orders which remove the threat of imprisonment while giving people the security that the debt will be repaid.  I do not believe a person in debt should be imprisoned.  We see what has happened with our banking profession where people have been allowed to get away scot free, and with some of our developers who have codded people.  Last week in New York, Mr. Bernard Madoff was carted off to jail.  In this country the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il get the white flag and the red carpet is rolled out.  It is a bit like Palm Sunday in reverse.</P>
        <P>We have proposed an attachment to earnings order which removes the option from a person not to pay the fine.  Under such an order, a fine would be deducted at source from a person&rsquo;s salary or social welfare in a fair and balanced way.  It can be taken by percentage in an equitable <Col N="789"/>way that is very much in keeping with what the Bill is meant to be about.  We would see a maximum threshold being established and one would pay in proportion to one&rsquo;s income.  For example, the courts may establish that no more than 5% of a persons&rsquo; income could be taken in any given period.  That might be significant in some people&rsquo;s wages, but it would remove the threat of imprisonment which outweighs the contribution.</P>
        <P>From my experience, many credit unions are willing to reschedule members&rsquo; loan repayments and the conditions of the payments if people&rsquo;s circumstances change.  I have been at credit union AGMs where the chairman has issued on behalf of the board of directors an appeal to people in difficulty to talk to the credit union.  I appeal to people in financial difficulty to talk to their credit union or bank.  The credit union control committee is committed to assisting its members who are ordinary people.  It was the credit union movement which commenced the money advice and budgeting service in Cork.</P>
        <P>It costs almost &euro;2,000 a week to keep one prisoner in jail.  In 2008 the average civil debtor spent 21 days in prison at a cost of &euro;6,000 to the State.  By any man&rsquo;s language that does not make sense.  We have proposed a balanced and fair system whereby the debt would be repaid and the granting of an attachment order by a judge would allow a portion of a defaulting person&rsquo;s wage or social welfare payment to be used in repayment of the loan.  While sanctions are necessary, imprisonment is a step too far, especially when we consider what has happened in 21st century Ireland where there is now no acceptance by some people of their wrongdoing and where such people have been aided and abetted without having to pay the price, which is wrong.  We are now discussing penalising ordinary people when we should be assisting them in repaying their loans.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  The need for this important legislation came about as a result of a High Court judgment on 18 June in the case of McCann, who is from my constituency, <i>v.</i> Judge of Monaghan District Court <i>et al</i>.  The Minister of State has outlined the findings of the High Court, as have other speakers.  We are all agreed that nobody should go to jail because he or she cannot pay a debt.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>

	<P>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?</P>

	<P>Now.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Is that agreed?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.  We point out to the Leader what he said about guillotining debate on Bills.  The guillotining of the debate has happened already because some <Col N="793"/>speakers were not allowed to contribute to the debate on Second Stage.  In effect, the Leader has guillotined the debate on this Bill.  He should not say that he has not guillotined the debate on Bills in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, for the benefit of the House, will the Cathaoirleach repeat what he indicated to the House this morning as being his understanding of what the Leader said about the debate on this Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I outlined what I was told this morning.  I must be clear on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Cathaoirleach repeat it for the benefit of the House?  Will he repeat what he said earlier?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a proposal before me.  I outlined to the House what I understood to be the case this morning.  The question I have before me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>What was that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Why does Senator Alex White not tell us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not the Leader.  I am trying to chair these proceedings as best I can.  What is before me is the question that Committee Stage be taken now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Cathaoirleach indicated clearly that his understanding of the position was that if amendments were proffered time would be given so the House would have an opportunity to have a sos&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was my understanding this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach, that was his understanding.  Will the Leader respond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>A Chathaoirligh&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I must move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very relevant.  What did the Leader&rsquo;s words mean this morning when he said he would review the proceedings?  Our understanding was that if amendments were tabled there would be a break and we would come back to deal with the amendments.  All Stages should not have been ordered for today anyway.  Will the Leader clarify what he said this morning?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Leader and the Government.  The Leader has proposed that we take Committee Stage now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>What do the Leader&rsquo;s words mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question for the House.  On a point of order, if the Cathaoirleach told the House what he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, but this is a point of order.  The Leader told the House that there would be no guillotine.  Then the Order of Business, as agreed by this House, indicated there would be no guillotine, so what is happening here is illegal.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="794"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Further, on a point of order, the Leader indicated earlier that there would be a review.  I have tabled an amendment, that I had to compile during Second Stage.  I do not think the Minister has had time to review my amendment nor the other amendments from the parties.  All the amendments have not been circulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader orders the business of the House and when I asked when it was proposed to take Committee Stage he said &ldquo;Now&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an appalling way to treat the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I am concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>

	<P>Members, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Cathaoirleach happy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach is required to obey the ruling and the decision of this House this morning, namely, that there would be no guillotine and that there would be time for amendments.  That was agreed on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business made no such provision.  What I have before me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Cathaoirleach preside over the House being run like this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, is the Cathaoirleach happy for the House to be run in this manner?  No breaks are scheduled between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  All Stages are being taken and no amendments have been circulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I am concerned, the Leader has put forward the business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that not lowering the reputation of this House?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I must concur with the proposal of the Leader that Committee Stage be taken now.</P>

If I could take the Chair through those amendments, amendment No. 1 on the Government list mentions page 3, subsection (1), line 12, which comes before Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment of page 3, section 2.  In fairness, the Government amendment comes first.  This is a reflection of the procedural shambles if it is not even clear which amendment comes first.</P>

It is not unreasonable for a Member of the House to have one sheet of paper that shows a list of the amendments we will be dealing with.  This is not the fault of the Leas-Chathaoirleach and this is not directed at him by any means but there are four lists of amendments and we are being asked to figure out their order.

        <P FLI="0">This amendment arises from the High Court judgment of Ms Justice Laffoy of 18 June 2009.  She pointed out the constitutional flaws in the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.  While the Bill addresses some of the deficiencies in the Act, this amendment addresses one of the essential findings of the court, that there is no provision for adequate intermediate steps before the last resort of imprisonment is invoked by the courts or by a creditor.</P>
        <P>It is an issue of proportionality because it interferes with the constitutional right of an individual to liberty.  In her judgment she has expressly pointed out the futility of a procedure that puts people in prison, where the creditor does not benefit.  In the judgment, she stated that a statutory procedure for enforcement of debt, under which the debtor may be imprisoned without there being a positive requirement that the court determine whether non-payment is due to inability to pay before making an order for arrest and imprisonment, is not only futile in terms of securing the creditor&rsquo;s remedy, but imposes unnecessary expense on the creditor and the State.</P>
        <P>If the warrant for imprisonment of the plaintiff had been executed in this case, the plaintiff would have spent a month in Mountjoy Prison.  The credit union which its counsel described as a not-for-profit co-operative financial service provider governed by the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended, would not have received the sum it claimed, or even a brass farthing, from the plaintiff.  The credit union would have borne the cost of the proceedings for the instalment order and the application for the order for arrest and imprisonment.  The State would have borne the cost of two District Court sittings, the execution of the warrant and the accommodation of the plaintiff in Mountjoy Prison for one month.  Not only would the process have had no practical value in securing payment of the outstanding debt, or any part of it, it is difficult to see how it could be said to have any deterrent value.</P>
        <P>The issues are efficiency, interference with the right to liberty, whether the measures in the Bill provide a proportionate response to that interference with liberty and whether the principle of proportionality is respected in providing for procedures that ensure that the deprivation of liberty and the imprisonment of a debtor is genuinely a last resort.</P><Col N="804"/>
        <P>The Bill attempts to amend section 6 of the 1940 Act and deals with a number of issues that were raised by the judge in the court case.  The Bill is designed to deal with the fall-out from that judgment and the implications for the recovery of debt.  The amendment proposed, however, is a substitute for section 2.  It is designed to provide for a procedure whereby an attachment of income is ordered as a substitute for imprisonment, which is to the benefit of creditors, eliminates the use of imprisonment to force the individual to pay a debt and is more efficient.  The proposed amendment provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Where a debtor is liable, by virtue of an instalment order, to pay a debt and costs either in one payment or by instalments and such debtor fails to make such payment or fails to pay any one or more of such instalments accruing due while such an order is in force at the time or times appointed in that behalf by such order, the creditor may, at any time while such order is in force or within 12 months after it has ceased to be in force, apply to a Justice of the District Court for an Attachment of Income Order.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is defined in the amendment as an order under sections 8 and 17.  On application to the relevant court by a creditor, the court may make an attachment of earnings order, which is defined as &ldquo;an order directed to a person who...has the debtor in his or her employment&rdquo;.  It is further stated that the order &ldquo;shall operate as a direction to that person to make, at such intervals as may be specified in the order, deductions of specified amounts&rdquo;.  The amendment provides that an attachment of earnings order &ldquo;shall not be made without the consent of the debtor unless the court is satisfied that the debtor has, without reasonable excuse, defaulted in the making of any payment under a court order&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  Subsection (4) of the proposed new section states:</P>
        <P LI="1">An attachment of earnings order shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>(a) </i>specify the normal deduction rate, that is to say, the amount of the debtor&rsquo;s earnings which the court considers reasonable to be applied in satisfying the court order, but such rate should be no greater than is necessary for the purpose of&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="3">(ii) securing payment within a reasonable period of any sums already due and unpaid under the court order and any costs incurred in proceedings relating to the order which are payable by the debtor,</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>(b)</i> specify the protected earnings rate, that is to say, the rate below which, having regard to the resources and the needs of the debtor, the court considers it proper that the debtor&rsquo;s earnings should not be reduced by a payment made in pursuance of the attachment of earnings order,</P>
        <P LI="2">(c) contain such particulars as the court considers appropriate for the purpose of enabling the debtor to be identified by the person to whom the order is directed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It continues:</P>

        <P FLI="0">In many ways this procedure facilitates mediation or settlement.  It provides for a meeting of minds on the debt.  The procedure of the attachment of earnings or income order would enable the court to play a part in resolving such disputes.</P>
        <P>Subsection (6) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Payments under an attachment of earnings order shall be in lieu of payments of the like total amount under the court order that have not been made and that, but for the attachment of earnings order, would fall to be made under the court order.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment provides a procedure for compliance with the attachment of earnings order.  The proposed section 9 provides:</P>
        <P LI="1">A court registrar or court clerk as may be specified by an attachment of earnings order shall cause the order to be served on the employer to whom it is directed and on any subsequent employer of the debtor and such service may be effected by leaving the order at, or sending the order or a copy of the order by prepaid registered post to his or her place of business or residence in the State.</P>
        <P>As I go through this amendment I must point out that it is a complex and important issue we are trying to deal with through this Bill.  The amendment is complex but it also highlights the fact that we should not be rushing this legislation.  It is futile and bad legislative procedure.  If time was allowed both the Minister and the Department would be well served by giving adequate consideration to these amendments.  I appreciate that the Minister is intent on rushing this and other legislation through the House.  The Leader is following the directions of the Minister, but it is an abuse of the process of the House, as my colleague in the D&aacute;il has said with regard to other legislation introduced by the Minister, to rush the legislation in this fashion.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the amendment provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) Where an attachment of earnings order or an order varying it is made, the employer for the time being affected by it shall comply with it within 10 days of it being served on him or her.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) On any occasion where a person makes, in compliance with an attachment of earnings order, a deduction from a debtor&rsquo;s earnings, he or she shall give to the debtor a statement in writing of the total amount of the deduction.</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) Where an attachment of earnings order is served on any person and&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the debtor is not in his or her employment, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the debtor subsequently ceases to be in his or her employment, that person shall, within ten days from the date of service or, the date of cesser, give notice of that fact to the court.</P>
        <P LI="1">(5) An order made under subsection (1) shall be confidential and the employer shall not make it known to any person other than those persons necessary for the payment of wages, and such persons shall themselves have a duty not to disclose the existence of an attachment of earnings order.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The provision on confidentiality is important.  The amendment also provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Upon application to the court for an attachment of earnings order, or at any subsequent time which the court deems fit, the court may&mdash;</P><Col N="806"/>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>order the debtor to give to the court, within a specified period, a statement in writing signed by him or her of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) the name and address of any person by whom earnings are paid to him or her,</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) specified particulars as to his or her earnings and projected earnings and as to his or her resources and needs, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) specified particulars for enabling the debtor to be identified by any other employer, including any future employer,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) order any person appearing to the court who has the debtor in his or her employment to give to the court, within a specified period, a statement signed by that person, or on his or her behalf, of specified particulars of the debtor&rsquo;s earnings and projected earnings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment also provides for notification of changes of employment and earnings in subsection (11), providing that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Where an attachment of earnings order is in force&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>the debtor shall notify the court in writing, within 10 days of every occasion, in which he or she leaves any employment, or becomes employed or re-employed,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>the notice referred to in paragraph <i>(a) </i>shall include particulars of his or her earnings and projected earnings from the relevant employment,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) any person who becomes an employer of the debtor and has knowledge that an order is in force shall, within ten days of acquiring that knowledge, notify that court in writing that he or she is the debtor&rsquo;s employer, and include in the notification a statement of the debtor&rsquo;s earnings and projected earnings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Another provision in the amendment is with regard to the power to determine whether particular payments are earnings.  Section (12) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) Where an attachment of earnings order is in force, the relevant court shall, on the application of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the employer concerned,</P>

        <P FLI="0">Subsection (2) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Where an application under this section is made by the employer, he or she shall not incur any liability for non-compliance with the order as respects any payments (or any portion thereof) of the class or description specified by the application which are made by him or her to the debtor while the application or any appeal in consequence thereof or any decision in relation to the application or appeal is pending, but this shall not, unless the court other<Col N="807"/>wise orders, apply as respects such payments (or any portion thereof) if the employer subsequently withdraws the application or abandons the appeal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 13 relates to attachment orders in respect of debtors who are in the service of the State, local authorities and other such bodies<i>.</i>  Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) provides that &ldquo;in a case where a debtor in the service of the State is employed in a department, office, organisation, service, undertaking or other body, its chief officer shall . . . for the purposes of this Act, be regarded as having the debtor in his or her employment&rdquo;.  Subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) specifies that &ldquo;in a case where a debtor is in the service of such an authority, board or committee, its chief officer shall, for the purposes of this Act, be regarded as having the debtor in his or her employment&rdquo;.  Subsection 1(<i>c</i>) states that &ldquo;in any other case, where a debtor is paid out of the Central Fund or out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance . . . shall, for the purposes of this Act, be regarded as having the debtor in his or her employment&rdquo;.  Under subsection 1(<i>d</i>), &ldquo;any earnings of a debtor paid out of the Central Fund or out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas shall be regarded as paid by the chief officer referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>), as the case may be, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance or such other officer as may be designated under paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>c</i>), as the case may be, as may be appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Subsection (2) of section 13 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">If any question arises in proceedings for, or arising out of, an attachment of earnings order as to what department, office, organisation, service, undertaking or other body a debtor in the service of the State is employed in for the purposes of this section, the question may be referred to and determined by the Minister for Finance, but that Minister shall not be under any obligation to consider a reference under this subsection unless it is made by the Court.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Subsection (3) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">A document purporting to contain a determination of the Minister for Finance under subsection (2) and to be signed by an officer of the Minister for Finance shall, in any such proceedings as are mentioned in that subsection, be admissible in evidence and be deemed, unless the contrary is shown, to contain an accurate statement of that determination.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Subsection (4) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">In this section references to a debtor in the service of the State include references to a debtor to whom earnings are paid directly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 14 relates to the discharge, variation and lapse of attachment of earnings orders.  Subsection (1) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The relevant court may, if it thinks fit, on the application of the creditor or the debtor, make an order discharging or varying the antecedent order.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Subsection (2) specifies that:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Under subsection (3), &ldquo;Where an employer affected by an attachment of earnings order ceases to have the debtor in his or her employment, the order shall, in so far as that employer is <Col N="808"/>concerned, lapse&rdquo;.  Subsection (4) provides that: &ldquo;The lapse of an order under subsection (3) shall not prevent its remaining in force for other purposes.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Section 15 relates to the cesser of attachment of earnings orders.  Subsection (1) states that: &ldquo;An attachment of earnings order shall cease to have effect upon the discharge of the court order.&rdquo;  Under subsection (2); &ldquo;Where an attachment of earnings order ceases to have effect, the clerk or registrar of the relevant court shall give notice of the cesser to the employer.&rdquo;  I take this opportunity to remind the Minister of State that he may indicate at any time his agreement to allow Committee Stage on another day so that he has time to study this amendment.</P>
        <P>Section 16 provides for alternative remedies.  Under subsection (1):</P>
        <P LI="1">Where an attachment of earnings order has been made, any proceedings commenced under section 8(1) of the Act of 1940, for the enforcement of the court order against the debtor shall lapse and any warrant or order issued or made under that section in any such proceedings shall cease to have effect.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Subsection (2) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">An attachment of earnings order shall cease to have effect upon the making of an order under section 8(1) of the Act of 1940, for the enforcement of the court order against the debtor.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 17 provides for the attachment of welfare orders.  Such persons should not face the threat of imprisonment for non-payment of debt.  Subsection (1) states that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall make regulations to address circumstances where . . . a person is entitled to income support, and . . . has defaulted on the discharge of a court order, so as to enable the court to make an order directing the Minister to deduct sums from any amounts, not below the protected welfare rate, payable to the debtor by way of income support, in order to secure the payment of any sum which is or forms part of the court order.</P>

	<P>I was dealing with subsection (3) of section 17, dealing with the regulations to be prescribed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  To reiterate, the regulations may include provision as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]hat, before making an application, the court shall make an enquiry as to the debtor&rsquo;s means . . . allowing or requiring adjudication as regards an application, and provision as to appeals and reviews . . . as to the circumstances and manner in which and the times at which sums are to be deducted and paid . . . as to the calculation of such sums . . . as to the circumstances in which the Minister is to cease making deductions . . . requiring the Minister to notify the debtor, in a prescribed manner and at any prescribed time, of the total amount of sums deducted up to the time of notification . . . [and] that, where the whole amount to which the application relates has been paid, the court shall give notice of that fact to the Minister.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister of State indicated that the Courts Service estimates that in the first six months of this year approximately 4,300 applications were made to the District Court for enforcement orders and in the same period 186 people, less than 5% of the total, were imprisoned.  We know that many people are imprisoned for failing to pay minor sums.  The fatal flaw in this legislation is the absence of a procedure to facilitate such persons to avoid such a scenario through attachment of earnings.  This is the constitutional point made by Ms Justice Laffoy in her judgment and one that appears to have been overlooked by the Government in its rush to address the matter.  While I understand the importance of addressing the many other flaws in the 1940 Act, the failure to take account of this finding of the judge is the fundamental flaw of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The amendment is designed to provide for a procedure to substitute for imprisonment.  It would render imprisonment a genuine last resort and comply with the findings of Ms Justice Laffoy in the High Court.  I referred to the figures indicating that 2,000 people are imprisoned for non-payment of fines or debts in any one year and that 40 to 50 people are in prison at any one time for failure to pay a fine or debt.  This problem can be avoided.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s point that the courts are reluctant to order committal is correct.  However, the courts frequently do so because they do not have available to them intermediate procedures providing facilities, such as attachment of earnings, that would assist people to resolve the issue.  In addition, such facilities would enable creditors to obtain some satisfaction for the debts due to them in circumstances where they do not have an interest in seeing a debtor imprisoned and do not seek punishment but instead seek some return of the moneys due to them or a contribution to the debt.  That is the purpose of the exercise.  The Minister has failed to appreciate this fundamental finding of Ms Justice Laffoy in the High Court.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minster of State to consider accepting this amendment which complements the other remedies in the legislation dealing with the rights of an individual against whom procedures are initiated for non-payment of debt.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this substantial amendment as it offers a practical and human alternative to the last resort of imprisonment proposed in the Bill.  I concur with many of my colleagues on this side who have expressed serious reservations about the manner in which this legislation is being forced through the House.  The in-depth consideration the Bill requires is not possible in the time available.  Such consideration is not only desirable but absolutely necessary.  Last week, following only a cursory examination of other legislation, the Local Government (Charges) Bill, Senators discovered a number of unintentional flaws which <Col N="810"/>needed to be rectified.  I am pleased to note the majority of these flaws are being addressed as we speak. </P>
        <P>Between 2003 and July 2008, 1,138 people were imprisoned for non-payment of debts at an average cost of &euro;270 per person per day.  This Dickensian practice has no place in a modern society.  Many questions attach to this outdated approach.  Rather than being the last resort, as it has been described, imprisonment remains at the heart of the legislation.  It is an overly simplistic solution to a very complex problem.</P>
        <P>While the House has discussed the elements of responsibility attaching to a debtor, we have had little discussion about the element of responsibility attaching to those who do the lending in the first instance.  Every lending institution has a moral responsibility to lend correctly and carry out due diligence before making a loan.  I and many others have had concerns in the past two or three years about the development of predatory lending practices by most credit institutions.  We have all seen the fall-out from these types of practices.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Colleagues who are customers of a certain credit card company will, like me, have received cheques in the post for &euro;4,000, &euro;6,000 or &euro;8,000 offering to finance a new kitchen or nice holiday abroad.  These cheques are signed and legally binding.  All one must do is pick up the telephone to have the cheque authorised before proceeding to spend the sum in question.  This type of predatory, irresponsible lending has resulted in many people appearing before our courts.  With a sanction as serious as a jail term for non-payment available to such predatory lenders, these high-wire trapeze artists have available to them a level of security and a safety net that will continue to encourage them to take risks in lending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to note that in the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour, the Debtors Act 1869 abolished sending people to prison for being in debt.  More than one and a half centuries later, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights is still recommending that Ireland does the same.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White remarked on the expertise of the free legal advice centres, FLAC, in this area.  We must give due regard to FLAC&rsquo;s report and the conclusions it draws.  The report states that debt enforcement in this country has a devastating and largely pointless human cost.  A survey carried out among people accessing FLAC found that those taken to court for not repaying debts refer to having nightmares, experiencing worry, stress and illness and even resorting to medication.  The report also concluded that imprisonment to enforce a private contract debt is &ldquo;entirely inappropriate&rdquo;, as well as being highly questionable.</P>
        <P>The key issue is that alternatives to imprisonment are available.  As Senator Regan noted, attachment of the debt to a person&rsquo;s salary or social welfare payment is one such option.  Other countries have resorted to the use of community service, which as an option we should consider given that it is at least as substantial a deterrent to non-payment of debt as a prison sentence.  It also has the social benefit of having necessary work carried out in the community.</P>
        <P>In introducing the recent fines legislation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated he wanted &ldquo;to reduce, as far as possible, a dependence on imprisonment for default on payment of fines&rdquo;.  He emphasised that while very few persons are in prison at one time solely for non-payment of a fine, he is determined to back legislation to reduce those numbers further.  The Minister seems to conclude that it is undesirable to imprison people for non-payment of a fine, but I wonder why he does not also consider it particularly undesirable when it involves a civil debt.</P>
      
        <P>I listened to the earlier stage of the debate in my office and it seems there is not much uniformity of opinion across the Government benches on this issue.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan thinks <Col N="811"/>it is ridiculous to imprison someone for a debt as small as &euro;500 because of the cost involved.  Quite rightly, he has major concerns about the stigma and emotional damage attaching to a prison sentence.  Senator Walsh sees a system of attaching debt to salaries to be &ldquo;highly desirable&rdquo;, as he described it.  Senator Boyle, while not including himself in this group, said a vast number of people believe imprisonment for non-payment of debt is inherently wrong.  He suggested that we must come up with more appropriate legislation.  In recent months, we have been promised many times that this legislation will come before us shortly.</P>
        <P>The conflicting opinions in the contributions make one wonder about the wisdom of rushing this legislation through the House.  Benjamin Franklin said, &ldquo;Take time for all things; great haste makes great waste&rdquo;.  In this instance, this rushed legislation will provide for great waste, first, of hard-earned taxpayers&rsquo; money in unnecessarily jailing people while most of the time we have a 107% occupancy rate in our prisons.  Second, there is the waste of people&rsquo;s basic human dignity while we treat them as criminals when a far more appropriate sanction could be found with a little time and imagination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to support the proposed amendment, which is eminently sensible since it proposes a different regime as an alternative to the sanction of imprisonment being imposed upon a debtor.  Rather than imprisonment, it envisages an attachment of income or welfare order that would be made to address circumstances where somebody is unable or unwilling to pay debts.  It is in keeping with the recommendations of FLAC, as other speakers have mentioned.  In its report published on 6 July, FLAC said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The State should examine how effective non-penal remedies should be employed in order to enforce compliance with civil debt judgments.  Amongst the solutions considered should be attachment of earnings legislation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is what is proposed here.  The idea of attachment of earnings seems a much more sensible and practical method of enforcing compliance with debt orders.  It is sensible and practical because it ensures that money is paid as a result of the attachment, rather than putting people in prison with the consequence that they will be unable to earn any money or repay any debts.</P>
        <P>It is instructive to re-examine Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment for some of the background to the need for an amendment such as this.  She refers early on in her judgment to Article 11 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It states that &ldquo;No one shall be imprisoned merely because of their inability to fulfil a contractual obligation&rdquo;.  The principle is clear in international law that people should not be imprisoned merely because of their inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.  We are clearly in breach of that.  Although there are improvements to the current situation in this Bill, which were necessitated by the McCann judgment, the fundamental principle upon which the current system is premised &mdash; that people can be imprisoned for non-payment of debt &mdash; remains in place.  That is the fundamental objection we have to this Bill; it does not envisage any other method of enforcing compliance with contractual obligations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also worth noting page 18 of Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment, which refers to the personal background of Caroline McCann, the applicant in the case.  She was described in the judgment as being a single woman in her mid-30s, with two children &mdash; boys of 14 and ten &mdash; who lives with her mother in council housing.  She was one of nine children who left school at 14.  The judge referred to her literacy as being poor.  She was unemployed and owed &euro;18,000 to the credit union.  She had a history of alcohol abuse and psychiatric illness.  This was the woman whom, prior to her brave challenge, the system would have imprisoned for a month with no consequent improvement in her ability to pay the debt owed to the credit union.  Senator Regan has already read out the judge&rsquo;s comment as to the complete pointlessness of imprisoning <Col N="812"/>somebody in Caroline McCann&rsquo;s situation.  That sort of situation would be fairly standard for many of those who come before the courts as debtors, or people who are brought before them and ultimately subjected to a committal order without having engaged in the process.  FLAC has described the links between ill health and literacy in terms of building up debt.  We must be mindful of those facts and also mindful of the personal backgrounds of the debtors we are speaking about.</P>
        <P>We need to examine other methods of enforcing such orders.  The method proposed by Senator Regan should commend itself to the Minister of State as being a far preferable, more practical and more humane approach to securing compliance with court orders.  This amendment in its complexity and in the different issues it seeks to address, deserves more time than we have here.  It deserves a gap between Second and Committee Stages so that we might all have more opportunity to look at it in more detail and reflect on how it relates to the Laffoy judgment.  In particular, the Bill deserves more time from the Minister of State.  I fail to see how it is possible to give it the consideration it deserves in the truncated time allowed, which is subject to a guillotine.  It is a shame, given the real situations facing people like Caroline McCann, who will be affected by this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  In particular, I echo what Senator Bacik said about the detail and care that has gone into drafting this amendment.  It cannot be said that Opposition parties have not taken care with the details of the alternatives to imprisonment for non-payment of debts that are being brought forward.  Rather than simple debating points, great clarity, care and substance have gone into this proposal and others that have emanated from this side of the House.  Although I am waiting to hear it, I cannot see what objection can be made to this amendment.  Even speakers on the Government side have acknowledged the necessity and importance of alternatives to imprisonment being in place for non-payment of debts.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify that I was not disagreeing earlier with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s support for the exercise of compassion by District Court judges.  However, it is no longer enough for us to rely on that as a means of resolving such complex, delicate and difficult issues.  It should not be left to District Court judges to determine whether a matter should be put back for another two or three weeks, adjourned to the autumn or assessed by a judge as to whether somebody will pay up at some point.  It should not be left to him or her to make that determination.</P>
        <P>It has been said so many times by the Supreme Court and the High Court that the Oireachtas is here to legislate.  It is for the Oireachtas to bring forward proposals on how these matters should be dealt with.  They ought not be left to the discretion, or compassion where it exists, of the District Court.  They should be clarified in law by the Oireachtas.  For those reasons I strongly support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  It is a practical and clear proposal which would form the basis for an alternative to imprisonment in many cases.  We are familiar with attachment of earnings orders in other areas.  We know that attachment orders can be made in family law proceedings.  We are familiar with how they can be introduced and what role they can play from many comparable cases.</P>
        <P>I await with some interest the basis on which the Minister of State will be rejecting this amendment, as that is what I anticipate he will do.  It is a pity, because care and attention has clearly gone into this aspect of the matter.  It should not be rejected in the manner in which I anticipate it will, although I may be proven wrong.  I support the amendment and endorse what has been said by my colleagues about it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am in a difficult situation on this side of the House.  As a young lad, my father often told me that &ldquo;those who are bound must obey, and those who aren&rsquo;t can run away&rdquo;.  I am probably under the cosh of the Whip, unless the Minister of State has a change of heart.  If he has such a change of heart, I will not oppose it.</P>
        <P>Credit must be given to Senator Regan for the very fine detailed amendment he tabled, and there is much merit to it.  I also think the learned District Court judge was wrong in making that decision in the case in question.  Most other District Court judges I know would not have made that decision, ach sin sc&eacute;al eile.  We are where we are, and the High Court has made its decision.  When I spoke this morning about the decision being appealed to the Supreme Court, it was not on the basis that I felt the decision was wrong, but because I thought we could get to the end of the constitutional road on the issue involved.</P>
        <P>I would love to see a situation arise so that committal for non-payment of debts could be abolished, and I have 15 years of experience advocating in front of District Court judges on this.  Senator Cannon spoke about banks and those institutions that were hoisting money on us a few years ago.  The wheel has turned.  I remember when I did my law degree, my father had died and there was not much money at home, so I went to the bank with my mother for &pound;100 to come to Dublin and do some more exams.  The bank manager said he would give me the money, but he wanted the deeds of the farm in exchange.  It was a small, mountainous farm, but it was only &pound;100 and how things have changed since 1975.  Only two years ago, money was being thrown at people who were scarcely 19.  I have no sympathy for the banks in that respect, but I do have sympathy in extreme cases.</P>
        <P>I came across a situation where a woman with five children was forced to leave her family home.  She left due to fear and intimidation, and she was thwarted by her ex-husband every which way.  She was not entitled to a council house because she was technically the joint owner of a property.  She was unable to get maintenance because he gave up his day job and decided to do something where he was earning cash which could not be proved.  There are people who would exploit things if the threat of a prison sentence, as a very last resort, was not hanging over them.  I am not saying Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment does not suggest that either.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to see a good debate in this House on various issues.  It is probably wrong to rush this legislation through in the way that it has been ordered, although I was not here for the Order of Business.  When an initial judgment has been granted in the District Court to a creditor, that judgment is still valid whether we pass this Bill this week or next week, or even next September.  The judgment will not lapse because the Statute of Limitations does not run against judgments.  This Bill could have been dealt with better if there was a more prolonged debate on it.  I know the sincerity of the Senators.  I may be voting against them in a minute, but I understand where they are coming from.  There are valid points being made, but there is not enough time for the Minister of State or his officials to take them on board and put clear water between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It would have been better if we had that time, but we are where we are and unfortunately I find myself somewhat bound.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I could not agree more with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  He has made quite a valid point in saying we have insufficient time to debate such legislation.  He speaks about putting some clear water between Second Stage and Committee Stage, while Senator Alex White earlier asked for breathing space.  This is exactly what we need in discussing this Bill and I cannot understand why the Leader has adopted a position where he is trying to ram it and other Bills through the House this week.  There is more than enough time to deal with these matters and I cannot understand why that position is being adopted today.</P>
        <P>I support the amendment so ably proposed by Senator Regan.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes to amend section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.  The aim of that appears to <Col N="814"/>be to ensure a debtor will be obliged or strongly encouraged to attend a court.  This is in direct contrast to the current situation, where it would appear that only one in five debtors take part in debt enforcement proceedings at all.</P>
        <P>Section 2 contains a full revision of the existing section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 and also proposes to insert a new section 6A into the existing Act.  It would be helpful if section 6(2) included a clear statement that the debtor may seek a variation of the existing instalment order at the hearing which he or she is required to attend.  This is the position of FLAC, and it is very reasonable.  The vast majority of debtors acknowledge their debt obligations but they should not face the additional pressure of imprisonment for failure to reply to an instalment order.</P>
        <P>Nearly 2,000 people are sent to prison every year for failure to pay fines or debts, an alarming figure.  There should be an enforcement order for these items, as is stated in the amendment.  I look forward to the reply of the Minister of State and I hope he will accept the amendment proposed by my colleague.  We all know there is chronic overcrowding in many prisons.  There are 3,853 prisoners in custody compared to a bed capacity of 3,642.  This represents an occupancy level of up to 106%, which is crazy, yet we are still sending people to prison who owe small debts.  This is absolutely ludicrous.</P>
        <P>I fully support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  I look to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on this proposal, which I hope will be favourable.  Much thought has been put into it.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan stated there are some very valid points in it.  If it is not accepted in full, perhaps the Minister of State might propose an amendment himself on Report Stage to encompass some parts of this amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister was not given the opportunity to reply on Second Stage, we have had to wait for information until now that we could have received at that time.  In the meantime, I would like to ask the Minister of State a few extra questions in support of this amendment, which aims to prevent people from being sent to prison for minor reasons.  That is the main thing.  It does not apply to those who have no intention of ever paying their debts.  When this legislation was being drafted, what kind of information was acquired about those who are sent to prison in these circumstances?  What amounts of money are people being imprisoned for not paying?  Has any research been done into those who are jailed?  Are they just unfortunate?  Did they lose their jobs, for example?  Do they no longer have the ability to earn an income?  How did they find themselves in the stressful situation of having to go to court?  Are they the kind of people who, in normal circumstances, would try to pay their debts?  Alternatively, are they serial offenders?  Do they have a history of chancing their arm and not paying their debts?  Do they tend to break the law and get into all kinds of trouble?  The outcomes for the two different groups would be very different.  It would be almost wrong to jail people who find themselves in this position by accident, as opposed to those whose behaviour it is much more difficult to change.  There are other ways of getting the money back from people who have some assets or a steady income from any source, such as a social welfare payment or a cheque from an employer.  Putting people in prison can only be considered as the most expensive way for the State to collect its debts.</P>
        <P>The fact that just one in five people turns up when summoned to court in these circumstances should not automatically be seen as an indication that four in five people choose to throw caution to the wind.  People might not attend for a range of reasons.  They might feel shame because the District Court sits in their own communities, they might not understand what is asked of them or they might decide to bury their heads in the sand.  Many people might not attend because they suffer from depression or anxiety, which might have been the cause of <Col N="815"/>their huge debts in the first instance.  There are many circumstances that result in people not going to court.  When they were drawing up this Bill, the Minister of State and his officials should have gathered information from the Courts Service, in the interests of ensuring the legislation is useful.  To be honest, the manner in which we have operated for over 300 years cannot be said to have worked effectively, given that we are still trying to amend it.  We need to examine who is being jailed and why, with specific reference to the amounts concerned.</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned that the Law Reform Commission is considering this whole area.  While I accept that a jail sentence represents the only way forward for a small minority of people, I suggest that the commission should examine whether another option should be pursued in the majority of cases.  This issue relates to what I said about the issue of maintenance on Second Stage.  Some people do not apply to the courts for maintenance because they know it can lead to difficulties even if the application is successful.  If a person&rsquo;s estranged partner decides to ignore a court order for payment, or to be extremely difficult when the time comes to hand over the money, the amount of maintenance that is not paid to the person will nevertheless be considered as part of his or her income when he or she goes looking for social welfare assistance.  Such people often decide not to bother going to the courts.  The State does not take too much interest in such matters.  The result of the State&rsquo;s failure to put in place a means of chasing people who should be making maintenance payments is that it has to make those payments, in the form of social welfare payments, instead.  I do not think the Department of Social and Family Affairs makes any great effort to ensure maintenance payments are made.  The Minister of State needs to outline his views on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we talk about these matters, we should also reflect on the broader picture around us.  Banks and lending agencies are invariably involved in most of the cases that result in people being jailed.  As far as we are aware, no bank executives or managers of any great consequence have faced any investigation of any significance that could result in them facing criminal prosecution over the past 12 months.  In the United States, by contrast, Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford, who perpetrated frauds worth many billions of dollars, were arrested, investigated and brought before the courts.  It is clear that they were well connected and had plenty of friends.  Many people, right down the line, who dealt with millions and hundreds of thousands of dollars have been investigated in the US.  To the best of my knowledge, no one of any consequence has been investigated by the Garda fraud squad and no prosecutions have been brought by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  We are familiar with the case of a chief executive officer of a bank who gave himself a loan of &euro;87 million.  Members have spoken about the &ldquo;golden ten&rdquo; in Anglo Irish Bank, for whom loans in excess of &euro;300 million were arranged by the bank.  The terms of the loans were changed so that the people in question would not be responsible for having to repay them.  Although a number of similar cases have emerged throughout our financial system, no prosecutions have been brought.</P>
        <P>It is almost laughable that we are being asked to support legislation that will jail people for the sake of &euro;50, at a time when people are able to avoid repaying &euro;300 million by changing terms and conditions with their friendly bank managers.  The Government has made no effort to restore this country&rsquo;s credibility.  In some respects, it is happy to see Ireland being painted as a semi-corrupt banana republic, where anything goes as long as one is big enough and has sufficient connections.  That is another issue that should be dealt with before any Minister or Minister of State comes in here to talk about jailing people on the basis of minor infringements involving small amounts of money.  The Government should address the fact that neither the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement nor the Garda fraud squad seems to have the resources and legislative back-up &mdash; I hope they have the ability &mdash; to help to restore the credibility of the Irish financial services sector following the frenzy of poor lending and other <Col N="816"/>practices of the last four or five years.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to some of the issues I have raised if he gets an opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the detailed and specific amendment that has been tabled by Senator Regan.  As I said in my opening speech, at this time the Government has limited the Bill before the House to the introduction of the protections and safeguards that were identified by the High Court in the McCann case.  The Government intends to return to this subject, with the benefit of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s review, at a future stage.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the views of Senators who have suggested that deeper reforms are necessary.  I believe the rigorous work that has been undertaken by the commission will greatly assist us in striking the balance that is necessary in these matters.  I appreciate the concern that has been expressed about the speed with which this Bill is being introduced.  I remind the House that the High Court judgment I have mentioned, which drew our attention to the specific gap this legislation is designed to fill, was issued less than three weeks ago.</P>
        <P>Many Senators asked questions about the imprisonment of people for the non-payment of debt.  While nobody wants that to happen, it is important that we maintain a balance in this legislation between the rights of creditors and debtors.  The Law Reform Commission, which is reviewing this matter, as I said, will issue its recommendations in due course.  All of its recommendations will be considered by the Minister.  A couple of Senators suggested this Bill does not provide for an alternative to imprisonment.  They claimed the only option that will be available will be to throw people into jail, but that is not true.  The specific aim of this legislation is to ensure that people who cannot afford to pay their debts will not be subject to imprisonment.  Those who can afford to pay but simply choose not to, however, will continue to face imprisonment.  It is important that this Bill allows imprisonment to continue to be seen as a threat in such circumstances.  It is not the first option, by any means.  Specific alternatives, including mediation and variations to instalment plans, are provided for in this Bill.  We have spoken about the role of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  The legislation is specific in that regard.  It is to deal with one narrow issue that has changed in the past three weeks.</P>
        <P>On the question of attachments, the substantive basis of the amendment, the whole area of attachments to earnings and to social welfare had been considered by the Government both in this Bill and in the Fines Bill, which is before the Houses.  The conclusion, however, was that it would be problematic and difficult to operate fairly.  The amendment also acknowledges that it would be necessary to include attachments to social welfare payments and this might not be the best time to try to do that.  There would also be practical difficulties that would need to be overcome where persons in temporary employment are concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position in family law is that attachment is a well-established practice.  It may be possible to formulate another model closely along those lines.  Specifically, Senator Regan referred to the figures in my opening statement to the effect that there were 4,300 applications to the District Court for enforcement orders in the first six months of the year, and in the same period 186 people were imprisoned.  It is worth nothing, however, that approximately half of those imprisoned at any time related to maintenance debtors where this option of attachment exists already.  Therefore, it is far from being a panacea.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to the report from FLAC which says:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The State should examine how effective non-penal remedies should be employed to enforce compliance with civil debt judgments.  Among the solutions considered should be attachment of earnings legislation.</P><Col N="817"/>
        <P FLI="0">The Senator stopped there but the next line says: &ldquo;However, any such measure must be regarded as a last resort.&rdquo;  It is important we look at it in that context.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, the Law Reform Commission will be reporting and it has the opportunity to examine this among other issues in the context of non-judicial methods of dealing with debt enforcement.  The Government would prefer to await that report before dealing specifically with the area of attachments.  The purpose of the legislation, as brought before the Seanad today, is specifically to remedy the situation following the High Court case in the middle of June.  In that regard I will not be accepting the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation does not remedy the issues raised by Ms Justice Laffoy in her judgment.  I will read what I consider to be, perhaps, the most relevant part in relation to this very issue of liberty and imprisonment. It is at page 82 of the judgment:</P>
        <P LI="1">The application of elements of the test to section 6 illustrates that it is disproportionate interference with the constitutionally protected right to liberty for the following reasons:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) The objective of imprisoning a debtor for failure to comply with an instalment order is to procure the discharge of arrears of instalments.  A statutory procedure under which a debtor, unable to discharge the arrears, is imprisoned because of the absence therein of procedures (including procedures which give effect to the debtor&rsquo;s right to fair procedures under the Constitution, which ensures that the judge ascertains that the debtor is unable to discharge the arrears), cannot be said to be rationally connected with the objective.  Such a procedure is arbitrary, unfair and not based on rational considerations.  It is an unreasonable and unnecessary interference with the debtor&rsquo;s right to personal liberty [That, to a certain extent, has been remedied in the Bill].</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) In circumstances where a debtor has some resources to meet the debt, a statutory scheme which does not require the creditor to seek redress by attaching those resources does not impair the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as little as possible.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is proportionality, namely, interfering with the right to liberty as little as possible.  The judge is saying expressly in the judgment that not providing for a statutory scheme which does not require the creditor to seek redress by attaching those resources is a disproportionate interference.  It is similarly the case with the failure to impose on the creditor pursuing an application for an order for arrest and imprisonment the obligation to go through an Order 46B-type process, including personal services, etc.  However, it is a fundamental point where the legislation is being rushed and therefore does not deal with one of the crucial findings of the judgment that it runs the risk of being struck down again by the High Court on constitutional grounds for the very reason that it does not provide for the type of provisions included in the amendment we have tabled.</P>
        <P>On that issue of proportionality, the new section 6(7) as inserted by section 2 of the Bill provides for the remedying all of the procedural issues concerning  proper notice for a debtor and so on, with the court being able to assess the means of the person.  It provides under section 6(7) that on hearing the creditor and such evidence, &ldquo;if any, as they may respectively adduce, a judge may, if he or she is satisfied that the debtor has failed to comply with the instalment order . . . treat the proceeding on the summons as an application under section 5 for a variation of the instalment order.  Section 6(7)(<i>b</i>) provides for resolution by mediation and section 6(7)(<i>c</i>) provides for imprisonment, albeit with a stay of three months.  Section 6(7)(<i>d</i>) provides for arrest and imprisonment.  What is missing, and what the High Court judge expressly laid out in her judgement, is the requirement to ensure the proportionality of the interference with the individual&rsquo;s right to liberty, namely, the attachment of earnings procedure.</P><Col N="818"/>
        <P>The Minister of State has said it would be administratively difficult or impractical at this point to provide for such a procedure.  However, in the next breath he said this procedure is well established in the family law area.  I do not see the administrative difficulty of including this provision in this Bill which I believe is necessitated by the judgment of the High Court.</P>
        <P>Again, on the figures referred to by the Minister of State in his opening statement of 4,300 applications for enforcement orders to the District Court  and 186 people imprisoned so far this year as against 276 for the whole of last year and 201 the year before, the trend is rising as indicated by the significant increase signalled by the figure of 186 for the first half of this year.  In the current economic circumstances, it is self-evident this situation is going to get worse if the procedures to provide for the imprisonment of people who do not pay their debts, which procedures are continued in this Bill, are not amended.  The numbers will escalate with more people being imprisoned.</P>
        <P>The reality, however, is that the prisons are full.  I understand it costs almost &euro;2,000 a week to keep one prisoner in jail.  In 2008 the average civil debtor spent 21 days in prison at a cost of &euro;6,000 to the State.  On release the debtor still owes his or her debt.  In some cases the cost to the State of imprisonment far outweighs the debt owed in the first place.  There is chronic overcrowding, with 3,853 in custody compared with a bed capacity of 3,642, which represents an occupancy level of 106% according to Government figures.  The overcrowding in our prisons creates all sorts of problems.  I do not understand why the Minister is not more accommodating when a procedure is proposed and where the High Court has highlighted the problems that exist in this type of draconian measure, which is disproportionate to the &ldquo;offence&rdquo;.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are set against accommodating any new ideas that could improve this situation.  It is very regrettable.</P>
        <P>There is a necessity for the Minister to rethink this.  There is a legal and constitutional obligation on him.  This is the same Minister who insists on having a blasphemy offence because it is required by the Constitution.  Here, a High Court judge, in a judgment which is not being appealed, has set out in express terms the constitutional problems with the existing legislation.  One of those problems, attachment of resources, which is the language used in the judgment, is not being addressed in the Bill.  Yet the Minister is not prepared to countenance any amendment to that legislation.  It is most regrettable and unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the Minister&rsquo;s reply and his earlier speech, we have not gone any way towards remedying the Laffoy judgment, as Senator Regan said.  Senator Regan quoted from the judgment, which is cogent and makes clear that there is a flaw in this Bill.  I am not a law person but I would not be surprised if we were back here when it is found that the Bill is unconstitutional.  FLAC said the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Bill confines itself to remedying the constitutional difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech rightly refers to the creditor.  We should acknowledge that the creditor deserves reference here but the Minister is forgetting that the debtor is here for a reason and is an individual.  This is about people falling into debt, bad provision and people being unable to manage money or falling into difficulty financially for whatever reason.  Yesterday I had in my office a recovering alcoholic who had a gambling problem and was in debt with the local credit union.  The amendment allows for recompense to be paid to the credit union in the case of what Senator Regan proposes.</P>
        <P>In terms of the attachment of income orders, the amendment is a very manageable and precise way of allowing people in debt to pay back money.  The amendment adds a section, 8(2)(<i>b</i>), which specifies that an attachment of earnings order &ldquo;shall operate as a direction to <Col N="819"/>that person to make, at such intervals as may be specified in the order, deductions of specified amounts&rdquo;.  The amendment takes on board the person&rsquo;s ability to repay.</P>
        <P>I am a little concerned, as Senator Alex White said, and Senator Regan just referred to, about rushed legislation.  I do not understand why we cannot take our time today and why we run the risk of the Bill being unconstitutional.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, want to preside over this?  I do not think he does.  I do not think the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, wants to, but that is what he is trying to do.  The Fine Gael amendment seeks to rectify the situation by inserting the clause on failure to comply with the order.  The second part of the amendment deals with compliance with attachment of earnings orders.  It is very clear that there is an obligation on the debtor to repay.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State mentioned that in this economic climate the attachment of a court order or income order would be the wrong way to go, I laughed, with respect.  At this moment his Cabinet colleagues are about to, if they have not already done so, sit down at the Cabinet table to discuss taxing social welfare.  They are talking about taxing the most vulnerable people in society.  The Government has already taxed the over-70s, with the removal of the medical card and it is purported to be about to unleash a massive attack on the women of Ireland by taxing child benefit, yet we are talking about putting people in jail.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan gave figures.  I take issue with the fact that the Minister said that in the first six months of this year there were 4,300 applications for enforcement orders but in the same period only 186 people were imprisoned.  The figures in my mind do not justify what the Minister is trying to achieve in the Bill, given the cost of imprisonment.  In the Government&rsquo;s Bill the entitlement to free legal aid under section 6A is a further cost on the State.  If I am in debt I could cost the State a fortune, whereas Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment is a fool-proof way of getting money back.  I am not sure there is joined-up thinking.</P>
        <P>I commented on how credit unions do their business.  The Acting Chairman, Senator Boyle, was involved in the credit union movement in his area of Turner&rsquo;s Cross.  Credit unions are able and willing to meet people.  There is a provision for bad debt in all credit unions and banking institutions, and that is fair enough, but we should be talking about helping people to repay.  As I said, I fully subscribe to the notion that one must have a sanction, but can the Minister justify to me that imprisonment is the way forward?</P>
        <P>I was taken by the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s very measured contribution.  I hoped his colleagues would listen to him because it was a very fine contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chairman cannot contribute to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that and I am not trying to bait the Chairman.  The amendment would take cognisance of the earnings a person may receive.  There is an obligation on the debtor to sign up to and participate in the repayment.  In Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment on the statement of earnings, there is a timeline, there are specified particulars on earnings and projected earnings regarding his or her resources and needs and it enables the debtor to be identified by present and future employers.</P>
        <P>That leads me to my final point.  I am a little concerned as to why there is no reference in the Bill to the money advice and budgeting service, MABS.  In the Minister&rsquo;s Department he works with disadvantaged communities and groups, and MABS offers people a way of restructuring and repaying, and, more important, it allows people the independence to restructure what they owe.  From talking to people employed in MABS, I know they are struggling to respond to the demand for their service.  That means we have a difficulty as a society with people being able to repay their loans or debts.</P><Col N="820"/>
        <P>The amendment seeks the removal of the provision that imposes a prison sentence and calls for the facilitation of repayments by debtors.  Why does the Bill not provide for improving access to advice and assistance for people in debt?  Why can we not allow them to make staged repayments?  Ultimately the important point must be that our creditors are entitled to be repaid.  As Senator Regan rightly said, the debt still stands after imprisonment.  While the Bill is necessary, it represents a missed opportunity.  I am not a legally minded person, I am only a person who served on the supervisory committee of a credit union and as a politician I deal with people every day.  In my previous role as a supervisor, I met people who were in debt.  They struggled and were embarrassed.  Senator Boyle spoke about historical practice and the different types of prisons we had.  Do we want to go back to that stage again where we put Jerry Buttimer, John Curran or Diarmuid Wilson into jail because they have not paid their debts?  Maybe we should set up the barricades and stocks in Mountjoy Square and start to throw eggs at people to embarrass them as the fellow in Monaghan did a few months ago with the debts he owed.</P>

I am not necessarily sure that the Bill will do that.  I believe it is a missed opportunity.</P>

He also mentioned difficulties with social welfare payments in trying to get instalment plans.  Are those difficulties administrative difficulties regarding social welfare?  Are there also legal difficulties with regard to instalment plans?  I do not have Senator Regan&rsquo;s level of skill in interpreting the High Court judgment.  He seems to be suggesting that the process goes from discussion and mediation to jail.  It seems to break with the High Court judgment.  If that is the case, the legislation as it stands could well fail a Supreme Court test.  What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s interpretation of the High Court judgment regarding not having instalments?</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also disappointed at the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  It is unfortunate that he is not willing to contemplate some form of attachment of earnings or welfare option within the Bill, given that it purports to improve the situation as far as debtors are concerned and to ensure no further breach of the Constitution in the way the court will deal with debtors.  Having read Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment, she clearly identifies the flaws in the current procedure and points out on page 69 and again on page 82 a list of the defects and flaws in the current procedure.  We clearly need some mechanism that would give a different sanction of last resort for a debtor against whom enforcement proceedings have been taken.  Some alternative to imprisonment should be employed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State responded to me in particular by referring to paragraph 5.2 of the recommendations of the FLAC report.  I had read the first part of those which stated &ldquo;Amongst the solutions considered should be attachment of earnings legislation.&rdquo;  The Minister of State said that the next line reads &ldquo;However, any such measure must be regarded as a last resort.&rdquo;  That is correct.  FLAC has suggested that it should be the last resort, in a sense, to replace imprisonment as the last resort mechanism.  The start of paragraph 5.2 states: &ldquo;The State should examine how effective, non-penal remedies should be employed in order to enforce compliance with civil debt judgments.&rdquo;  It also states any such attachment of earnings mechanism &ldquo;must <Col N="821"/>also be practical and workable and must ensure that debtors are protected from adverse outcomes such as excessive deductions, multiple orders and loss of employment.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Clearly there is a degree of complexity.  It would be difficult to operate a scheme without sufficient safeguards to ensure debtors are protected.  In his proposal, Senator Regan has taken great care to ensure that debtors would be protected in this way.  In particular I note that the provision that there should be a protected welfare rate below which the debtor&rsquo;s income should not sink even where an attachment of welfare order has been made.  An effort has been made to ensure those requirements have been met.</P>
        <P>The point FLAC is making is contained in the preceding paragraph, 5.1, which states: &ldquo;The sanction of imprisonment should be removed immediately from the Instalment Order procedure for those who are unable to pay their debts.&rdquo;  That is its starting point in a chapter headed &ldquo;Removal of imprisonment as an option in debt cases.&rdquo;  It clearly recommends that the sanction of imprisonment should be removed.  I have already referred to Article 11 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which similarly provides that there should not be the imprisonment of persons simply for inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.  That should be our starting point, from which we should be examining reform of the procedures and not simply putting this sticking plaster on a gaping wound.  This is really a sticking plaster that is shoring up the sanction of imprisonment by ensuring we have minimal safeguards in place.  It does not take account of any of the more comprehensive safeguards that could be adopted.  It does not remedy, for example, one of the things FLAC identified as a real problem for people, which is that these proceedings are taken in public in the local District Court.  There is no provision in the Bill as drafted to remedy many of the defects with the current procedure.  A provision such as an attachment of earnings mechanism should have been introduced as a minimum to ensure that we comply with our international obligations and no longer imprison people for non-payment of debts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the startling point made by Senator Regan.  It is not a point that can simply be grouped with all the other various points made on this side of the House and set aside by the Minister of State on the basis that this would be dealt with more comprehensively in subsequent legislation.  I will only make this point because very often when we make five, six or seven points, the one point gets missed.  I respectfully say to the Minister of State that Senator Regan&rsquo;s point absolutely requires clarity as to what the Attorney General is saying regarding this legislation purportedly dealing with the McCann case.  The Bill definitely addresses the issue in the McCann case to do with distinguishing between ability to pay and mere refusal to pay.  That is the biggest issue in the McCann judgment and I accept that it is addressed in the Bill.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>However, the judge grouped her reasons for finding that there was a disproportionate interference with the constitutionally protected right to liberty into two sections, A and B, as Senator Regan has said.  Under group A she deals with the question of the ability to pay versus wilful refusal, which I accept the Bill addresses.  Under group B, outlining why the old section was a disproportionate interference with the constitutionally protected right to liberty, she stated: &ldquo;In circumstances where a debtor has some resources to meet a debt a statutory scheme, which does not require the creditor to seek redress by attaching those resources, does not impair the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as little as possible.&rdquo;  In other words &ldquo;as little as it should&rdquo;, which would be a happier way of stating that.</P>
        <P>It is quite clear that whereas the Bill as drafted addresses the core of the Laffoy judgment, it does not address the aspect that relates to the judge pointing to a disproportionate interference with constitutionally protected right to liberty for the debtor in circumstances where there is not a basis for attaching the resources of somebody who has resources, in other words, <Col N="822"/>a debtor who has resources.  A scheme needs to be put in place to provide for the attaching of such resources to right the situation.  The Minister of State is not doing that in this Bill.  There is a gap in this respect.  I ask him to deal directly with this unanswerable point that has been made in respect of what the Laffoy judgment means.  It is not being addressed in this legislation.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will confine my comments as directly and specifically as possible to many of the points raised and will deal with them in no particular order.  I will conclude by responding to the key point raised by Senators Regan and Alex White.</P>
        <P>In regard to the FLAC report, the sanction of imprisonment should be removed immediately from the instalment order procedure for those who are unable to pay their bills.  I contend that the aim of the Bill is to ensure that people who cannot afford to pay will not be subject to imprisonment.  That is my contention and the Government&rsquo;s perspective, regardless of whether the Senators agree with it.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that this is a relatively small Bill to address specifically the issues that arose in the McCann case in the High Court.  I appreciate a number of other issues were raised.  I said that the Law Reform Commission is preparing a report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s position that this report will be considered in full.  We understand it will deal with a range of issues, including non-judicial methods of dealing with debt enforcement.  The Government has indicated it will await that report.</P>
        <P>One or two Senators referred to imprisonment and I want to clarify the position.  There is a perception that one of the reasons there is overcrowding in our prisons is that they are cluttered with debt and fine defaulters, but that perception is false.  At any one time the number of such persons held in custody is only a fraction of the overall prison population and generally at any one time the number is in single figures.  It is important to put that in the correct context.</P>
        <P>The role of MABS was raised.  While it is not mentioned specifically in legislation, I referred to it in my opening address.  I am aware that the impact of the legislation is being communicated to MABS, which I acknowledge has a key role to play and it does so significantly.</P>
        <P>The issue of a person with limited resources and goods and essentially the issue of proportionality was raised.  Those with resources are probably dealt with in various ways, whether by way of a variation to the instalment order or in terms of MABS and so forth.  Even in this section where there is reference to an imprisonment order, there is the option of deferral for a range of reasons.</P>
        <P>The other aspect is separate, namely a person who might have finance and cash.  That person could be dealt with by way of an instalment order or an amended instalment order.</P>
        <P>I refer specifically to the subsection (8)(<i>b</i>) which refers to the option to seize goods.  I am informed that the Attorney General has considered this question specifically and advised that subsection (8)(<i>b</i>) is sufficiently a proportional approach.</P>
        <P>The area of attachment orders has merit and should be considered further.  I do not believe it is the panacea people might expect it to be.  I reiterate that it is worth noting that approximately half of those imprisoned at any given time relate to maintenance debtors, where the option of an attachment is already available.  This aspect requires further consideration.  The area of attachment in particular will be considered in the context of the findings of the Law Reform Commission report as well as other non-judicial methods of dealing with debt enforcement.</P>

	<P>Does the Minister of State appreciate that if we had been allowed sufficient time, we could have dealt with this attachment procedure in this Bill and would not have to wait for it to be dealt with in further legislation?</P><Col N="823"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White made the point, as have I, that the language used by Ms Justice Laffoy in her judgment is quite clear.  There is no ambiguity in the language.  She held that in circumstances in which a debtor has some resources to meet the debt a statutory scheme which does not require the creditor to seek redress by attaching those resources does not impair the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as little as possible.  There is a proportionality issue involved.  That is the expressed language used.  I have read out the language used and Senator White has read out an excerpt from the judgment.</P>
        <P>The point originally made by the plaintiff in the McCann case was that rather than ploughing ahead for committal, it would have made more sense to attempt to attach the debtor&rsquo;s resources, which were social welfare payments, thereby rendering the application for committal a genuine last resort, something required by the application of the doctrine of proportionality to the constitutional right to liberty.</P>
        <P>An attempt to address this has been made in the Bill, to which the Minister of State referred, in the new section 6(8)(<i>b</i>).  Subsection (8) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A judge shall not make an order under [the] subsection [in regard to imprisonment] unless he or she is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence presented, that the creditor has established...(<i>b</i>) the debtor has no goods which could taken in execution under any process of the court by which the judgement, order or decree for the debt was given.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That does not deal with the issue.  The reference to &ldquo;no goods&rdquo; is a reference in one way to that <i>fieri facia</i>  procedure, whereby a sheriff returns a warrant of execution marked &ldquo;no goods&rdquo;.  It is a specific procedure.  In her judgment Ms Justice Laffoy referred specifically to attachment of monetary resources.  The new section 6(8)(<i>b</i>) does not deal with that.  It does not involve an attachment of monetary resources or income such as social welfare payments or employment income.  It does not seek to envisage a garnishee type procedure where payments are falling due to the debtor and there can be an attachment.  Given that this is what was suggested by the plaintiff in the McCann case and given that it was certainly what Ms Justice Laffoy had in mind and expressly set out in her judgment, this is the real difficulty in terms of the drafting of the Bill.</P>
        </Speaker><P Just="Left"><i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present,</i></P>
      
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has not dealt with the issue satisfactorily.  To refer to section 6(8)(<i>b</i>), which relates to the debtor having no goods that could discharge the debt, does not address Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s ruling on what, in effect, is a constitutional requirement if the provision for any order of imprisonment ultimately for failure to pay a debt is to be constitutionally valid.  The Bill is fundamentally flawed in that regard.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the Money Advice and Budgetary Service, MABS.  In the current, dismal economic situation one will have more actions taken for the recovery of debt.  MABS statistics prove that.  It is dealing with 19,000 customers.  The number of calls to its helpline has increased by 53% in the first quarter of this year compared to the last quarter of 2008.  MABS is struggling to respond to the demands for its service.  Its ability to assist people in debt is handicapped by its inability to act as a negotiator with lenders.  MABS should be properly resourced to deal with the increase in demand for its services, which should be expanded into debt settlement and mortgage renegotiation, which would lead to a more efficient system.</P>
        <P>Those types of measures are called for, rather than the draconian measures that are provided for in the legislation.  The approach we have suggested involving the attachment procedure would take less time and be less expensive for the taxpayer in terms of court time, prison time and Garda time.  By resourcing a body such as MABS to deal properly with the problems <Col N="824"/>encountered by people who are not always the best at managing their finances would assist in the whole process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also evident that the stakeholders in the system recognise that the debt collection system is inefficient.  The Irish Banking Federation has supported the calls from the FLAC and MABS for an overhaul of the enforcement system and the development of alternatives to imprisonment for non-payment of civil debt.  We support the recommendations contained in the study by FLAC.  They would be facilitated by the acceptance of the amendment in terms of the attachment of income and earnings as we have suggested in this amendment.</P>
        <P>I underline the fact that it is not a question of the economic circumstances or the inefficiency of the debt collection system.  What is fundamentally at stake is that the Government&rsquo;s intention in the Bill is to provide for a procedure that takes account of the Laffoy judgment in the McCann case.  The Bill fails to do that in a fundamental respect.  Nothing the Minister of State has said, invoking the advices that have been given or otherwise, deals precisely with that fundamental flaw.  It will be exposed, if not in these Houses, ultimately in the courts if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not have regard to what is being said in this House on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak again on this point because it is very important.  Senators Regan and Alex White referred specifically to the passage in Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment which they say mandates the adoption of some form of attachment of earnings order.  I took the opportunity to read again the relevant passages in the judgment.  It is very clear that their analysis is correct.  At the bottom of page 80 of Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment she examines the question of whether section 6 breaches the guarantee of personal liberty in the Constitution in Article 40.4.  She says the core question is whether section 6 constitutes a disproportionate interference with the right to liberty.  That is straightforward.  She says one answers the question by applying the well established proportionality test first enunciated by Mr. Justice Costello in Heaney <i>v</i>. Ireland in 1994.  She quotes Mr. Justice Costello&rsquo;s statement that the means chosen must pass a proportionality test.  They must be rationally connected to the objective and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations.  In dealing with that she says it is reasonable and legitimate to have an effective statutory screening for enforcement of contractual obligations, including the payment of debt.</P>
        <P>It is the second means, as Senator Alex White said, that is so important.  Ms Justice Laffoy outlines that the means chosen must also impair the right to liberty as little as possible.  She goes on to say that unless the means chosen fulfil the proportionality test for the enforcement of contractual obligations such as debt they would be in breach of the Constitution.  On page 82 she goes on to say that the application of elements of the proportionality test to section 6 illustrates that it is a disproportionate interference with the constitutionally protected right to liberty for two reasons, (a) and (b).  As Senator Alex White outlined, (a) is the reason that is targeted in the legislation.  The Minister of State addressed that point.  Ms Justice Laffoy states that the judge must be able to ascertain whether the debtor is in fact unable to discharge arrears and that without safeguards to ensure debtors are not imprisoned simply because they are unable to pay arrears, the procedure is arbitrarily unfair, not based on rational considerations and is an unreasonable and unnecessary interference with the debtor&rsquo;s right to personal liberty.  It is paragraph (a) on page 82 of the judgment which this legislation seeks to address, a point with which we do not disagree.  However, as Senator Regan rightly pointed out, it is in respect of paragraph (b) that this legislation does not meet Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s clearly stated finding, namely, that section 6 as currently drafted disproportionately interferes with the right to liberty because where the debtor has some resources to meet the debt, a statutory scheme <Col N="825"/>which does not require the creditor to seek redress by attachment of those resources does not impair the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as little as possible.</P>
        <P>As Senator Alex White stated, the wording is a little unclear.  However, when one reads the judgment a number of times in the context of the judgment of Mr. Justice Costello in the Heaney case, it is clear that what Ms Justice Laffoy is saying is that one cannot breach a person&rsquo;s right to liberty without first exploring whether he or she has the resources to meet the debt through the putting in place of a scheme to ensure the resources can be attached.  Otherwise, one is breaching the persons right to liberty much more than the minimal allowed under the Constitution.  In other words, there is no procedure in the pre-existing section 6 or in the Minister of State&rsquo;s draft of the new section 6 for checking before one moves to imprison the debtor whether he or she has the resources to meet the debt and whether they can be attached.  That is the key problem with the current legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment seeks to address this by instituting another level of safeguard.  This safeguard is not in substitution for but in addition to the safeguards already in the Bill.  Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment clearly states that this is another way in which the current section 6 infringes the Constitution.  It is disproportionate because it does not allow for the attachment of resources where a debtor has resources to meet the debt.  We need to put in place a statutory scheme which requires the creditor to seek redress by first attaching those resources before encroaching upon a person&rsquo;s right to liberty.  I apologise if I am labouring the point but it is a point that can perhaps be missed on first reading Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment.  I had to read it a number of times.  I believe the interpretation Senators Regan and Alex White have given is correct, namely, unless there is in place a statutory scheme to ensure debtors with resources can have those resources attached to pay their debts, the debtors&rsquo; rights will be breached.  In other words, one is not breaching their right to liberty in a proportionate manner, rather it is disproportionate.  I hope that is somewhat clear.  I apologise for having gone over it for a number of times.  This is about proportionality.  To put it bluntly, one can imprison a person but only if one does so in a proportionate manner.  If one imprisons a person without first checking if he or she has resources that can be attached, then it is disproportionate to imprison him or her in the first instance.  I do not believe I can put the point any more clearly than that.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taken by the arguments made by my colleagues, Senators Regan, Alex White and Bacik.  I would have thought it was fundamental in a democracy such as ours that we would pay all due credence to the prompts, guidance and judgments of bodies such as those mentioned in this instance, namely, the Irish Bankers Federation and FLAC.</P>
        <P>As Senator Bacik said, this is about proportionality.  I would have thought this was a <i>sine qua non </i>in our system.  Sadly, in this instance the Government, for whatever reason, has not paid due attention to the Laffoy decision in the McCann case.  Where attachment of income is possible, that is the prudent course to embark upon.  What is the point of imprisoning a person and depriving them of income and ability to earn?  It serves no great purpose.</P>
        <P>Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s decision, which is at the nub of this amendment, states that in circumstances in which a debtor has some resources to meet the debt, a statutory scheme which does not require creditors to seek redress by attaching those resources does not impair the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as little as possible.  It would have made more sense to attempt to attach the debtor&rsquo;s resources such as social welfare payments thereby rendering the application for committal a last resort.  That is what imprisonment should be &mdash; a last resort.  This is required in the application of the doctrine of proportionality to the constitutional right to liberty.  These are fundamental points of great importance to us all.</P><Col N="826"/>
        <P>The judge is not entitled to make an order for committal unless he or she is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence established by the creditor, that the debtor has no goods which could be taken in execution under any process of the court by which the judgment order or decree for the debt was given.  The process arising out of this Bill does not involve an attachment of monetary resources such as social welfare payments or income from employment.  For example, it does not seem to envisage a garnishee-type procedure.  Given that this is what was suggested by the plaintiff in the McCann case and given that it was what Ms Justice Laffoy had in mind in her judgment, a difficulty arises, as adequately and more eloquently outlined by my colleagues given their qualifications.  This provision is fundamentally flawed and is the purpose of the amendment to this section of the Bill.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Typographical errors are more likely when Bills are rushed.  That is a lesson we can all learn.  There were typos in my amendment that were spotted by the Bills Office, despite the enormous pressure the staff there are under.  I am grateful to them that the version in front of us now is at least grammatically correct.</P>
        <P>I am also grateful that the Minister of State indicated that Report Stage would be taken tomorrow.  That was the first formal indication that Report Stage would not be taken today.  I welcome that.  It is important to all of us who are tabling amendments to improve the Bill.  We want sufficient time to consider the amendments.</P>
        <P>I say that as an introduction to this amendment which the Minister of State may consider overnight.  I tabled it in light of the comments by Ms Justice Laffoy in page 16 of her judgment when she refers to the current procedure and states that if the debtor is seen as a user, there is nothing user-friendly about the procedure of the documentation used in the procedure for the enforcement of court orders.  She then identifies specific defects in the procedure that could be remedied and this Bill is an attempt to do that.</P>
        <P>I have tabled this amendment, however, in an attempt to improve the procedure while the more general criticisms I have of maintaining imprisonment as a sanction stand.  If we are to introduce a Bill that contains the possibility of imprisonment for non-payment of debts, at least a better level of documentation should be provided.  I am guided in this by FLAC&rsquo;s briefing paper on the Bill where it suggests that more information should be given to the debtor at an earlier stage than provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 2 inserts a new section 6 into the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.  The new section 6 would provide for a summons to be issued by a District Court clerk where a debtor who is liable to pay a debt has defaulted.  That summons would contain details of the consequences of failure to comply with an instalment order, especially the possibility of imprisonment, under section 6(2)(<i>b</i>).  Under section 6(2)(<i>c</i>) it would state the debtor may be arrested if he or she fails to appear before the District Court as directed, and under section 6(2)(<i>d</i>) the summons would be served on the debtor by personal service.  We know the absence of requirement of personal service was one of the key defects identified by Ms Justice Laffoy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">FLAC has identified other defects that would persist even with the new section 6.  It claims it would be helpful if section 6(2) included a clear statement that the debtor may seek a variation of an existing instalment order at the hearing he or she is required to attend.  That is critical because, as FLAC has found, many debtors are not aware of the opportunity they would have at a hearing to vary an existing instalment order.  Although this is the law at present, FLAC has pointed out that many debtors are unaware of this.  As we know, fewer than 20% of debtors engage with the court at any stage during the enforcement process.  It is of particular importance that they would be informed of the possibility of making a variation to the instalment order.</P>
        <P>That is the first part of the amendment, to insert a new subsection to section 6(2) stating that the summons would provide to the debtor information in ordinary language in order that the debtor might seek a variation of an existing instalment order at the hearing he or she is required to attend.  That is important because it is likely that debtors faced with a summons of this sort will take an ostrich-like approach and hope that if they bury their heads in the sand, it will go away.  That approach is taken by many people to summonses for traffic offences and so on.  They hope they will just go away and they certainly do not want to turn up in court, <Col N="828"/>assuming in a fatalistic way that a certain procedure will run its course.  If they are not informed of the possibility of varying instalments, there is no way they can know of the possibility of variation.  There are many improvements that could be made to the procedure provided in section 6, including the possibility of variation at the hearing of the summons and later possibilities of variation, but there is not much point in making those improvements if debtors are unaware of them when they receive the summons.  It is vital they would be given that information in the summons.</P>
        <P>I have also suggested that when the summons is issued, the debtor should also be provided with information in ordinary language of the consequences of not appearing at any future hearing and the possibilities of variation being granted at those hearings.  It is not enough to say at section 6(2)(<i>b</i>) that a debtor should be informed of consequences of failure to comply with an instalment order and the possibility of imprisonment, because that sounds as if a person may be imprisoned once he has defaulted.  It does not give him the vital information that if he turns up in court, he may seek a variation and if he does not turn up, there is a greater likelihood, ultimately, of imprisonment.  It is important the possibility of seeking a variation is emphasised at that early stage.</P>
        <P>There is a provision later in section 6(5) that where a debtor is arrested and brought before a District Court, the judge shall explain to the debtor in ordinary language at that point about the entitlement to legal aid, that he must attend before the next hearing and the consequences.  I am anticipating that the Minister of State will say we have already provided for a mechanism to give the debtor that information but we should think of the likely situations of those who will be brought before the court.  Currently, if someone fails without reasonable excuse to appear before the court in answer to the summons, the creditor can apply to the judge and the judge may issue a warrant for the arrest of the debtor in the absence of the debtor and before the debtor has been informed in ordinary language under the procedure set out in section 6(5).</P>
        <P>FLAC has identified a flaw in the procedure in that the debtor may be arrested still under the new proposed section 6 without having been informed of the possibility that he may seek a variation and of the precise consequences of failure to appear at hearings.  The information provided for in section 6(2) in the summons is inadequate to give the debtor a full picture of the likely process he faces, especially the room he has to seek a variation of the instalment order, a critical factor for someone with a fatalistic acceptance of the consequences of inability to pay and consequent imprisonment.  It is important there is some light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
        <P>The issue of a warrant for the arrest of the debtor or, alternatively, the fixing of a new date for the hearing requires a hearing in open court and FLAC has suggested this is a problem for many debtors because it happens in the local District Court.  The warrant is issued for the arrest and will be enforced by the Garda.  That carries with it serious punitive connotations for an individual who in all likelihood has never been in trouble with the law but now faces an arrest warrant without having received all the information he should have been given.</P>
        <P>I did not table an amendment on this but it occurs to me that there is a second gap where information should be provided but there is no provision for it.  Under section 6(3), the judge can decide that instead of issuing a warrant, he or she will give the debtor another chance and fix a new date for the hearing at which the debtor will be required to attend and direct that he or she be notified of that date.  To make this workable and give the debtor a fair chance of being aware of the full process, notification should also include within it information about the consequences of failure to comply with an order or attend the court.  In addition, the debtor should be informed of the possibility of seeking a variation of the instalment order.  If, as FLAC has said, it is vital that debtors are given as much information as possible as early as possible <Col N="829"/>in the process, any notification of a new hearing date should also include information for the debtor about the process itself and the consequences of failure to comply.</P>
        <P>As I said, many of the improvements will be empty unless debtors are made aware of them and of the possibility of their being able to influence the proceedings by convincing the judge to vary the instalment order.  Of course, debtors also need to know what sanctions are ultimately likely to be imposed.  I would be grateful if the Minister would consider some amendment to ensure a greater level of notification as early as possible in the process and, in particular, before any arrest warrants have been issued.  Arrest warrants bring people into a different cycle of the process and will be viewed by anyone subject to arrest as bringing them into a criminal process, even if there are safeguards in place for the subsequent process.  They are being brought to court subject to an arrest warrant and that is something we should seek to prevent at all costs.  We should try to prevent the issuing of an arrest warrant by ensuring that people get as much information as possible in that early summons and therefore are encouraged to attend court.  We would be providing a carrot as well as a stick.  That is why it is so important they are informed of the possibility of variation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment and support it for the reasons she has outlined.  The point she made at the end of her contribution was a particularly compelling one: in the spirit of ensuring that debtors and persons subject to court procedures have all relevant information available to them, the risks of their situation and the possibilities of resolution should be outlined at every available opportunity, within reason.  That is what Senator Bacik described as using a carrot as well as a stick.  The proposed section 6(2) outlines four different items which should be included in such a summons: that it be issued by a District Court clerk; that it contain details of the consequences under the section of failure to comply with an instalment order and, in particular, the possibility of imprisonment &mdash; nobody could object to this; that it state that the debtor may be arrested if he or she fails to appear before the District Court as directed &mdash; again, no one could object to this being included; and that the summons be served on the debtor by personal service &mdash; there is a separate amendment dealing with that aspect.</P>
        <P>The point covered in Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment is important.  As I indicated, where a person is at risk, the extent and seriousness of that risk should be outlined in the summons.  Clearly the possibility of imprisonment is one such serious risk.  Therefore, the effort to ensure that the person&rsquo;s risk and exposure is communicated to him or her is entirely consistent with the policy, which appears in this proposed new section, that the summons should also communicate to the debtor that he or she can use the opportunity of the hearing to seek a variation of the instalment order.  It is arguable that in many, if not most, cases this would encourage people to attend court if they see a real opportunity to improve the situation.  Carrot and stick is a fair characterisation of this approach.  The summons makes clear what the risk is, but the person is also told there is an opportunity to improve the situation by turning up in court.  It is a good and clear proposal and I see no reason it ought not to be included in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also support the second aspect of the amendment, which proposes that the summons provide information in ordinary language to the debtor of the consequences of not appearing at any future committal hearing and the possibility of variation being granted at those hearings.  This backs up the first part of the amendment.  The point made by Senator Bacik with regard to section 6(3) is important because, as identified by FLAC, it appears that if the amendment is not made there will be only a provision whereby people who are arrested would receive notification in ordinary language of the consequences of not appearing at the hearing and the possibility of variation at the hearing.  What FLAC is proposing, which is fair, is that all persons at risk of imprisonment should receive notification of the consequences of not appearing and <Col N="830"/>the possibility of variation of the order.  It seems inconsistent to provide for this in one case and not in the other, that is, in section 6(5) but not in section 6(3).  What does the Minister of State have to say about that?  Will he explain why a decision appears to have been made to include such a provision in one set of circumstances but not in the other?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general terms, I support the amendment.  The desirability of a debtor&rsquo;s having all information available to him or her, particularly with regard to the risks but also with regard to the possibilities available to improve the situation necessitate the inclusion of such provisions in the Bill.  I support the reference in the Bill to ordinary language, which is the phrase that is used, although &ldquo;plain English&rdquo; was the phrase the Minister of State used in his speech.  The Bill itself refers to ordinary language.  That is an objective we all support.  There have been improvements over the years with regard to the language used in those documents.  They should contain ordinary, readily understandable language, not jargon or incomprehensible or inaccessible language such as would put people off or pose the risk of the recipient&rsquo;s not understanding the true situation facing him or her or the application to be made in court.  The risk of imprisonment is obviously made worse by an inability to understand the words on the page.  Many people who are not in a position to obtain legal advice will, understandably, be put off by the language used, which may of itself be a disincentive for people to come to court.  They may think what is written in the summons sounds awful.  It will be headed &ldquo;Dublin Metropolitan District Court&rdquo; or similar, and recipients will think that things look bad for them if they do not understand it.  Even the language that is used may of itself be a disincentive to people to come to court and to make whatever effort they can to improve their situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very good amendment.  The provisions of the Laffoy judgment laid down the requirement for the person concerned to be apprised of the full consequences of a failure to comply with a summons.  Page 82 of the judgment refers to the failure to impose on the creditor pursuing an application for an order for arrest and imprisonment the obligation to go through the 46B-type procedure, including personal service of an order with a penal endorsement and so on.  I accept that the provisions of section 6(2) seek to take account of that judgment, but Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment, with the inclusion of the two additional paragraphs, is very appropriate.</P>
        <P>Given the consequences of failure to comply with a summons, it is essential that the language used therein is easy to understand.  It is also appropriate that the full consequences of non-appearance at a committal hearing and the possibility for variation of an existing instalment order are clearly set out.  A later amendment of mine seeks to ensure that an individual who is the subject of an instalment order is fully apprised of what is involved and of the consequences of non-appearance.  These two paragraphs, as proposed in amendment No. 1<i>a</i>, would add to the safeguards within the provisions of this Bill.  I appreciate that the subsection as drafted goes some way to meeting the requirements and observations of Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment.  However, this amendment would enhance those safeguards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>There are several issues to deal with and I will try to be as specific as possible.  The possible consequences of non-appearance are addressed in section 6(2)(<i>b</i>) and 6(2)(<i>c</i>).  Paragraph (<i>b</i>) sets out the consequences under the section of failure to comply with an instalment order, including the possibility of imprisonment.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) stipulates that the debtor may be arrested if he or she fails to appear before the District Court.  Thus, the specifics of the Laffoy judgment in terms of the requirement to set out the seriousness of the consequences of non-appearance are dealt with in the Bill.</P>
        <P>In regard to the variation of an attachment order, I regret it is not possible, from the necessity of balance, to accommodate the provision as set out in Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment.  I pointed <Col N="831"/>out on Second Stage that the Government must also have regard to the interests of creditors.  The receipt of the summons serves to bring the matter into sharp focus.</P>
        <P>I referred to the importance of using simple and direct English in summonses.  Following the passage of this legislation, the concerns expressed by Senators in this regard will be conveyed to the District Court rules committee.  It is a principle that should apply to legislation in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, particularly his refusal to contemplate the insertion of information for debtors about the possibility of a variation of attachment orders.  I ask for further clarification in respect of the concept of balance to which he referred.  I contend that simply setting out in the legislation the procedure that is to be followed will not interfere with any rights of the creditor.</P>
        <P>There is clearly a strange anomaly in the different levels of information that will be provided to different categories of debtors at different stages.  The only situation in which a judge is obliged to tell a debtor anything under section 5(6) is where the debtor fails to appear under section 6(3) and a warrant is issued for his or her arrest, in which case the judge must then explain that the debtor is entitled to apply for legal aid and must attend the court, and must explain in ordinary language the consequences of non-appearance.  However, there is no provision for a debtor who comes before the District Court either because he or she simply turns up on foot of a first summons or, under section 6(3)(<i>b</i>), on foot of a second notification.  A debtor who turns up in court in either of those circumstances is apparently not to be given information under section 6(5).  Such persons will be told under section 6(6) that they are entitled to apply for legal aid and of the consequences of non-appearance, including the possibility of imprisonment.  In other words, a different level of information is provided under this subsection.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that neither an arrested debtor nor a non-arrested debtor is to be informed at any stage of the possibility of variation, yet under section 6(7), the judge may treat the proceedings on the summons as an application for a variation.  Anyone who has been present at or done work in the District Court knows how difficult it is to follow what a judge is saying because of the way the court is set out and so on, particularly where there is no lawyer present.  Therefore, debtors who come to court may not realise what is happening.  Even if they come to understand that the proceedings are being treated as a variation, they will have had no opportunity to prepare for that and will have had no knowledge that such an eventuality might arise.</P>
        <P>I see no problem with simply informing persons of the procedure that may be adopted at a hearing of the summons.  I do not see why different levels of information are provided, depending on the way in which the debtor comes to court.  It would be entirely in line with the Laffoy judgment and with the public policy behind this legislation to ensure that the maximum level of information be provided to debtors as early as possible in the process, that is, through the summons served on them at the start of the process.  If information is provided at that stage in a balanced, neutral way and accessible way, in language that is easily understood, they will be encouraged to appear before the court, which is, after all, the purpose of the legislation, and to answer their creditors&rsquo; demands.  It is very much in the interests of all, including creditors and the State, that we encourage debtors to appear before court.  A summons simply informing them they are to be arrested and possibly imprisoned without offering any prospect for a positive outcome from the hearing is much less likely to encourage them to appear before court than a summons that contains fuller and more balanced information.  As I said, it is not in any creditor&rsquo;s interest if debtors are discouraged from appearing before the court.  Creditors want debts to be repaid, rather than that debtors be imprisoned, and that is what the legislation <Col N="832"/>purports to achieve.  We are trying to improve the relevant provisions so that the procedure for enforcement of debts becomes more robust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, concerns in regard to the use of clear language will be referred to the District Court rules committee.  To reiterate, the proposed provision regarding information on a variation to an instalment order is not being accepted because of the necessity to ensure a balance between the interests of creditors and debtors.  The Senator spoke about what happens when debtors go to court.  A variation during the course of a hearing is only one possible outcome, others being imprisonment with deferral, mediation and so on.  A variation arises out of the proceedings of the hearing itself and it is not intended that all the possible consequences and details of the hearing will be part of the summons.  There is a balance to be struck between the interests of creditors and debtors.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand but I do not accept the notion of balance the Minister of State is advocating.  A person has the right to apply to have the order varied.  No question arises in that respect.  The point is, however, that the person will not be provided with this information in the summons.  The balance for which the Minister of State argues is that it would create imbalance if the debtor were to be provided with information that is available to him or her in any case.  He does not argue that the person should not have this information but that he or she should not be told in the summons that he or she can apply for a variation in the order.  It is ludicrous to suggest that this information be withheld from someone in the interests of maintaining balance between debtor and creditor.  If that is the case being made by the Minister of State, it is not acceptable and I do not buy it. </P>
        <P>While I may not agree with the following scenario, I could understand if a particular opportunity, entitlement or right were withheld from someone on the basis that it is necessary to do so to keep the scales balanced as between a debtor and creditor and that the former would only be given a certain latitude in a certain circumstance.  In this case, however, the Minister of State is arguing for the implementation of some balance by means of not informing a person of a matter that is his or her right when he or she comes before a court.  If this is a person&rsquo;s right, why can he or she not be told about it in the summons?</P>
        <P>I referred to the use of ordinary language.  There is no point trying to reduce this matter to being one of ordinary language alone because it is only one aspect of the argument being made by Senators on this side.  While we all agree on the need to have ordinary language, it does not dispose of the point under discussion.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State indicated, the District Court rules committee will have to meet to draw up a new rule and perhaps advise as to how precisely the summons will be constructed.  Notwithstanding this, the legislation mandates the inclusion in the summons of certain matters, not all of which are being left to the District Court rules committee.  It provides, for instance, that the summons include details of the consequences of a failure to comply with the instalment order and, specifically, the possibility of imprisonment.  The section also mandates that the summons should state that the debtor may be arrested if he or she fails to appear before the District Court, as directed.  The legislation therefore mandates the inclusion of certain matters in the summons.  I cannot understand the reason the legislation cannot, in the same spirit, provide that the summons include a provision, in plain or ordinary language, that a variation will be possible if and when the person comes to court.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>By reason of the lengthy debate on this legislation, I somewhat misrepresented the position in respect of the proposed section 6(5) because it does not, as I stated, include a provision on <Col N="833"/>variation.  In mixing up the threat of imprisonment with the issue of a right to a variation, I may have misled my colleagues, although I note that no one spotted the oversight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, I fail to understand the reason the summons should not state that a variation may be sought and, further, that mediation may be sought.  It is interesting that the Minister of State referred to balance.  Like Senator White, I fail to comprehend the argument being made in this matter.  The legislation stipulates what is required to be included in the summons under section 6(2).  This information appears to consist of many sticks and no carrots.  It provides for the consequences of failure to comply, namely, the possibility of imprisonment and arrest.  The section provides for all the State&rsquo;s sticks but does not include carrots which would induce or encourage somebody to come to the court.</P>
        <P>I fail to understand how it is in the interests of a creditor to withhold from a debtor the information that a variation of an instalment order may be sought if the debtor comes to court.  That is not to say the judge will grant such an order.  The judge will still adjudicate in an impartial manner and if he or she considers that the debtor is, as one judge has said, playing ducks and drakes with the court, he or she will not grant a variation.</P>
        <P>We are discussing a person who is facing imprisonment for non-payment of a debt, a fundamental premise of the Bill of which many of us have been critical.  However, given that imprisonment for up to three months remains a sanction, as a bare minimum we should seek to encourage people to try to avoid imprisonment, if possible, and, as a first step, to try to avoid the issue of an arrest warrant.  It is not in anyone&rsquo;s interests that an arrest warrant is issued or that people face imprisonment.</P>
        <P>I indicated earlier that what is being done borders on criminalisation.  I have since re-examined Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment and on page 70 she states that there is no rational basis for treating differently a person facing three months for non-payment of debt and a person facing three months for a criminal charge.  The judge is pointing out that the person is going to prison and therefore faces the most severe consequence the State can offer.  In that context, I fail to see how one can talk about balance because the information that can be provided in the summons is rather imbalanced, as the section stands.  Even if one accepts the concept of balance, I fail to see how it impedes in any way the right of a creditor to include in the summons information about the possible positive as well as negative outcomes of the court hearing.  The negative outcomes, namely, the imprisonment consequence, are provided for, which is appropriate given the importance of informing the debtor of this potential consequence.  It is also important, however, that the debtor be told that it is not inevitable that he or she will be imprisoned and that other outcomes are possible.  I ask the Minster of State to reconsider his position on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik raised a point regarding negative consequences.  The Minister of State, in his contribution on Second Stage, specifically referred to the large number of applications for enforcement orders and so forth and the small number of people who turn up in court.  People faced with enormous debt are in over their heads and do not know what to do.  When they receive a summons containing negative information outlining harsh consequences, it is understandable that many of them bury their heads in the sand and do not show up in court.  This is borne out by the facts cited by the Minister of State in that they fail to show up in court and run away from the problem because they consider it insurmountable in the circumstances. </P>
        <P>Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment proposes that debtors be offered some light by informing them in the summons that if they come to court and explain the circumstances giving rise to the debt problem, the order may be varied.  The amendment is very good and the more we discuss it, the more it recommends itself to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="834"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik referred to sticks.  It is important, when the summons is issued, that the seriousness of non-attendance is clearly identified.  The Senator referred specifically to an alteration to the instalment order.  In discussing mediation I failed to point out, although the matter is not strictly relevant to the legislation, that consideration is also being given to preparing an information leaflet to accompany a summons.  The information included in the leaflet would be broader in nature than that normally included in a summons.  The matter will be the subject of legal advice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>An information leaflet may be different in some respects from a summons, which refers to obligations.  I could be flippant and say we will send out a copy of the legislation but that would serve no purpose.  An information leaflet is different from what is required in a summons notice.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P><Col N="835"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) Where a judge of the District Court is satisfied that the debtor is avoiding personal service, the judge may make such order as is appropriate to compel the attendance of the debtor before the Court.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It has been correctly stated during the course of these debates that creditors also have rights.  Most of the force of the argument on this side of the House has been to seek to ensure the rights of debtors and the position faced by debtors are properly provided for in legislation.  Every single opportunity should be afforded to a debtor who, unfortunately, finds himself or herself in that difficult position to make good the debt and not face the ultimate consequences that still obtain in those circumstances.  However, many people who are creditors also face genuinely serious difficulties in extracting money owed to them by debtors.  One of my colleagues on the other side of the House made the point that not all creditors are large financial institutions or large retailers.  People running small businesses and other individuals are owed money and find it difficult to have it repaid to them.  We must acknowledge this.</P>
        <P>When we are seeking to scrutinise this Bill, especially in the context of the Laffoy judgment, we should make no apology for concentrating on the position that faces debtors in circumstances where they are threatened with imprisonment.  This amendment deals with a situation that seems to arise by virtue of section 6(2)(<i>d</i>) where one of the requirements of the summons about which we spoke earlier is that it be served on the debtor by personal service.  I have no difficulty that it should be served by personal service, but it does not include any provision for substituted service with which we are familiar in the system generally.  Where there is no provision for a substituted service, there is a possibility or risk that a few people might seek to avoid service of a summons on them.  From the kind of provisions that are in this Bill, it follows that there should also be a provision where the court would have some form of residual discretion to compel the attendance of a person who might be seeking to avoid personal service.  One way of doing that is to provide for substituted service, something that is used frequently across the system.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator White&rsquo;s amendment.  If it is a normal situation concerning a debt and a civil action, there is a system whereby a service is deemed a good service.  However, this situation contains the risk of imprisonment.  Following the logic of the High Court judgment of Ms Justice Laffoy, it is imperative that a person who is subject to that risk is apprised of what is at issue, the responsibility involved and the implications.  I do not think the procedure of deeming service good is an option.  Given that this a criminal type of procedure, this may be the only remedy and alternative procedure available.  The amendment makes sense in the particular circumstances of this situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recognise the different rights of the different parties in this Bill.  This amendment looks at the procedure more from the creditor&rsquo;s point of view by seeking to ensure that where personal service is being avoided by a debtor, a different order may be made by a judge to compel the attendance of the debtor before the court.  That seems to be very much in the interest of the creditor and it is a balanced approach to improve the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with this concept.  Subject to correction, I am of the view that under the District Court rules, a judge can order a substituted service on any issue regarding people who might avoid service.  From my experience, I know that people use all sorts of methods to try to avoid the service of a summons, especially if they know there is bad news coming down the track.  I recall one incident where a particular debtor was avoiding service by hiding from the postman and so on.  The creditor got a bit shrewd and decided to get a jury envelope and stamp &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; on it.  When the debtor opened the envelope, he found the summons inside and got the fright of his life.  It was dragging on for months and <Col N="836"/>months and it added a bit of hilarity to the District Court in question many moons ago.  I do not wish to denigrate the amendment in any way, but I believe this situation is covered in the Bill as it stands.  The District Court judge may decide to allow the person to be served by ordinary pre-paid post, as opposed to registered post, for example.  I also believe, subject to correction, that personal service will continue to be possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>When one listens to the discussions of the eminent legal professionals in the House, it is difficult to be sure.  I understand fully the concerns that have been expressed by Senator Alex White about people who may try to avoid personal service.  However, I will not accept this amendment.  I will revert to it tomorrow when we talk about other forms of court service.  I am specifically interested in the best remedy when problems of this nature arise.  While I will not accept the amendment, I will ensure that the issue of avoidance of personal service is dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s comments are very helpful.  I would like to respond to the perfectly reasonable points made by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  I draw his attention and that of the Minister of State to an aspect of this debate.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is right to point out that there are other means of service.  It is within the jurisdiction of judges to make those kinds of orders.  However, it seems that the language used in the proposed new section 6(2) of the 1940 Act, to be inserted by this Bill, is mandatory.  The proposed new section 6(2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1940 Act states that &ldquo;a summons referred to in subsection (1) shall . . . be served on the debtor by personal service&rdquo;.  That does not seem to provide for the kind of flexibility that Senator O&rsquo;Donovan perfectly reasonably argued for.  I will not press this amendment, in view of what the Minister of State has said.  I hope he will review this issue and, if he deems it appropriate, introduce a further amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>Government amendment No. 2<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 4, line 11, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P><Col N="837"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>This short amendment will strengthen this provision slightly.  In effect, the use of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; channels the courts towards using the provisions of section 6(6), 6(7) and 6(8).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this amendment.  In its briefing paper, FLAC pointed out that the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the Bill as it stands seemed inadvertently to give a judge the discretion to do neither of the two things proposed in section 6(3), which clearly would have been a flaw in the legislation.  I emphasise, in a constructive spirit, that this amendment is welcome.  It is noteworthy that the free legal advice centres spotted this apparent anomaly in the original drafting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be as co-operative as possible while the Minister of State tries to make progress with this Bill.  I share Senator Bacik&rsquo;s observation on this amendment, which I support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very helpful that the Government has tabled this amendment.  We should not forget that, as Senator Bacik pointed out, this is an amendment of some substance.  It is not merely a technical matter.  Senator Bacik was right to point out that the amendment changes the force of this section, perhaps not dramatically but certainly for the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their comments and for their support of this amendment, which provides for the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to channel the courts, in effect, towards the subsections I mentioned earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2<i>b</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) if he or she considers it appropriate, where another person is indebted to the debtor or the debtor is in receipt of payments from such third person by reason of employment or otherwise, make an order that all debts or payments owing and/or accruing from such third person to the debtor shall be attached to answer the judgment or order, but where such third person disputes a liability to the debtor, instead of making an order that execution shall issue in that case, may order that any issue or question necessary for determining any such liability be first tried before the court.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment, which represents a variation on the theme of attachment of income or earnings orders, proposes the inclusion of a new section 6(7)(<i>c</i>) in the 1940 Act.  I have tabled it to more clearly set out the stages through which procedures of this nature should progress.  Subsection (7)(<i>a</i>) provides for a variation of the instalment order and subsection (7)(<i>b</i>) provides for resolution by mediation.  I suggest that subsection (7)(<i>c</i>) should then provide for the attachment procedure.  We can then move on to measures like the threat of imprisonment etc., which are provided for in the subsequent subsections.  We had hoped to avoid some of those measures.  That would have happened if my more comprehensive amendment had been accepted.  I do not intend to reiterate what has been said.  This Bill needs to include attachment of earnings provisions if it is to comply with the High Court judgment and I propose this amendment as a variation on that formulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support amendment No. 2<i>b</i>.  As Senator Regan said, the argument in favour of the need to include some attachment of earnings procedure in this legislation has been rehearsed.  Like Senators Alex White and Regan, I explained that the correct interpretation of Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment means that some procedure of this kind is required to ensure that <Col N="838"/>the debt enforcement mechanisms are proportionate and nobody&rsquo;s right to liberty is breached disproportionately by this Bill.  I do not want to go back over the ground we have covered, other than to say I support this amendment as an alternative means of achieving the aim we have outlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally express my support for the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  When we discussed the issue of attachment in the context of an earlier amendment, I gave a commitment to revert to the House on the matter tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment extend to this amendment as well?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it does not.  It relates to the first amendment only.  I envisage that the whole area of attachment orders etc., will be addressed in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s review.  The legislation before the House is narrow in its scope.  The most important point that has been made about the issue of attachment is that it is a necessary requirement.  In that context, the constitutionality of the legislation will be considered by the Attorney General.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, line 39, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, being the amount specified in that behalf in the order under subsection (7)(<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am proposing the insertion of a phrase, as specified in my amendment, at the end of section 6(10)(<i>b</i>) so that it will read: &ldquo;Where a debtor is imprisoned on foot of an order made under subsection (7)(<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>), he or she .... is entitled to be released immediately upon payment by him or her or on his or her behalf to the District Court clerk concerned or to the Governor of the Prison for the District Court clerk, of the sum of money consisting of the amount of all instalments of the debt and costs which have accrued before, and are unpaid at the date of such order, being the amount specified in that behalf in the order under subsection (7)(<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>).&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister of State does not intend that anything else is intended.  This amendment would clarify that the amount the debtor has to pay to secure his or her release under section 6(10)(<i>b</i>) is the amount specified in the District Court order.  If we do not make that clear, the question of whether the relevant amount under section 6(10) is different from the relevant amount under section 6(7) might arise.  I am proposing to tidy up this section to clarify that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this sensible amendment, which would clarify the meaning of section 6(10).  It is worth emphasising that with debts of this nature, the debt remains in place even after any term of imprisonment has been served.  In that sense it is very different from a fine.  Where people are imprisoned for non-payment of a fine, their imprisonment effectively discharges the fine since the imprisonment order is made where they are in default of paying the fine.  Where somebody is imprisoned under this Bill or the current procedure for non-payment of a debt, the debt remains in place.  It is important that the level of debt that is owing <Col N="839"/>is made clear to him or her and that no greater debt is assumed to be owing as a result of lack of clarity in the legislation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, support the amendment.  There is need for greater clarity in the Bill in these circumstances, where vulnerable people are perhaps in over their heads.  Where the procedure has run its course and matters are resolved, it should be laid out crystal clear that the matter is closed and there should be no ambiguity about the amount owing. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand where the Senator is coming from but I am advised that the amendment is unnecessary because it is already implicit in the order, where the debtor is imprisoned on foot of an order made under subsection (7)(<i>c</i>) or (7)(<i>d</i>). </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It may be implicit but it is best in these matters that these types of issues are explicit.  There is certainly residual doubt in my reading of the two paragraphs.  It would hardly cause a difficulty for the Minister of State to amend the Bill to ensure that there is a &ldquo;belt and braces&rdquo; effect, so that his confidence that it is already covered may be augmented and confirmed absolutely beyond doubt to the effect that the only amount of money is that as comprehended by the original order.  I see no reason that it cannot be included. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that it is unnecessary.  To include it, from the drafters&rsquo; viewpoint, would not achieve greater clarity because it forces one to refer back to the previous sections. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>In support of Senator White&rsquo;s amendment, there is reference in subsection (10) to the order.  However, the language, &ldquo;entitled to be released immediately upon payment by him or her . . . of the sum of money consisting of the amount of all instalments of the debt and costs which have accrued before, and are unpaid at the date of such order&rdquo; does not specify the amounts which are the subject of the order.  I believe there is ambiguity there.  One could argue it is implicit, but for the sake of clarity it should be specified, perhaps, as Senator White has suggested.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice is still the same to the effect that it is unnecessary, and I am not accepting the amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, to delete lines 45 to 48 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(12) Failure by a debtor to comply with subsection (5)(<i>a</i>)(ii), without reasonable excuse, constitutes contempt of court, and the District Court judge may deal with the matter accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is a rather odd formulation in the Bill in respect of contempt of court.  I am not sure whether I have seen this before, but I would like it to be explained and perhaps justified.  Subsection (12) states that if &ldquo;a debtor fails to comply with subsection (5)(<i>a</i>)(ii), without reasonable excuse&ldquo; the District Court judge may deal with the matter as if it were a contempt of that court.  I do not understand why that formulation is being used, particularly when it is associated with &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than anything more mandatory.  To say, &ldquo;the District Court judge may deal with the matter&rdquo; is an unsatisfactory formulation, is unclear and leaves far too much to the imagination.  It is either a contempt of court or it is not.  If there is a better formulation than mine or one that is more desirable or advisable, I am certainly willing to debate that with <Col N="840"/>the Minister of State.  I propose that we reword the subsection as follows, for the avoidance of doubt: &ldquo;(12) Failure by a debtor to comply with subsection (5)(<i>a</i>)(ii), without reasonable excuse, constitutes contempt of court, and the District Court judge may deal with the matter accordingly.&rdquo;  The fact that the term &ldquo;may deal&rdquo; is included in that context seems to be all right because there has to be an element of discretion by the judge.  It strikes me that the phrasing of that subsection, the notion that legislation states that a court may deal with contempt of an order &ldquo;as if it were&rdquo; contempt of court, is flawed.  Contempt of an order is contempt of court so the section needs to be redrafted, accordingly, unless I am missing something.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It is somewhat like the amendment that the Government has introduced on the judge issuing a warrant where the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; has been changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  This is inviting the judge to sit on his or her hands.  It is not a question of limiting the judge&rsquo;s discretion, but it means he or she has to deal with the matter.  The phrase &ldquo;may deal with the matter as if it were&rdquo;, is not satisfactory.  The amendment, as proposed, adds clarity to the formulation and the drafting. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the amendment.  There is a serious lack of clarity in subsection (12) and Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment is trying to make sense of it.  If one looks at it carefully, it makes no sense: &ldquo;If a debtor fails to comply with subsection (5)(<i>a</i>)(ii), without reasonable excuse, the District Court judge may deal with the matter as if it were a contempt of that court.&rdquo;  Subsection (5)(<i>a</i>)(ii) is the provision under which a debtor is arrested and brought before the District Court under subsection (3)(<i>a</i>), and the judge fixes a new date and explains to the debtor in ordinary language, under subsection (5)(<i>a</i>)(ii), that he or she must attend before the court at the date next fixed for the hearing of the summons.  Presumably the meaning of subsection (12) is to the effect that the only debtor to whom it applies will be one who has been arrested and brought before the District Court under a warrant under section 6(3)(<i>a</i>) and who has failed to attend before the court at the date next fixed for the hearing of the summons.  There is a strange gap in the language.  Subsection (5)(<i>a</i>)(ii) simply provides, from my reading, for the explanation to the debtor that he or she must attend before the court and does not impose upon him or her an obligation to do so.  Again, we are dealing with a relatively serious matter here, where a person may be dealt with as if he or she were in contempt of court.  It is important, therefore, to have clarity in the language.  A reconsideration of the drafting is required at least to ensure that it is watertight.  I am not sure that it is so at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>From the viewpoint of clarity, I do not want any misunderstanding.  In reading out the phrase, the Senator added a bit that I do not have.  He said, &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt, failure by a debtor to comply&rdquo;, whereas the amendment before me reads &ldquo;Failure by a debtor to comply&rdquo;.  I want to get clarity in that regard. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment, as set out in the list of amendments, does not include the phrase, &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt&rdquo;.  The version I have does, but that is a case of my gremlins, not those of the Minister of State. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all right.  I do not wish to further confuse the matter. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has clarified the amendment, if not the<?oasys _jy ?>Bill. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to be accused of adding  in something or taking something out.  As the Senator reads the amendment, it is: &ldquo;Failure by a debtor to comply with subsection <Col N="841"/>(5)(<i>a</i>)(ii), without reasonable excuse, constitutes contempt of court, and the District Court judge may deal with the matter accordingly.&rdquo;  I believe the objective is the same, namely, to provide a workable option for the sanction against the person who refuses to co-operate with the court.  Having been given the opportunity to look at this amendment, I believe it is necessary and I am willing to accept it.  That is why I was fussy about the actual wording.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful to the Minister for taking that on board.  I will not speculate on whether he would have accepted the amendment had it included the words, &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(3) The following section is substituted for section 9 of the Act of 1940:</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">&ldquo;9.&mdash;(1) Where a person is in prison under an order of a court made on account of the failure of the person to pay a sum of money, the Minister may, at any time and for any reason which appears to him or her sufficient, direct that the person be released either (as the Minister thinks proper) immediately or after payment of a specified part of that sum of money.</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(2) The Minister may, before releasing a person under this section, if he or she considers it appropriate and proper in all the circumstances consult with the judge who made the order for imprisonment of the person.</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(3) Where the Minister directs that a person be released from prison, the person shall be released in accordance with the direction.</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(4) In this section &lsquo;Minister&rsquo; means Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  The current provision obliges a Minister who is considering the release of a debtor in any circumstances to consult the District Court judge who ordered the debtor&rsquo;s imprisonment.  The only condition currently is that the consultation may be practicable.  The Attorney General has recommended the proposed amendment be incorporated to provide a workable procedure for the future.  It allows the Minister of the day to consider whether consultation with the judge is appropriate.  Unlike in criminal cases where temporary release is part of the system, the existing provision for release of debtors has traditionally been vary rarely used, I presume to avoid any accusation by creditors of political interference.  I would not envisage widespread use in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very surprised by this amendment.  I think of a previous amendment in a Bill we dealt with only last week where a sitting High Court judge is asked to be an advisor to the Taoiseach on matters relating to surveillance.  I find this merging of the Judiciary and the Executive inappropriate.  This issue should not be politicised.  We have had experiences in the past of ministerial interference in the release of prisoners.  The law should stand, the penalties apply and the orders of the court complied with, and I do not believe the Minister should mess around in this area.</P>
        <P>I certainly do not believe the Minister may, &ldquo;if he or she considers it appropriate and proper in all the circumstances consult with the judge who made the order for imprisonment of the person&rdquo;.  I find that fundamentally flawed and unconstitutional and it is in conflict with the separation of powers.  If there are extenuating circumstances in an individual case there can be <Col N="842"/>procedures whereby an individual can obtain some redress, but this is not the procedure.  It is extraordinary that a Minister should consult with a judge as to the order he or she has made for imprisonment of a person and negotiate with the judge as to whether the person should be released.  It is perverse and absurd.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wanted to take issue, particularly with the proposed section 9(2).  I have no problem with the general principle that a Minister may direct that a person be released because that is a function of the Executive.  Returning to Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s judgment, she said there is no rational basis for treating people differently if they are imprisoned for non-payment of a debt or facing a criminal charge, and in either situation it is the Executive&rsquo;s function to direct that they be released.  There is a point about the need for remission for a person who is imprisoned for non-payment of a debt, but that is a separate issue.</P>
        <P>My concern is the subsection Senator Regan has commented on.  It is most improper and must be unconstitutional to provide that the Minister may consult with the judge who made the order for imprisonment of the person before releasing a person.  We have been given these amendments and are speaking on the hoof, and I have not looked again at the two obvious cases that spring to mind.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One is the Gallagher case in which it was held to be an Executive function to direct the release of a person who was detained in the Central Mental Hospital on foot of a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  For a time it had been thought it was a judicial function to direct when a person could be released from that detention but the Gallagher case established that it was an Executive function, a matter for the director of the Central Mental Hospital, and ultimately the Minister, to decide whether a person could be released from that detention following the special verdict.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also thinking of the Finn case some years ago in which the Supreme Court said review dates were in breach of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.  Judges had been in the practice of providing for a sentence of seven years but with a review date of three years and the person would be brought back to them after three years and could then be released by the judge.  Again, the Supreme Court said once the judge has pronounced sentence, it is then a matter for the Executive to decide upon the release date of the person.  That allows for the operation of remission and so forth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are not talking about imprisonment on foot of a criminal conviction here; the Gallagher case did not concern criminal conviction but was detention on foot of a special verdict of an acquittal, albeit an acquittal and a finding that the person was insane.  Here there is a real danger in inserting in legislation a provision that a Minister can consult with the judge who made the order for imprisonment before releasing a person.  It seems to trespass on the judicial function even if we are not in the context of criminal convictions.  I still do not see how it can be constitutional, nor do I see any practical necessity for it because section 9(1) provides that the Minister can &ldquo;for any reason which appears to him or her sufficient, direct that the person be released&rdquo;.  The matter is obviously within the Minister&rsquo;s discretion more properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the surprise of my colleagues on this provision, particularly 9(2).  It begs more questions than it answers.  The first and most obvious question is why the Minister is being given the power to consult with a judge.  What is the purpose?  Senator Bacik is correct that there is already a role for the Executive in releasing persons from detention in different contexts.  Why would the Minister consult with the judge?  What would the Minister ask the judge?  What sort of consultation would they have and for what purpose?  Would it involve meeting with the judge?  I am sorry if it sounds crass, but where would the Minister meet the <Col N="843"/>judge?  In what context would they meet?  Would it be a formal meeting?  Would it be documented?  Who would have access to documentation on it?  How would the deliberations between the judge and the Minister be recorded?  Would the parties involved have access to documentation on the meeting between the Minister and the judge?  Would a person who is in prison and regarding whom consideration was given to his or her release and, following consultation between the Minister and the Judge, a decision was made not to release that person, be entitled to know what the judge said to the Minister that persuaded the Minister not to release the person?</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this.  Apart from the fundamental objection to it regarding the separation of powers, this opens all kinds of possibilities and problems for Ministers in future regarding what would or would not happen or could happen.  I am not suggesting for a minute any question of possible impropriety, although that could happen.  I do not suggest it could happen with anybody currently in office.  However, if we are providing in statute for consultation to occur, whether through meetings, letters or otherwise, between a Minister and a judge, it would be dangerous for that to become in any way a precedent in our system.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this provision.  No case has been made for it and it could cause the most serious problems in the future in how it might play out.</P>
        <P>The period of imprisonment for debtors is relatively short, as I recall.  It is three months.  In those circumstances if the Minister were to contact a judge and was considering releasing the person, presumably it would be only three months since any such hearing would have occurred, but three months is three months.  A District Court judge presumably has many cases coming in and out through his or her court and I wonder what implications this has for what records would be kept by a District Court justice on these cases.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am reminded that within the past year we debated another Bill in the House which was taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  As far as I recall, in that legislation we removed an ancient provision whereby a District Court judge was required to take a note of the deliberations in court.  As I understand it, that has been removed by legislation passed by these Houses in the past year or so.  There is now no provision for a record or a note to be kept by a District Court judge of what has happened in his or her court.  Obviously some record is taken of decisions made.  What will the judge be able to tell the Minister?  This is the nub of the issue as far as I am concerned.  What will the Minister ask the judge?  Will he or she ask about the character of the person concerned?  What would be the factors that would enter into the equation from the judge to the Minister that might persuade the Minister to release the person or keep the person in custody?  This seems to be highly fraught with considerable danger for all concerned and I counsel in the strongest possible terms against its inclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also ask the Minister of State to reflect on this section again between now and Report Stage.  I have concerns because I was of the view that such interference, which would normally apply in road traffic cases involving criminal sanctions and possibly non-payment of fines, and the lobbying that went on by Deputies and Senators to have somebody released or the fine reduced were more frowned upon than supported.  I believe that many District Court judges would go frantic over the notion that they could be called to account on every decision.  Here we are dealing with a civil issue of money owed between a debtor and a creditor.  I see no great <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for the Minister to involve himself or herself by asking a District Court judge to account for himself or herself and have somebody released.  Based on the circumstances outlined by the Minister of State in his speech, it would be expected that a person would be given at most 28 days&rsquo; imprisonment for non-payment of an enforcement order and the usual length is three weeks, or 20 days.  If one allows for time, the person <Col N="844"/>would probably be released in the normal course of events.  It is very rare for someone to be sentenced to six months&rsquo; imprisonment for non-payment of a debt on foot of a committal order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>In my last point I said I did not envisage this provision having widespread use.  The consultation with the judge is merely repeated from the 1940 Act.  The amendment reduces the likelihood of any future consultation being undertaken.  The Attorney General recommended that the proposed amendment be incorporated to provide a workable procedure to be followed in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 1940 Act was introduced three years after the Constitution was adopted.  We have learnt some things in the intervening 70 years, of which we should take account.  I do not understand how it is possible to simply transpose that section with a certain reformulation providing that a Minister may consult the judge who gave the order for imprisonment.  While I will not repeat what has been said, I find it extraordinary.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the proposed amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been 69 years since the 1940 Act was passed and things have certainly moved on.  I was not aware this provision was in the 1940 Act.  I am surprised to hear it and I do not imagine it has ever been used, certainly not in recent times and since the judgments that clarified separation of powers on imprisonment.  We need to review the matter and not simply replicate it in the new legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept it is relevant that it is in the 1940 Act.  However, given the opportunity we have as legislators to take it out, we should grasp that opportunity, unless a case can be made for it.  If the Minister has a case for its inclusion, this is the time for that case to be made afresh.  Senator Bacik said she doubts if the provision has ever been used and she is probably right.  However, if it has never been used it should definitely be dropped.  Is the Minister of State aware that it has ever been used?  While he may not know I will ask and he can do his best to answer.  Is it the practice for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consult District Court judges and, if it happens, does the Minister of State have any idea how often it happens?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously I do not know if the section of the 1940 Act has been used.  However, I reiterate that this comes with the advice of the Attorney General.  As I said at the outset, the purpose of this legislation was not to revisit all the other issues that arose here today.  I believe there will be more substantial legislation on foot of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s proposals in due course.</P>

        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section, after section 17:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;17A.&mdash;All instalment orders made under the aforementioned section must be served, personally, on the judgment debtor and must contain a notification of the consequences of failure to comply with such an order, including the possibility of imprisonment pursuant to section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 1940, as amended by <i>section 2 </i>of the <i>Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 </i>and the District Court Rules applicable to such proceedings may make.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment provides for an amendment to the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926, as distinct from the 1940 Act.  It is designed to deal with the type of issue raised by Ms Justice Laffoy in her judgment.  It relates to personal service and the alerting of an individual to the possibility of imprisonment if he or she fails to comply with the order.  This relates not to a summons, as such, but to an instalment order in the first instance.  The amendment proposes a new section in the 1926 Act, that, &ldquo;All instalment orders made under the aforementioned section must be served, personally, on the judgment debtor and must contain a notification of the consequences of failure to comply with such an order, including the possibility of imprisonment pursuant to section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 1940, as amended by <i>section 2</i>&rdquo;.  The order must be served personally on the judgment debtor and must <Col N="846"/>contain a notification of the consequences of failure to comply with such an order, including the possibility of imprisonment pursuant to section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940, as amended by section 2 of the Bill.  The idea is that this endorsement of the order will inform the debtor that failure to comply could result in the issuing of a committal summons, as a result of which the instalment order could be varied.  The court may order mediation or attachment, as is proposed in the Bill.  The court may also order imprisonment with or without a stay of execution.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The reason the amendment is important is that Ms Justice Laffoy highlighted it as a weakness in the system.  In page 82 of the judgment she says similarly the failure to impose on the creditor pursuing an application for an order for arrest and imprisonment the obligation to go through an order 46B type process, including personal service of an order with penal endorsement, does not impair the debtor&rsquo;s right to liberty as little as possible.  Again, it is a reference to the proportionality test.  It is in the light of that ruling of Ms Justice Laffoy that one has to go back to the instalment order itself and ensure it is personally served on the debtor, and that does require an amendment to the 1926 Act.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  We have already discussed at some length the need to ensure that debtors are informed at the earliest possible opportunity of the consequences of failure to comply with orders and other information about the procedure.  Again, the amendment seeks to do that at a different stage of the process where instalment orders are to be served on the debtor.  The amendment should recommend itself to the Minister of State for that reason alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment, which is appropriate.  It is consistent with what we have been arguing, namely, that in the case of a debtor who faces serious consequences, up to and including imprisonment, the creditor who is seeking payment, as it were, and is pursuing the debtor ought to be put through the hoops and ought to ensure that every possible opportunity is given to the debtor.  The debtor&rsquo;s position must be protected.  Obviously the creditor has rights too but the notification of the consequences of the failure to comply with the instalment order at that early stage of the process should be communicated to the debtor, and that is what is set out in the amendment.  It is entirely appropriate that the amendment should be incorporated into the Bill.  We have debated the issue of ensuring that all of the risks to a debtor of not complying with the requirement to repay the debt should be communicated to that person at the earliest possible opportunity.  If the amendment is accepted that regime would be in place.  I support the amendment for those reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the logic behind Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment but we are primarily concentrating on amending the relevant portions of the 1940 Act, rather than the 1926 Act to which he referred.  I do not intend accepting the amendment at the moment but the matter will be examined as part of the ongoing Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s review.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan made a point, which I intend to pursue, on the court ruling of 18 June.  I will examine the specifics to ascertain if the legislation we are passing is sufficient without having to make an amendment.  If an amendment is required I will arrange to introduce it on Committee Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I would envisage the broader issue being addressed as part of a greater review of the legislation, but the detail to ensure that the legislation we are passing conforms with what was required by the ruling will be dealt with and, if necessary, an amendment will be brought forward on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="847"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is that when we speak about the 1940 Act we also speak about the 1926 Act, because the principal Act is the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926.  The first section of the 1940 Act outlines that the &ldquo;principal Act&rdquo; means the 1926 Act.  In all the amendments we are speaking about the 1926 and 1940 Court Orders Enforcement Acts.  The 1940 Act amends the 1926 Act.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The Bill seeks to address the weakness of the notification procedure to a debtor at a later stage in the process, namely, at the stage of the committal summons.  That is not surprising.  I understand where the Minister is coming from, given that the main criticisms in the judgment concern the committal proceedings rather than the procedure leading to the instalment order.  It is worth considering that once a committal summons is served on a debtor, under the amendments proposed by the Bill, the possibility of legal aid arises.  Personal service and a warning of imprisonment at an earlier stage could avoid the necessity for the summons and the entire procedure that we are now trying to remedy.  It would also avoid the cost of going through the legal aid process and the expense incurred in that regard.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this amendment, albeit concerning the 1926 Act, which is the principal Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reconsider it.  I specifically asked my officials to examine it, particularly with relevance to the High Court ruling of 18 June and to make sure that the legislation complies with it.  If necessary, an amendment will be brought forward when the Bill is taken in the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is strange that amendment No. 1 was not allowed because it was deemed to be in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  There was much discussion about that issue on Second Stage and I thought it would be allowed.</P>
        <P>Section 6 prevents any sale or promotion for any period shorter than 31 days.  I imagine that the thinking behind this is the need to protect consumers, but we in Fine Gael worry that this provision stifles competition and only serves to benefit the insurer with the deepest pockets, which can sustain a sale for this amount of time.  It could be said this constitutes interference in normal commercial practice.  I do not think this provision applies in any other financial services market in Ireland and I would like the Minister to explain why this period of 31 days is specified and what is the justification for it.</P>
        <P>It could be argued that the section stifles competition.  I can certainly see the intention, but does it not constitute interference in normal commercial practice?  Why is it necessary in this area when we do not protect people in other financial markets?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the provision stifles competition, nor does it interfere with it.  In fact, it does the opposite, and protects the consumer, who is given ample opportunity to check out the product.  I must point out that in no other market do we have community rating.  That is the current position.</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P>To provide further clarification, the primary purpose of the clause is to support the effective operation of community-rated insurance as it prevents insurance companies from introducing products that are available only to specific consumers and not to the broader public.  Removing the subsection to facilitate such practice would not be in the best interests of the consumer.</P>
        <P>If a product were introduced in the absence of the 31-day limit, or even a shorter limit, the sharks in the industry would be first in and the ordinary consumer would not have the opportunity to be aware of the product or its benefits.  I again underline the fact that there is no other market that has community rating and the provision is there to provide protection in this regard.</P>

	<P>We cannot compare most financial products because we are talking about a community-rated product.  The same does not apply to other financial products, and that is why the 31-day limit is there.  The effect is the opposite to what Senator Fitzgerald suggested.  It is there to protect the consumer and ensure that the product is properly marketed and that the public become aware of it, rather than particular segments who deal specifically in that area.  It would not apply to any other financial product but only this species of product in a community-rated market.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This section raises similar issues.  Section 8 requires that all new products be submitted to the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, ten days prior to their being launched onto the market.  When the Bill was initiated this was 20 days.  I welcome the fact that it has been changed to ten, and clearly there has been some compromise from the Minister in this regard.  I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point about the context of community rating, but one could again say that this provision stifles competition within the market and the opportunity for competitors to react to market conditions.</P>
        <P>This provision would effectively give an insurer a ten-day lead time in which to sell a product exclusively without being matched by a competitor.  Is this not an impediment to a normal competitive environment?  Is there any rationale or consumer-based justification for putting it in?  Our concerns in this regard are similar to those about section 6, namely, that it stifles competition and prevents other insurers from reacting to a product and thereby give the consumer more choice.  I recognise, however, that the time has been changed from 20 to ten days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s point of view.  Again, this provision is to protect the consumer, and it is also intended to provide protection to insurers.  The provider <Col N="850"/>can go to the authority to make it aware of a product.  There have been examples in the past in which a provider introduced a product without fully researching its compatibility with existing legislation and it turned out to be in conflict with existing legislation.  One that comes to mind is the cash plans introduced by a certain group some time ago, which contravened existing legislation.  Thus, it is also an attempt to provide a certain level of security for providers.</P>
      
        <P>The relevant section provides that the insurer shall submit samples of proposed contracts to the HIA ten days in advance of offering them.  When the Bill was initially published, the specified period was 20 days.  Having considered representations from the industry and from Opposition Members and colleagues, including Deputy Reilly, the period was reduced from 20 days to ten.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposed for this section by Senator Fitzgerald would reduce this period to three working days.  Given the time necessary to enable the authority to consider any proposed contracts and to reply, if necessary, the proposed timeframe is not feasible.  Perhaps this should have been better explained on Second Stage.  The provision offers certain protections to providers to ensure their offerings are compatible with existing legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State confirm that no change has been made to the minimum requirements for health insurance?</P>

	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no attempt to make any change in that regard.  The purpose of these provisions is purely to assign a timeframe.  This was initially set at 20 days and has since been reduced to ten.  The thinking of the Department in this respect was to ensure there was space to allow any provider entering the market to explain its product, check out the possibilities and ensure there is no conflict with existing legislation.  I referred to the instance when cash plans were proposed and had to be withdrawn from the market.  To be fair, this created unnecessary public relations upheaval for the company involved.  We are seeking to ensure that does not recur.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This deals with the obligation to make information returns.  Section 9 requires significant information to be provided to the Health Insurance Authority, including personal public service numbers.  Insurance companies may not be in possession of all relevant information for existing contracts because this was not required in the past.  Information requested should only relate to contracts effected from the date of the signing of the legislation as opposed to the enactment <Col N="851"/>date.  Exact details of information required will be specified and insurers will only be required to commence collecting such information at the renewal of existing policies or inception of new policies.  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment would give insurers an unnecessary level of discretion in the collection and provision of information.  The latitude proposed by the Senator is not considered appropriate.  Subsection (1) already provides an undertaking to make all reasonable efforts to obtain the information.  In other words, we are asking providers to do only what is reasonable.  This strikes an appropriate balance.</P>
        <P>The data requirements in respect of personal public service numbers have been discussed with the Data Protection Commissioner.  The obligations under this legislation are much more restricted and less onerous than those contained in the Bill as initially published.  The Revenue Commissioners require personal public service numbers to assign tax credits.  As such, the steps proposed in the legislation are not unreasonable.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 16, to delete lines 7 to 11.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment was discussed in considerable detail in the D&aacute;il.  Section 7E(3), as inserted by section 9, allows the Minister to appoint a person whom he or she considers to be competent and qualified to advise and consult the Minister on ministerial functions under this section.  In her Second Stage speech, the Minister, Deputy Harney, outlined how much expert advice and support was made available to her in devising the new levy.  Given the current fiscal position and the number of advisers currently in place in the Department, why is it necessary to build into legislation the need for yet another special adviser?  The Minister referred in the D&aacute;il to the actuarial assessments that had to be made and the complexities arising from the court rulings relating to community rating.  I take her point in this regard.  However, it is surprising, given the amount of work the Department has had to do in this area and the amount of discussions that have taken place in committee, that this provision is now proposed.  Senator Feeney referred to the lengthy discussions that took place in committee in respect of the VHI and community rating.  I am puzzled that it is considered necessary to appoint yet another special adviser and that the expertise in the Department of Health and Children is not adequate to deal with the demands that may emerge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator referred to the number of advisers available to Ministers.  I am reminded of Deputy Burton&rsquo;s comment in the other House that Ministers of State are sent out at night when everybody else has gone to bed.  That is my brief tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to differentiate between actuarial advisers and general advisers.  This provision relates to very specific advice.  The Minister has made the point that rather than having actuaries on the payroll permanently, the best advice is to bring in expertise as required.  Section 7E, as inserted by section 9, provides for the evaluation and analysis of information returns, the compilation of the authority&rsquo;s related report and the Minister&rsquo;s consideration of such reports.  Amendment No. 6 proposes to delete section 7E(3) which pro<Col N="852"/>vides for the Minister to avail of expert advice in considering the authority&rsquo;s report.  Under the subsection, the Minister will be able to avail of specific advice rather than having a person <i>in situ</i> within the Department waiting for that advice to be requested.  This provision relates to a very specific issue in respect of which it is necessary to take the advice of competent and qualified persons.  We are talking about very complex calculations in regard to tax credits and the nature of the process involved in any reviews of the credits and levies.  The Minister is required under the Bill to evaluate a report from the Health Insurance Authority of actuarial expertise and to advise the Government thereon.  This is a specialist area requiring the engaging of experts to advise on technical issues relating to health insurance.  In that context, I cannot accept the amendment.  All the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors since 1994 considered it necessary to rely on such advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>What was the situation prior to this legislation?  The Minister has been getting bucketloads of advice on risk equalisation and community rating and the Government has been up and down to the High Court for the past five years dealing with the issue.  It is difficult to comprehend the necessity for the inclusion of this subsection.  I do not wish to tax the Minister of State.  As he said, senior Ministers need to be tucked up in bed at this time of night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister took the advice of the Senator some time ago when he asked about value for money.  Rather than having a person on the payroll 52 weeks of the year, advisers are brought in to provide the specialised expertise required in respect of the authority&rsquo;s report.  The Minister took advice from the Opposition and from her colleagues to ensure there is value for money in the process.  It is better not to have people sitting idly by waiting for a report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am still of the view that it is odd to include this provision in legislation.  I assume Departments, on an ongoing basis, hire people for specific purposes and for short periods for advice on specific legislation.  I do not understand the reason it must be written into the legislation.  One would expect actuarial advice to be available to the Department.  Such advice has probably been sought in this complex area in the past.  Did the Minister of State indicate that provision was made in previous legislation to appoint a special adviser to provide actuarial advice in this area or that Ministers had used actuaries previously?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>

        <P FLI="0">The amendment relates to the information that must be contained in advertisements and other information sheets.  The provision directly overlaps with the large-scale advertising guidelines <Col N="853"/>set out by the Financial Regulator to which competitors of the VHI must adhere.

	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s amendment would remove from the Bill provisions aimed at protecting the position of the consumer in respect of advertising and the provision of information concerning health insurance contracts.  The thrust of the related amendment to the preceding subsection put forward by the Senator&rsquo;s colleagues in the other House was accepted on the basis that it enhanced the provision of information to the consumer.  Retaining the subsection under consideration is consistent with the approach taken to the subsection in question.

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 20 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make several points on the levy on insurers.  The concern is that the levy has forced up the price of health insurance for health consumers.  The cost of premiums has increased in VHI, Quinn Healthcare and Hibernian Aviva Health by 26%, 16% and 22%, respectively.  I note, however, that Hibernian Aviva Health has indicated that increases will be kept in separate accounts and returned to consumers if the European Commission does not approve the levy. </P>
        <P>There is a concern that the levy will make private health insurance unaffordable and will result in a contraction in the private health insurance market of at least 10%.  As Senators will acknowledge, families are finding it increasingly difficult to afford private health insurance and will continue to leave the market as a result of the economic position in which they find themselves.  The introduction of a levy on health insurers will result in an increase in the cost of family premiums of as much as 20% on typical plans, rising to 32% for some cheaper family plans.  Such increases would put considerable pressure on those who are just managing to stay in the private health insurance market.  If premiums continue to increase, families will leave the private health insurance market, thus placing even greater pressure on the public health system.  People believe they need private health insurance and want the choice it offers.</P>
        <P>The levy will also increase the costs of employee benefits for companies, an issue that was addressed in the other House.  It will increase the costs of trading here for the companies in question, many of which supply health insurance as part of their package to employees.  The levy could amount to an increase in costs of &euro;12,800 for a company with 100 employees and could be much higher for larger companies.  The impact on a medium size enterprise of 50 people would be an additional cost of &euro;6,400.  This is a problem because the costs of premiums, which are increasing as matters stand, will increase as a result of the levy.  As a consequence, the market for private health insurance could shrink.  I will make several further points on subsequent sections.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="854"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage I asked the Minister of State what was the position in a case where someone pays another person&rsquo;s health insurance premiums and he indicated that such persons could claim tax credits.  Does a limit apply in such cases?  Senator Feeney, for instance, pointed out that she pays the cost of private health insurance for five adults.  If the Senator was paying the premiums for five elderly relations, could she claim tax credits for all of them?</P>
        <P>An elderly person on an old age pension who has small savings and does not enjoy credits because his or her income is relatively low will have to pay a premium of up to &euro;3,000 per annum.  Until now, such an elderly person would pay perhaps &euro;1,800 for health insurance but that person will soon pay &euro;3,000.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge and respect the concerns expressed by Senators about the increase in the costs of private health insurance.  However, to accept the Senator&rsquo;s viewpoint would fillet the Bill and prevent the proper functions of the tax system.  The increases implemented by insurers reflect the issue of medical inflation and, more importantly, the absence of intergenerational solidarity.  The overall impact on the market will remain neutral.  In acting on an interim level, it protects those generational concerns, as well as taking medical inflation into account.  Senator Quinn spoke on that specific aspect and posed the question as to what would happen if the opposite of medical inflation occurred.  The fact remains, however, that that is the purpose of it.</P>
        <P>The amount being paid in levies is being paid out in tax credits.  I am unable to answer the question about how the elderly who may have no tax credits can be recompensed.  I will try to come back to the Senator on that before the debate ends.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 22 primarily provides for the granting of credits for the system to work effectively.  Sections 20, 21, 23, 24 and 25 were drafted and prepared on the basis that they are necessary and for that reason I cannot accept the amendments.  If the Senator so wishes, I will outline the overall structure and purpose of each of the sections that have been proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State talked about ring-fencing money for intergenerational solidarity.  I also read Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution to this debate, which was very interesting.  The levy, however, is not ring-fenced as such.  The VHI can use the proceeds from the levy for any other purposes it may choose, including expanding its business.  However, section 3 sets out the principal objective of the Minister and the Health Insurance Authority in ensuring intergenerational solidarity.  Despite this there is no requirement that the recipient insurer should use the State funds concerned for the direct purpose of bolstering intergenerational solidarity, which is such a key aspect of community rating and the Minister&rsquo;s intentions.  It does appear open for the recipient insurers to use this large-scale State support, raised by what we consider to be an inequitable levy, on the provision of other insurance &mdash; for example, travel, life or motor cover &mdash; at a lower rate.  Perhaps the Minister of State can say what he thinks about that in his reply.  Surely there should be some ring-fencing, if he is saying he wants the levy to be used to deal with intergenerational solidarity.  If there is no ring-fencing of some aspect, does it not defeat the purpose?  Perhaps the Minister of State can explain why that is not in the legislation.  Should it not be considered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>As to why it is not in the legislation, I do not think it was intended even to take it into consideration.  It was presumed that there was protection there by way of intergenerational solidarity.  In the first instance, health insurance premiums are charged on a <Col N="855"/>net premium basis, after the reduction of credits to all persons, irrespective of their level of income.  I do not think that would arise in that context.  The legislation makes the point that it is an interim measure.  Health insurance premiums are charged, as I said, on a net premium basis, so there is protection there.  </P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 22 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise a particular query concerning section 22, which is about making the provisions of the Bill retrospective from 1 January 2009.  If the Bill is passed, will the levy be applied twice to certain contracts?  I am worried that might be the case, given the dates outlined in section 22.  If so, that could have serious financial consequences.  Will the Minister of State respond to that point?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The short answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Section 22 inserts a new section 470B into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This new section provides for an additional age-related tax credit in respect of health insurance premiums paid to authorised insurers, excluding restricted membership undertakings, within the meanings of section 2(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1994, under relevant contracts renewed or entered into on or after 1 January 2009, or before 1 January 2012 in respect of insured persons aged 50 years or over.</P>
        <P>As regards premiums paid under contracts of insurance falling within section 2(10)(<i>d</i>) of the Health Insurance Act 1994, certain international health insurance plans or contracts of insurance relating solely to the charges for public hospital inpatient services under the Health In-Patients Charges Regulations 1987 do not qualify for the age-related tax credit.  In the case of each insured person aged 50 years or over but less than 60, the tax credit is &euro;200.  Therefore, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, they are not paying twice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point that an elderly person was paying for her private health insurance out of her own resources.  The basis is that one will put a levy on people under 50 and will give a tax credit to those over 50.  If elderly people aged 70 are paying for their own private health insurance, they will be expecting a tax credit of around &euro;950 back per year.  If they are not earning enough to pay tax, however, there is no opportunity to give them this sum back every year.  This is a new structure for private health insurance; it is not the regular community rating, risk-equalisation model we have been using up to this point, because that was thrown out by the courts.</P>
        <P>In the normal community rating the premium would be slightly different for everybody.  This individual will not get the &euro;950 back per year.  That is my interpretation of it.  There is nothing in the legislation that will in any way look after that elderly person who, for some reason, is paying his or her own private health insurance.</P><Col N="856"/>
        <P>I also noted that patients who came into the practice had their VHI card tucked in behind the medical card.  The Minister of State will be aware of this.  Therefore, even patients with medical cards make stringent efforts to pay for private health insurance.  I would like to know how we are going to get around this problem where elderly people pay for their own private health insurance.  How will we give them back the &euro;950 if they do not have tax credits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point the Senator has raised.  The levy is on insurance companies, not specifically on the customer or purchaser.  Tax credits are granted at source in the same way as the levy or existing relief.  Elderly people are securing a tax relief of 20% but the levy is on the company not on the specific customer.  The companies would have to recognise their customers&rsquo; age profile, while taking account of the fact that the levy is on the company, rather than the customer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Which means they could pass it on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  That is what they are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Looking at the age of the patient and so on, does this mean they would pass it on accordingly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly what I am saying.  The levy is clearly on the companies which will make up the shortfall by whatever means they decide, and they will pass on that charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not have to pass it on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, they do not have to do so.  If the companies are living up to their own standards by protecting the elderly, they clearly should not be tempted to pass that on.  The bottom line is that I cannot say for definite.  I presume that if a levy is added to existing charges to an insurance, the possibilities are that those charges will be passed on, or at least the temptation will be there to pass them on.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>When we were debating this on Second Stage, I spoke about these levies that are being applied.  The Minister of State may say that the same levies may have come into play if risk equalisation were in place, but I do not know whether that is true.  It is a significant levy on young families.  If we take a mother, father and three children, there will be an additional tax on young families of &euro;500 per year.  That is a significant sum of money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Does this highlight the potentially sorry state of the finances of the VHI, or is that the VHI is being fattened up for privatisation?  The 40% reserve for the VHI is way out of kilter with what is needed for health insurance.  Health insurance is not like insurance for storm damage <Col N="857"/>and so on and is pretty predictable over the course of a number of years.  I do not think there is a need for it to be at 40%.  I cannot understand why the Government has not advised the Financial Regulator to lower this to 25%, which is the figure in many other countries.  Even after a pretty disastrous investment year, the reserves of the VHI are still at 27.5%.  If the level was dropped to 25%, the VHI&rsquo;s reserves would still be adequate.  It may well be good enough to hold it at that rather than introducing another levy on young families.  The Government should think a little bit more politically about families rather than thinking purely economically from the point of view of the VHI.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Rather than bringing this Bill through, we should have sorted out the mess that is risk equalisation.  Every single individual in this House supports the concept of community rating and the need for risk equalisation, but this does not deal with that problem and the court case that has just come about.  This is a sort of quick-fix solution, but it is a huge levy on young families and this section is now authorising that levy.</P>
        <P>I have seen nothing whatsoever about controlling costs within the VHI.  I spoke at length on Second Stage that invoices and bills from the VHI are almost made up.  Hospitals bill the VHI with bills that would be unacceptable to any major health insurer in the US or in mainland Europe.  People can basically add in their fees without any major checks and balances.  The hospital is not inclined to push that sort of check because it is income for the hospital and in these difficult times, the hospital needs every single euro it can get its hands on.  I do not know whether the VHI is controlling its costs to the best of its ability.  Other avenues should have been examined, such as reducing the reserve and looking at the cost base and making savings there rather than hitting young families with a new levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in agreement with Senator Twomey on many of his points, especially those regarding cost.  How do members of the VHI have a say in controlling the company?  It was brought to my attention by a consultant yesterday that the VHI has written to consultants to inform them that they are making proposals whereby consultants must call the VHI before admitting any of the company&rsquo;s customers.  We will be going down the wrong road on this and I would question patient care as well as patient safety if that was to be brought in.  Can the Minister of State find out if there is any truth to this?  I was told about this yesterday by a consultant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to support Senator Feeney&rsquo;s request for clarity in this area.  It was pointed out on Second Stage that patients going into hospital for maternity care cannot access a private room and therefore pay the hospital the money due for the room unless they are private patients of the consultant.  This is a widespread anomaly throughout the country.  It is an extremely narrow-minded view on the collection of funds by the hospitals.  It is a massive resource that is not being exploited and is widespread practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>To respond to Senator Twomey first, this is not an attempt to fatten up the VHI for whatever ulterior motive may be down the road.  Neither is it a quick-fix solution.  I would prefer to call it an interim measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a quick fix.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a bit of a difference.  Sitting over there on the Opposition benches, it is a quick fix.  Over here on the Government side, it is an interim measure.  It was well thought out by the people to whom we referred in previous amendments, such as expert advisers and so on.  Section 26 provides for the application of the levy on the health insurance companies.  It has been amended since publication to address issues raised by the industry.  It is worth noting that the levy now applies only to contracts renewed or entered into after 2009.</P><Col N="858"/>
        <P>I am not aware of the issues raised by Senators Feeney and Prendergast, but they are obviously very important and we will check them out immediately.  Under the Bill, the VHI will be only partly compensated for the additional cost it faces as it has more older members.  <?oasys _dc18- ?>That point was often made in the committee rooms when representatives of the VHI and BUPA were also before them.  This ensures the company will continue to focus on controlling costs.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>I do not think we can lean on the Financial Regulator who is independent and must make an independent assessment.  The Senator spoke about the 40% reserve but we must allow the Financial Regulator to make that assessment independently rather than pressurising the regulator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister of State is looking into the issues raised by Senators Feeney and Prendergast, perhaps he will also examine another matter I would like to highlight.  When some private hospitals do an MRI or CAT scan, the patient in question does not have to do anything other than present his or her VHI card.  In other private hospitals, however, patients have to pay in advance of the scan before claiming that money back from the VHI.  Indeed, such scans are not covered at all under the VHI in some other private hospitals.  VHI customers have a range of options when they are choosing private hospitals.  Depending on the hospital, the VHI might pay upfront, pay when an invoice is submitted or not pay at all.  I ask the Minister of State to examine why there are such variations between the private hospitals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great pleasure to burn the midnight oil with the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the unprecedented difficulties we face in this period of serious economic distress and the urgent need to stabilise our public finances.  We have had to take exceptional measures to respond to the challenges we face and many of the decisions the Government has been forced to take have involved significant sacrifices for those affected by them, because everyone has commitments.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 midnight</TimeSt><P>When introducing the supplementary budget last April, the Minister for Finance stressed that fairness must be the cornerstone of all our efforts to achieve economic renewal.  The Minister said that everyone wants fairness but that there is less agreement about what it means.  For many, it is tempting to mean that the next person should pay, but the reality is everyone must give according to his or her means.  Those who have most must give most.  Equity demanded that when we asked anyone else to give, we in this House and in the Government had to examine our own remuneration and demonstrate that we were prepared to lead by example.</P>
        <P>The members of the Government have already shown their willingness to give leadership in this area.  They reduced their salaries by 10% last October.  Ministers of State made a similar reduction.  The public service pension levy was applied to members of the Government and Ministers of State.  As a result, Ministers have seen a reduction of about one fifth in their incomes.  In addition, the number of Ministers of State has been reduced from 20 to 15, a reduction of which I came out in favour last January, expressing a willingness, if necessary, to give up my position.  There is logic to having an equal number of Ministers and Ministers of State and I am glad that the pre-1994 position has been restored as a consequence of this reform.</P>
        <P>The Government also decided to introduce a number of additional changes to the remuneration of Deputies and Senators.  These included the matters that are the subject of this Bill, <Col N="861"/>namely, changes to the arrangement whereby former Ministers could receive ministerial pensions while they are still Members of the Oireachtas and the abolition of long service increments payable to Deputies and Senators.</P>
        <P>Separate provisions are being put in place to give effect to other changes to reduce expenses, halve the allowances paid to Oireachtas committee chairmen and abolish the payments to Whips and vice-chairmen.</P>
        <P>While the Bill has the effect of providing measures to reduce public expenditure, I appreciate they are very modest in the overall scheme of things and in light of the difficulties we are facing.  Nevertheless, they represent a real and important contribution from the individuals affected.  We all have an interest in not distracting from the value of the contribution made by Oireachtas Members because of side issues where the rationale, particularly in current circumstances, for the existing system is debatable.  Under this legislation, from after the next general election, all Deputies and Senators, other than officeholders, will be paid the same, and sitting Members will not receive a pension in addition to salary by virtue of having been officeholders in the past.  It is better for everyone concerned that, rather than any invidious finger-pointing at individuals who take up their existing rights, the system be changed to reflect what is right for everyone with limited transitional arrangements</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts 1938 to 2001 and the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act 1938.  It provides for cessation of payment of long service increments after the next general election for all Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and for withholding long service increments in the case of those Members who would normally have qualified for them before the next general election.  The same provisions will apply to Members of the European Parliament who are eligible to do so and opt to continue to be paid the same salary as Deputies, a matter we discussed a short time ago in another Bill.</P>
        <P>In case anyone should think that Ministers or Ministers of State are somehow unaffected by this measure, I will read into the record the last paragraph of a letter I received a short time ago from the Minister for Finance:</P>
        <P LI="1">Under the existing arrangements you would have qualified in the near future for a long service increment although it would not have been payable to you while you hold Ministerial office.  However, I am writing to inform you that following the Government&rsquo;s decision you will not now qualify for a long service increment.</P>
        <P>I would like to deal with the issue of the effect of this measure on the pensions of Deputies, Senators and MEPs who will lose their long service increments after the next general or European Parliament election.  The position is that any Member who held long service increments before the cut-off date of 13 May 2009 will ultimately receive the benefit of them in their pensions.  Appropriate arrangements will be made to this effect by amending the Members&rsquo; pension scheme.  The legislation requires that any scheme or amending scheme shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be possible after it is made and if a resolution annulling it is passed within the next 21 days on which the Houses sat after it was laid before them, the scheme is annulled.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides that ministerial pensions paid to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament will be reduced by 25% between the passing of this Bill and the next general election in the case of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and in the case of the Members of the European Parliament, the next European Parliament elections.  Such pensions will cease to be paid to sitting Members on the respective dates.</P><Col N="862"/>
        <P>For the sake of completeness and transparency, I would like to inform the House that it may be the intention of the Minister to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to permit changes to be made to the present parliamentary allowances system such as may be agreed between the Minister and the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas to be introduced by regulation.  However, consideration of this is continuing and should such an amendment be tabled and made, then this Bill would have to return to the Seanad next week.</P>
        <P>In regard to the detail of the sections, section 1 covers interpretation and defines &ldquo;Act of 1938&rdquo; as the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938.  Section 2 provides that long service increments will not be paid to those Members who would normally have qualified for a long service increment on or after 13 May 2009.  It also provides that long service increments will not be paid to any Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas after the next general election.</P>
        <P>Section 3 is concerned with pensions awarded to officeholders under the old officeholders&rsquo; pensions scheme, that is, those who qualified for such pensions before 13 January 1992 when the new officeholders&rsquo; pension scheme was introduced, and who did not opt to join the new scheme.  Officeholders are the Taoiseach, Ministers, Ministers of State, etc.  The section provides that between the passing of this Act and the next general election, officeholder pensions paid to sitting Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will be reduced by 25% and the pensions will cease to be paid to such Members after the next general election.  In the case of members of the European Parliament, the reduction will apply until the next European Parliament elections.  Pensions will cease to be paid after that date for sitting Members.</P>
        <P>Section 4 is concerned with pensions awarded to officeholders under the new officeholders pension scheme to persons who have three years or more of qualifying service. New scheme members are those who first qualified for an officeholder&rsquo;s pension after 13 January 1993 when the new scheme came into effect.  It also includes persons who had already qualified under the old scheme for an officeholder&rsquo;s pension but who opted into the new scheme.  These pensions are not paid until the person concerned reaches age 50 and the pension is reduced to one-half while the former officeholder is sitting in either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament.  The only exception is for former Taoisigh, in which case the pension is not reduced.</P>
        <P>The section provides that between the passing of this Act and the next general election officeholder pensions being paid to sitting Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will be reduced by 25%.  This provision is given effect by reducing the pensions by 62.5% rather than 50%.  It also provides for a reduction of 25% in the pension paid to former Taoisigh who are Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament.  As I have said, at present, such a former Taoiseach&rsquo;s pension is not reduced.  The section also provides that the pensions will cease to be paid to such Members after the next general election.  In the case of members of the European Parliament, the reduction in the pension will apply until the next elections for the European Parliament and then the officeholder pensions will cease to be paid after that date.  Section 4 also provides for some technical amendments to the legislation by the renumbering of an existing provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 5 deals with ministerial, secretarial, Minister of State and other officeholder pensions awarded under the new scheme to persons who have more than two but less than three years&rsquo; qualifying service.  The qualifying period for officeholder pensions was reduced from three years to two in 2001.  The provisions of section 5 are essentially the same as those in section 4.  It provides that the officeholders&rsquo; pensions will cease to be paid to former Ministers who are sitting Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament after the next <?oasys _dc18- ?>elections.  In the meantime, the pensions paid to such sitting Members will be reduced by 25%.<?oasys _dc0- ?>  Section 6 provides for the Short Title and collective citation.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>We would all welcome many of the changes proposed in the legislation and support the reasons for them.  These are changing economic times and everyone must play their part.  People who hold positions as Chairmen of committees have had their allowances cut in half and Vice Chairmen, Whips and convenors have had their allowances abolished.  Members&rsquo; travel expenses have been massively reduced.  What is proposed in this Bill is an expansion of that approach.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that this legislation may be challenged in the future.  One of the reasons given for the proposed reduction in the ministerial pensions paid to sitting TDs being limited to 25% is that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was that those affected could claim a form of property right and that the reduction had to be proportionate to that imposed on other groups.  Essentially, the Minister was saying that the reason it is not proposed to abolish ministerial pensions for sitting TDs is that they could take the Government to court and make the case that they had an expectation that they were due to receive a ministerial pension and therefore they should be paid it.  If the reduction in the ministerial pension is limited to 25% that would seem to pass any such test because it is proportionate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was interested in that aspect, given that it is proposed Members&rsquo; long service increments will be abolished.  I question if that measure could be challenged by the individuals concerned who had an expectation that they would receive a long service increment.  Members who were elected in the previous election would have had an expectation that they were to receive a long service increment.  The explanatory memorandum indicates that the savings arising from this measure in a full year is estimated to be &euro;128,000.  The savings that will arise when the long service increments are abolished after the next general election will be approximately &euro;500,000.  If the Government had decided to make a 25% reduction in the long service increments for all the individuals concerned, there would be no possibility that measure would be challenged in any court because its application would be seen to be proportionate.  A 25% reduction in the figure of &euro;500,000 would equate to the &euro;128,000 savings that will be achieved under the proposed measure.  While politically it may appear better, there is a question as to whether this measure could be challenged legally at some point in the future.  Individuals who would have expected to receive their first or second long service increment may consider challenging this measure using the advice the Attorney General gave the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, as the reason for the reduction in ministerial pensions by 25%.</P>
        <P>In regard to the abolition of long service increments after the next general election, I would like to tease out this proposal as it involves legal issues.  A Senator&rsquo;s pay is linked to a TD&rsquo;s pay, which in turn has been linked to the pay of a principal officer in the Civil Service.  Even though that linkage is not covered under the Constitution or any defined legal agreements, it has come about in terms of reports on Government in recent years in terms of the linking of a TD&rsquo;s pay to that of the pay of a standard principal officer grade in the Civil Service.  A conflict may arise as to whether that linkage could be challenged.  Perhaps the Government has plans in regard to the payment of long service increments to staff in the civil and public service, but the Minister should be mindful that these measures could be legally challenged.  That is the issue that stands out when one considers the debates that have taken place on this matter.  There is strong potential that the immediate abolition of long service increments would be legally challenged, but there could also be a legal challenge if they were to be abolished after the next general election.</P>
        <P>In regard to ministerial pensions, it seems wrong that a TD who loses ministerial office should continue to be paid a ministerial pension as long as he or she is a Member of the Oireachtas.  The ministerial pension scheme and the pension scheme for TDs and Senators is generous compared with private sector pension schemes.  That reflects the unpredictable nature of being a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It reflects the fact that one can find oneself out on one&rsquo;s ear fairly quickly.  It is said that one is not a real politician until one has won and lost an election.  I managed to achieve that fairly quickly.  However, continuing to pay a ministerial pension to a sitting TD on a substantial salary was not right and needed to be addressed.  That is the sort of thing that gives the public a bad impression and brings to mind the expressions &ldquo;gravy train&rdquo; and &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo;.  The public is not as anti-politician as they would like us to think if they believe we are being reasonable.  They do not mind politicians getting a pension having served a certain amount of time, but maybe not a long time, because of the nature of the job we do.</P>
        <P>I would be the first to admit that the pension is good, but there is a need to make some changes.  Some of the procedures relating to certain allowances and fees could be misconstrued by the public who are facing much tougher times than we are facing.  There is a need for people to understand the job we do and the difficulties of that job, but there is also a need for us to understand that when people feel they are under attack they must stand up for certain things.  Linking TDs&rsquo; pay to a grade within the Civil Service is an important move because it removes the political aspect from it.  TDs are then paid the same salary as individuals in a grade because their work has been deemed comparable to the work of that grade and they cannot be paid an extra salary for any other reason.  In terms of the allowance Members of the Oireachtas get, most Members can defend them adequately.  However, if the public feels we are hiding anything or that something is a bit opaque, we should shine a strong light on it and explain properly why we get what we get.  It is easy for people who have lost their jobs or who have gone on a three-day week and are suffering now to attack politicians.  It is becoming easier as well for people to attack civil and public servants.  It is important for us as politicians and public servants &mdash; as a doctor I consider myself to be a public servant &mdash; to stand up for what we do and defend what we get.  It is also important, however, to empathise with the individuals who are in trouble.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to examine the points I have made so that this will not be seen in a couple of years&rsquo; time as having been a waste of time because somebody can conclusively prove in the courts that the Minister has done the wrong thing.  That was my concern when I was looking at this legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Bill 2009 as proposed by the Leader.  As a former shop steward and member of the Insurance and Finance Branch of SIPTU, I never thought I would see the day when I would be putting through a Bill that would reduce my terms and conditions of employment.  However, the realities of the world are such that Ireland is no longer competitive in the world market and we are paying a very high price for that.  To become competitive we must take certain steps, the first of which is to lead by example.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey and I have crossed swords on occasion but much of what he said tonight was very worthwhile and interesting and, whereas I might not agree with every aspect of it, it was beneficial to the overall debate.  Our attempts to be seen to do the right thing by the national economy and to give guidance are made against the backdrop of previous experience in 1932 when a general depression set in.  At that time the aim was to ensure people had enough.  We are certainly past the days of people having enough.  In many cases recently there was huge excess.  I refer to the types of salaries in the private sector that caused outrage and caused us to wonder what types of jobs were being advertised at &euro;700,000 per annum.  These jobs were not for managing directors of a company but for heads of corporate compliance or something like that.  The salaries were excessive and they were astounding to some of us, although we were being well paid.</P><Col N="865"/>
        <P>I am conscious that we should ensure that everybody is treated fairly, and there was an attempt to do so in the supplementary budget.  Many hours, days, weeks and months were spent working to ensure equity and fairness were achieved and that nobody was left out.  If there are cuts in county councils I do not like to see the man with the shovel being the one asked to leave.  I would like to see proportionate measures so that not just those least able to defend themselves or the less well-heeled are looked after, but everybody.  It is on that aspect that we will ultimately be judged.</P>
        <P>Times have changed.  In different times we could afford more.  It was always questionable that a pension should be paid to a sitting Member of the Oireachtas, particularly when ministerial pensions are generous by any standard.  There is a reason they are generous, however.  There are not many jobs where one needs to expend so much money.  A Seanad campaign costs at least &euro;30,000 while a D&aacute;il campaign can cost &euro;70,000.  Many people spend less while others spend more.  There are not many jobs that involve such expenditure.  We have been fortunate in the past few years in that we have had five-year terms.  In the 1980s, however, there were five D&aacute;il elections, one in 1981, two in 1982, one in 1987 and one in 1989.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>If I am mistaken in those dates, I know that Members went into debt to serve in these Houses.  It should never be the case, and it was never intended to be the case, that only the wealthy could afford to be in public life.  When one considers that the average term in these Houses is now approximately 11 or 12 years, and that is not a long life cycle, it surprises me that members of the media, who often do not look for balance, wonder why Members hold on to jobs while they are Members of the Houses.  Of course they will hold onto jobs because the average term is 11 or 12 years and they have to consider themselves and their futures.</P>
        <P>There are many interesting parts to this Bill.  I ask the mandarins from the Department of Finance &mdash; it is not a derogatory term but gives great credit to their abilities &mdash; to examine one part of it as it is something I do not understand.  The section concerned provides that between the passing of this Bill and the next general election pensions being paid to sitting Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will be reduced by 25%, which is straightforward enough.  The provision is given effect by reducing the pension by 62.5%, rather than 50%.  I may have missed something very significant, but if one wished to reduce somebody&rsquo;s pension by 25%, one would cut it by 25% and not by 62.5% or 50%.  I may be reading the provision incorrectly, but if one wished to reduce a pension by 25% that is what one would do.</P>
        <P>There are very positive and necessary aspects to this Bill.  I ask that we continue to ensure there is fairness.  All of us will accept the cuts that are necessary.  I commend those in this House who have been in a position to take extra cuts and have done so voluntarily.  I suggest we ensure at all times that nobody feels he or she was singled out compared to the person next to him or her.  It is very difficult to do, but it is something the last supplementary budget achieved in full and I would like the Government to continue to examine that area.</P>
        <P>The terms and conditions should reflect the times we are in.  We are in more difficult times.  Things will improve once we ensure our competitiveness and banking structures are correct, which is essential not to insure bankers but, rather, the economy, which depends on the banks.  We must also ensure there is liquidity in the economy and get people back to work.  We are facing difficult and challenging times, but the reality is that we have to take a lead.  I am certain this Bill is a major step forward in taking a lead to show people that we are serious about what we intend to do and that we will lead by example.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now 12.45 a.m.  I pay tribute to the members of staff who have to be here to allow us to debate this very important Bill.  There are people who should have gone home long ago and, for a variety of reasons, are still here and are allowing us to debate this Bill.</P>
        <P>I agree with much of what Senator Hanafin said.  His chronological account of the elections of the early 1980s is quite correct.  There were general elections in June 1981, February 1982 and November 1982.  The only five-year term of the 1980s was from November 1982 to the summer of 1987 which was, in effect, four and a half years.  It was the only term that spanned five calendar years.  During that time the country was in the grip of a major economic depression, unemployment had spiralled to levels that were previously unseen and the national debt, interest rates and emigration were significant issues.  Governments of various hues tried to deal as best they could with the economic situation of the day, but fell because they could not reach consensus.  It was a very dark, murky time for the Irish Republic, for some more than others.</P>
        <P>When I was elected to Cork County Council ten years ago, I remember learning about various members who had served on the local authority, some who had very distinguished careers, were very lucky and had been re-elected and others who had lost their council seats.  Tragically, in terms of political careers, people had mortgaged houses and borrowed money from banks to finance election campaigns in the 1980s.  Some only had six month terms, went on to contest Seanad elections and had no success there.  What did they have towards the end of their political careers?  They had nothing.  They had no job because they had lost their D&aacute;il seats and were not successful in Seanad elections.  They only thing they could boast of was a parking space in Dublin which they could only use if they were here, which was not much good to somebody tucked in the recesses of the southern parts of Munster.</P>
        <P>One case concerned a Member who had lost his D&aacute;il seat and had arranged to visit the leader of his party &mdash; I will try to spare blushes by being as vague as I can &mdash; with a Telecom &Eacute;ireann phone bill for more than &pound;600 which he could not afford to pay.  He had a wife and a young family.  He was not very old and is still working in the public sector, but he had been bankrupted by politics.  We must bear in mind, in the context of debating this Bill, that it was not a very well-paid job back then and there was no security of tenure.  There was no guarantee that one was here for any length of time.</P>
        <P>What has changed since then?  There have been, as Senator Hanafin quite rightly pointed out, five-year terms.  It is an unusual feature in politics but has been in place since 1997.  Most of us have replaced people who have served on local authorities or in the Oireachtas.  If one looks at the wealth or status of such people in terms of assets, in my case it is not much.  I do not see millionaires who have made significant amounts of money from politics.  I see people who have given of their time to get elected, have given service to the public and have not benefitted from politics in the same way in which they would have benefitted from a trade, occupation or profession outside politics.</P>
        <P>The media discusses politics a lot, such as the <i>Sunday Independent</i> which stated Deputies were running off for three months of holidays while the country is stuck in an economic quagmire.  That is not the case.  There are people, including some in this House, who have made the case for a pay cut across the public sector and that we should lead by volunteering to take pay cuts and giving up long service increments.  I am one of those affected by the long service increment and I do not mind giving it up.  It is a sacrifice we must make to show some element of solidarity with those who have lost their jobs and will lose their jobs before the year is out.</P>
        <P>I do not write for a newspaper.  This is my job and occupation.  I do not have a job to fall back on; I resigned a permanent, pensionable job to contest an election in 2002.  I do not have <Col N="867"/>the luxury of saying we should take a 10% or 20% pay cut and fall back on an occupational pension from a previous incarnation.  I am 32 years of age and my wife and I have a 30-year mortgage with two years of it paid for.  We have just been blessed with a new baby.  We have a young family.  That type of dynamic does not exist with those who can lecture and pontificate about what we should be doing.  I do not job-share with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  I do not have something to fall back on.  I do not have pensions.  I do not do this job in my spare time.</P>
        <P>In agreeing this Bill, we are agreeing to forgo a long service increment, and rightly so.  However, I have an issue, namely, serving Members of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann who are in receipt of ministerial pensions.  They have been elected, have served their time and have been lucky to have been selected for office.  If we are serious about the long service increment, why does it not affect those who already have it?  Would it be fair and proper now to go to the public sector, including nurses, garda&iacute; and teachers, and say Deputies and Senators have led by forgoing the long service increment?  What other arm of the public sector would agree to that?  Would it be acceptable to go to any other arm of the public sector?  No, it would not.</P>
        <P>We are constantly under the spotlight and being held to account, and rightly so.  However, it is time for a level playing pitch.  Very few Members of the House qualify for the long service increment this month.  I am one and I am happy to forgo it.  I wrote to the one stop shop in January and told it I would be happy to forgo the payment in solidarity with those the length and breadth of the country who have lost their jobs.</P>
        <P>When we debate this Bill, let us bear balance and fairness in mind.  Let us judge those who argue in favour of it in terms of what they are themselves, because I get sick and fed-up of pious platitudes and people who say politicians are all in it for themselves, that they are all creaming it.  I have the political bug, and am very honoured to have been elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on two occasions and to have been elected to a local authority.  It is a significant honour to bestow on an individual by their peers, as has happened most of us.  We are accountable to those people and are lucky to be here.  I have the political bug; I chased it and find it very fulfilling.  I believe politics is worthwhile and that we can effect change but if the majority of Members of this House had remained in their previous occupations I am sure they would have earned more money.  I could earn double what I do as a Senator and would not be judged once every quarter by an excuse for a newspaper that uses the Freedom of Information Act.  Some newspapers say we are all in this job for the money and that we will be gone from July to October.  They say when we return we will pay lip service to the economic situation the country faces between October and Christmas, but this is not the case.</P>
        <P>There is very little in this Bill with which I disagree and I am happy the Leader has decided to take Second Stage tonight.  I do not think it would be appropriate to rush such legislation without proper examination because there are issues that require further scrutiny.  It seems to me the language of the Bill refers to people here and now and not other Members of the Oireachtas after the next election.  Does this mean those currently in receipt of the long-service increment will lose it after the next general election?  I look forward to teasing out the issues relating to the other Stages with the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget our colleagues who have lost out and who never made substantial sums of money from politics.  Public service is a duty and to be elected is an honour.  Through the years there have been around 2,000 Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and only a handful were involved in activities that required examination by tribunals.  It is a tribute to our democracy that most people have endeavoured to serve this country well and leave it in a better state than it was in when they got involved in public service.  Let us not forget the figures, accountability and the great contribution we all must make.</P><Col N="868"/>
        <P>The Attorney General advised the Government it can reduce the ministerial pensions to current Members of the Oireachtas by 25% but that does not go far enough.  If the Government had left this matter to Members&rsquo; own devices some would have volunteered to surrender their pensions.  The ministerial pension was surrendered by a former Member of this House who did not run to the media seeking recognition and this must be commended.  Regardless of party affiliation, I wish all Members were the same because this is about showing solidarity with workers all over the country who have lost their jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation can be looked at from a number of angles.  There is no doubt that for most of the history of this State the salaries of those involved in public life compared very badly with salaries in the private sector and in the upper reaches of the Civil Service.  Systems were put in place to compensate for this, such as income tax at half the rate of ordinary workers and expenses and allowances that were hard to account for.  Many theories exist as to how political representatives should be paid.  Some people make a virtue of payment of the average industrial wage to public representatives, though I never hear these people suggesting payment of a minimum wage.  After all there are wages above and below the average industrial wage.  Another theory suggests that if one pays peanuts one gets monkeys but the history of this State shows many incompetent people in public life have received very high salaries.  A high salary is no guarantee of success, in terms of public policy.  It is always difficult to strike the appropriate balance.</P>
        <P>In the past ten to 15 years we have sleepwalked into a situation where levels of pay for public representatives are linked to salaries in the private sector and higher reaches of the Civil Service.  However, we have held on to the vestiges of old systems that should have been changed.  This Bill is an attempt to make some of the necessary changes.  Like Senator McCarthy, I would like to see the changes made in one clean sweep and I am conscious of the advice of the Attorney General as to how this should be done.  I am also conscious that the legislation is framed to accept that advice.</P>
        <P>I will repeat what I said elsewhere.  In terms of the current economic situation, these changes show political solidarity with the lot of all citizens.  There is also a need to readjust wages across the board and the public service must be part of this as we must re-establish competitiveness in our economy.  The reality is that money paid to public representatives and politicians is out of sync with other countries.  To achieve competitiveness in our society we must have rates of pay and systems of allowances that reflect the new reality and this Bill is a sincere attempt to address this.</P>
        <P>The concept of paying pensions to serving politicians should be long gone.  Members should not be allowed to hold on to jobs in the education system, though this Bill does not deal with the matter.  At the same time, a myth has been created as to how, and the extent to which, people benefit.  I was a candidate for a Government party in the recent European election and I have lost count of how many people told me that in the event of my leaving public life, I will be entitled to a considerable pension.  As best I can work it out, it comes to &euro;300 per week.</P>

I think this is a good change.</P><Col N="869"/>
        <P>If an election is held in 2011, the money saved from 2009 to that year will amount to &euro;1 million.  I fear the impact of this Bill will be minimal.  Due to a mythology that exists, there will be little public thanks for the passing of this legislation.  We must look at the wider picture.  I was formerly a community, youth and social worker and when I was elected to the other House in 2002 my new salary was a multiple of what I had earned.  This does not reflect what others have said in this House.  Within a short period I found myself with a significant sum in my bank account because I spent money like a person on a lower salary.  However, I suddenly started spending money like a TD and found that my bank account was soon back at the level it had occupied before I was a Deputy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>During this debate others have referred to costs.  I live some distance from the national Parliament, spend half the week in Dublin and continue to have a public office in my shadow constituency as a Member of the Seanad.  The cost of all this is around &euro;50,000 per year.  Our expenses do not reflect this properly.  We are paid too much for travel and accommodation and not enough for our offices and running costs.  However, the figures probably add up to be the same anyway.  If we want greater public acceptance we really need to change that system so as not to bring upon ourselves the public opprobrium felt towards the British Parliament.  We need more openness and transparency and more legislation of this type.  We should not see this as a way of winning public favour at a time when politics and politicians are not well thought of.  It is a first small but important step towards greater reforms which are still necessary.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it to the House.  It is probably the most botched legislation the Government has ever brought in to deal with our role as public representatives.  Senator Boyle was right to ask what a public representative should be paid.  This is a PR exercise on the part of Government to save face by using politicians as guinea pigs, or as camels to ride into the sandstorm.  As the Leader is fond of saying, it is a privilege to be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and it is an honour for me to be elected by the electorate of Cork County Council and Cork City Council.  We are an honourable profession and we should never be ashamed to say so.  The six of us present in the House tonight represent the people.  We work unsocial hours and would do it for nothing if we could get elected.</P>
        <P>As Senator Boyle said, the old system is being laid to rest.  The salaries paid to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Ministers of State and the Attorney General are absurd.  One can add the cost of advisers or hangers-on, whatever one may wish to call them.  President Obama published the amounts of money paid to a number of his advisers and they were considerably lower than the amounts paid to advisers to the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and other members of the Cabinet.</P>

        <P>The aspect of this which upsets me most is the increment.  I have been a school teacher for over 20 years.  Every few years I receive an increment and I am entitled to it based on the service I have given to the school.  I will not get votes from this and the media will probably deride me for saying so, but non-ministerial office holders, whether they are Senators or Deputies, should not be afraid to stand up for what we believe in.  I do not think taking away the increment for non-office holders is the right decision.  However, I believe members of the public will look at the cuts in this Bill and decide they are not enough.</P><Col N="870"/>
        <P>The remuneration is good and the allowances are generous for ordinary Senators and Deputies but let us start the process with the Cabinet and its entourage.  Can the Minister of State say if we have cut that entourage and the other costs incurred by Cabinet?  If officials and civil servants had their increments taken away they would go out on strike but we cannot do that.  I have no difficulty with the abolition of pensions for Ministers who are serving Deputies, nor with pay cuts.  I have no difficulty with not being able to claim an allowance as a Senator for my job in the school.  That is a fair move and we need fairness.  However, I do not agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s claim that the Government has shown leadership.  We are in the position we are in today because of the way Fianna F&aacute;il has run the country for the past 12 years.  It is like an animal farm, where the slogan was &ldquo;two legs good, four legs better&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle is right there must be transparency and accountability.  I run a full-time office in the constituency of Cork South-Central but do not receive a brass penny for it.  Maybe this Bill will be a catalyst to fix the cleavage in Irish politics and get rid of clientelism.  It might force people to question the job of a Deputy or Senator.  Is their job to be at the beck and call of everybody and do work on the ground but to forget about legislation?  It is 1.30 a.m. and we are debating legislation we should have debated throughout the day, instead of rushing it.  We need a wider debate about what we want parliamentarians to do.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle was also correct to say that the cost of politics was increasing for the ordinary person who gets involved.  I would hate a situation to arise in which politics were the preserve of the rich and only a select few could run for office.  I am not a wealthy person and have no aspiration to have riches.  I want to be a representative of the people, as is the case with many of my colleagues.  As politicians we have a fundamental choice between a system which has accountability, transparency and value for money and one that does not have those things.  I ask the media, who are very quick to jump on politicians, to look into their own profession because there is much to which they have turned a blind eye but we are soft targets.</P>
        <P>The Bill is welcome and must be the beginning of a change in politics.  I hope we will all be treated with fairness and equality because such things are the cornerstone of the democracy of which I want to be a part.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important we recognise that we have a difficult economy which has been ailing for the past 12 months.  We are now responding to the private sector, which has taken very substantial pay cuts of between 15% and 25%.  This Bill makes a statement to the 400,000 people who are unemployed to the effect that we understand what they are going through and will reduce our salaries in response.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable that Senators or Ministers should draw a pension while still working and the provision to change that aspect is the most just part of this Bill.  However, I agree with Senator Buttimer on the subject of increments.  As Senator Hanafin said, there were regulations and agreements in place for this House but this Bill diminishes them and that is a mistake.  It has cost some people a fortune to go into politics, whether they ran for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann or local authorities.  Senator McCarthy rightly empathises with people who were broke when they left politics and I also know such people.  There is no guarantee of a job in politics.  One is lucky if the people vote for one and put one into either this or the Lower House.  I am very grateful to be here.</P>
        <P>What really lets the system down badly is that when we go to the trouble of dealing with legislation such as this, there is a situation in this House which we have not dealt with and I do not know whether we have the courage to deal with it.  Although this is not the time to be <Col N="871"/>doing it, I want to bring to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention that &euro;500,000 is spent by these Houses on RTE and the national and multinational press which work out of this building.  I would like to see some effort in this area.  These are all profitable organisations whose representatives in these Houses are highly paid, use telephones and desks, and enjoy heating and subsidised food.  Despite this, they write stories about public representatives not doing their jobs while they can telephone their granny in Australia, New Zealand or wherever at the expense of the State.  It is time we had the courage to stop that.  A sum of &euro;500,000 would keep a great many people looking after the sick and elderly in our hospitals.  I would like to see that addressed and I will address it in more detail tomorrow morning on the Order of Business.  When we legislate we should not take the soft options.  That is an option which could have been in the Bill and is one we should still look at.  I do not see why Dr. Tony O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s journalists or those from <i>The Irish Times</i> who are in these Houses should be subsidised by this or any Parliament for that matter.  While it is important they play their part, I have not heard any one of them giving good press to any politician no matter what time of the morning we sit.</P>
        <P>This legislation is welcome.  I am happy to be a Member of this House and I am happy to take a reduction in salary as a signal to the people who are not so happy, who are unemployed and who may have very little hope in life.  At least we can make some contribution towards the retention of the small amount of money that such people are paid to keep them in basic food and services to which they are entitled and to which they contributed.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to this House where he spends a great deal of time.  He gives Members an excellent explanation of all of the legislation he presents in this House and I thank him for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to delay the House because it is 1.15 a.m.  Fairness and balance is what we seek in this legislation.  We are doing the right thing because we are leading by example.  We are showing those who have lost their jobs that while the allocation of money involved is small, it is leading by example.  It is a small lead, but it is the example that really matters.  I certainly support the Minister of State in his efforts.</P>
        <P>I remember in 1982 the salary of a Senator was &euro;9,100; today it is &euro;70,000.  However, there are the levies, income tax and all those deductions that come out of it.  Members are lucky to have &euro;35,000 in take-home pay.</P>
        <P>It is temporary employment.  As I have seen down through the years, the D&aacute;il changes its membership by approximately 30% in every general election, with the exception of 1982 when 55 TDs ceased membership of the D&aacute;il through retirement or not being re-elected.  Also in that year there were 16 outgoing members of Fine Gael in the Seanad, 14 of whom did not return.  There were 14 new Members along with two long-standing colleagues, who are still Members of the House and distinguished colleagues.</P>
        <P>That goes to show the difficulty entailed in the permanent employment of being a public representative.  One gives away everything.  One gives away one&rsquo;s independence and one&rsquo;s privacy.  One puts one&rsquo;s availability to the nation first before one&rsquo;s family and oneself.  Like colleagues, I know many wealthy people who became Members of both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad over the years &mdash; I have been coming here since 1963 &mdash; who left this House penniless, and it was worse years ago.</P>
        <P>When I became a Member in 1982, there were five Members, four TDs and myself as a Senator, in the one office.  We had one secretary and we booked our hour on the telephone because there was only one.  Of course, being the junior Member, I was given the 5 o&rsquo;clock to <Col N="872"/>6 o&rsquo;clock time slot.  We have come a long way in being given the tools of our ware and of this technological age.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is held in high regard throughout the nation as someone who has served the country well to the limit.  With many Taoisigh, he played a pivotal role in the North of Ireland.  He is most welcome in this House.  He is a great supporter of this House and a former Member.</P>
        <P>The area I want to address is the expectation of the long-service increment to TDs and Senators.  The long-service increment is not gained but worked hard for.  The reason the long-service increments were made on seven years and then increased on ten years was for the positions the TDs and Senators were holding as Front Bench spokespersons or assistant spokespersons on the various Departments.  They had no research back-up.  They had nothing.  The Front Bench spokespersons of the Opposition parties in the D&aacute;il in particular and of all sides in the Seanad do not get anything for their research or for what they do, yet they take on the extra responsibility of spokesperson on behalf of their party.  That remuneration is now being removed in the national interest.  I am pleased to learn that those who have the long-service increments will be able to avail of them with their pension rights.  I would like to think that when the economy turns around in a few years&rsquo; time, these long-service increments, which are incentive payments to those of us who are spokespersons, would be looked at again.</P>
        <P>On the remuneration for committee Chairmen, which was reduced by 50%, Vice Chairmen and convenors, surely given the tribunal experience and the tens of millions of euro it has cost the taxpayers, the success of committees has been central to saving the taxpayer.  Look at what the DIRT inquiry of the Committee of Public Accounts, chaired by the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, saved the taxpayer, and the deliberations of the committee were successfully concluded within a short period.  Look at the way the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which I chaired in the previous D&aacute;il, dealt with high insurance costs at the time and how we saved premium holders tens of millions of euro just by having the members of the committee present and giving the small remuneration to the Chairman, the Vice Chairman and the convenor.  This is a retrograde step in the case of committees because they save the taxpayer massive sums of money in the long term compared with the work being done in the tribunals, work which should be done under the scrutiny of the television cameras with everything available for the purposes of openness and transparency.  Committees do such work in record time.</P>
        <P>When the economy returns to normal, we must give the tools of the ware to the committee system in the House because I can see it playing a central role in EU scrutiny which has not been carried out to the extent it should be.  I recall when I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business the enormous volume of post, weighing almost half a stone, that used to come to me every day.</P>
        <P>There are other areas I could touch on but it is late.  The Bill is welcome and shows we are giving example.  I would like to think the few points I made from my long years of experience would not be forgotten when the economy, hopefully, improves in the not too distant future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true, as the Leader said, we must lead by example.  That is the way one brings people with one.  The general public, as Senator Buttimer said, should not be the reason for this legislation.  We have to do the right thing because the general public and the media will not thank us for the new arrangements we are making.</P>
        <P>Senator Cassidy made a valid point on remuneration.  When I worked in the Civil Service, the post office, in the 1980s and budgets were tight, the basic pay was so bad one could not <Col N="873"/>survive on it if one did not get overtime.  Overtime made up half the basic pay.  At the time we had to take the pay cut but when business picked up again our wages went back to where they had been.</P>
        <P>As Senator Buttimer said politics is a costly job in which to stay.  There is not a day of the week &ndash; I am sure most Members have the same experience &ndash; when I do not get letters from all groups in my constituency looking for &euro;200, &euro;500 or &euro;600.  If I were to pay it all out, half my salary would be gone in subscriptions to these groups just to stay in business.  Regarding Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s other point about staying in business, one needs an office in a constituency, one has to keep up to speed and one needs high-tech equipment.  Members get no allowance for this whatsoever.</P>
        <P>The definition of expenses is that when one is out of pocket, one is reimbursed.  I do not believe anyone in any job should be out of pocket.  However, we should not make martyrs out of ourselves just to show the public we will go along with this.  We should not demean ourselves to such a degree that we become doormats and there would be no respect for us.</P>
        <P>Recently at a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting I became unpopular for raising the issue of Members receiving a salary and ministerial pension at the same time.  It does not happen in any other walk of life and I am glad action is being taken on this.  That was the one issue about which the public was complaining.</P>
        <P>Regarding the point that we are linked to civil servants&rsquo; salaries, I counter that I am in politics because I like it.  I am not in politics to become rich.  When I was first elected to the Oireachtas, I was informed by some Members that their salaries were very bad.  When I delved into it, I realised that for some of them politics was only a sideline because they had large businesses and were millionaires and billionaires.  I could understand what they were saying about salaries as we have to compare like with like.  However, my bank statements verify that at the end of every month I hardly break even due to the fact I must pay a large amount to keep in business.</P>
        <P>We must lead by example.  However, at the same time we must be paid for what we do.  Politics is a high-risk business and it is difficult to stay in it.  Many pay a high price for politics with family life affected as well as one&rsquo;s own.  In some cases, one&rsquo;s health can be affected.  Many had short careers in politics due to health reasons.  As Senator Butler said, many left the Houses broke, some of whom I know myself.  I welcome the ministerial pensions aspect of the Bill.  I concur with our Leader, Senator Cassidy, that when times get good again this legislation should be re-examined.</P>
        <P>Members often say they would earn ten times as much if they were not in the Houses.  That rubbish annoys me.  I say to them they should leave as there is no one chaining them to here.  Some Members complain it is terrible in here when they could be outside earning so much or being a doctor.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  I agree with him that because of the huge change in our fiscal fortunes there is a need for us to address this area in the interests of the overall economy.  Several efforts have been made over the past six months to get to grips with this, but even so we are still facing a budget deficit of some &euro;20 billion or &euro;22 billion.  There is much work to be done on this.</P>
        <P>There are two trends of thought on the long service increment.  One, prevalent in the public service, is that it is there to reward people for their experience and, in turn, assist them in doing their job.  In recognition of that, they get paid on an incremental scale.  The other view is that people should be paid according to their ability, performance and responsibility.  Having spent most of my working life in the private sector, I am more inclined to the latter.  I know there are difficulties, particularly for administrative positions, in making that distinction and making judgments.  Nonetheless, it has been done in the private sector.</P>
        <P>I am not sure how effectively bonus schemes have been applied in the public sector as they seem generally to apply to people regardless of performance.  For many in semi-State companies, it seems to apply even when the company&rsquo;s fortunes are not very good.  We have seen this in the banking sector as well.  There are certain underlying principles which should apply to the application of bonuses.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provision for long-service increments came about because of a newspaper campaign which referred to them as bonuses.  Given the opprobrium people have towards bonuses, particularly the banking sector&rsquo;s bonuses, the continuance of increments was not going to get public support.</P>
        <P>It has been said those of us elected to office to represent people should give a lead in difficult times, a point with which I concur.  Obviously, the amount of money being saved through this legislation, even when all long-service increments will be abolished after the next general election, will make no difference to the fiscal position.  Who else in the public sector will follow this example?  Unless applied across the public service, this provision is meaningless in correcting the public finances.  The pension scheme has been changed during the time of most of us here, i.e. during the last term and previous terms, and entitlement to the pension now applies at age 65, as happens in the private sector.  I have concerns about the voluntary early retirement scheme which will give people pensions at age 50.  The actuarial cost of that has not been evaluated and I believe it will be significant.  We are fortunate to be in the public service.  We would not be able to buy these pensions if we were in the private sector and we should recognise that.  I believe that at some stage the pensions we have will have to be abandoned, but there is a reasonable expectation by those working in the service that their current entitlement will continue.</P>
        <P>I want to raise a couple of anomalies.  This applies only to those who were there prior to the change and who were entitled to a pension after the age of 50, whose pensions will be affected as a consequence of this legislation.  As I understand it, however, it is affected only if they continue to be a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  That creates an anomaly.  A Member who has been a Minister will not be paid a ministerial pension while he or she continues to work in these Houses regardless of age.  The import of this Bill is that that would <Col N="875"/>apply even after the age of 65.  However, if a Minister leaves politics and takes up another profession, say as a barrister, he or she could be charging fees of &euro;1 million in a year, which I understand is not unusual for a member of the Bar Council, and still get the benefit of an Oireachtas pension.  That is inequitable and should be looked at because it is essential that everybody should make a contribution across the board and that the system be demonstrably fair.  If it is not, it will be difficult to persuade people across the broader spectrum of society to play their part in countering the difficulties and challenges confronting us and that we must overcome in the interests of the next generation and of regenerating the economy.  If my interpretation is correct, I ask the Minister to comment on what can be done in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that Government members reduced their salaries by 10% last October and that Ministers of State made a similar reduction.  Was that 10% of the total salary of Ministers and Ministers of State, including their D&aacute;il salary, or was it 10% of only the ministerial part of it?  I understand that the 10% reduction applies only to the ministerial part of their salary and it is stretching the facts to say Ministers and Ministers of State have taken a reduction of 10% in their salaries.  They did not.  They took a 10% reduction in the additional payment they get on top of their TD salaries, which many people do not realise.  It is only right that the public should be made aware of that and that Members of the Oireachtas gave a false impression that the 10% reduction applied to the total amount they get.  That is not the case.</P>

It is a debate we should have had during the day because everybody should be getting the message.  This debate is about expenses.  It is about what we are.  It is about what we earn and what the public pay for us.  It is about what we do for the money we are paid.  It is a most important opportunity &mdash; that is the only reason I am delaying people here tonight &mdash; for us to sell a particular message.  I do not know whether the media are listening.  Perhaps I am speaking only to the people in this room, but if that is the case I know I am speaking to quality.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is probably right.  My first point is the timing of the debate tonight.  I am very interested in selling who and what I am.  I am a seven days a week, 20 hours a day politician.  When I said that on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; I received two e-mails immediately afterwards which stated that we were only doing the same as everybody else and that everybody was working hard.  I believe everybody works hard.  I was able to solve two problems that weekend of people who sent me e-mails challenging me as to whether I was really a seven days a week operator, whether I really have people&rsquo;s interests at heart when I say I am interested in politics as a career.</P>
        <P>I want to declare my interest in regard to the long service increments.  I have been in national politics for 13 years so I qualify for both increments.  I also qualify for an extra pension payment, having been a convenor and having been Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I, therefore, stand to lose in the next tranche of cuts, but if is in the national interest I have no problem with it.</P>
        <P>In the context of what Senator Brady said, if I had remained teaching I would have points for organising an orchestra, points for training a choir and points for taking on various responsibilities.  Had I been in nursing I would have points for undertaking different levels of <Col N="876"/>responsibility.  I do not know that we are so different from other public servants.  If we are different, what makes us different?  The longer one is in a job the more experienced one becomes.  More experience does not necessarily make one better.  However, in any other job time yields results in terms of points and financial gain.  I make the point that we are told we are not the same, but let me give the example of travel.  When I was first elected to the D&aacute;il and people in Donegal wanted me to meet them on a Tuesday or Wednesday I had to tell them I could not because that was when the D&aacute;il sat.  They would ask why I had to go to the D&aacute;il and I would answer that it was because they elected me to go there and legislate and that to do that I had to go to Dublin.  They wanted to know why it was in Dublin and why it could not be in Donegal.  I am not saying everybody thought that way.  When I attended a meeting on a Monday night somebody would ask why I spent so much time in Dublin when I should be in Donegal.  That is why I say we should be having this debate during the day when people can tune in and listen.  We need to find mechanisms to sell what we do because many people do not know why we are here.  I have to be here so the cut of 25% in mileage expenses was something I felt.  I am not sure that people out there knew about that cut.  If I were in another job I could choose to go to this or that conference, but I cannot choose whether to be here or not.  I have to be here because it is where the Seanad sits.</P>
        <P>We have been subject to public levies as well and it is important to say that because the public seem to think we are not affected by cuts.  I want to put on record the fact that as a Senator I can choose whether to have an office.  I chose to have one and keep a service to the national electorate, that is, the national public representatives in the county councils, and my constituents.  We do not receive allowances towards that.</P>
        <P>An interesting pilot project was done recently where the phone system in the Oireachtas was given to five people, of which I was one.  Despite having had the free service of that phone, I have still incurred phone bills.  My bills, even with the free service, still exceed the amount of allowances we receive.  The money spent on the services we provide to constituencies, constituents and taxpayers far exceeds the allowance we receive.</P>
        <P>When I was convenor of the health committee, we were involved in an examination of the issue of tobacco.  Our work contributed to the ban on smoking in public places that was introduced by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  When I was chair of the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, we pushed the issue of alcohol being brought under the national substance misuse strategy &mdash; it is now there.  We pushed for party pills to be banned, which has now happened.  I did a report on music therapy, and all of the issues concerning that have not yet been dealt with.  I am on the Council of Europe and I am sure at some stage someone will complain about the amount of money I spend on travel, but a report was passed unanimously by the Council on history teaching in conflict and post-conflict areas which I gave to Ban Ki-moon during his visit to the Oireachtas yesterday.</P>
        <P>A serious amount of work goes on here.  I have put reports together which required many hours of work.  Had we outsourced the 13 reports I did while chair of the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and reports done before and after that to consultants or others who receive a lot of money for these types of projects it would have cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of euro.</P>
        <P>The issue of understanding and valuing the work of a politician still needs to be addressed.  I do not expect praise or expect people to understand the ins and outs of it, but we do not stand here often enough and have time to sell our message, who we are and what we are doing.</P>

	<P>It is 1.45 a.m. and I have one question for the Minister of State.  In reviewing the Bill, I note that members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission receive &euro;20,000 per annum as an extra allowance for serving on it.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, stated that was to be halved, yet such a measure seems to be missing from the Bill.  He has touched on long service increments and chairs, vice chairs and convenors of committees.  Why is that the case?  Am I incorrect in my understanding?  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that point.  If I am correct, why would the members of the commission be excluded from the Bill?</P>

        <P>Many points have been raised and I would like to reply to them.  I will start with the last point made by Senator Healy Eames so she can go to bed.</P>

	<P>The matter she mentioned will be addressed by regulation and a regulation to that effect will be submitted to Government shortly.  The halving of the salary of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission does not require legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank everyone who spoke for their constructive and thoughtful contributions.  The background to the legislation is the very difficult economic situation in which, collectively and individually, we find ourselves.  Regardless of the fact that the savings to be made will be, comparatively, a drop in the ocean in terms of the problem we face, it is nonetheless important that such a contribution is made out of solidarity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Twomey raised the question of people&rsquo;s expectations and that receiving long-term increments could perhaps have created potential legal rights.  Legally, practically anything can be challenged and to say something can be challenged does not necessarily say a whole lot, because even the most clear-cut issues are sometimes challenged in court.  In the situation we are in, we cannot be constrained by what people&rsquo;s expectations were.  The reality of the current situation means we all have to lower our expectations.</P>
        <P>It is correct to say, and several speakers made the point, that pension arrangements for Members of the Oireachtas are very generous.  I had dinner with my son who has received an MBA and works in the pensions industry.  He made the point that Members&rsquo; pensions are as good as one will receive anywhere.  We should not be under any illusion about that.</P>
        <P>There was much discussion about long service increments.  It is important to remember that such increments for Oireachtas Members were introduced relatively recently, in 2001.  Arguments can made for both sides.  There may be something to be said for the notion of equality, that is, whether Members of the Oireachtas have been elected for a short period or a relatively long period of time.</P>
        <P>Not all of us understand how long service increments work in this House and the Civil Service.  Members do not receive annual increments, but after seven years receive the first long service increment and after ten years, until now, receive the second long service increment.  Civil servants receive annual increments up to a certain point and after that it levels off.  After three years at the maximum level of salary, they receive their first long service increment and after six years on maximum salary receive a second long service increment.</P><Col N="878"/>
        <P>Points were also made on bonuses.  As I said before, when I was a member of the Civil Service there were no bonuses of any kind.  For example, during the first Irish Presidency one could work very long hours seven days a week, but one did not get paid anything extra.  To be frank, I have a certain nostalgia for that type of egalitarian system, rather than having a system which has a &ldquo;one for everyone in the audience&rdquo; approach.</P>
        <P>Senator Cassidy made the point that it is temporary employment and after I was elected by a very small margin I was told by a person to enjoy my tenancy.  I liked that remark.  Both Senators Cassidy and Keaveney spoke of the success of the committees and the savings to taxpayers.  It was said that people should be proud of their profession but I do not think this necessarily must be linked to increments, pensions, bonuses and so on.</P>

	<P>One can be proud irrespective of recompense.</P>
        <P>Most politicians spend more money on their work than they receive in this respect and this point has often been made in this debate.  This is absolutely true, but does it follow from this that the State should fund whatever we wish to spend individually on politics, our campaigns, services for constituents and so on?  If we wish to set up three, four or five offices in our constituencies, should the State fund them?  I do not think so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying anyone is arguing for such a measure but there must be economy in the running of politics and this applies individually and collectively.  Senator Hanafin mentioned figures that were quite high, according to my experience, but perhaps he was elected by a more comfortable margin than I ever achieved.  The figure of &euro;30,000 was mentioned for a Seanad campaign but in 2002 I did not spend more than &euro;12,000.  For a D&aacute;il campaign the amount suggested was &euro;70,000; we all know parties take a certain amount of what an individual can spend and use it at national and regional levels.  One would not be allowed to spend &euro;70,000 in a D&aacute;il campaign.  It is undesirable that a successful campaign should require more and more money; very often successful campaigns seem to be linked to the amount of money available and there is no more striking example of this than the first Lisbon treaty referendum.  In that case a great deal of money was spent on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign by a particular organisation and this clearly brought results.  To be fair, it was an intelligent and focused campaign and did not relate solely to the spending of money.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Cummins&rsquo;s point, Ministers and Ministers of State took a voluntary salary reduction of 10%, which is closer to 20% when one includes the levy.  The Senator is correct to note that this applied to the ministerial part of the salary; I am not aware that anyone tried to present anything else as being the case.  The pension levy applied to the other part of the salary &mdash; the D&aacute;il salary.  Certain Members of the Oireachtas made an equivalent voluntary reduction, though not many.</P>
        <P>The Minister has referred the issue of the high salaries of office holders, including those at the top of the public service, to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector <Col N="879"/>to benchmark pay against international and EU rates and to write a report; this has not been widely noted and its significance has been underestimated.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the members of staff for having the patience to stay here.  I wish to raise the issue of the need for the Minister for Education and Science to comment on the importance of media studies in ensuring that students who are exposed to historical events spun by media channels with their own agendas on a 24 hour basis are helped evaluate what they hear in a critical manner.  This sounds quite convoluted but I could not find a way to put it in less convoluted terms.  I will briefly explain my point and I hope it will reach the staff of the Department of Education and Science, though I appreciate the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I do not mean to patronise the Minister of State when I say that he, of all people, will understand where I am coming<?oasys _jy ?>from.</P>
        <P>I have completed a report on the teaching of history in conflict and post-conflict areas; I spent a year and a half on the project, which got the full endorsement of the Council of Europe last Friday.  The clearest point I came across was the fact that in former times, particularly in the Soviet era, there was a single truth in history.  Teachers were told what to teach in the first five minutes of class and in the next 20 minutes; in the last five minutes they were told to reinforce what was covered at the beginning.  History was seen as a truth to be dispensed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The advent of news broadcasters such as BBC World Service, CNN, Fox News, TV5 Monde and many others, including our national broadcasters and national broadcasters around the world, means we now live permanently in historic times.  To use a non-political event, we have lived through the death of Michael Jackson but most news items relate to politics, such as events in Iran, Iraq and conflicts around the world.  These events are broadcast simultaneously into our houses as they happen, often merely to fill in time.  The matter of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s death has now taken over the airwaves; people want to know how he died, who will take custody of the children, where his money will go and so on.  This will keep the 24 hour news channels busy for a considerable period.</P><Col N="880"/>
      
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>My point is that a gap has grown between the Soviet notion of a single truth and the various truths offered by different media outlets today.  In conflict and post-conflict areas people need to engage with something other than a single truth.  Every person has his or her own version of the truth; there are many perspectives on every situation.  We should encourage people to explore the history taught to them and not necessarily accept a single version as the truth.  It is very important children are given the chance to do media studies so they understand that a certain person&rsquo;s view of a particular event is coloured by where that person comes from and what is his or her agenda.  In this way we will develop a more critical and analytical student who will become much more employable and may even become an employer.  In all cases of conflict, including that on the island of Ireland, there is a need for more bright, intelligent, critical and analytical thinkers who can see through what they are told and recognise that there other agendas.</P>
        <P>Places that have come out of conflict usually have to address economic as well as political problems.  Tonight is not the time to go into the detail of the report.  Instead, I ask the Department of Education and Science if it is aware that children are exposed to more and more media, such as the Internet, which bombard them with information and have agendas.  One form of media will have a different agenda from another and young people should be given the skills to discern.  As Marc Bloch said: &ldquo;History is like a knife &mdash; it can kill or cut meat&rdquo;.  The media can help to decide whether the knife is used as a weapon or as a useful tool.</P>

	<P>At this time of the evening I find it hard to resist the temptation to go a little off script.  My last article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in June 2006 was devoted to considering Pontius Pilate&rsquo;s question &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; and whether relativism was truth or whether there was any such thing as absolute truth.  I also commented on the paradox of politicians in promoting objectivity when much of our life is taken up with promoting a particular political agenda.  The reference to the Soviet Union reminds me of the Soviet joke about history: &ldquo;While the future is certain the past may be unpredictable&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>Media education is a specific strand unit within the social, personal and health education programme for all primary school pupils.  Through this a child in the infant classes begins to learn that he or she receives information through a variety of different sources and begins to distinguish between advertisements and programmes and discuss characters and their appealing traits.  By sixth class pupils develop an understanding of how information is conveyed, what may be deliberately excluded, the role of bias and the different messages promoted in advertising.  The curriculum is designed to promote an increasingly critical and discerning attitude to advertising and media, their purposes and the messages they promote.  This goes hand in hand with the strand unit on making decisions, so that children learn to examine critically the influences on their decision making and the consequences and processes involved.</P>
        <P>While media studies is not a specific subject at second level, the skills of interpretation and analysis, the use of language in different contexts and genres and the influences on decision making are covered within the existing curricula and allow scope for exploring issues related to the media.  For example, in junior certificate English students are required to think, respond and communicate in everyday contexts, including a diary, a journal, a radio programme, video film, drama, poem, essay etc.  They develop a critical consciousness with regard to all language <Col N="881"/>use and learn to focus on the choice of words and the reasons for and effects of these particular choices of words.  The ways in which this is achieved include the introduction of students to the skills of reading, viewing and listening to a range of literary and media genres.</P>
        <P>While the syllabus provides teachers with the freedom to choose their own texts and materials, they are expected to include print and media material.  The guidelines for teachers include a unit on media studies, which encourages students to think and talk about the media as products and processes and to explore both their pervasiveness and persuasiveness.</P>
        <P>The skills acquired in junior cycle are built on in senior cycle English where the term &ldquo;language&rdquo; includes verbal and visual forms of communication, including the role of media, film and theatre.  The aims of the curriculum include developing students&rsquo; powers of discrimination and interpretative abilities in regard to these media.  Engaging with fiction, drama, essay, poetry and film in an imaginative, responsive and critical manner forms part of the approach.</P>
        <P>In junior certificate history the syllabus aims to give students the skills to be able to examine critically a variety of types of historical sources, to distinguish between fact and opinion and to detect deficiencies such as gaps, inconsistencies and bias.  As part of the leaving certificate history syllabus, students participate in a documents-based study and a research study.  The emphasis is on the development of historical investigation skills and historical thinking, using evidence, and the need to look at history from different perspectives and as a dynamic process.  The development of these critical and investigative skills can be transferred into many other areas of the curriculum and beyond.</P>
        <P>The skills of information processing, analysis and critical evaluation are also developed through the action project within civic, social and political education, CSPE, which is compulsory in junior cycle.  CSPE aims to equip students with the skills and understanding of processes which enable them to see, decide, judge and act.  They should be better prepared for living in a world where traditional structures and values are being challenged, and where they are being confronted with conflicting interests and constant questioning.</P>
        <P>Within social, personal and health education, a mandatory subject at junior cycle, influences and decisions is a specific module which is covered over the three-year programme.  This includes helping students understand the role of the media and the impact of social mores in the wider community on their decisions.  In the transition year programme media studies is among the range of flexible options which can be taken by students.  Overall, within our second level curricula, there is a key emphasis on the development of skills in research, data gathering, analysis, evaluation and critical reflection which are important elements of effective learning.</P>
        <P>I am confident the knowledge and skills acquired by our young people in our education system will assist them in processing, interpreting and critically evaluating the varied sources and forms of information in the media.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I did not expect my matter on the Adjournment to be heard at 2.10 a.m.  I am also looking for the Minister of State to show a personal touch by addressing the needs of Scoil Mhuire, An Gharr&aacute;n, Maree, Oranmore, roll No. 1809S.  Given that it is willing to progress its urgent accommodation needs for four permanent classrooms to replace deteriorating prefabs in a way that would suit the Department of Education and Science, can <Col N="882"/>the Minister of State advise which of the relevant schemes is preferable in this case?  Is it to proceed with the major capital programme or should it transfer to the devolved scheme?  Can he also advise on the timeframe for delivery of the preferred building option which he recommends?</P>
        <P>I will give a little bit of background to the case.  The principal told me recently that his aim was to replace the substandard buildings.  He said he wanted to replace the sheds with permanent buildings.  Maree national school has 208 pupils including my own children.  With a devolved grant of &euro;600,000 versus a cost of &euro;2 million on the major capital programme, at any point Scoil Mhuire, An Gharr&aacute;n, Maree, Oranmore can build the four permanent classrooms needed to meet the needs of its 208 pupils and a staff room for 16 staff &mdash; 11 teachers, one SNA and one secretary plus visiting teachers.  This school has been let down since 1997.  It is 12 years since its first application for a two-room extension and all it has acquired in the meantime is five prefabs.</P>
        <P>There is a serious charge to be made against the Department of Education and Science in continuing with the five substandard prefabs for classes in the mid to high 20s.  It is impossible to deliver the aims and objectives of the revised curriculum, an active discovery-based experiential learning curriculum which requires space for the children and the teachers to move.  None of the prefabs is fit for more than 20 pupils, and yet all classes have numbers in the high 20s.  Scoil Mhuire, An Gharr&aacute;n has only three permanent classrooms that are capable of responding to the requirements of the revised curriculum, and yet all classes are expected to deliver on that goal.  The Department must be responsible and accountable for what it is requiring of its teachers, if it is serious about the implementation of the revised curriculum.  It is a contradiction, and unfair of the Department to ask teachers to deliver a curriculum and equally to have its inspectors inspect the outcomes of the revised curriculum, without providing an appropriate learning space in which to achieve it.</P>
        <P>On the major capital programme, I understand Scoil Mhuire is at the design-team appointment stage.  In December 2008, the principal met with the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who indicated he would be willing to allow this school on to the devolved scheme.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate which option is preferable in light of the school&rsquo;s current needs, and if it is the devolved scheme, whether the Department will allow easy transfer of Scoil Mhuire without any disadvantage to the school or without losing further time.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State recommends, the exact status of this school&rsquo;s building programme and the timeframe for delivery for the four permanent classrooms and staff room.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position on an application to the Department of Education and Science from the school for large-scale capital funding.</P>
        <P>This school has applied to the Department for an extension to the existing school building.  The brief for this project is for an extension which will result in a school large enough to provide sufficient accommodation for a long-term projected staffing of a principal plus ten mainstream class teachers plus ancillary staff.  The project was assigned a band rating of 1.1, which reflects the rapid population growth in this area of Galway.  I have no doubt whatever of the value of the project when it is completed.</P><Col N="883"/>
        <P>Due to competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it has not been yet possible to progress this project through architectural planning and into construction.  The Senator will understand that it is not possible to progress all projects at the same time as the resources must be in place to complete the project.</P>
        <P>The school verbally contacted the Department in November 2008 to discuss the possibility of providing the four classroom extension via a devolved grant and the school was advised to submit a formal written proposal to the Department for consideration.  The school, along with a number of other schools, met with the Minister in December 2008 and proposed that four additional mainstream classrooms and some refurbishment could be provided via a devolved grant of approximately &euro;500,000 to &euro;600,000.  Officials from the Department will be in contact with the school authorities regarding their proposal.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department against published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the education partners.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of accommodation needed based on population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for pupil places.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under the prioritisation criteria, which I have already mentioned.  There are four band ratings in all, with band 1 being the highest and band 4 being the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of schools where none currently exists but where there is a high demand for pupils places while a band 4 project makes provision of desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need, and this is reflected in the band rating assigned them.  In other words, a building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it and as it is ready to proceed.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that, in February of this year, the Minister for Education and Science announced details of 43 major building projects to proceed to tender and construction and 25 high priority projects to commence architectural planning.  The project for the school in question was not included in this announcement, therefore, it will not be proceeding in 2009.  The project will, however, be considered for the Department&rsquo;s 2010 capital programme.</P>
        <P>The Senator will appreciate that the extent of the demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget is enormous providing, as it does, accommodation for new communities, additional accommodation for the unprecedented number of extra teachers which the Government has put into the system and modernising existing schools.  However, huge inroads have been made into addressing these needs and under the last national development plan alone, 7,800 school building projects were delivered.</P>
        <P>As I said, the Senator will appreciate that it is not possible to advance all the projects needed at the same time.  The Minister for Education and Science would like to assure the Senator, however, that all school building projects, including that for the school in question, will be advanced incrementally through the system over time and as funding is available.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter and wish her progress in achieving finality in the matter.</P>

	<P>This matter is of critical importance to thousands of people, be they pensioners, people who are sick or patients young and old, so that they have access to their medication and there is an equitable restructuring of the pharmacy issue.  We all support the important concept and the need to achieve value for money, but I call on the Minister to be equitable in what she does in this regard and to engage in negotiations with the pharmacists&rsquo; unions.</P>
        <P>This is an important issue that has not gone away.  It has been simmering and now it has come to the surface with the threat of thousands of pharmacists resigning from the scheme.  The value for money could be phased in, as the Dorgan report recommended.  What are the contingency plans if the pharmacists withdraw their services?</P>
        <P>I have great sympathy for the smaller pharmacies the staff of which are providing a service and working hard.  Giving the taxpayer and consumer value for money is fine, but the Minister for Health and Children is driving a coach and four through everybody involved.</P>
        <P>There are concerns that the Minister&rsquo;s decision will have a negative impact on both patients and, importantly, jobs in the industry.  The 33% decrease in payments that pharmacists receive from the HSE could have a negative impact on jobs, with the closure of many community pharmacists reducing choice and service for patients.</P>
        <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach and I have met with pharmacists and raised these issues with them.  As I am sharing time with Senator Ross, I will conclude by saying we need to look at all of the options, including generic substitution for branded drugs.  There is greater clarity and flexibility needed from the Minister.  We must remember that this is about patients, people who need medication, and jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for sharing time.</P>
        <P>There is an extraordinary spinning game going on here between pharmacists and the Government, and this is far too serious for a game or for macho stances to be taken.  It is all very well at this stage, in July, to sit back and suggest that somehow the pharmacists will capitulate on their demand by the beginning of August.  I do not believe this will happen.  We are heading for a serious crisis in the pharmacy industry, not just for the pharmacists who are being badly treated by the Government but also for patients.  It is not right, as Senator Buttimer said, for the Minister to stand back and say there will no talks whatsoever.</P>
        <P>The instrument the Minister has used, a cut of 34%, is crude.  One cannot treat pharmacists with the one-size-fits-all approach as not all will be able to take such a cut.  I know of pharmacists who have borrowed enormous sums of money to establish their business.  These cuts will put some of them out of business.  Is that what the Minister wants?</P>
        <P>The results will be that small businesses will go under, creating more unemployment, and medicines will not be accessible to patients, particularly older people.  The intransigent attitude of a Minister saying she will not talk with concerned parties is irresponsible because people&rsquo;s health will be at risk.  This is not like cutting public service pay where people make a small sacrifice and will still be in jobs.  This is going to affect some people very badly.  Pharmacists <Col N="885"/>have been conciliatory, coming forward with reasonable offers of cuts.  They are perfectly happy to take the pain with the rest of us.  However, the pain they are being asked to take with these cuts is crude and disproportionate in one go.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister, or at least her civil servants, sit down for talks with the Irish Pharmacy Union?  One problem in the dispute is the difference in the calculations of the effects of the cuts on the pharmacy industry.  The differences are wide and inexplicable.  For example, the pharmacists claim the bottom line will be &euro;106,000 for an average pharmacy while the Minister claims it will be only &euro;82,000.  The pharmacists are correct in wanting these to be compared.  People who paint pharmacists as being particularly well off should examine the PricewaterhouseCoopers review in 2007 which showed their margins are only 6.6%.  Talks need to begin before this becomes the inevitable crisis it will be at the beginning of August unless it is resolved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity, or not as the case may be, to outline to the House the background to the decisions taken by the Minister for Health and Children under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to tackle the rapid growth in the cost of distributing and dispensing drugs under the medical card and community drug schemes.</P>
        <P>The cost of these schemes has doubled since 2002 to over &euro;1.6 billion in 2008.  Fees and other income earned by pharmacists have doubled accordingly.  It cost the taxpayer &euro;640 million to get &euro;1 billion of drugs from factory gate to patients in the community in 2008.  The Minister considers this growing level of cost unjustifiable and unsustainable and it has to be reduced.</P>
        <P>Approximately 1,600 pharmacies hold contracts with the Health Service Executive from which they receive substantial fees and income and will continue to do so under the new measures the Minister announced.  In view of the complex nature of the sector, and the different rates and retail mark-ups which apply under the schemes, the Minister decided to overhaul the payment structure.</P>
        <P>Up to now, the general medical services scheme has attracted a dispensing fee of &euro;3.60 per item, while the drugs payment scheme and long-term illness scheme attracted dispensing fees of &euro;3.16 plus a 50% mark-up on the ingredient cost of the drugs.  The changes involve a new higher dispensing fee structure for the schemes based on a sliding scale.  It will be &euro;5 for the first 20,000 items, &euro;4.50 for next 10,000 items and &euro;3.50 for the remaining items.  The changes will reduce from 50% to 20% the retail mark-up payable under the community drugs schemes.  No mark-up is payable under the general medical services scheme.</P>
        <P>The amount paid to pharmacists includes a wholesale mark-up of 17.66% over the ex-factory price of these products.  It means, for example, that in the case of a drug which leaves the factory gate at a price of &euro;85, the Health Service Executive pays the pharmacist &euro;100.  In theory, this mark-up is intended to cover the price paid by pharmacists to their wholesale suppliers for the delivery of products.  It is estimated the wholesale mark-up amounts to approximately &euro;200 million per annum, of which half is retained by community pharmacists.</P>
        <P>The Minister considers there is no justification for half the wholesale mark-up being retained by pharmacists in addition to the fees and mark-ups they are paid.  This mark-up will be reduced to 10% which will save &euro;77 million in full year terms.</P><Col N="886"/>
        <P>Pharmacists are also paid a premium of approximately &euro;33 million per annum on foot of an agreement in 2001 arising from the granting of medical cards on an automatic basis to persons aged 70 years and over.  Upwards of &euro;200 million has been paid to pharmacists up to the end of 2008 under this arrangement.  This special payment is being ended now to save &euro;33 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>The savings to the Exchequer from these measures are estimated at &euro;55 million for the remainder of this year and &euro;133 million on a full-year basis.  This is almost exactly what would have been saved if the Minister had imposed an across-the-board 8% reduction in fees and retail mark-ups and re-imposed the reduction in wholesale mark-up to 8%, as attempted by the Health Service Executive last year.  However, the Minister decided to achieve broadly the same level of reduction through a revised common fee structure for dispensing, a reduced retail mark-up, removal of the special payment for over-70s dispensing, along with the lesser wholesale reduction.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, a public consultation process has already taken place.  All interested stakeholders were invited to make submissions.  Over 100 other written submissions were received, most of them from community pharmacists.  The Irish Pharmacy Union made a written submission and made an oral submission to Department officials.  These were analysed and considered before the Minister made her decision on the restructuring of payments.</P>
        <P>The retail pharmacy sector has been on notice for some time of the need to reduce substantially the amount paid by the State.  Senator Ross pointed to the number of investments in their businesses made by pharmacists, sometimes involving high degrees of borrowing.  In the last analysis, a pharmacy is a business and, as we know with investments in other sectors of the economy, investment can pay off or be over ambitious.  I would be second to none in my regard for my local pharmacies.  The truth, however, is that the State is not in a position to pay the escalating sums of money in order to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that a number of pharmacists have threatened to withdraw from participation in the community drugs schemes.  Under the Act, health professionals are required to give 30 days notice of their intention to withdraw service.  The Minister believes the threats of withdrawal of service by community pharmacists are unjustified and not in patients&rsquo; interests, and there can be no grounds for causing upset or anxiety about the supply of prescriptions to patients.  The HSE has written to all 1,600 community pharmacy contractors to clarify whether they intend to continue the provision of services under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  A contingency plan is being put in place by the HSE and will be implemented if required to ensure supplies of medicines to patients under the GMS and community drugs schemes will continue in the event of discontinuation of services by community pharmacists.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that those measures will pose a challenge for the pharmacy sector.  However, not making those savings will be even more challenging for health services and would mean significant, immediate cuts in hospital and home-based services for patients.  The budget of the HSE this year assumes savings of at least &euro;50 million to be achieved in the area of pharmacy costs.  Other actions are being taken and will be taken by the Department and the HSE with a view to containing costs.  Among the matters being addressed are the price of drugs, the volume of drugs prescribed and the extent of use of patent and generic drugs.</P>
        <P>The reality is that we are in a very difficult situation and the Government has to take difficult and painful decisions.  We previously discussed measures that will affect the Houses and will <Col N="887"/>cause difficulty and distress for people.  Regardless of their level of income people&rsquo;s commitments rapidly meet their income and, generally speaking, somewhat exceed it, so those sorts of adjustments are always very difficult.  We have to combine understanding and compassion with difficult decisions but we must also be reasonably tough minded in the present situation.  Every sector and group, including ourselves as Members, can always make a strong case as to why the <i>status quo</i> or something like it should be preserved, and that it is inadequate compared with what it should be, but this is just one area and there are many areas that will cause us difficulties.</P>
        <P>We will have to work our way through it.  We cannot allow ourselves to be completely swayed by messages and communications from a particular group that is defending its interests, in a bona fide way from its point of view, but where we are apt to lose sight of the larger interest, namely, that we survive and get through the current difficulties both in the health service and in every other sector of the economy.  Unfortunately, that involves us &ndash; the Government in particular, but also the Oireachtas in a larger sense &mdash; taking and standing over tough decisions.</P>

	<P>I accept it is late, but the Minister of State was doing well until he went off the script.  Pharmacists have indicated they are willing to accept a cut in their fees.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is not attached to the Department of Health and Children but I ask him to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention that talks and negotiations must be held.  There is no contingency plan if the pharmacists opt out.  The reply is woolly.  It does not explain what will happen.  I call on the Minister to meet with the IPU to work out the issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister made a comment about the global picture.  This is about people.  The Minister is discarding the Fianna F&aacute;il slogan from 1987 about cutbacks hurting the old, the poor, the vulnerable and the elderly.  Is that what the Minister of State is telling me this morning that he wants to do?  I hope it is not, but unless we have action and a meeting of minds we will have chaos.  It is not a case of spreading fear.  The reality is that fear already exists among patients and people who need pharmacists and there is fear about job losses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State addressed some of the points we raised and I appreciate that he departed from his script.  I thank him for that.  What about the point Senator Buttimer made, that at least the Minister&rsquo;s officials should talk to the pharmacists?  The pharmacists are willing both to make concessions and to talk.  One of the reasons they are offering to talk is to settle the difference between the calculations they have made and those worked out by the Department about how much it will cost each pharmacy per annum to implement the proposed cuts.  If that happens we will understand how many of them will go bust.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Government appear to be condemning those who have quite reasonably borrowed on the basis of current margins to invest in their companies.  The Minister is possibly imposing bankruptcy or liquidation on them.  Let the parties at least talk so the Minister can see their point of view and they can see her figures.  That matter could be resolved without anything being done at all.  As a first premise the parties should be talking about exactly the same figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their interventions.  Three main points have been made.  On a personal basis I have much sympathy with the pharmacists.  I have friends in the pharmaceutical profession.</P>
        <P>I say to Senator Buttimer that economic survival is about people too.  That is what is fundamentally involved, not just in terms of this measure but for the many other measures introduced <Col N="888"/>by the Government in an attempt to retain the vast majority of the services that we take for granted and so that we do not get into a far more serious situation than we face currently.</P>
        <P>As I am not the Minister for Health and Children and have no responsibility in that area I regard the question of talks, their format and who should attend them as <i>ultra vires</i>.  Those are matters on which the Minister would have to be questioned.  However, I do question Senator&rsquo;s Ross&rsquo;s position.  I do not think he would apply the same logic to developers, namely, that the State has to protect people who borrowed to invest.  People have to take responsibility for their own commercial judgment.  It is not possible, especially in the current situation, for the State to underwrite every business move made by various groups, except where the safety of the State itself is at stake.  Senator Ross applies a different logic to pharmacists than to other sectors.</P>
