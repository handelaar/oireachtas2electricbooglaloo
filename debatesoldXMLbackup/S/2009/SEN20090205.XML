	<P>I have notice from Senator Eugene Regan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter: </P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to include Pottery Road, D&uacute;n Laoghaire in the regional and local roads programme; and to confirm when financing will be made available for the Pottery Road improvement scheme.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the present position with regard to allocating the necessary funding to upgrade facilities at St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Knockbeg, Carlow.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to re-assess the withdrawal of EPV days for teachers engaged in voluntary work abroad.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to give an update on the equalisation of mobile telephone calls and the elimination of roaming costs on an island and European basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to introduce legislation regarding the governing of exhibitions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to relocate the Athlone tourist office to a more convenient site rather than the off-street location where it is at present.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Regan, Phelan and Ross and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P><Col N="672"/>
        <P>I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator McFadden as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements regarding expenditure measures for the stabilisation of the public finances to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 4 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for 20 minutes and other Senators for eight minutes, and Senators may share time, by leave of the House. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall a former Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach stating that any Government that presided at a time when 200,000 people were unemployed should be removed from office. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 100,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday 326,000 people queued for unemployment benefit.  In the past 18 months under this Government the unemployment rate and our national debt have doubled.  It is necessary to focus again on the real economy, on jobs and enterprise survival.  There are many things that can be done to generate employment.  We need to accelerate the schools building programme, reverse the hike in value added tax, VAT, to give some relief to retailers and to provide pay related social insurance relief, PRSI, to employers in distressed companies which have problems competing.</P>
        <P>It costs the Government more than &euro;20,000 in social welfare payments and lost tax receipts for every job that is lost.  Is it not better to intervene before rather than after companies close?  It is also necessary to put in place a loan guarantee system for small businesses as part of the recapitalisation of the banks.</P>
        <P>The principle of asking public servants to contribute more to their pensions is not unreasonable but it is not right to ask those public servants on a small wage to do so.  There is no fairness in the system that is about to be introduced by the Government.  We have had a plan to cut wages and to increase payments.  What we need now is a plan to get people back working, to create jobs and to maintain the jobs that we have.  Unfortunately, the Government is bereft of ideas.  It is jaded and has no plan.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House and outline to us what the Government intends to do to tackle this national crisis of unemployment.</P>
        <P>Every one of the 326,000 unemployed people must exist on a low wage, feed and clothe their children, bring them to school, and pay mortgages.  That is what it is like when one is unemployed.  We must put ourselves in the situation where we can understand how those people feel.  There are many of them in my constituency now, and it is the same throughout the country.  Something will have to be done, and there is nothing imaginative coming from the Government.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House and tell Members whether the Government has a plan, or whether we just carry on as before and react to situations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader of the House for addressing our request to have the issue we raised yesterday dealt with diplomatically with the Head of State at the Vatican.  I note it worked wonders and that he responded fully by yesterday afternoon.  That is the way the Seanad should be: effective, efficient and topical.</P>

	<P>We are on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not raise this at the Leader&rsquo;s meeting the other day, but I did not spot it until now.  The discussion today should not just be about the stability of the public finances, but also about a general economic recovery.</P>
        <P>I wish to make one comment about what was said the other day and which I touched on yesterday.  I would like the Leader to take one message back to the Government.  A public servant on &euro;25,000 per year is now being asked to pay substantial amounts of money for a pension which is less than the State pension.  Where is the equity in that?  It will be less than the &euro;240 per week which people in the private sector would receive through their ordinary PRSI contributions.  I raise this as an anomaly.  I am sure the Government did not see this, but it should have.  While one can understand where the Government is coming from in asking people like ourselves, earning salaries approaching &euro;100,000 per annum, to make a contribution.  Everyone earning such money, in the public and private sector, should be asked to make a similar contribution.  Apart from asking ordinary public sector workers to pay more for their pensions, the rest of us should be asked to make the same level of contribution.  There is no sense in not asking high earners in the private sector to pay nothing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We intended dealing with the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 today.  I express my admiration for the fight that Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan has been making on this issue.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar the west, iarthar na t&iacute;re seo.  T&aacute; tuarasc&aacute;il curtha i gcl&oacute; anois ag an Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir Pearse Doherty an tuarasc&aacute;il le ch&eacute;ile.  This report on the west has been accepted by the committee and ba mhaith liom go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht air sin.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; ag baint leis sin &oacute; thaobh tionscail na hiascaireachta, b&oacute;ithre, iarnr&oacute;id agus fosta&iacute;ochta de agus &oacute; thaobh a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; eile de chomh maith.  Is maith agus is c&oacute;ir go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn air sin.  I ask the Leader to allow us use Senator Doherty&rsquo;s document, prepared for the committee, to have a debate next week on the west.</P>
        <P>I do not want to get into the debate raised by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, but the reality is that there is a harbour authority in west Cork running an efficient and effective operation and making money in the locality, yet someone in Dublin has decided it should be part of a Cork city outfit.  That will again disable the west and is completely unnecessary.  There is no gain and it adds to administration.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar an iarthar and on that report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Members will join me in congratulating the makers of the Irish films &ldquo;Hunger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Garage&rdquo; on winning <i>Evening Standard</i> awards in London.  It is a testament to the good work done by the Irish Film Board.  At the moment, there is a level of disquiet among many members of the Irish film industry.  I must declare my own interest here as I am involved in a television production company.  The Government has not reappointed or confirmed the appointment of members of the Irish Film Board which it was meant to do in mid-January.  As a result of this, the board cannot approve any grants or development funding for the production of films or television programmes.  There is a concern that something is coming down the line.  Can the Leader use his good office to find out what is going on and allay the concerns within the industry?  Many people depend on the film industry for their livelihoods, which has been very beneficial to our own tourism industry.</P>
        <P>We had an interesting debate here last night on the subject of human rights.  I spoke about the proposed cuts to the overseas development aid budget.  The impact on this will be severe.  The Minister mentioned yesterday in the D&aacute;il that 1 billion people go to bed hungry every night.  It is very important that we do not cut our aid.  We have done tremendous work in aid <Col N="674"/>over recent years.  Hans Zomer, the chief executive of D&oacute;chas, stated that although aid is a very small percentage of our overall spend, 5% of all cuts proposed by the Taoiseach will come from the aid budget.  Senator Boyle described this last night as unfortunate, but this is not the word used by the aid agencies.  If we go ahead with these cuts, other governments will use it as an excuse to cut their own aid budgets.  We need to show leadership here.  We cannot sell out on our principles and on our commitments to the developing world.  I ask the Leader and Senators on the Government side of the House to ask their Ministers to look again at these proposed cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole generally makes much sense, and it is very difficult to disagree with him on most of the issues he raises.  His contribution this morning is no exception.  I agree with him fully on the focus he has put on Senator Doherty&rsquo;s report to the Oireachtas committee, of which I am a member.  It was very well received because it was very comprehensive.  I looked at the number of people contributing to the report, most of them coming from Sinn F&eacute;in.  I feel the document would provide a particular focus for us.  I hope it can be brought before this House, so that we can have an opportunity to discuss it, especially in the context of the west.</P>
        <P>I also agree with the point he made on the stand taken by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan regarding the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008.  Even though the Bill is coming from the Government, it is important that a person can stand up in this House and put forward ideas based on his or her own experience and knowledge.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has done an exceptionally good job on Committee Stage.  Senator Doherty&rsquo;s document would give the House an opportunity to see this issue in its totality.  Rather than just look at an isolated aspect, as is the case with the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008, we could look at the whole situation in the west.</P>
        <P>I compliment Sinn F&eacute;in on its response to the economic recovery plan, the first phase of which was announced the other day.  It has brought forward specific proposals and it is important that all political parties bring forward proposals at this stage.  I had intended speaking yesterday, but I left it a bit late to do so.  I was going to say that there is an absolute sea change in media coverage since the first phase of the economic recovery plan was put forward.  There is great emphasis on responsibility.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> is calling today for responsibility from the Government and the Opposition.  This point is made on the front page and on the inside pages.  It is a great development.  We can now start to see light at the end of the tunnel.  People are embracing the seriousness of the reality we now face.  It is clear that if we do not do that, we have no hope of economic recovery.  Senators will recall that in the first few days following the election of the US President, Mr. Obama, he was held up as a messiah &mdash; he could do no wrong.  If they have been reading the newspapers over recent days, however, they will be aware that he is now dealing with the reality of his office in exactly the same way.  While I have great respect for President Obama and admire him greatly, his glamour boy image&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the next week, we should all start to embrace that reality.  I will use the dreaded word by suggesting that we should work together in a patriotic fashion for the good of this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>If that happens, we will have an opportunity to see a signpost for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Cummins that in these extremely difficult and damaging times, it is now a question of surviving and saving every job we possibly can.  I look forward to hearing the T&aacute;naiste outline the Government&rsquo;s proposals in respect of PRSI.  Will additional infrastructural developments be sanctioned to keep the building industry going?  We cannot afford to slacken in that regard when so much work remains to be done for the good of this country and its economy.  We cannot afford to see all building jobs disappear.  I would like to raise an important matter that ties in with all this.  Will the Leader let the House know when the banks, especially Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, will be recapitalised and restructured?  This issue is central if the economy is to survive and get moving again.  It needs a bit of a lift.  It is obvious that legislation will need to be amended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter can be raised during the debate that will follow the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that, but I would like to ask the Leader a question about the necessary legislation.  When will the Bill governing the National Pensions Reserve Fund be amended to provide for billions of euro to be taken from the fund?  We do not know how much will be taken.  This measure will affect the availability of credit and normal working capital to businesses that are being choked and are suffering badly.  The Government&rsquo;s dithering on this issue is severely damaging our economy.  We need to support business.  Until that is done, we will have no trust and no confidence.  I look forward to hearing from the Leader on this vital matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Before Christmas, I predicted in this House that the number of people unemployed would reach 500,000.  Some people outside this House told me I was insane to think that.  I now believe that number will increase to 700,000, or 20%, by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I was unable to be here yesterday, so I watched the proceedings of this House and the Lower House on television.  I did not get any sense that either House is grasping the extent of this problem.  Those whose greed has now been followed by anger and fear are looking for scapegoats to blame.  That this is a global recession is not being accepted.</P>
        <P>We are told that bankers, financiers and people in the political class were negligent and incompetent.  I do not agree with those who maintain there was a high level of corruption in this country during the boom.  While I accept that questions may need to be asked about neglect and incompetence in Anglo Irish Bank, the level of corruption that was a feature of banks throughout the world was not evident here.</P>
        <P>The political class does not seem to appreciate how bad the recession is throughout the world.  It is in Asia, in Australia and in the United States.  I have recently returned from Britain, where I observed that the midlands of that country are like a wasteland.  The shops and pubs are empty.  Ireland is not a special case.</P><Col N="676"/>
        <P>I am tired of listening to the revising of history, particularly the blaming of the political class, including the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and his successor, Deputy Cowen.  We had a boom.  Everybody in Ireland participated in it.  Irish people bought 200,000 houses overseas during the boom.  They were not all bought by bankers.  Everybody in Ireland participated in the boom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody in Ireland is now looking for a scapegoat.  That kind of anger is of no use at this time.  Like alcoholics on a binge, we need to reach rock bottom.  We need a reality check before we can rebuild.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to face the fact that we might have the best part of a million people out of work.  We need to stop playing party politics.  I repeat the call I made before Christmas for a national Government.  We need a national plan.  We need to bring an end to this kind of partisan politics.  We need reform and cutbacks, beginning with the political class.  We should get real by making serious cuts to salaries and expenses, rather than tinkering with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I intended to raise a couple of issues yesterday, but I was not fortunate enough to get in.  My colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, managed to raise a number of them successfully.  I refer in particular to the question of the rehabilitation by the Vatican of Bishop Williamson.  I was interested in the contribution of a certain little interchange here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is the Senator calling a &ldquo;little interchange&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not engage in personal abuse.  That is a very interesting comment because Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution yesterday included his usual mantra of appealing for calm and rational debate without personality-based or <i>ad hominem</i> arguments.  He then proceeded to imply that Senator O&rsquo;Toole was a clown and that I was ignorant, which may well be true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Never.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot answer for Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I implied that he was clever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to accept my ignorance as one of the great national resources of Ireland.  Ignorant as I am, I heard Bishop Williamson on the radio saying there were certainly not 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust.  He claimed that the correct figure might be 200,000.  He does not believe there were any gas chambers in Auschwitz.  He has said that not a single person, Jewish or otherwise, died in a gas chamber.  That is unconscionable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It cannot be allowed to stand without rebuke.  It is quite appropriate to challenge such views.  The Holocaust was a uniquely catastrophic event in human history.  While the overwhelming preponderance of victims were Jewish, they were not exclusively Jewish.  This extraordinary and tragic event is part of our universal inheritance of suffering as <Col N="677"/>human beings.  It is inappropriate for it to be used to deflect criticism of Israeli foreign and military policy, for example.  To use it in that manner, as has been done, represents a betrayal of the victims of the Holocaust.  I hope it does not happen again.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear Senator Hannigan speak about last night&rsquo;s interesting Private Members&rsquo; debate on human rights.  The media has shown no interest in the debate, however.  I issued a script but not a word of it was picked up.  People are preoccupied with the economy, as Senator Harris said.  That is natural because it is a huge problem.  We must not allow matters such as those raised again today by Senator Hannigan to be blown off the agenda.  The media has a responsibility in this regard.  It cannot let these matters go entirely.  I accept the economy is important.  During last night&rsquo;s debate, Senator Hanafin spoke about the enormous waste of money on material that is sent to us in packages.  I got an angry communication from a constituent yesterday about something that was included with her Eircom telephone bill.  The document in question sets out the life and times of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in one of its central sections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it is sent to everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My constituent objected to the document on the basis that she had not paid for it and did not want it included with her telephone bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have much more to add to the fine contributions made by Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Harris on how best we can all work together.  I watched a television programme on Monday night during which two representatives from parties bickered during the entire programme.  I listened to &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; this morning and those who were being interviewed again engaged in point-scoring to determine who would make the best contribution.  The contributions are wholesome and fine statements are being made, but nevertheless it is time we worked together.  We are in a crisis and the public are calling for us to work together to get out of it.  I urge that we all work together and endorse the many fine points raised here this morning. </P>
        <P>I wish to raise the motion on the human rights issue on which we had a fine discussion yesterday evening.  I compliment Senator Norris on bringing the motion forward.  I too am disappointed at the proposed cutback in our contribution to overseas development aid.  I will examine how best we can work in this regard into the future.  Having visited very poor countries, I know what goes on there.  I hope we can get around this issue in some other way.  If we <Col N="678"/>cannot increase our allocation, we can work with our embassies to see how best we can maintain the programmes in place and fulfil our obligation in that respect.  I want to do that.</P>
        <P>I endorse the stand taken by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan in regard to Bantry Bay and how best he can protect that area.  He is doing a fine job and I wish him well.  I hope that we will all work together on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Leader tell us why the Minister for Education and Children is boycotting this House?  Since the budget was introduced he has not once come into this House to answer any questions on his education brief.  Yesterday we saw 15,000 students protest outside Government Buildings.  They are fearful that third level fees could be reintroduced.  We have had no debate in this House on the funding of third level education.</P>
        <P>This situation is critical.  I met students in Galway who told have told me that if fees are reintroduced, they will have to quit college and join the dole queue as they will not be able to pay them because their parents have lost their jobs.  No vision has been shown here.  The students are our future.</P><Col N="679"/>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il councillors have written to me requesting that the book grant be reintroduced and that home school liaison teachers be retained.  People are desperately trying to cope and the effects of the education cuts have not been felt yet.  Most of them will come in on 1 September next year.  I ask that the Leader give us a date when the  Minister for Education and Children will come into this House for an urgent debate on education.</P>
        <P>I sense great concern among people at the unfairness of the first prong of the announcement of the public service cuts by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  I received a call from a person yesterday who said, &ldquo;In this country we have the reverse of Robin Hood where we are asking the poor and the easy targets to pay for the sins of the rich.&rdquo;  It is unpalatable that people who did not cause the problem are the first who are being asked to pay.  In the interests of moving forward matters, I suggest the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment go first to the bankers, speculators and Ministers and ask them what can they offer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make that point to the Minister for Finance who will be in the House later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Following that and a apology having been given to the Irish people who were asked to come on board, then the Ministers should approach the rest of the people who did not cause the problem.  The innocent are being asked to pay first and it is not fair.  That is what is sickening the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on entrepreneurship.  This country is full of people who have great ideas.  Some of them lost their jobs recently.  All of them have a work ethic and are dependable, traits that attracted businesses to invest here.  People here have a good work ethic, getting up in the morning and working 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  We must find mechanisms to take on the people who lose their jobs to ensure they retain their spirit, work ethic and &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude.</P>
        <P>It would be helpful if the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment came to the House to discuss what specific measures can be introduced to foster entrepreneurship.  Such measures would create new industries and opportunities for those who have lost or will lose their jobs.  In these economically straitened times good ideas come out of the woodwork, but we need then to be able to rush in and give the necessary supports to those people to make their dreams become reality, which would involve their becoming employers, not employees. Of all the people who should know that, it is the people of Donegal who rose up after the loss of Fruit of the Loom.  Many of them went on to become employers, not employees, post that disastrous loss for the county.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to provide an opportunity for us to exchange views with the T&aacute;naiste on that issue.  A parochial issue for the people from Donegal was the loss of Fruit of the Loom to another country with cheaper production lines.  Yet we are losing Boston Scientific to Galway.  With respect to the people of Galway, I would like an answer as to why Galway is more competitive than Letterkenny for those particular jobs.  I would like the opportunity to go through the issues that seemingly have made the north west less competitive.</P>
        <P>I ask that we take on board the issue currently being before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is examining the reasons for the price differential in products between the North and the South.  I raised the issue of Translink here prior to Christmas.  If one buys one&rsquo;s ticket in Dublin, it will cost &euro;52 return, but if one buys it in Belfast it will cost &pound;36 sterling, which is an exchange rate of 69 cent to the sterling &pound;1.  That is completely wrong for a co-financed European &ldquo;hands across the Border&rdquo; project.  We have to get the message out loud and clear to consumers that they have to stand up and reject such exploitation.  It would be useful if we could take on the issues in this House that are being dealt with <Col N="680"/>in that committee and explore further the factors that are making us less competitive.  We have to get the message out to retailers, suppliers or whoever is causing the problem that we will not stand over the exploitation of the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can raise that point during the debate later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>During the debate and talk about economic doom and gloom last week, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, sadly announced the abandonment of the sports capital programme.  It has served sporting organisations and rejuvenated and consolidated rural communities.  It has funded sports clubs for young people.  It has given people in rural Ireland a great opportunity to fundraise and develop their local communities.  That was a retrograde decision by the Minister.  We should not forget that this is a Minister who, I believe, is ostensibly an anti-rural Ireland politician.  I say that because he is the Minister who abolished the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant when he was Minister with responsibility for local government.  He is also the Minister who increased, in some cases by 600%, the planning and development charges attached to one-off houses in rural areas.  The combined financial calamity of that decision is about &euro;10,000, which has impacted on many young people throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Given that he has now kicked rural Ireland further in the gut, will the sports capital programme be reactivated in 2010?  What will happen to the money that has been raised through the national lottery system?  Given that grants will not be paid this year, what will become of that money? I want the Leader to ask in particular if a cost benefit analysis was carried out prior to this decision.  If the answer to that question is yes, I would judge the decision, in its entirety, to be ill advised.</P>
        <P>The unemployment statistics released yesterday are frightening.  I was in the company of other Oireachtas Members when the announcement was made on the news yesterday.  The reaction on their faces was a sight to behold.  Given that the numbers out of work have reached 327,000, is it not time that we debate in earnest how to provide job creation opportunities, employment schemes and return to education schemes?  We must ensure there are upskilling and retraining opportunities for those who lose their jobs, particularly the many workers in the construction industry who did not go on to third level education because of the lure of the earnings to be made on building sites.  These people are now seeking work without the benefit of a skill or trade.  Training schemes must be brought up to a standard that reflects the current economic difficulty.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, I intend to press the amendments I have tabled on Committee Stage of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008.  Our names appear jointly under some of the amendments.  I advise Members on the Government side to follow us into the lobbies if they are serious and determined in their views on that legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader consider it fair that young garda&iacute;, teachers and nurses will now have to hand over an additional &euro;300 or &euro;400 per month to the Exchequer as a result of the pension levy?  Meanwhile, a consultant in a private clinic has only to bear an additional income levy of 1%.  Is that fair?</P>
        <P>I conclude by saying that I do not believe Senator O&rsquo;Toole is ignorant.  One could never level that type of allegation at a Kerryman.  As a former T&aacute;naiste from Kerry said in D&aacute;il <Col N="681"/>&Eacute;ireann some years ago, &ldquo;When you are as ignorant as we are on this side of the House, you have to be very clever.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>I support Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s call for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, to attend a debate in this House on the various incentives and investment policies in place to encourage enterprise and entrepreneurship.  Like Senator Ormonde, I support the good work being done by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan in regard to the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008.</P>

	<P>I simply wish to record my support for Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and to point to my knowledge of the Bantry Bay and Dunmanus Bay areas.  I hope the Senator is successful in his endeavours.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on the schools building programme?  A school in my constituency, St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s junior boys school in Clontarf, is in need of replacement classrooms.  The current prefabricated facilities have been in use long past their life expectancy.  When the Taoiseach announced the expenditure measures last Tuesday, he indicated that &euro;300 million was to be reprioritised for the schools building programme.  I hope St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s school will be accommodated in this reprioritisation and that we will have a better understanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Harris expressed irritation at all the talk in this House and the questioning of Government economic policy.  He suggests that we need a national Government.  The reality, however, is that politics is a battle of ideas, exchange and dialogue as to what are the best policies for the State.  That is what parliamentary democracy is about, pure and simple.  The Senator may feel uncomfortable on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches at this particular time given the absence of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>These remarks are a preface to my question to the Leader.  A national Government is required when the incumbent Administration does not have the numbers to take decisions.  Leadership and competent Government are essential in this crisis and are precisely what we do not have.  There has been much constructive engagement by the Opposition.  We have offered many ideas and have acknowledged the seriousness of the economic difficulties with which we are faced.  In the last seven months in particular, the Opposition has urged the Taoiseach to take some decisions.  He has failed to do so.  Moreover, his procrastination has further worsened the economic circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue can be discussed later.  Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>By way of constructive criticism, I have a question for the Leader.  The Taoiseach made the announcement on Tuesday of his grand plan to secure a reduction in Exchequer expenditure.  Of the &euro;2 billion in savings to be made this year, &euro;1.4 billion is to <Col N="682"/>come from the public sector pension levy.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today, Dominic Coyle writes that, after tax relief, the saving will be &euro;900 million rather than &euro;1.4 billion.  Given that the changes will not be introduced until March, the saving for 2009 will be only &euro;750 million.  I do not point to this figure in order to suggest it should be higher or lower.  However, it raises the question of whether the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and officials in the Department of Finance can count.  The &euro;1.4 billion was supposed to be the definite figure in this patchwork proposal for &euro;2 billion in savings.  Now, however, it is not at all clear that even that particular target will be achieved.  Will the Leader clarify this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the comments this morning by Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole in regard to the Holocaust.  However, I must correct Senator Norris on one point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is not the time to correct other Members.  Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, I did not compare Senator O&rsquo;Toole to a clown.  He is far from a clown.  Rather, I compared him to a clever man who uses the catch cries of the clown.  There is an important distinction.  I have great respect for both Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Norris.</P>
        <P>We are all glad the Vatican has made clear not only that it was unaware of this man&rsquo;s unacceptable views but also that he may hold no post as a prelate unless he renounces those views.  The lesson from all this is that it is good to presume good will because good will is generally what is there.  There may be another lesson, namely, that if the media coverage had brought out the nuances of this story in advance, we might not have had much of the commentary that took place in various parliaments and in the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Senator&rsquo;s question to the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased Senator Hannigan raised the issue of the proposed cuts in the overseas aid budget.  He is absolutely right to cite the observation of Mr. Hans Zomer of D&oacute;chas that those who have not contributed to the financial crisis but are affected most severely by it are the very people whom Irish Aid is designed to reach.  It is shameful that while 2% of our budget is allocated to Irish Aid, 5% of the proposed expenditure cuts apply to it.  I call for a specific debate on this matter.  Our treatment of the poorest in the world will reflect how we treat each other at home.  That is the issue.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk recently of announcements being made outside the Oireachtas.  I am concerned to read the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today of yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings in the Supreme Court wherein the State seems to be putting forward as its position that the human embryo does not enjoy any constitutional rights under the definition of &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.  Is the State throwing the case and pre-empting the Supreme Court decision by making this dramatic announcement about what it believes the law should be, without any debate having taken place on the issue in the Oireachtas?  It is very disturbing.  The Attorney General seems to believe that the human embryo is property, the equivalent of a blood sample.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is moral anarchy.  It is extremely disturbing that the State seems to be speaking in this way on a very sensitive issue.  I call for a debate on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader undertake to invite the Taoiseach to the House, given that he has not been here since he assumed office?  It is important that he attend a debate <Col N="683"/>on the role of the Government and the programme for Government.  I remind Senators opposite who raised the issue of a national Government that only this week the leader of my party, Deputy Kenny, was refused a briefing by the Government.  Why has the Government refused to take on board the policies my party has put forward?  It makes no sense to make an argument for national Government if the policies proposed by the Opposition are not even entertained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my first question.  Members opposite are open to a charge of hypocrisy if they continue to talk out of both sides of their mouths.  They should vote with the Opposition, if they believe what we say is right.  If not, they should not say two things.</P>
        <P>In light of my Adjournment matter on Tuesday, I ask the Leader for a debate on the national lottery and on where the money it raises is going.  In his reply, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, stated the money from the national lottery goes into Exchequer finances.  I believe the decision by the Minister to put a freeze on the sports capital programme is wrong.  It sends the wrong message to the sporting community and voluntary groups but, more important, it stops us as a nation and a society from building a sustainable community.  We have benefited greatly from the sports capital programme.  I would much prefer to see the national lottery funding local sporting and community groups rather than sponsoring &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; on TV3.</P>
        <P>I join with Senator Norris in condemning Eircom, a private company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please.  The Senator should not display documentation from any company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not, but it is wrong of Eircom to promote a former Taoiseach at the expense of other politicians.  Let us have fair play.  It sends the wrong message, creates a second class of politician and should not be done.  It also upsets people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse some of the cries for a national effort, whether one calls it national government or solidarity among the parties.  There is a sense of urgency in this House, among both Government and Opposition, about the emergency situation we face.  In Northern Ireland, when they were trying to make the big leap they said they would all jump together.  If we are prepared to make sacrifices, it is important that we all jump together.  In that light, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and National Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to come to this House to tell us why the workforce in the ESB is being given a 3.5% rise, at a time when unemployment has soared to 326,000 and everybody else is told to make a sacrifice on pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is unforgivable that it should happen at this time.  This is a well-paid workforce where people earn up to &euro;70,000 per year, with some, I suspect, earning a great deal more.  This body is owned by the Government, although a semantic defence is put that it is private sector under partnership.  That is nonsense.  The ESB is owned and controlled by the Government.  It was refreshing to hear the Minister, Deputy Gormley, state, courageously, that he was concerned about this issue.  Concern is not enough.  The Government has the power to direct the ESB not to pay this exorbitant increase.  Otherwise, the national solidarity we are discussing will be broken left, right and centre by people.  One cannot blame them.  Everybody will take what they can get away with.  The problem here is they are being allowed to get away <Col N="684"/>with it by the Government and the Opposition, including all Members, who make exhortations to people to help the national effort.</P>
        <P>The Leader might allow us to have an answer to that by inviting the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to the House.</P>

	<P>With regard to what is happening in the Supreme Court concerning the status of the unborn, we have discussed this matter <i>ad nauseam</i> in both Houses, and on Committee Stages in this House.  The fact that we have not legislated for IVF treatment in this country has been highlighted.  The Leader should take the matter back to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  Since 2005, she has stated she would make this a priority.  Nothing has happened, to the detriment of women who have received the treatment in this country since then.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the issue of national government, the Leader might tell us what ministries he would like the Opposition to take care of in such an event.</P>

I got an instruction from the Government Chief Whip and Senators will know that I must take instruction with regard to these matters.

	<P>On a point of information, the last time we had a situation like this in the House, I checked with the Opposition Whip in the other House, and there was no request for a pair.  I wish to clarify that.  The situation may have changed in the meantime but I speak of past experience.</P>

	<P>I also propose, with the permission of the House, that the Minister will be called upon at 3.45 p.m. and will have 15 minutes to respond to points made by Senators.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Coghlan, Harris, Ormonde, Healy Eames, McCarthy, Regan, Buttimer and Ross expressed their serious concerns about the economy, especially with regard to the new unemployment figures.   It is a serious and difficult time for all of us in the Oireachtas, and for the people, in particular those who are unemployed and those who have been let go, especially people who never experienced this before.  We must be confident that the measures announced by Government in the past 48 hours are the start of what will be the corrective path to assist these people.  As Senators have noted this morning, our priority must be the creation of jobs.   Senator Keaveney asked for a debate on innovation and the role of the entrepreneur.  That must be our preoccupation.   Senator Ross is correct.  The ESB is not leading by example in any national sense.  I heard the interviews on the radio this morning.  The Minister said he expects energy costs will be reduced to double digit figures.  They are unsustainable now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>They are 30% higher than they should be.  The Government has a duty to ensure those who are in employment are given a level playing field with regard to the cost of energy.  There are many very decent people employed in the ESB who always answered the call in all kinds of emergencies.  I compliment them and acknowledge their actions.  They have one of the top best-serving chief executives our country has ever had.   However, in the national interest, the gesture is required.  We are all in this together to help and do everything we possibly can to maintain the jobs that are there and to support those who are unfortunate to be unemployed.  Energy cost is a major contributory factor.  After wages, insurance costs used to be the second largest expenditure on the balance sheet but now energy costs are in that position.</P>
        <P>I can tell the House at first hand that energy costs have increased by 50% in the past 12 months for most businesses in Ireland.  Domestic energy costs have increased even more.  This hits everybody in society.  One the one hand, I compliment the ESB, and the workers were entitled to the increase, but a gesture is needed in the national interest and I call on the ESB to do that.  As Senator Ross correctly pointed out, as soon as one organisation thinks it can get away with this, it is human nature for others to follow.  The example has been given, and it is not the one we need.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan spoke the great work done by the Irish Film Board.  He congratulated Pat Shortt and all his team on the film &ldquo;Garage&rdquo; and the great acknowledgment of our country.  I have supported this industry all my life.  I know many who participate in it and live on a wing and a prayer most of their lives.  They got very little from the State, and did not want anything, but they are great innovators and entrepreneurs whom we should support.  I will pass on Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s views to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan called on me to ascertain the date of the refinancing of the banks.  The Minister will be in the House this morning and I suggest all those questions be directed to him during the debate on the economy.  He will be able to give up-to-date information on that, and on pension entitlements and what we will do for people who have been making contributions all of their lives in good faith to pension funds, whether private or public.  A whole new look is urgently needed, particularly in light of the Waterford Crystal debacle.</P><Col N="686"/>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Norris and Mullen all welcomed the good news and good wishes were extended across the board by the Independent Senators to each other.  We are all very happy for them.  The Holy Father will intervene and assist them in any way he can.</P>

	<P>Senators Norris, Ormonde, Healy-Eames and Mullen expressed their serious concerns regarding human rights issues and everything pertaining to them.  I can pass on their strong views to the Minister.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, was to be in the House this week but, as we know, he has accompanied President McAleese to the Gulf.  I have another date arranged in the Minister&rsquo;s diary.  On Tuesday last the Taoiseach and Government made an extra allocation of funding to the Department of Education and Science and the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney, McCarthy and Callely called for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, to come to the House to discuss innovation and entrepreneurship.  At that discussion or perhaps today, the spokespersons should make an issue of the concerns we heard this morning on the radio and in the newspapers regarding the low level of students taking up science and maths.  I will be guided in this House on how we can play our part.  When I was Chairman of the enterprise, trade and small business committee I proposed that an extra 50% of marks should be given in the leaving certificate to encourage students in maths and science to take these two subjects because this is where the high end jobs will be in the future when the global economy begins to pick up.</P>
        <P>Senators McCarthy and Buttimer called for a debate on the sports capital programme, the success of which has been fantastic.  Every parish in Ireland has benefited over the years from the national lottery funding.  I very much admire the Minister, who has been very willing to come to this House in all the portfolios he has held as Minister or as Minister of State.  If I had a criticism of the Minister it is that if I were in his shoes I would not have announced the funding until early this year because he got very little credit and thanks for it.  Now he has to say truthfully and honestly the funding probably has to go to health.  He says it is going back into the Exchequer.  However, those of us who are here a long time know it is probably going into the health portfolio because that is where the money is needed most.  We have to under<Col N="687"/>stand that.  The use to which the national lottery funding has been put throughout the country has been immense.  We have seen it in all voluntary organisations.  I ask the people of Ireland to continue supporting the national lottery because if the funding is going to health it is going to an equally, if not more, deserving cause in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>I will pass on Senator Callely&rsquo;s views to the Minister regarding the particular school.  However, as the Cathaoirleach has correctly pointed out, this could be a matter for an Adjournment debate when the Senator could make his very worthy case.  I will have no problem holding a debate on Senator Mullen&rsquo;s serious concern regarding what is taking place in the courts regarding human embryos.  Private Members&rsquo; time is coming up for the Independent Members in a few weeks&rsquo; time.  If legislation does not allow us to take it in the House, perhaps Senator Mullen can discuss this with his Leader and see how this can be achieved.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for the Taoiseach to come to the House.  I discussed this with him during the Christmas recess.  He is very anxious to avail of the opportunity to come to the House and I have asked him to update us on North-South affairs, which was always the subject of the visits to the Seanad by previous Taoisigh of all Governments.  I hope this will happen as soon as possible.  Senator Twomey made a point and I will pass his strong views on to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>

    <Title>Stabilisation of the Public Finances: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to set out the basis for the Government decisions on expenditure and the economy, announced on Tuesday, and to commend them to Senators for their support.  As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have made clear, we are now living in exceptionally difficult budgetary times, and the measures announced on Tuesday are likewise exceptional.  The Government has had to take resolute action, and, despite constant criticism, the Government has not been found wanting.  It is easy to castigate, speculate and to make pronouncements from the sidelines, but ultimately it is the responsibility of the Government and the Oireachtas to act in necessary time in the interests of all our citizens.</P>
        <P>The economic background is stark.  Growth is forecast to decline by 4.5% this year, and export growth will be negative.  Unemployment has increased significantly to date and, unfortunately, is set to continue to rise to 400,000 or beyond.  The Government has prioritised the creation and maintenance of jobs above the maintenance of income levels.  Improved competitiveness must be at the heart of our economic policy.  The Government&rsquo;s resolute actions must be seen in this light.  On the positive side, inflation is set to ease considerably over the course of 2009, reflecting reductions in interest rates and lower prices of oil and other commodities.  All of this helps to boost any given income in real spending terms and means we can obtain better value for money from a given level of expenditure, including of course in the capital area.</P>
        <P>The current condition of our public finances is such as would require us to borrow &euro;18 billion this year.  In the present international climate, and against the background of easily alarmed sentiment among global bond markets, such borrowing must be financed at ever-steeper interest rates.  This is why the national debt will rise to more than 45% of GNP, although it is still below the Maastricht guidelines, and spending on interest costs alone will come to &euro;4.5 billion, or 12% of the total tax take, in 2009.  This is of course an unsustainable position and must be corrected.</P><Col N="688"/>
        <P>To listen to some critics, one might think that Government fiscal policy over the past decade and more was without any thought to the future.  The reality is different.  Our establishment of and investment in the National Pension Reserve Fund means our net debt has been much lower than in most other EU countries, and this, together with the cash balances built up by the NTMA, allows for a better funding position than would otherwise be the case.</P>
        <P>The Government has set out a clear three-pronged strategy to correct our public finances and restore our economy.  We must lower our cost base as rapidly as possible and become the highly competitive economy we once were, rebuilding a platform for future export-led growth; we must maintain the real value of our investment in our national productive capacity; and last but not least, we must carry through this policy in as fair and balanced a manner as possible to reinforce social solidarity along the lines that have long been a hallmark of this Government.  Reducing public expenditure is never an easy task.  At present, social welfare spending accounts for around &euro;20 billion of the &euro;55 billion or so the Government spends on current goods and services.  The pay bill accounts for a further &euro;20 billion, and the balance of &euro;15 billion represents all other day-to-day spending on public services, grants, administration and consumables.  There is limited scope to reduce social welfare given the Government&rsquo;s priority of protecting the vulnerable.  In the past number of years, there has been a strong focus on securing greater efficiencies in the delivery of the &euro;15 billion that is not pay, and further such savings are planned.  All that remains is the public pay bill.  We cannot avoid looking to this area to secure major savings.</P>
        <P>Of course, we could have recourse straight away to tax measures, but let us think that through a little.  Increases in indirect taxes would undermine already weak consumer confidence and drive more shoppers north of the Border.  Further increases in income tax would affect our ability to produce goods and services.  Meddling with company taxation would drive away foreign direct investment, which is a key driver of jobs growth.  The scope for capital tax increases is simply not there at the moment.  The Commission on Taxation will take a considered look at these and all other options and report to Government later this year.  For now, we must start to put our fiscal house in order by looking at the expenditure side.  That is the task that is facing the Government.  Its actions are essential to underpin our creditworthiness and the confidence of investors both at home and abroad, and ultimately our ability to continue paying for public services.</P>
        <P>International investors understand that the problems we are experiencing are not unique to us.  In fact, we are now in the midst of an international recession of unsurpassed severity, prompted in turn by the worst crisis in international financial markets since the Bretton Woods agreement was instituted.  All major world economies, and most of the minor ones too, are now suffering or will suffer this year.  As Ireland is a small, open trading economy, its difficulties are exacerbated by exchange rate movements.  It is also true that our excessive reliance in the recent past on the domestic market and the housing sector as drivers of growth has proven to be a serious structural weakness within our economy.  That is the diagnosis.  The Government is now concerned with finding the solution to our problems and setting us back on the path to recovery and ultimately prosperity.  The budgetary measures we have had to take are not pleasant, and we are profoundly conscious of the burden we are asking public service workers, including all in these Houses, to share.</P>
        <P>It is now fashionable to charge the Government with recklessness in our desire over the years of plenty to improve public services and improve the lot of those who were poor and marginalised.  Generally, the only voice of dissent from the Opposition benches to our initiatives in these areas was that we should have been doing even more, and sooner.  The same voices now berate us for having tried to do too much, spend too much, and reduce taxes too far and <Col N="689"/>too fast.  In the May 2007 election platforms of the parties opposite, the main commitment was to reduce the standard rate of income tax to 18%, plus a raft of other tax concessions.</P>
        <P>We were all mistaken about the relative security of our position.  Now is not a time for mutual recrimination but for common purpose &mdash; for social solidarity, which is the principle behind the Government&rsquo;s response to our current problems.  We engaged fully with the social partners and sought to draw up a solidarity pact to put before this House together with a series of measures to secure savings of &euro;2 billion on a full-year basis, which are needed as a minimum to start restoring fiscal balance.  Regrettably, it was not possible to reach full agreement on that.  But that does not alter the fact that the savings are essential, or the continuing value of social partnership.  Unless we are prepared to shoulder the burden collectively now, much greater sacrifices may be forced on us at a later date.  The Government, therefore, must proceed with the proposals it formulated in our discussions.</P>
        <P>The larger part of the savings proposed are in the area of pay and pension contributions.  In total, these changes will yield savings of &euro;1.4 billion in a full year.  The great bulk of the saving will come from a new pension-related payment which will be paid by all public servants, including TDs and Senators.  Those who have already made a voluntary surrender of salary, among them some Members of the Oireachtas, may discontinue that surrender should they so choose and substitute their contribution through the new pension payment.  For its part, the Government, which includes for this purpose Ministers of State, has decided to continue with its 10% voluntary surrender in addition to the pension contribution of more than 9%.  Those in positions of leadership in all parts of this country must lead by example.  The remuneration of political advisers will also be adjusted in line with the pension contribution.</P>
        <P>The payment will be on a graduated, progressive scale, with the average payment being 7.5% of total earnings.  It will apply to all elements of the public service pay bill, with the exception of employers&rsquo; PRSI, including both pensionable items and non-pensionable items such as overtime.  This payment is in recognition of the fact that public service pensions are significantly more favourable than the generality of pensions in the private sector, together with the need to reduce net public service pay costs.  This change will require new legislation which will be introduced as a matter of urgency.  A much smaller component of the total pay-related savings will be achieved through reductions in travelling and subsistence rates and other savings.  In addition, the increases provided for under Towards 2016: Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 with effect from 1 September 2009 and 1 June 2010 will not now be paid on those dates.  Further discussions on these increases will be held in 2011 without prior commitment.  This will represent an additional saving of up to &euro;1 billion in 2010, making a start on the &euro;4 billion savings that will be required then.</P>
        <P>The pay-related savings will also apply to local authority staff.  To that end, it will be necessary to amend the existing legislation on the local government fund.  Again, it is proposed that the necessary legislative amendments be introduced as a matter of urgency.  Public servants paying the new pension contribution will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as those making pension contributions in the private sector.  Contributions will be deducted from gross pay by employers before income tax, PRSI and health levies are calculated and, as such, will be effectively relieved of tax at the marginal rate.</P>
        <P>Flexibility in responding to changing service demands must be pursued with determination.  In this context, the Minister for Finance is establishing an innovative mechanism via the Public Appointments Service and the Commission for Public Service Appointments to facilitate the redeployment of surplus staff in several areas and the matching of vacancies at all levels across the civil and public service.  The redeployment of staff across different sectors of the public service organisations, for example, Civil Service, local authorities, HSE and State agencies, <Col N="690"/>gives rise to technical, legal and human resource issues that will require consultation with local management and staff unions.  Discussions have  been taking place already with relevant Civil Service unions about the redeployment of staff into social welfare offices.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach sets the pay-related savings measures across the public service as part of the comprehensive national effort to adjust incomes, with the aim of restoring competitiveness in national incomes generally.  This is not about targeting the public service, which we value.  I have been a public servant for 34 years, both permanent and temporary, apart from some periods in opposition.  We are simply asking public servants to share in the adjustment that is taking place more broadly across the economy, especially in the unprotected sector.</P>
        <P>Savings will be also vigorously pursued in all appropriate State payments to individuals, including fees payable to medical and legal professionals.  The need to engage in consultation with professional interests, and the delays that may ensue, may limit the scope for securing the full savings we would like in 2009.  Here again, the Government would appeal to all sections of our country and our society to engage expeditiously and with good will in the collective national effort to deal with this unprecedented economic downturn.</P>
        <P>The following supplementary measures are required to realise the full &euro;2 billion: a modest retrenchment on overseas development aid this year in view of our diminishing resources &mdash; this still leaves our ODA spending rate among the highest in the world at about 0.53% of GNP; a small reduction in the early child care supplement to &euro;1,000 per year and a lower  maximum age of five years &mdash; this will save &euro;75 million in a full year; a further &euro;140 million to be pruned from administrative and other spending on staff, advertising, travel and procurement; and a reduction of &euro;300 million across the board in spending on capital, still leaving our spending rate as a percentage of GNP at more than 5% and among the highest in Europe.</P>
        <P>Within this revised capital envelope, a sum of &euro;150 million is being reallocated, half each, to labour intensive spending on schools building projects and energy saving measures, which is being funded from all parts of the capital programme, including education.  With falling construction prices, we should be able to maintain a high output of projects even with reduced allocations.  Tender prices in a variety of areas such as national roads, schools, higher education and social housing tell a consistent story.  We are getting a bigger result from a given level of capital funding or more from less.  Even with reduced allocations, careful and proactive management of capital allocations will enable priority, high-return projects to be delivered.</P>
        <P>We are already well on track to complete the major inter-urban routes next year.  We will continue to invest in public transport.  We will continue to expand commuter rail and the Luas network and invest in other suburban rail services such as the Cork-Midleton line, the Kildare line upgrade and phase one of the Navan line.  We will continue to support the development of the smart economy and direct capital investment towards science and technology, inward investment and indigenous enterprise.</P>
        <P>The total saving comes to &euro;2,090 million in a full year.  In addition, there will be saving of up to &euro;1 billion in 2010 from not paying pay increases next year.  In announcing these measures, we have focused not just on short-term needs but also on the vital necessity of preparing the ground for eventual economic recovery.  We have tried to protect the most vulnerable.  We have sought to maintain capital spending in real terms, and redirected much of it to areas that can sustain and protect jobs.  We have sought to make a firm start now to take us off the path of high borrowing and job-destroying tax rises in the future that would cripple us before long.</P>
        <P>More must be done in a planned way in 2010, 2011 and beyond.  The Government&rsquo;s economic framework published before Christmas provides the blueprint that informs all of our progress.  We have a competitive advantage in the knowledge and skill base of our people, and we will <Col N="691"/>build on it further.  We have an advantage in our flexibility in responding to change and to challenges and we are demonstrating that flexibility and firmness of purpose now.  This Government will play to our strengths in rebuilding our economy and seeking new opportunities for job creation, export growth and future prosperity for all our people.</P>
        <P>A Chathaoirligh, I am happy to commend the Government&rsquo;s expenditure measures and economic strategy to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has often spoken at length in this House and he always has been good at revision of history.  The Opposition never had the same views as the Government over the past five to ten years.  We had different views on benchmarking, which some people considered an automated teller machine or ATM for the public service when it was introduced.  We made a strong case at that time to the Government to deal with the issues of accountability, transformation and reform of the public service.  We were ignored by the Government.  From that point of view we were quite different.</P>
        <P>We had a different view on decentralisation.  We urged the Government to be careful in what it did to the civil and public service in its plans for decentralisation as it could ruin the service rather than improve it.  The initial announcement by the former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, outlined a scattergun approach of 53 decentralisation locations throughout the country.  It was soon reined in to less than 40, and progress in that programme has not improved.  The majority of staff who moved under decentralisation were already living outside the greater Dublin area and simply moved to a different location outside Dublin.</P>
        <P>We also raised concerns about the PPARS project and the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money on a system for paying health service staff that has since been switched off.  These issues, and there are more if I had sufficient time to discuss them, marked our approach as significantly different from that of the Government.  The Minister should acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>In discussing the stabilisation of the economy and what we should do for the future, we should start with our democracy.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have been neutered by Fianna F&aacute;il in the past two decades.  They have become nothing more than places to rubber stamp decisions made in Dublin Castle by the Government, its advisers and the social partners.  The Government has taken power from the people and given it to a select group.  It simply came to the Oireachtas to present us with reports or a <i>fait accompli </i>and told us to vote on them.</P>
        <P>We have heard speakers from the Government benches speak in support of what Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan is doing about the Harbours Bill in an effort to protect local democracy and issues which he considers very important.  However, if Senator O&rsquo;Donovan was not standing up for those issues, all the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators would have voted for that Bill by now.  That is how much both Houses of the Oireachtas have been neutered.  Even the Government representatives will rubber stamp whatever is decided.  They will not speak their minds and say what they believe is wrong about Government policy.  They will not stand up against that policy but, like sheep, will do what they are told by their betters in Fianna F&aacute;il.  That has led to many of our current problems.</P>
        <P>It sickens me to hear members of Fianna F&aacute;il criticise the Opposition for saying hard things about the Government, as if we are not being sufficiently patriotic in what we do.  Our job, since the Government has neutralised Parliament, is to stand up to the Government and be extremely critical of it.  It is not our job to come up with solutions for the Government.  Most Ministers have between 200 and 500 civil servants and advisers to help them in that role.  When we do offer solutions and suggestions, they are ignored in the majority of cases.  There is no consensus in this Parliament between the different political parties because it is the Government&rsquo;s decision not to have such consensus.</P><Col N="692"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The next decade will be extremely difficult.  The economy will not turn around in 2010 or 2011 and Ministers who claim it will are only continuing the foolishness they have displayed in the past couple of years since the election was won in 2007.  It was only last March that the members of the Government felt they could pay themselves 14% increases in their ministerial salaries, which was incredibly out of touch with what we knew was happening in our economy at the time.  We knew there were difficulties.  I said in this House I thought it was a mistake when I received a letter last September stating we were to get a 2.5% pay increase, given that everybody knew the reason we were having a budget in October was that the national finances had deteriorated so much.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Celtic tiger was going well, I never heard any Minister giving credit to Alan Dukes for his role in the Tallaght strategy.  All the credit was soaked up by Fianna F&aacute;il and its party members with no credit given.</P>

	<P>More important now is for the Government representatives to begin speaking their minds in the same way we do, and this includes the Senators opposite.  They must give up this idea of being Mighty Mouse in their constituencies and Mickey Mouse in Dublin.  This has had a detrimental effect on our politics and democracy and is why we are in this type of scenario.  We are playing politics with people&rsquo;s lives and it has been going on for too long.</P>
        <P>To give some idea of how disjointed the situation is, I will give a simple example.  Private health insurance contributions are tax deductible at only the standard rate of tax.  If a person wants dental treatment for his or her children, it is deductible at the standard rate.  When the Minister, Deputy Harney, was asked the reason for this, she said she wanted everybody to be treated equally and did not want those on better incomes to somehow have better access to medical and dental care on the basis of tax.  Yet, in regard to pensions, if one pays at the higher rate of tax, one can deduct expenses at the higher rate.  This seems to be a contradiction.</P>
        <P>This issue is not being taken into account with regard to the level of overall savings.  Ministers are everywhere saying they will save &euro;2 billion.  They will not save &euro;2 billion because at least &euro;300 million will be paid back in tax rebates to those making pension contributions.  It is very difficult to support a Government that simply cannot get its figures right.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to wake up to the seriousness of the situation.  A contribution was made in the House this morning stating that we have not realised how serious the issue is.  We have realised it.  If America has the iPod, we are part of the i-pigs.  We are one of five countries in Europe that is considered by international investors to have an extremely poor credit rating.  This is the price we are paying.  The public is being drip-fed announcements by Government &mdash; we are not going to nationalise, we are going to nationalise; things are bad, things are not so bad; we are not going to tax you, we are going to tax you.  They have lost confidence in the Minister and at the same time the clouds of the wider global economic downturn are swirling around us.  We understand this.  Our situation is much worse than people perhaps acknowledge.  The IMF pointed out that the economic downturn of 2% in some of the large economies is extremely serious yet the economic downturn in this country will be at least 5%.</P><Col N="693"/>
        <P>If we are talking about moving forward, when we ask questions of Ministers, I would like them answered.  Often when we ask questions in the House, they are not answered and we are not told what is happening.  Much information is still not getting to these Houses in time.  For example, I read a report on what will happen to taxes in the future.  One of the concerns is that the tax take will be down during the course of 2009.  The Department of Finance is not in a position to give us the different profiles for each of the tax categories.</P>
        <P>I presume the reason for this is that the situation is difficult and unpredictable for the next couple of months.  However, when that is the situation, there is an even greater need for Ministers to come to both Houses to give us as much information as they have, to let us know they do not know and to stop acting as if they do know.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for the past five or six months have been acting like they are great fountains of knowledge who will protect this country, only for them to be exposed as emperors with no clothes a couple of months later, in some cases a few days later.  This is only putting fear into people&rsquo;s minds.  There is a need for the Government to be more open.</P>
        <P>When the Government says we must make changes and become more competitive, what does it mean by competitiveness?  In a contribution to this House two weeks ago, I pointed out in regard to the health service that consultants in Northern Ireland get paid a maximum of &euro;100,000 whereas consultants on this side of the Border are being paid at least &euro;180,000.  The same goes for all other categories of workers.  Is the health care system in Northern Ireland substantially worse than that in the Republic?  In Northern Ireland, 10% of people feel the need to get private health insurance because they do not trust the public health care system whereas, in the South, 70% feel the need to get such insurance.  Every individual north of the Border has free GP care but fewer than one third of the people on this side of the Border have this.  This is one section of Government expenditure where costs, efficiency and delivery can be examined.  We are completely out of kilter with what is happening just north of the Border, even before we begin making other international comparisons.</P>
        <P>That is what competitiveness is all about.  It is not the mumbo jumbo Ministers go on with and on which they publish documents.  We have priced ourselves out of being a small, open, global economy and this is the price we are paying.  We are still not prepared to accept that sort of language.  This is the fourth or fifth time I have debated the economy in the House.  If I studied the last four or five speeches from Ministers who have come to the House, there has not been much change.  In fact, today&rsquo;s debate is probably the most substantial example of the Government actually doing something.  It will actually impose a pension tax on public and civil servants, reducing services that are being provided for children and others across our economy.</P>
        <P>It is the first time something tangible is being done but, even as it is being done, the Government figures are still all wrong.  The Government gives a figure of &euro;2 billion but I suspect that because it must introduce legislation and other changes, this will drag on and we will have no idea what will be saved this year.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, said we have more or less reached the end of the line.  He said we cannot change corporate tax, income tax or capital gains tax.  He said we cannot do any more and he gave his reasons for this.  However, if things do get worse, what is the next step for the Government?  What if 400,000 people are unemployed in September and the situation is getting tighter?  What is the next step or will that also be pulled out of the hat like a rabbit sometime in July, and will we live in denial until the very last minute?  Is the Government planning to make changes to capital spending or income taxes?</P>
        <P>If the members of the Government are talking about national government, partnership and consensus, why do they not share their thoughts with us?  Are we simply to lead ourselves into another abyss in a few months without the Government telling us what is going on?  Will the <Col N="694"/>Government continue to lose the confidence of the people?  A lack of knowledge brings fear, which is why people are panicking.  They just do not know what is happening and do not get the sense that the Government knows what is happening.</P>
        <P>There is time for the Government to come to the House to talk to us about what we will do next and potentially how bad the situation could get.  The banks have fallen off the radar, as it were, in recent weeks but a further &euro;15 billion or &euro;20 billion at least may need to be invested.  The Government has referred to a &euro;2 billion saving, but that is not the case.  The problem in the public finances amounts to &euro;20 billion per year.  We cannot get out of this problem by borrowing.  Debt in Ireland, including private debt made up of mortgages, car loans and credit card loans, is in excess of gross national product.  The people are already seriously in debt.  The Government cannot afford to fall into serious debt in the coming years.  That would bring us into the category of Iceland as a bankrupt state.  We are not there, but delusional thinking such as we need only consider savings of &euro;2 billion per year for everything to be fine will put us there.  There is a need for the Government to give a clearer idea of its strategy in the coming years to stabilise the public finances.  There is no point discussing something occurring in 2010 or 2012 and suggesting we need only make &euro;2 billion savings this year, &euro;3 billion in the following year and &euro;4 billion the year after that.  In each of those years we will borrow a minimum of &euro;20 billion.  There will be a shortfall of &euro;50 billion at the end of that three-year period.  If the economy contracts and does not improve in the coming years, then by 2011 it will not be in good enough shape to bring us out of recession.</P>
        <P>We should consider a detailed national plan for the coming three years, not simply a framework or a policy document, to give some idea of the worst possible scenario and a plan for the next decade.  That is how the Tallaght strategy worked and that is what Mr. Charles Haughey and Mr. Alan Dukes discussed.  They did not simply discuss the matter over a couple of months and discuss Mickey Mouse figures, which is essentially what we are discussing now.  They made some serious cuts at the time.  Some people say we never recovered from the cuts made then because we did not transform and change the health services during the good times.  We simply used benchmarking as a method of throwing money into the system.  However, it was not very efficient.</P>
        <P>Perhaps some of these matters might be addressed when the Minister is replying to the House, including the nature of the grand plan.  The Opposition should not be expected to come up with it; that is not its role.  We will produce some ideas.  We have provided opinions and backed the Government with some of its suggestions.  However, there is no leadership.  We are all very much in tune and we wish to know what is taking place.  It is not the job of ordinary men and women to pay attention to what is occurring.  We are paid to do so.  Perhaps many of those people are only now understanding the serious extent of the crisis.</P>
        <P>We wish to hear more from the Government benches than we have heard to date.  The Government must broadly indicate how it will proceed.  We have heard very little about its proposals for the banks, which is a significant part of the issue.  We do not know if reference has been made to stopping remuneration of senior bank officials.  Between giving the State guarantee and nationalising Anglo Irish Bank, millions of euro was paid in bonuses to managers at Anglo Irish Bank, in which the Government had no say.  There is a need for the Government to take control of such matters.  These are not weekend wonders where large meetings take place and everyone stays up until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. and then everything is forgotten.  There is a need to explain what is being done and what will be done with the senior management of the bank and how they will be made accountable.</P>
        <P>I listened to the car radio on the way to work and I heard one possibility which the Minister might consider.  A person spoke of how he was tied into fixed rate mortgage repayments <Col N="695"/>because he thought interest rates were increasing.  In the meantime, interest rates have dropped significantly.  When this person asked the bank if he could exit this arrangement, the bank indicated it would charge excessive amounts of money to do so.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, I had a similar arrangement and I worked it out.  The banks examine the difference between repayments now and if repayments were fixed, and that amount is charged over the course of the fixed term, whether it is two or three years.  What role has the Minister in such a scenario?  There is no point in suggesting writing to one&rsquo;s friendly bank manager.  Such a letter goes straight to the headquarters and a <i>pro forma</i> letter is returned.  In this case, the Minister could step in and, as the person bailing out the banks with &euro;8 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money, ensure the banks make null and void all these fixed mortgage terms, if so requested by the customer.  Some people may not wish to break such a contract, but that is an example of the leadership the Government should display for the people.  The significant savings we are now making on mortgage repayments, owing to the drop in interest rates, have been swiped from us by the pension tax and other levies introduced by the Government.  The Government could help those who have not benefited from the fall in interest rates because they are tied into fixed rate repayments.  Perhaps it should say to the banks tomorrow morning that if customers wish to break such a contract, both sides should sign to that effect and the contract would then be null and void.  The Government should show some leadership.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time with Senator O&rsquo;Malley, 15 minutes and five respectively.  However, I doubt if I will use 15 minutes as I wish to be as brief as possible.  I welcome the multiple opportunities in recent weeks to address the serious economic crisis we face, nationally and internationally.  Many have had the opportunity to put on the record of the House their views on the causes of the crises and the possible solutions to be undertaken by way of remedy.</P>
        <P>As it is customary, I will begin with a rebuttal of the remarks of my good friend, Senator Twomey.  I welcome the decisive action taken by the Government this week in terms of &euro;2 billion in savings.  I will return to the rebuttal.  Senator Twomey has referred to some of these actions.  I will go through each one and make a comment.  I refer to the amount of &euro;1.4 billion to be generated from the pensions levy.</P>
        <P>We have all received e-mails and calls from those within the public service.  There is much anger and frustration at this measure.  As I remarked on the Order of Business yesterday, as a public servant I share the anger and frustration resulting from the introduction of these measures.  In reality, circumstances have intervened to make such measures essential.  That is highly regrettable and it frustrates me.  I am angry, as are many public servants, that this is case.  However, I fully accept the necessity to do so.  We have no choice but to take it on the chin.  When tax receipts were significantly higher in recent years, it was possible to introduce certain measures which are no longer possible.  This is a simple fact.</P>
        <P>Some 80% of the workforce are in the private sector.  Most of these would gladly trade their position with ours because of the associated security.  They do not enjoy the same level of security at this time.  I am certain such people would gladly swap their positions with ours.  There is no question that every household in the country will have sacrifice and pain forced upon it by measures already introduced.  Clearly, more such measures are necessary as the situation continues to evolve.  That is another fact.  The Government has no choice but to provide decisive leadership by introducing the necessary measures to correct the public finances from their current state.  It is not sustainable to do otherwise.  I welcome the proposals of recent days as the first of several necessary steps as we proceed on a course to economic recovery.</P><Col N="696"/>
        <P>Recently published unemployment figures are extremely shocking and it is frightening that 37,000 people have signed on in January.  Other figures have been mentioned in this regard and Senator Harris this morning speculated on a figure of up to 700,000 people.  While I hope he is wrong, I fully understand the reason he said that.  This is extremely worrying and every possible measure must be taken to ensure as much employment as possible can be saved or created in these difficult times.  This is what is most important.  I appeal to those in the private sector, if possible, to try to consider the possibilities that may exist, such as short-time work or week on, week off work, instead of laying off people.  One manufacturer from County Meath to whom I spoke explained to me how he had put his staff onto a week on, week off basis rather than laying off anyone.  I respect such commitment to one&rsquo;s workforce and encourage it within the private sector to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>I refer to calls for a national Government, such as those I heard from Senator Harris on the Order of Business, and Senator Twomey also mentioned the possibility.  It is interesting that such calls are being made and, again, I can understand the reason for them.  However, I do not necessarily call for it.  Decisive leadership is what is required at this time and I believe this is what the public is getting.  I also believe that Members of the Opposition may not like this.  As Deputy Kenny noted in the other House recently, the role of the Opposition is to provide opposition and I am quite happy for it to so do if it wishes.  While the Opposition should do so in a constructive manner, I am not especially bothered if it does not because that is its choice.  At present, a majority exists on the Government side and any constructive suggestions made by the Opposition will be taken on board as the Government and Members on this side see fit.  I welcome any constructive suggestions made in this regard.</P>
        <P>I also have heard the Tallaght strategy being mentioned in this context many times.  However, the 1987 budget has been substantially credited with turning the tide at that time and, as I noted on the Order of Business yesterday, the Tallaght strategy did not exist until the following September.  A minority Government put through that budget and if the Opposition wishes to make constructive criticisms or points, it should do so.  However, I do not call for a national Government.  The Government must provide and is providing the level of leadership required to take difficult decisions to try to secure the future for our children and our grandchildren.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey made a number of points in respect of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill and noted that some Members on this side of the House, of whom I am one, had spoken in favour of the stance taken by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  What is important within any political party is a level of vitality to ensure the correct policies are being followed at all times.  In pursuit of this objective, it is important opinions differ when formulating policy as, otherwise, it simply constitutes public administration and, God knows, we have enough of that.  Senator Twomey should not worry about how Members on the Government side conduct themselves as they will continue to do so as they best see fit.</P>
        <P>While I can understand the frustration engendered by the cut of &euro;95 million in overseas development aid, as others have pointed out it is worth noting that Ireland is among the highest <i>per capita</i> contributors in the entire world.  Its <i>per capita</i> contributions are higher than those of the United States or the United Kingdom.  Moreover, throughout Europe only the Nordic countries, Luxembourg and the Netherlands make higher <i>per capita</i> contributions than Ireland.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the curtailment of the early child care supplement.  While it constitutes pain for every household in the country, it had to be done.  Although a recent increase of &euro;100 to &euro;1,100 was welcome, it now is necessary to reduce it back to &euro;1,000.</P>
        <P>I greatly welcome the general and administrative reductions of &euro;140 million as there is always room for improvement and efficiencies in respect of matters such as printing, stationery, adver<Col N="697"/>tising and so on, all of which are areas in which we have continually over-expended.  All businesses must keep such areas constantly under review and I welcome the proposed savings in this regard.</P>
        <P>As for the savings on the capital side, I welcome that much of the suggested &euro;300 million in savings will come from re-tendering and lower construction costs in respect of the various projects.  However, I also welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the capital programme, both as a stimulus to our economy and to ensure priority is given to those capital projects which will most contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  This is what is most important.</P>
        <P>While we are in unprecedentedly difficult times, both nationally and internationally, the world has not come to an end, nor will it do so.  We will come out of this and it is important to do everything we can to best position ourselves to capitalise on an upturn, when it comes.  While it is at times difficult, particularly these days, to identify light at the end of the tunnel, it will come.  It is vital to ensure those measures that are within our power to take, such as correcting the public finance issues, are taken quickly and decisively.  Regrettably, there is no easy way to take the appropriate action in the forthcoming weeks and beyond.  As I noted, I believe further measures must be taken in future budgets.  It would be nice if that could be spread as equitably and as fairly as possible among all sectors of society.  However, as I noted yesterday, I fear it will not be possible to so do without angering many people in this House and in many households of hard-working people nationwide.</P>
        <P>I am confident, however, that the Government, under the stewardship of the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and their Cabinet colleagues, will take the appropriate action.  It is important to maintain a level of agility and an ability to improvise as the situation continues to evolve.  If one looks to the United States, I have watched with interest as President Obama&rsquo;s stimulus package has been negotiated through the United States Senate &mdash; I was going to refer to it as the Seanad.  It is interesting to see that while the Democrats support it, the Republicans seek changes.  However, as President Obama noted, no plan is perfect and if it can be strengthened, that is good.  The same is true in Ireland.  These are the early steps towards building an economic recovery.  However, if they can be strengthened along the way, that certainly should be done and constructive criticism is welcome in this regard.</P>
        <P>As for the banking situation, I note with interest that the Government intends to proceed with the capitalisation plan.  I do not know whether this will take place this week or next week and I ask the Minister of State to provide clarity to Members in this regard as soon as possible.  I realise other matters are being considered.  Internationally, I note that in the United States, the possible introduction of an aggregator bank appears to be favoured, whereby bad debt would be pooled and centrally managed.  While I am unsure whether this is the correct option, perhaps it should be considered.  Moreover, insurance schemes in which governments will insure banks against potential bad debts over a certain level also are being considered.  If possible, the Minister of State should clarify whether there have been some suggestions on this matter at European Union level or whether proposed regulations are forthcoming.  Unquestionably, in a general sense the entire banking system in Ireland must change forever.  I am in favour of capped remuneration as one cannot continue with the level of incentivisation for risk taking that obtained in the past.  It has proven to be reckless and contributed, internationally as much as nationally, to much of the difficulty in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>I expect Members will continue regularly to have the opportunity to contribute on the economic crisis that faces us.  Above all, I am sure all Members would like to wish the Government well in all its endeavours on our behalf.  Some of today&rsquo;s media reports carry headlines on the so-called biggest bluffer in Leinster House and stated that populist platitudes will not solve the <Col N="698"/>problems.  Those terms do not apply to any Opposition Members in the House.  It is clear that, while everyone is trying to be as constructive as possible, some are better at it than others.</P>

	<P>A debate is an opportunity to share ideas and I am in attendance to listen to those of the Fine Gael Party, but there is none.  Unfortunately, we have been treated to constant whinging, questions about what went wrong and mumbling.  There are no ideas on how to get away from the problem.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by the way in which Deputy Gilmore spoke in the D&aacute;il last week.  Part of his job is to criticise the Government, which he did well, but the second part of his job is to tell us what he would do.  He let down himself and his party badly.  This is the difference.

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s measures, which clearly comprise the beginning of the stabilisation programme, will amount to &euro;2 billion this year, but it will not be long before we hear about the &euro;4 billion that must be saved next year and so on.</P>
        <P>A responsibility of office is to make tough decisions.  The Opposition is unfortunate in this regard.  While I do not expect it to fall over and say the Government has got everything right, I expect it to be responsible enough to say the Government was right on a tough decision and to back it to restore stability to the public finances.  Where the Opposition does not agree with a decision, it should outline where it would make the cuts.  Otherwise, it is only fooling people and letting down everyone.</P>
        <P>I have great faith in politics as a profession.  However, if the Government gets a decision wrong, we let ourselves down if all the Opposition does is kick to the sideline without offering a proper idea or robust argument on where it would make cuts or from whom it would demand additional revenue.  Where the Opposition is critical, it must provide proper opposition.</P>
        <P>Earlier this week, I mentioned that I grew up at the end of the last recession among school leavers who placed no hope in the country.  They only tried to put enough money together to leave the country, a dreadful situation I will never forget.  The Government must ensure the hopelessness of the 1980s never returns.  For this reason, it is necessary to make such tough decisions.</P>
        <P>It is not good or easy to govern at a time when cutbacks must be made, particularly after a time of prosperity when the most difficult decision for Ministers was the size of the increase to be given.  Everyone&rsquo;s expectations rose as a result.  Now, the international and national economies are unable to generate the same level of income.  We must grab the bull by the horns and arrest expenditure growth, which has been proposed in the plan.</P><Col N="699"/>
        <P>As the Taoiseach stated, it is never easy to ask people to pay more.  People in the public sector have a job security not possessed by those in the private sector.  The former must make the sacrifice that the latter has been making.  Many homes and families are being visited by the devastation of unemployment to which those in the public sector are, to a certain extent, immune.  For this reason, it is necessary that they make sacrifices.  The public sector must be honest in this regard.  During the week, people from a radio show went to County Galway to ask for comments.  RTE was somewhat disappointed with its vox pop, as most people recognised the fairness of what the Government is asking people to do.</P>
        <P>The second half of what must occur comprises measures to promote enterprise.  The private sector will get us out of the recession.  There must be measures to promote enterprise and the maximum amount of sustainable employment.  I look forward to the relevant initiatives that will be announced in due course.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I was struck by Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s comments.  Regardless of some of the debate&rsquo;s party political spats, we must recognise that we are facing a large schism in society.  The situation is fundamental.  According to Senator O&rsquo;Malley, she was raised at a time when all her generation did was save money to go abroad, a situation she never wants to recur.  While it is now recurring, it is worse in some ways.  Recently, I did a little work to determine to where our unemployed are emigrating.  They have nowhere to go, the implications of which will, in some ways, be worse for society than the previous recession.  This time, members of a well educated workforce will be rightly discontented in the country of their birth without any outlet for the education, enthusiasm and energy they have been brought up to have.  The implications are mind boggling, given that the numbers unemployed will reach 400,000 by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>As well as economic problems, we will face unprecedented social problems unless we somehow get ourselves out of this awful mess.  I have listened to the arguments on all sides.  To which side one belongs determines who one blames.  The Opposition blames the Government and the Government blames the world.  This is politics and it is fair enough.  However, the world and its markets have made a judgment on us in terms of the cost of borrowing money overseas, namely, that the Government&rsquo;s situation is exceptionally more fragile than those of other European countries, apart from Greece, which is above or below us from time to time.</P>
        <P>The judgment of those who have to put their money where their mouths are is that we are in a worse situation than anywhere else and they will not lend us money at any reasonable rate unless we do something about it.  I have not looked at the rate today but as far as I know that has not changed since the Government introduced its package on Tuesday.  The markets continue to watch us with a great deal of scepticism about what we have done.  They may or may not be right; we will have to wait and see.  For some time to come we must face the scepticism of the international markets about our ability to get out of our economic situation.  I take the argument made by many on all sides of the House that were we not in the eurozone we would probably be in a much worse position.  That might not have been the reason for our entering the eurozone but it is a side benefit of monumental proportions in our present situation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was somewhat benign and lacking the sort of alarm we ought to feel.  I distrust the references to social solidarity because they do not mean anything.  He stated: &ldquo;Unless we are prepared to shoulder the burden collectively now, much greater sacrifices may be forced on us at a later date.&rdquo;  I have never heard such a clear warning.  When <Col N="700"/>decoded it means that the International Monetary Fund, IMF, or others will impose this on us.  I do not expect the Minister of State to say that but if he says such sacrifices &ldquo;may be forced upon us&rdquo;, there is little doubt that he means the IMF is at the door.  The only problem is that by the time the IMF gets around to Ireland, it may not have any money left because it has been involved in situations in Ukraine and Iceland and elsewhere which will not leave it with unlimited sums of money to rescue Ireland.  It would be useful if we faced the problems head on.</P>
        <P>I am interested in the mindset that we cut now and introduce taxes later in the year.  People are sceptical of some of the cuts.  It is inevitable that taxes will rise at the end of the year.  We are beginning to get hints that even the sacred cow of corporation tax will be tackled.  I wonder whether it has occurred to the Government to cut corporation tax rather than raise it.  The movement of multinationals such as Dell and others from Galway and elsewhere out of the country has not gathered a great deal of momentum yet, although it is alarming to see big and small ticket names moving.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  We are not in an alarming situation with multinationals but we will desperately need them.  The main reason for their coming to the country, apart from the young educated labour force, is the 12.5% corporation tax.  People who have ideological difficulties with that should not because the multinationals have produced employment on a scale that we could not have dreamt and the spin-off prosperity has been enormous.  They are leaving because of the high cost of labour and because the eastern bloc countries they visit have cut corporation tax to a level below ours.  There is no reason for us not to experiment by reducing corporation tax to 10% or 9%.  There would be a loss to the Exchequer in terms of forensic accounting but there might well be a long-term gain from attracting more multinational industry into the country.</P>
        <P>The good times began when Charlie McCreevy, the former Minister for Finance, slashed capital gains tax by 50% from 40% to 20%.  That produced a great deal more revenue and activity.  It was a double gain.  We can learn from that.  If we cannot do it by ourselves, attracting more industry from overseas will help employment and possibly the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan raised the alarming prospect that the figures are wrong.  He may be right.  I studied them this morning too.   There is some window-dressing in these figures for cuts and the Government has not cut &euro;2 billion.  The figure may be lower and it may have to come back for more when the Department of Finance examines its figures again.  There is good reason to worry about that.  The Government should accelerate the cuts process.  I do not know why we have to wait for &ldquo;an bord snip&rdquo;.  If it has any recommendations, let us deal with them and make the cuts now.</P>
        <P>There are serious questions to be asked about the semi-State bodies and State agencies.  F&Aacute;S is only one with &euro;1 billion.  There are interesting questions to be asked about the budget of Enterprise Ireland.  It is all very well for semi-State agencies to tell us they have done a wonderful job taking a few guys out to Japan and the Middle East, announcing they have got &euro;140 <Col N="701"/>million worth of orders in Japan and therefore Enterprise Ireland is a good thing.  That does not follow.  Let us examine what it costs because if we compare the operational costs for Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Authority, Enterprise Ireland is inexplicably in the stratosphere.  There are quangos galore that could be cut.  An industry grew up around the sacred cow of social partnership in which there are people on boards that need not exist.  The State is looking after them.  We could begin to attack that mindset.  I wish I had more time to speak.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, to the House.  I will not get involved in a debate about who is to blame for all this.  We are where we are and we need to find a solution to the problem.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s action, standing alone and unchanged, is unacceptable.  I received a telephone call yesterday from a nurse who is married to a teacher.  She told me their salaries, which are not important because we can work those out.  They are both being hit for the 1% levy and the pension levy which is fair enough.  Her husband, however, is one of two siblings.  His mother, who receives a small pension, is in a nursing home for which he and his sister must each pay &euro;700 a month.  The Government has now decided that from next January, that will only attract a 20% tax rebate whereas it was 40% previously.  That is appalling.  It means that the young couple are more than &euro;1,000 worse off per month in net terms.  That couple are struggling now.</P>
        <P>I received a letter this morning from another person.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is my belief that we must all make sacrifices to pull the country out of this difficult time, but we need to target it as well ... I also feel that the way in which the levy has been calculated is most unfair, and that somebody on a salary seven times more than myself will pay only 1.9% extra...We are just a young couple trying to get by, like so many of our colleagues.  We have never enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle.  For example, when we finally made it onto the property ladder, we could only afford a place 35 miles away from work.  This is far from ideal, when we both have to drive because of our jobs.  My husband and I were already wondering how we would ever be able to afford to start a family, but now the whole thing seems impossible.  This really does not seem right in a country whose Constitution promises to protect the family.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As politicians, we are used to getting people on the other end of the phone, spraying abuse in all directions.  However, the people getting on to me recently have been on the verge of tears.  A nurse told me that she was working with a consultant who is earning somewhere between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 per year.  She and her husband are being asked to pay about 10% of their salaries, but he is only being asked to pay 2% more on the levy.  There is something wrong with that.  There surely must be a point above a figure of &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 where people in the public and private sectors pay more.</P>
        <P>A person rang me who has a menial job in the public sector.  He is earning &euro;25,000 per year.  He has been hit for all these pension contributions.  He told me that if he was paying his ordinary stamp in the private sector, he would get a pension of &euro;250 per week, which equates to &euro;12,000 per year and which is exactly what he would get in the public sector under the so-called defined benefit pension.  Where is the equity in that?  Surely these are anomalies.</P>
        <P>When everything was supposed to be bad last year, Irish developers put &euro;1.8 billion into the Cape Verde islands &mdash; the same amount the Government is looking for at the moment &mdash; yet <Col N="702"/>these developers are not being asked to contribute.  Let us get fairness and equity into this.  It is fine to hit people like me and everyone in this House.  However, the people below us should not be included.  There is so much we need to do to get this right.</P>
        <P>Prices have dropped in the past six months in places where there seemed to be no change in wages or whatever.  Prices dropped by 20%, 30% and even 50%.  How did those businesses manage to do that and still stay profitable?  The answer is that they were greedy and making profits for the last few years.  Ministers had been saying that, but no one is saying that we should go back to those people and make them contribute.  They caused much of the inflation and many of the problems.  They should surely be included.  If this is going to be a national initiative, then we must ensure the public sector makes its contribution, but workers from the public sector should not be picking up the tab on their own for what has gone wrong in the economy.</P>
        <P>Benchmarking cost the State &euro;900 million, and we are still talking about it.  We now intend to take twice that amount out of the public sector, following the announcement yesterday, and we will take twice that again next year and the year after.  We need to bring a bit of scale to what we are doing here.  We have much work to do to get balance into things.  What we have seen in Greece, Iceland, and France is beginning here with the Waterford Glass workers and the students.  People are going to feel completely disengaged and disconnected.  We need to make sure this is shared by everyone.  Let us forget about whose fault this is.  Let us claw our way out of it.  We must move forward together as a country with everyone involved and paying their share while recognising that some people cannot do so.</P>
        <P>The Waterford Glass workers surely should have their pension protected.  I do not mind paying into a fund that would do that.</P>

	<P>Some people dipped into their pension, and they should be jailed.  In the meantime, I want to tell those workers that this is what the State is for.  If I have to pay extra to do that, I will be happy to do so.  If people in the public or private sector are in danger of losing their houses because they cannot meet their mortgage repayments and if we are prepared to insure banks, then we should also be able to insure ordinary people, and in a sensible way that does not pick up the slack for people who have never paid their mortgages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing time with me.  I echo his words about the need for equity, about the problem with the burden of blame being heaped on the public sector and the unfair scapegoating of public service workers.  In the public service, we all accept the need to pay our share.  I support the principle of the pension levy, but I disagree with the inequitable way in which it is being imposed on the lowest paid.  As the Government accepted with the 1% levy, there should be a level below which there is no pension levy.  Those of us at the higher end should pay a higher percentage, but I do not think that people on &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 should be paying 3% or more as a pension levy.  That is an unfair and inequitable way of targeting lower paid public service workers.</P>
        <P>I express solidarity with those in the private sector who have borne the brunt of the recession, especially the Waterford Glass workers.  As the granddaughter of the founder of Waterford Glass in the 1940s, Karel Bacik, I would like to say how deeply regretful I am to see what is happening at the company.  I echo Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s words that we need to ensure at the very least the Waterford Glass pensioners are guaranteed their pensions.  That is vital.</P><Col N="703"/>
        <P>At a time when we are bailing out bankers with multiple billions of euro, it seems unfair that those in receipt of the largest sums of money &mdash; developers, bankers and people who are not earning incomes, but dividends on property &mdash; are not being asked to pay their share in the same way that we in the public service are asked to do so.  I ask the Minister to look at the equity of the Government&rsquo;s scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard of the unpalatable choices that have had to be made in the past week.  There seems to be an expectation, fostered by many on the Opposition side, that everything that can be done should be done now.  I am not sure whether that is an acceptable economic strategy to be following.  We are dealing with an immediate situation where cuts of &euro;2 billion are required owing to the shortfall in tax receipts in November and December.  That has caused us to make decisions on public expenditure that were agreed only last October.  The biggest element of public expenditure agreed in last October&rsquo;s budget relates to public sector pay.  It comes to around 35% of all public expenditure in any given year.</P>
        <P>The options are either to reduce the number of people working in the public sector, to pay them less, or to look at how additional costs are achieved, particularly regarding pension entitlements.  These entitlements in the public sector are better than those that exist in the private sector.  With the imposition of this new levy, they are still nowhere near the economic cost of providing such pensions.  When we face that reality, we have a further job to do about the sustainability of pensions across our society.  We provide far more in relief for private pensions than we pay into the State pension every year.  Now we have a third element on how we treat public sector pensions.</P>
      
        <P>The reality is that there are distinct differences between public sector pensions and pensions that are available to people in the private sector.  Many of the pay-related pension increases that apply in the public sector do not apply in the private sector.  We have to accept that it is not sustainable that some former senior civil servants, including former Secretaries General, are now earning more in their pensions than they were paid to work as civil servants in this State.  We cannot afford that on an ongoing basis.  As a society, we need to think about what we can afford and how we can afford it.</P>
        <P>The reality of what needs to be done about other issues is that at the end of this year, we will have to decide how to save a further &euro;4 billion.  At the end of 2010, we will have to decide how to save another &euro;4 billion.  At the end of 2011, we will have to decide how to save a further &euro;3.5 billion.  The measures we take to that end will not even balance our books.  According to our projections, all they will do is bring us back in line with the 3% expenditure rule set out in the Maastricht criteria.  This country will still be spending more than it can afford.  These drastic circumstances require difficult decisions to be taken.  Action is needed in response to what is happening.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I accept that the public outcry that has resulted from the unpopular decisions that were announced earlier this week is partly based on the desire to see certain actions taken concurrently.  People&rsquo;s anger in respect of the financial services sector is justifiable.  They want action to be taken in relation to remuneration.  They want criminal action to be taken against those who have brought our economy to its current position.  Regardless of the amount of money it will save the State, there is a responsibility on the political sector to play a particular role in saving money.  A symbolic gesture would be appreciated by the wider public.  I do not get a sense from Senators in this Chamber, or from people in wider politics in general who have contributed to this debate before now, that they are prepared to take such a jump.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The political representatives of the people need to consider how costs in the political system can be reduced to an extent that is equal to or greater than that being experienced by those <Col N="704"/>outside that system.  I refer to people who will now have to make added contributions and to the 40,000 people who have joined the dole queue over the last month.  If public representatives do not take action in his respect, we will be doing a disservice to our roles.  We should send out a clear signal that we accept the need to address issues like the payment of additional expenses and the receipt of pensions by people who are still in public office.  If political parties and politicians are collectively not prepared to accept that need, regardless of who is in government, they will not receive the respect or acceptance of the public.  In such circumstances, the public will not buy in to what it is being asked to accept in this package and in future packages.  It will be possible to prevent that if the measures that are needed are announced and implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>We have already provided for the recoupment of &euro;1 billion in 2010 &mdash; money that would otherwise have been spent &mdash; by imposing a pay freeze rather than the national wage agreement.  We intend to consider the proposals included in the report of the Commission on Taxation.  I expect that any new taxes will be aimed at those in our society who have most, but are contributing least.  That is the essence of one of the issues of public concern.  If those of us who are part of the political system want to retain any sense of respect, we need to be prepared to take the type of decisive action that is needed.  It is a simple equation.  If we are not prepared to countenance a tiny reduction in overall public expenditure &mdash; I suggest that &euro;20 million can be saved from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission&rsquo;s annual budget of &euro;100 million &mdash; we have no right to talk about the additional measures that are affecting the wider public.</P>
        <P>We have to do things in a better, more efficient and more honest way.  I have not yet seen a willingness on the part of politicians, across all political parties, to change the way we behave within our political system.  We need to send out the right signals by showing a degree of empathy and by making changes &mdash; in the Oireachtas, in the first instance, and subsequently in the rest of society &mdash; that will give us a better society and a more sustainable economy.  Until that happens, debates of this nature carry very little worth, to be frank.  I hope this House can send a message to the effect that the Government&rsquo;s consideration of these issues will result in adequate decisions being made at an early date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The proposals that are the subject of this debate are welcome only in so far as they mark the end of the period of prevarication, indecision and rudderless leadership.  We have had no Government, in effect, for the last eight months.  We have lost some of the international credibility we had built up.  These measures are welcome only in so far as they represent the end of that horrific period.  However, I do not welcome the unfair effect these proposals will have on the lower-paid sector of the public service.  There is no escaping that reality.  It is unreasonable to expect young people who are burdened with mortgages, child care bills and travel expenses to make this contribution to pensions, in addition to the 1% income levy.  Public servants at the lower end of the wage scale already have little disposable income.  While it is acceptable at a certain level, it is unreasonable in many cases at the lower-paid end.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, this problem is exacerbated by the fact that bonuses are being paid willy-nilly throughout the State.  Bankers and media stars in RTE are being paid enormous salaries.  Public servants are justifiably angry about this series of injustices, irregularities and unacceptable practices.  We are putting the cart before the horse in this instance.  What about tax exiles?  What about the plethora of waste at Government level?  Over the last 11 years, the Government <Col N="705"/>threw money around like confetti on projects like PPARS, electronic voting and the Red Cow roundabout.  Nothing has been done, in effect, to halt such practices.  I have already referred to tax exiles.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his opening speech, the Minister of State spoke about the need to cut expenses and other bills.  What about consultancy contracts?  What about public relations expenses?  What about the plethora of advisers in the offices of Ministers and Ministers of State, which is costing the State a fortune?  It is the greatest national scandal confronting us at the moment, particularly as this country has a native Civil Service of a high calibre with high entry requirements.  It is an abomination and a nonsense of the worst kind that a Minister of State&rsquo;s office is staffed by a plethora of non-civil servants when we have a brilliant native Civil Service.  I am concerned about that kind of wastage.  What about the quangos?  I am concerned about the young civil servants who are following this debate.  It does not matter whether they are in single or double-income households.  Nothing is being done about all the other anomalies and forms of wastage.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle made reference to the Government&rsquo;s aspirations, but we have put the cart before the horse.  We need to get the public to engage with, accept and understand what we are doing.  In the context of this debate, we should be talking about introducing a real programme of job creation.  I welcome the announcement of a scheme of insulation grants, but they need to come on stream immediately.  A radical school building programme is needed to reduce the cost of prefabricated buildings in schools throughout this country.  We need to consider the money that would come back into the economy if the cost of paying social welfare to construction workers could be reduced.  It is bizarre that we are not building schools across this country.  There is a huge deficit in the quality of our school buildings.  No radical effort is being made to train people.  Some months ago, I proposed in this House on many occasions that the introduction of a F&Aacute;S scheme was seriously needed to retrain people who had half-completed their apprenticeships when they lost their jobs when building firms folded.</P>
        <P>What about energy costs?  There is no case for increased prices.  The increase given to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB last year was predicated on the then price of oil, which was &euro;1.46 a gallon.  Oil is a fraction of that price now.  Why has the Government not reduced energy costs?  It has been aspirational in talking about it.  Everything that has been talked about has been aspirational with this Government, but why was that not done?  Why was the regulator not called in?  Why has action not been taken?  Action should have been taken on this months ago.  When oil prices fell, ESB and gas prices should also have fallen.  All the wastages in the economy could have been eliminated months ago.  This is why the people are cynical and bitter.  This is why a Waterford Crystal worker who will lose his or her pension is angry.</P>
        <P>Why has the Government not engaged properly with the banks to date on the credit business and on putting money into the economy?  Why is the European money that can be drawn down for reconstruction not being used?  There are so many whys that people are angry, and justifiably so, and it is time for coherent action.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for his kindness in sharing his time with me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to be helpful here today.  All around us companies are falling and unemployment is increasing,  I heard Senator Harris say this morning that he was fearful that the number unemployed could rise to 700,000 by the end of the year.  I heard on the news last night that Celestica in Galway, a contract manufacturing company that makes inkjet cartridges, is seeking 80 voluntary redundancies.  I wrote to that company this morning and it has responded to me to the effect that it can be helped.  It is important to share this information with the House.  I asked the company if there was any action or initiative the Government could take now that would enable it to retain the 80 jobs at risk?  I asked if it would reconsider its position if a change was <Col N="706"/>made, for example, in the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI, and if a subvention grant per person per year for less than the amount of his or her social welfare payment, for example, &euro;5,000 per person, would enable the company to keep these people employed?  The answer I got was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The costs that are killing the company are utility costs, including ESB costs.  Since September 2008, the company&rsquo;s ESB bill has increased by &euro;500,000, a 34% increase.  Furthermore, it is tied into that contract for 12 months.  It needs the Government to get it out of that contract immediately if it is to save those 80 jobs.  This is good news.  If we know that ESB costs is the cause of the potential loss of these jobs, we can do something today.  We must reduce this cost base, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said.  The person in the company went on to say that we should ask all companies by how much their ESB bills increased since last autumn.  We should ask Intel and Dell that question.  This is something we can control because the regulator has not acted.</P>
        <P>The second cost, about which we all know, is the cost of labour.  The person in the company gave me some interesting information.  He said he is out there bidding for work.  Even though we are in a world recession, there is still work for which to bid.  Anything that will help him with the bidding will make a difference.  He said, if the company can say with clarity that the Government will keep costs down over the next five years, the company will be more competitive.</P>

In eastern Europe, inflationary rates are increasing all the time but, if we could bridge that gap and if we can stand still in terms of costs, we will be more competitive.  We need to stop the inflationary bandwagon we have been on for the past ten years.</P>
        <P>I have made these points to be helpful to the Government.  I have given the Minister of State two important items of information.  I will tender the letter I issued to Celestica this morning, to which it has given a positive response.  It said it needs help and it will take our help,  but the Government must control the costs.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are three questions we must ask ourselves.  How bad is this recession, whose fault &mdash; if anyone&rsquo;s &mdash; is it and what should be done?  Judging by what I saw on television yesterday &mdash; I was in hospital and had a chance to watch television &mdash; and as viewed through the eyes of the general people, I have no evidence thus far that colleagues in the Upper or Lower House grasp the seriousness of this recession. It is global, deep and there is no end in sight.  It will get worse before it gets better.  I heard the top Bloomberg analyst say the other day say it has a double peak.  Behind the bad news of the first peak or when we have climbed the first peak, we will see another bad news peak behind it.</P>
        <P>I understand why the Taoiseach, who has a good and clear grasp of the situation, would not want to play up public fears, but I do not agree with that approach.  We are faced with a global recession and a national emergency, given that, I believe, unemployment will hit 700,000 or perhaps higher and personal debt is astronomical.  The Government is close to a situation where Irish bonds will not be trusted and it will not be able to borrow.  I do not know to where the Government can turn, except to those parts of society which are able to bear the burden.  In a <Col N="707"/>situation such as this, there is a growth of fear, anger and denial.  That is what is currently prevailing.  There is so much fear that people are not thinking straight.</P>
        <P>First, there is all this loose talk of fat cats.  Every wealthy person in Ireland, Tony O&rsquo;Reilly, the Smurfits, whoever you want to name, has seen their wealth cut by between 50% and 60%.  Therefore, they certainly are bearing the brunt of the recession. Second, the professional classes could do with bearing some of the brunt of the burden and a start was made by the Government, but they will have to bear more of it.  For example in the case of doctors, the State has cut their fees, but they and other professional classes should be forced to cut their fees, professional classes in their private capacity.</P>
        <P>Then there are the bankers.  Again, I am struck by the way the climate of fear prevents people from  thinking clearly.  In terms of the media, RTE in particular is at fault in this because it, being a public sector institution, is anxious to spin away from scrutiny of its own wage rates for presenters and higher paid staff.  RTE is anxious to work up hysteria about banks and so on.  The fact of life is that the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks are solvent institutions.  The problem is they need to write off some of their property portfolios to close the market gap.  The market does not believe they are valued at &euro;8 billion, it believes they are valued at &euro;3 billion less than that.  It believes the true value of each of the banks is probably closer to &euro;5 billion.  It would be welcome if the Government talked to the banks and got them to write down their real assets in terms of what the market believes them to be, which is approximately &euro;5 billion.  We could then have an honest start.</P>
        <P>On the banking issue, some people in Anglo Irish Bank behaved badly.  I am all for handcuffs and the Criminal Assets Bureau being brought in to deal with bankers who commit criminal offences, but just because one smallish bank behaved badly is no reason to create an air of panic and hysteria that all the banks are facing meltdown.  The assets of both of the larger banks are quite solid and they should seriously consider amalgamation to become a kind of Ryanair bank in Europe.  They are both too small to be European players.  They should amalgamate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Beyond that, the only brunt that can be borne is by those of us in permanent and pensionable employment.  That is the class that must be targeted.  I was struck with disbelief when I listened to speeches on the public sector from Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others.  I cannot understand, when workers in Dell and Waterford Crystal are losing their jobs, people in permanent and pensionable employment have so little grasp of reality.  I will spell it out for them.</P>
        <P>For every &euro;100 earned by a private sector worker, a public sector worker gets a premium of 20%.  On top of that, they are being paid between 15% and 30% &mdash; the economists disagree &mdash; on a premium of their pension.  In other words, in addition to the 20% they get a further 30% in value from their pension.  In other words, for every &euro;100 earned by private sector workers, public sector workers earn &euro;150.  They produce 30% less in terms of productivity.  They are off sick more often and they are the greatest crowd of self-appointed victims I have ever come across.  They are not victims in this society.  They are the fat cats of society but they do not like to accept that.</P>
        <P>Any of us who are asked to look at our incomes will come up with reasons we cannot pay.  Ryan Tubridy, the RTE broadcaster, said he could not pay up because of personal reasons.  None of us wants to pay up but we will have to do so.</P>

        <P>The truth is the Taoiseach was correct to cut into the public sector.  His one mistake was that he did not cut more deeply.  He will have to do so in the future.  I predict that the shortfall in Exchequer revenues will be in the order of &euro;25 billion rather than &euro;18 billion.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, on providing us with a lucid and well-written document which sets out clearly the state of the public finances.  I disagree with some of its content but I commend him on its clarity.</P>
        <P>The recession is a grim reaper that is throwing a searchlight into every corner and crevice of society.  It has revealed the weaknesses in the banks.  It has revealed the cushioned nature of the public sector.  It has revealed the profiteering of the professional classes.  One calls to mind the Mahon tribunal in this regard.  Above all, the recession has revealed a society in denial.  Almost every taxi driver, small builder and tradesman seems to have purchased a second house either at home or abroad.  It is a lie to pretend the entire middle and working classes did not benefit from the Celtic tiger.  The evidence remains physically around us.  It is ridiculous for us to seek a few scapegoats in the form of politicians and others.  We in the public sector must make a start in bearing the brunt of the pain.  I agree totally with Senator Boyle in this regard.  We should offer the public something between 25% and 30% of our salary and expenses before the public takes it from us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I listened to part of what the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, had to say and I read the document he provided.  Like Senator Harris, I agree with much of its content.  The Government now wishes to take resolute action.  Unfortunately, it has not been resolute all the way through.  There has been a certain amount of fumbling.  In a situation where what is needed internationally is confidence, that is very dangerous.  It is worse than causing fear and worse than facing the situation we are in.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, in a manner uncharacteristic of Ministers in general, has described the economic situation as &ldquo;stark&rdquo;.  That is unusually uncompromising language.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that we recognise the reality of the current crisis and that there is an international aspect to it.  The State is obliged to repay borrowings from the European Central Bank at a rate 2.5 percentage points higher than that paid by Germany.  This is nothing other than a confidence issue.  For that reason, there must be firm, clear and concerted action supported by all members of society.</P>
        <P>However, there are aspects that are divisive.  We are not unique in this.  The President of the United States, Mr. Obama, recently had to reprimand Wall Street companies in the strongest terms because in the middle of this crisis, with financial institutions on the slide, chief executive officers had taken a total of &euro;18.8 billion in bonuses.  These people have no shame.</P>
        <P>Greed, vulgarity and selfishness are not unique to the economic ruling classes of this country.  It is a general situation and so too are the financial difficulties.  They represent a systemic failure of 21st century capitalism, a reality which must eventually be tackled.  We must deal with the immediate crisis but, as I have said before, we must also examine the basic issue of money and the way in which our entire financial system has lost touch with the reality that money is supposed to represent.  The notion of the worker worthy of his or her hire has gone entirely astray.  However, I will not go into that theoretical issue today.</P>
        <P>The situation gets worse even as we sit in this Chamber.  Before coming into the House, I listened to the news headlines announcing that Drummonds, the large grain company, is in trouble.  Sony Ericsson management has just called in its workers for discussions.  We know what that means.  The Bank of England has reduced its interest rate to an historic low of 1%.  In the 300 years in which the bank has been in operation, the rate has never been so low.  The <Col N="709"/>British Government expects as many as 3 million to be unemployed by the end of the year.  We will be lucky to get away with a figure of 400,000.</P>
        <P>A difficulty for this State relates to the balance between the public and private sectors.  The money to pay the public sector comes from the private sector.  If there is a substantial collapse in private sector employment, how will the Government find the money to pay the public sector?  This is an issue we must tackle.  I agree with Senator Harris that we all must take a lead.  I hoped yesterday to raise the issue of the pay rise for ESB workers but there was not time to do so.  However, several of my colleagues raised it this morning on the Order of Business.  I congratulate the Leader on the commitment he has given to use his influence to seek a reduction in ESB rates.  Those rates are one of the factors that make this State completely uncompetitive.  It is indecent for ESB workers, who have an advantageous pension system comparable even to that of Oireachtas Members &mdash; and God knows we are well fortified &mdash; to take a 3.5% pay rise.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I appeal to ESB workers to show the solidarity that is needed.  When people are being thrown out of work, it is unfair for those workers to accept an increase.</P>
        <P>The pension levy must be imposed in a fair way.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made an interesting case in this regard.  I heard an interview on the radio yesterday with a civil servant who is separated from her spouse and is under pressure to provide for her children on one income.  She consulted the money advice and budgeting service for assistance which mapped out a budget plan for her.  Not a single cent of that budget is allocated for luxuries or entertainment.  The entire budget goes towards servicing debts and purchasing food.  How can she be expected to pay a 7% levy?  There must be some degree of flexibility.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Bacik, whose grandfather was one of the founders of Waterford Crystal, spoke about the situation at that company earlier.  One is struck by the difference in the position of workers at Waterford Crystal and those at Waterford Wedgewood.  The former are likely to be put out of work and their pensions are not protected.  In Waterford Wedgewood, because of legislative action by the British Government, workers&rsquo; pensions are protected by a pension protection fund.  That option must be considered in the case of the Waterford Crystal workers.  What are the workers to do if they lose their jobs and their pension funds either have been raided or have collapsed because they were invested in bank shares that are now worthless?  How will they make a living?  They will represent a cost to the Exchequer one way or the other, so we should examine the possibility of some type of pension fund.</P>
        <P>Members received an e-mail in recent days from a married couple, both of whom are civil servants.  They write that those on a salary of &euro;55,000, as each of them are, will pay a levy of 7.7%, but those earning almost five and a half times more will pay only an additional 1.9%.  In other words, the wealthy will get away again.  They go on to say that it is always middle income earners who suffer most and this is the case once again.  They find the levy difficult to accept because the value of the public sector pension has already been taken into account in the benchmarking process.  Therefore, they have already been awarded a lower salary than comparable employees in the private sector.  For that reason, they welcome the scrapping of the increases provided for under the review and transitional agreement.  That is quite right.  I support that completely and will support the Government in any coherent measure it takes which directly affects the better off, such as me, to support people who are in considerable difficulties.</P>
        <P>We have taken certain measures.  Much has been done already.  With regard to the schools programme, very large numbers of schools await redevelopment, new premises, etc.  In some circumstances schools are renting portacabins.  The rent on these is less than they would pay <Col N="710"/>on a mortgage to build new classrooms.  Let us do that.  That would save money, provide work and decent classrooms for our children.</P>
        <P>With great respect to Senator Harris, there has not been a co-ordinated response.  I protested on the Order of Business when the Government increased VAT by 2.5%.  On the same day, the British dropped the rate by 2.5% in Northern Ireland.  Again that very day, the Government put extra rates on Dublin city centre businesses.  That is not a co-ordinated response.  We are contributing &euro;580 million to the Northern Ireland economy, as a political gesture.  The rate of unemployment there is only 2%.  Ours is 7.5%.  Why are we helping that economy?  Perhaps we should look again at that situation.</P>
        <P>We could reduce VAT on food to zero, certainly for fresh produce.  We could have an across the board rate of VAT at 16%.  We could halve this rate for Irish goods and load tax on imports of such materials.  The Government could get rid of five Ministers.  There are 15 Departments and 22 junior Ministers.   Why does one Department need two Ministers?  There could be a saving there.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I hope I will not have a negative tone.  I will do my best to make a contribution on the basis that there must and should be solutions to all the problems we face, and I am sure there are.  The Minister has taken very prompt, swift and effective action in the banking situation.  Last October we brought in legislation to deal with the banks.  By and large, the banking system has been stabilised and our banking situation has improved.  We took prompt action on nationalising Anglo Irish Bank.  It was vitally important that this be done swiftly.</P>
        <P>Some speakers here this morning said there was inaction in these situations; there was not.  The actions were precise and well-measured.  With the banking problem we have had throughout the world, countries have put huge amounts of money into banks and it did not stabilise the situation.  Britain was tired of pouring money in on a weekly basis and found it had to nationalise the banks in the end.  We have been dealing with the banking situation since October.  The pork crisis was dealt with very swiftly and we showed the rest of the world our food product is top of the range.</P>
        <P>I have heard people talking about &ldquo;propping up&rdquo; the banks.  We cannot have a stable economy without having a solid banking system.  I have heard people say we are keeping the &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; in there.  We need a proper inquiry into all banking situations and new regulations should be put in place.  That should be part of any condition of recapitalising the banks.  We have not yet spent any taxpayers&rsquo; money on support for the banks.  The guarantee scheme supports depositors in the banking system.  It is important that when we recapitalise the banks, which we will, we have a guaranteed share in the banks and that the banks pay a dividend to the pensions scheme.  That is vitally important.  I do not want people to say we have put money <Col N="711"/>into the banking system.  We are lending money to the banking system.  They are paying us for it.  The guarantee scheme also carries a charge in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is important we turn to how we will regenerate jobs in the economy.  It is vital to ensure we have proper training schemes for those who are losing their jobs.  Our support for the smart economy scheme, which we brought out before Christmas, will ensure we have a focused look at how we will rejuvenate the economy.  I welcome the recent cuts and savings in the public sector.  We had to do that.  It was very important to send the message to the global markets that we are taking action to put our public finances in order.  That was a first step.  We all know we have a lot further to go and there will be pain involved.  There is no use in saying there will not be pain for you, me and everybody in this House or in the public service.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The public sector gives a great service.  The people who work there are fine people and they do a good job.  We are asking them now to help us out in a time of crisis.  It is important that the people in the private sector who are suffering see that we are doing that and that everyone is playing his or her part.  In the private sector, 25% of wages go on pensions which are not guaranteed.  We have seen people who were working in Waterford Crystal for 40 years and now find themselves with no pension.  That is the reality in the private sector.  They are not guaranteed jobs or a pension.  Therefore, we have to take a certain responsibility in ensuring the country survives this terrible recession.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The lower sector of the construction industry, which is involved in retrofitting, insulation and alternative energy, is important for the creation of new jobs in the future.  More than 20,000 jobs are involved.  I have done some calculations in this area, as the Minister of State knows, which we have put through the parliamentary party.  A cost of &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 would bring a house up to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; energy rating.  This would save the householder 50% on energy costs, which is a major saving.  It is important we get this scheme up and running soon because it will create many jobs.  To give an example, for every &euro;25 million the Government puts into the scheme, &euro;100 million will be spent in the economy and there will be a benefit of &euro;52 million to the Exchequer.  This is in small industries.  We could create 20,000 jobs in that sector.  In 2008, the turnover in the renovation, retrofit and extension sector was &euro;7.7 billion.  That could be increased.  We must also bear in mind that a million houses in this country will have to be brought up to standard.  We will be penalised in Europe if we do not do so, and this will cost us hundreds of millions.  We might as well start there and create jobs.  This is terribly important.  We are somewhere on the way to doing it, but I would like to see urgency in this scheme.</P>
        <P>The Minister has announced the school renovation, insulation and solar energy plan, for which there is a major need.  We can have running hot water within our schools for nothing using solar energy systems which can be established at a small cost.  This is a wise way to go.  I suggest we expedite this.  Many people are going on the live register.  We must consider PRSI and we must consider all options open to us by which we can create jobs.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey mentioned that he did not have any plan and he hoped we would not be expecting him to come up with a plan.  That is a poor response when we have a full-day debate in the Chamber.  I want the Opposition and everyone in this House to come together with solutions that are workable and credible.  I commend the Minister of State on his speech in which he clearly outlined how things have to be for the future.  That is the way forward.  We should tell the people up front what we are doing, and then we can get the results.</P>

As previous speakers have said, I agree with much of what is contained therein, although there are a couple of points I will make about the Government&rsquo;s announcement earlier this week.  I do not want to be discordant at the start but I must comment on the remarks with which Senator Butler concluded.  I did not hear what Senator Twomey said this morning but I know that Fine Gael has put out many ideas <Col N="712"/>and plans for reforming public expenditure, including changes we deemed suitable and appropriate in terms of the public finances.  There has certainly been no lack of opinions or plans from the Opposition.  From the Government side, until very recently, we had met a stonewall response.  There was very much an attitude that it was going to do things its own way, as expressed in the words of the Taoiseach in the other House about ten days ago.  That attitude has changed slightly, and I welcome the fact that there seems to be more willingness to listen to what those on other sides of the House have to say on these issues.</P>
        <P>The announcements earlier in the week by the Taoiseach were a step in the right direction.  I would have announced things differently had I been in his position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the provisions for the pension levy are worthy of comment.  People on lower incomes in the public sector are being treated a little unfairly.  I was talking to a nurse yesterday who is to lose almost &euro;2,000 from her income because of the Government&rsquo;s measures.  I would not consider somebody on &euro;32,000 or &euro;33,000 to be a very high-earning public servant.  If I were in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position, I would have tilted the levy a bit more towards those who are earning more in the public sector.  However, I do believe something had to be done and I support the taking of action.  The only criticism is that it should have been done sooner.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators Harris, Norris and others who have spoken about the need to reform the way we operate in this and the other House, especially with regard to the costs of Government.  There is a need to lead by example.  I acknowledge that the Government members have taken a voluntary cut in their incomes.  I support that and it is to be commended.  However, we need to consider the number of Ministers of State, and the biggest disgrace is the staff attached to the offices of the Ministers of State.  I am not casting any aspersions on the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and I do not know how many people he has working in his office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are some Ministers of State who have nine or ten people working in their offices.  That is not acceptable.  It has spiralled out of control in recent years and we need to get back to some semblance of reality.  People expect this to happen and the Government should lead by example in this regard.  The number of Ministers of State should be reduced significantly, as should the number of Oireachtas committees.  There are around 20 Oireachtas committees and there is ample scope to cut back.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris made an interesting point about the possibility of public works and a schools initiative, with which I largely concur.  He also raised the difficulty that has emerged of unfinished housing estates in towns and villages throughout the country.  Building work has not been completed on many of the houses and many of the estates have been left unfinished for a long period of time.  I am puzzled that the Government appears to be cutting back significantly on spending on social and affordable housing for local authorities at a time when there will be more people on housing lists.  There are already approximately 56,000 people on the lists.  There is obviously a glut in the housing market and, while I do not know the ins and outs of the market, I am sure something useful along the lines of what Senator Norris suggested should be examined.</P><Col N="713"/>
        <P>The problems we face in the public finances are a symptom of what has happened in the Irish economy in the past couple of years.  They are due primarily to our lack of competitiveness.  Our competitive position has deteriorated significantly.  Senators Norris and Harris were correct to point out that, in effect, the private sector pays for the public sector.  If we are haemorrhaging jobs at a huge rate in the private sector, as is occurring now, there obviously will be a shortfall in income for the Government to support the public sector.  We need to get back to basics, to quote the phrase used across the water, in terms of competitiveness in the Irish economy.  The Government has a key role in that regard.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of speeches recently by Government speakers in this House and elsewhere about the energy crisis.  A significant job must be done to reduce the costs of energy.  There is also the issue of Government charges, while VAT was mentioned earlier in the debate by previous speakers.  There are also problems with wages.  I do not have a difficulty with the minimum wage but the arrangement whereby a particularly high rate is paid for weekend work is causing huge difficulties for small businesses, particularly in the service sector.  This matter should be examined as well.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler referred to Waterford Crystal.  I am familiar with the industry as I live only ten miles from Waterford city.  I know many people who have worked there over the years.  It is disgraceful that one of the workers, who spoke to Senator Cummins this week and has worked for Waterford Crystal for 44 years, has discovered he does not have a pension.  There is something very wrong with that.  Interestingly, Senator Norris referred to the British pension insurance scheme.  There should be something similar in this country.  It will not provide any comfort for the workers in Waterford Crystal but it should be put in place for the future.  I fear that the black hole in the pension provisions in Waterford Crystal will be replicated in other businesses across the country.  We should not allow people who have spent their lives working in those businesses to be thrown on the scrap heap when they leave.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this discussion.  There is a greater sense that the Government side is listening to what the Opposition has to say and is taking on board some of the more constructive arguments being made by all sides.  I welcome that.  Like Senator Harris, however, I believe the full realisation might not have dawned on the general public of the country&rsquo;s grave situation, given the numbers on the live register announced yesterday and the figures announced earlier this week for the reduction in tax income in the month of January.  The country is in a stark grave position.  The announcement this week is a small step in the right direction but I believe we will have to go further.</P>

	<P>He was, indeed.  However, he is much busier now.  I listened with interest to the debate and was delighted with the contributions from all sides of the House.  Some very constructive points were made in some of the presentations.</P>
        <P>I commend the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Cabinet on what they have done.  It was a courageous step but there was no other choice.  Nothing else was on offer.  It had to be done, and done immediately.  I was delighted to hear, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday, two of the country&rsquo;s leading economists say it was courageous of the Taoiseach and the Minister, that it was the right move and that it is the first step in a long journey.  We must regain our competitiveness.  This is the first step towards improving the country&rsquo;s economic situation; it is a first step towards recovery.</P>
        <P>The &euro;900 million reduction in tax yield in January is unprecedented.  We have never seen such figures.  Undoubtedly, the situation is gloomy but we cannot become despondent.  If we <Col N="714"/>do, we will be unable to do anything.  We will be unable to borrow and what will we be faced with then?  I hate to think of it and will not even say it.  Words have a way of sneaking out of places such as this, they are jigged around and are put across another way.  It is unsustainable to think we can borrow &euro;18 billion to run the country.  We cannot do that.  Pay increases will not be paid in 2010, and rightly so.  I believe everybody wishes to play their part in getting the country back moving again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My main reason for contributing to this debate is to address something quite upsetting, how it has become fashionable in recent days to question the concept of social partnership.  The leader of Fine Gael accused the Government of covering itself in a cloak of social partnership.  He said, &ldquo;The public coffers have been emptied, the developers and the banks are bust, and trade unions have little to offer.&rdquo;  He said it &mdash; I was in the Chamber and heard him &mdash; in a very dismissive tone, which has been echoed in this House and in the public pronouncements from various Fine Gael Deputies and Senators.  I also have been disappointed by the contributions of some of the Labour Party speakers, who seem not to recognise the true value of social partnership or the contribution made by the partnership process to the development of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>I am a trade union member.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach can smile all he wants.  I would prefer if he did not look to his own side of the House and sneer while I am making a presentation.  It is very off-putting.</P>

	<P>The concept that all power, responsibility and wisdom resides in one person or in a government is alien to this republic and has no place in democracy.  All Senators participating in the debate brought forward ideas of how things might work.  On Monday or Tuesday of this week, <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> covered very extensively the current crisis in the motor industry.  Is there any way the Government could consider reducing VRT on cars by perhaps 10% or 20%?  We should also examine stamp duty.  If we cannot reduce it, we could consider not collecting it all at once but spreading it over a number of years in order to help young people buy new homes or help others move up.  It would also help the real estate industry.</P>
        <P>Other speakers referred to VAT.  Could we have a serious attempt to reduce VAT?  Although I am sorry to mention names, on a recent programme I heard Ben Dunne discussing the importance of getting cash back into the economy.  People are afraid to spend money.  There is still money out there; it did not disappear overnight.  We need to get people spending again.  There is an old saying in this country that once the builders and farmers are doing well, the country will always be on the up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>We must get small construction businesses back up and running.  I come from a medium-sized town and I know the small builders who would build a house or an extension &mdash; I will not call them construction people.  They are on their knees.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to ensure that whatever we do when we recapitalise the banks, there is a clause that small and medium-sized businesses will be looked after.  If we do not do this, we are at nothing.</P>
        <P>We must also ensure the excessive salaries of the directors of the two banks we are now ready to recapitalise are brought into question, and that everybody shares the pain that we in the public and private sectors are sharing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the words he used in his speech.  I want to concentrate on three points he made.  He said, &ldquo;We must lower our cost base as rapidly as possible and become the highly competitive economy we once were, rebuilding a platform for future export-led growth.&rdquo;  I entirely agree.  One of the things that disappoints me about today&rsquo;s debate is that we have moved away from this to a large extent.  It really is essential.</P>
        <P>I started in business at the age of 23, way back in the 1960s, and I have seen many enterprises go out of business.  On one occasion, we had a joint venture with another company and we had to close that company although we had taken on 100 people.  It was one of the saddest days of my life when I had to tell those people that while we had encouraged them to join the company, we would have to close it down because it had not succeeded.  They had every right to say, &ldquo;It is not fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;That it is not our fault.&rdquo;  However, the business did not succeed and so it closed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When one takes, as we have this week, the first steps in reducing our costs and certainly the costs of running Government &mdash; they are only the first steps and we must go much further &mdash; people will say, &ldquo;It is not fair.  I did not cause this.  It was those nasty people in the banks or somewhere else.&rdquo;  Business is not about fairness, it is about competitiveness.  If somebody takes business away, one loses that business.  It is not a question of being fair.</P><Col N="716"/>
        <P>We must find a way of reducing costs.  On occasions in my business career, I had to go to our people and tell them that if we were to stay alive and be healthy again, it was time to take tough medicine and to cut costs.  I found that when I managed to show leadership and explain the position, as I think we are attempting to do now &mdash; although we did not do it early enough back in October &mdash; it is possible to get acceptance and recognition.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of fairness but there is a question of equality for everyone involved.  From what I hear of the sounds being made this week with regard to the proposal to cut costs, particularly in regard to the pension commitment, there does not appear to be an understanding that this will be equally applied.  There is a belief that those who are well off are not paying their fair share.  We need to examine that issue.</P>
        <P>We must take steps to address the costs of running the Government, which are too high.  There is little doubt that the benefits of a fixed, secure job with a pension must be paid by somebody and it seems only fair that those who will benefit will be those who pay.  This will be accepted if the cuts are seen to apply to everybody in the public service.  The challenge for the Government is not just to cut wages and the cost of pay, although that is a very serious issue and we have no choice but to take that medicine in order to get healthy again.  I support the Government in what it is doing and I believe it needs that support.  However, it has not gone far enough and it will have to go further in the future.</P>
        <P>When a business looks at its problems and realises it has a crisis and its costs are too high, it then looks not just at wage costs but at the cost of purchasing.  We have not taken nearly enough steps in this regard.  I saw some figures from a committee which considered the position of just one Department perhaps 15 years ago.  It reckoned that with more sensible and better purchasing, &pound;100 million was capable of being saved at that time, and savings would certainly be possible these days with e-tendering.  To the best of my knowledge, that report has never been acted on despite the benefits that could be brought about.</P>
        <P>For a business, the first thing is to reduce wages and one would go to the employees and tell them what had to be done in order to remain healthy.  The second thing is to reduce the cost of purchasing goods.  The third is to reduce the cost of rent.  Therefore, I would support the idea of a property tax of some sort.  I am not sure how this would be introduced and I know there was a huge reaction to rates in the past.  However, the suggestion of a property tax on second homes seems quite acceptable and this is the sort of step that will have to be taken.  This needs imaginative ideas on the part of the Government and it needs leadership.  Acceptance of those measures will only happen if it is understood where they are coming from.</P>
        <P>The next stage for a business, when it has sought to reduce wages, purchasing costs and rent, is to find whether it can bring in more money in higher sales or some other way.  I do not believe we have done nearly enough in this area.  We talked about tax during this debate but the idea that appealed to me is the concept that, as happened in the past, one would reduce the percentage rate of certain charges to take in more money.  We know this applied very well with regard to corporation tax, which was reduced from 30% to 12.5% over a number of years.  This was well thought out, well planned and well publicised.  Every time we brought the tax rate down, we took in more money.  I am not suggesting with full vigour that we should have taken up Senator John McCain&rsquo;s proposal.  When he was in debate with the now President Obama, Senator McCain made the mistake of referring to an 11% tax rate in Ireland and how well we were doing because of that.  At that stage, it would have been great publicity to say, &ldquo;What a good idea, Senator McCain.  We will bring our tax rate down to 11%.&rdquo;  However, if it were done imaginatively, it would be possible to reduce tax rates and take in more money.  We have seen this on a number of occasions, although it is not a simple issue.</P>
        <P>Our thinking was wrong at budget time.  At the very time when we were competing with Britain as it reduced its VAT rate by 3% or 3.5%, we raised our VAT rate, forgetting that we <Col N="717"/>must encourage spending.  I am unsure to what extent that is easy to achieve, but it is possible to be imaginative in those areas.</P>
        <P>There is another area in which it is possible to be imaginative.  I believe we should become the recognised country in Europe and the world for start-up companies, especially those which are knowledge-based.  Someone involved in a start-up should say this is the country to go to before any other.  I remember speaking with a man who was on the board of a company in the United States of America some years ago.  It was during the bad times in Ireland.  He could not believe that a person came before the board with a concept for opening a new business.  That person intended to take on 38 people and the board agreed with his proposal.  The man asked what would happen if it did not succeed.  The board said that if it does not succeed, then it does not succeed.  In other words, it was willing to be entrepreneurial and to take chances and accept that there might be failures.  If we decide to seed fund start-up businesses which are imaginative, thinking and creative, we could become the global centre of excellence.  If everyone planning to start up a business gave serious thought to locating in Ireland because of a fund, in some form or other, to encourage such businesses, then I believe there is a greater chance of making progress and of improving the present position.  However, to do so, we would have to accept and recognise failures might occur.  We must be willing to accept this if we are to create a seed capital fund.</P>
        <P>Let us consider what occurred when Mr. Dermot Desmond approached the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, in the mid-1980s with an idea which was developed.  Let us consider the sizable success in that case.  It requires such imaginative thinking.  Let us recall when Mr. Tony Ryan set up Ryanair.  Anyone could have said that he should be careful, because no one at the time could have believed that within several years, and from those beginnings, one of Europe&rsquo;s largest airlines would be based in Ireland.  We must recognise how the country has developed in the past 15 years.</P>
        <P>I refer to an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> yesterday, the title of which is &ldquo;In praise of Iceland&rdquo;.  I was going to read it, but there is no time.  However, it is worth reading.</P>

	<P>It is fascinating.  Of all newspapers, it is remarkable of the <i>Financial Times</i> to praise Iceland and to suggest that it deserves to be given a chance and an opportunity.  Iceland did not join the European Union, yet the article suggests we should fast-track it into the European Union to show what can be done.  I believe we will not get such support from Europe unless we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum.  I believe we have done harm to seek support for a goal which was unattainable.  I hope we will still get support from Europe.  However, it would have been a good deal more active if we had voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We have another chance to do so and I hope we do not lose that second chance.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Mark Daly.  It is always very good to follow Senator Quinn, because he is always constructive.  The business expertise and knowledge which he brings to the debate and the manner in which he puts forward very thoughtful points is beneficial for the debate.  I compliment him in this regard.  I listened to Senator John Paul Phelan also.  I have been critical of the partisanship in both Houses, as is the public.  It does nothing for the image of politics, or to address the challenges we face.  However, in fairness to Senator John Paul Phelan, his comments were very good and constructive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We should acknowledge that and encourage such contributions.  I do not believe this side of the House should always take the same view.  If we have a different opinion from the Government we should say so.  Perhaps we should encourage the Government to take on board some of our opinions in that regard.</P>
        <P>We are in a very difficult situation.  We are part of the global difficulties.  I attended a meeting of a Fianna F&aacute;il cumman in Campile, County Wexford two weeks ago.  A major debate was held on this matter.  The was much complaining, as is usual at these meetings.  However, one man said that in every town and village in the world there is a recession and we must accept it.  It may be preferable to be controversial and to personalise issues from the point of view of selling newspapers.  Perhaps it is more attractive from a media point of view if such an approach succeeds in getting the attention of the audience.  However, that constant drip can undermine collective and individual confidence.</P>
        <P>Obviously, the correct decisions must be made.  We must meet the challenges in the financial sector and elsewhere.  However, we must also restore confidence.  People must be able to hope and we must try to inject this into the system.  The Government has shown courage this week.  The decisions made took some courage, especially when the talks with the social partners broke down.  I welcome the disposition and comments of Ministers, and especially the Taoiseach, who strongly and genuinely believes in a significant role for social partnership to get through our current difficulties.  I recognise and support that call.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There must also be fairness.  I recognise why the unions had some difficulties.  I watched a very interesting debate on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;.  There was representation from IBEC and Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Connor from SIPTU was also present.  He came across as very balanced, and he had certain difficulties with what was done.  No one in the public service or in any business would welcome a cut in pay, which is understandable.  However, failure to take such action now would lead to a horrendous situation later on.  That is the reality.  If we do not correct the public finances, the Government will be paralysed and unable to take effective measures to instil some growth into the economy, and to deal with the banking situation and so on.  We may find ourselves unable to borrow money.  I do not wish to be too alarmist, because we need to restore confidence, but we also need to be somewhat realistic.</P>
        <P>In fairness, the Government must tackle those in privileged positions who are, perhaps, on salaries which are unsustainable in the current climate.  As someone who raised the issue at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I welcome the statements from several people on contract in RTE.  I am unsure if they have all made similar commitments.  No one in a privileged position should be immune, especially lawyers who have been creaming off for a long time in the Four Courts and elsewhere at tribunals and so on.  It is an absolute scandal.  We should call on them to complete the tribunals with no additional pay whatsoever.  I do not mean they should take a pay cut, rather that they should work <i>gratis</i>, because of the millions they have extracted from the taxpayer in the past decade.  I hope the Government will take strong action and I will be very critical if it fails to do so.</P>
        <P>A very bad deal has been done with the hospital consultants, which must be corrected, and not only by 8%.  It should be retracted more significantly.  There is no justification whatsoever for people in this country being paid 50% more for doing the same job as people in a neighbouring island.  I hope the Government will focus on these issues and pursue them energetically and strenuously.  Once people see that the Government has a very even-handed approach and that everyone is asked to contribute, progress can be made.  If people fail to contribute or to assist in the national recovery plan, steps will be taken to ensure they do.</P>
        <P>I echo the comments of Senator Quinn on encouraging risk-takers and entrepreneurs.  The last thing we need is to turn on each other.  This additional payment from the public sector should remove the debate and criticism between the public and private sectors.  We are all in this together and we will all either come through it together and come out at the other end <Col N="719"/>unscathed, or we will all come out seriously retarded, both financially and in other ways.  This is a boat that must be rowed in unison.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Walsh for sharing time.  I agree with his remarks regarding those in privileged positions.  We should start with ourselves.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, of which Senator Walsh is a member, is considering the matter of expenses and remuneration.  However, one cannot take action such as that announced yesterday and then state that Members&rsquo; expenses are immune, as one then would have no credibility.  I do not wish to see the implementation of the report and findings of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in a few months&rsquo; time, in the wake of a sustained media campaign that has lasted for weeks and with a perception that it was done under public pressure, rather than doing it quickly and immediately.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, advertisements on Internet sites for hotels in Dublin suggest that a room can cost as little as &euro;10 or &euro;20 per night, or &euro;40 if one wishes to go up-market.  Members&rsquo; subsistence allowances are greater than that.  Their purpose is to pay for overnight expenses and the cost of a hotel room.  There is not meant to be an element of profit.  Given the public is contemplating hotel rooms that cost &euro;10 a night, how can Members state that although subsistence was taken from the public sector yesterday, they are a different case?  Members are not a special case and if they declare everyone is in this together, they should mean it.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet on taking a decisive decision yesterday.  It is unfortunate this could not have been done under the auspices of social partnership.  I realise the pressure the unions were under as they were stuck between a rock and a hard place.  It is difficult for union representatives, whose job is to get the best pay, terms and conditions for those who pay their wages, to tell their members they have just negotiated a pay cut for them.  It was an easier job when times were good and benchmarking awards and so on were being handed out.  It is very difficult for them to accept reductions and the pressure of time was a major factor.  Obviously, the rating agencies are still considering Ireland from the perspective of its volatility and ability to pay.  There are those, I am  unsure whether one can call them merchants of doom, who have suggested that 500,000 people will be unemployed.  Such unemployment levels obviously would have a massive impact on social welfare payments and social order.  Consequently, nobody is immune and if Members are to give leadership, they must begin with themselves.</P>
        <P>Amid all the talk of levies yesterday, some good news was announced, as an additional sum of approximately &euro;750 million will be spent on the capital programme for schools.  A further &euro;56 million will be saved in the schools budget in respect of lower than expected costs, which will provide employment.  While such employment will not be nearly sufficient, it is something.  In addition, I have been informed there will be job announcements by the Government over the coming weeks.  They probably will go unreported in the newspapers, which only sell when there is bad news.</P>
        <P>Ireland must make itself competitive again and must do what Senator Quinn advocated, namely, encourage entrepreneurship.  As for the Opposition parties, my learned colleagues in Fine Gael have put forward proposals, some of which the Government has already adopted to a degree.  However, I note with interest that in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the Labour Party, while critical of the Government, has put nothing forward except platitudes and plenty of criticism.  In the hour of greatest peril, when deposit holders nationwide looked to the Government for leadership in respect of the banks, the Labour Party balked.  Senator Fitzgerald should consider that had a Labour Party Minister for Finance been sitting in the hot seat that night, Ireland would be in an entirely different world, which would not necessarily be a better place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak today and welcome to the House the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  The tone of the debate has been highly interesting and I found myself in agreement with many points made from different sides of the House.  The best thinking from everyone in Ireland must be sought and as many people as possible must be brought with us, because we face an unprecedented crisis both in Ireland and internationally.</P>
        <P>Earlier today, I read a note that John Bruton circulates on a weekly basis, from which a phrase struck me.  He spoke of being at a meeting in San Francisco in which EU-American relations were being discussed and at which he stated that the challenge of the 21st century will be to build a system of political governance for the world that can manage the economic, environmental and human relations globalisation that has already taken place.  The international crisis is evident and no one can deny the mess the international financial situation has become.  The international management system has been shown to have feet of clay.  Financial management is being re-invented both in Ireland and internationally and I do not believe the answers have been found yet.  This is clear in respect of the debate on the banks.  While other countries have recapitalised banks, they have not necessarily got the hoped-for results, which raises serious questions about Ireland&rsquo;s capitalisation plans.  One sees President Obama talking about the need for tighter regulation in banking and the Minister of State should comment on that issue.  I welcomed the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments yesterday regarding tighter regulation in the banking sector, and caps placed on bonuses and pay, which I consider to be absolutely essential.</P>
        <P>I will refer to an e-mail  which I and many other Members received and which was rather well put.  The writer stated his belief that everyone must make sacrifices to pull the country out of this difficult time.  However, he continued by suggesting that were economic cuts to be targeted at any particular sector, surely it should be at the financial institutions and the construction industry, which largely caused the problems.  A genuine sense of shock is widespread and those who were targeted yesterday by the pension levy are questioning the reason they will be the ones to feel the pain, given they did not cause the problem in the first place.  I agree with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point that one cannot set up the private sector against the public sector.  We must move forward and create a sense of everyone being in this together.  The only way this can be achieved is if people believe the actions that are being taken are fair and equitable in so far as possible.</P>
        <P>This is the reason for dealing with the banks in an up-front way and imposing conditions for the vast amount of money that they are to receive.  Conditions and tighter regulations should be imposed and greater feedback should be received on a more permanent basis.  In addition, one must ensure the audits are more accurate or cover all they must cover, compared to what has happened previously.  This is the only way in which those who have been asked to take money from their back pockets and who consider that they did not contribute to this crisis will believe that what is happening is fair.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy-Eames did something interesting and the Minister of State may wish to take note of her contribution today.  She spoke to a company in Galway in which 80 redundancies have been sought and asked whether there was anything the Government could do that would enable it to retain these employees.  It responded in the affirmative.  I do not suggest simply pouring money into firms with no return but, as everyone is aware, the cost to the Exchequer of unemployment is extremely high.  Therefore, everything that can be done in a proactive way to maintain jobs is critical.</P>
        <P>One issue the company cited was its energy costs and I believe strongly that the question of ESB and Bord G&aacute;is charges should be considered.  Although the global price of oil has fallen, we appear to be experiencing a huge delay in the passing on of the reduced costs.  I also take great note of the comments made by Senator Quinn, who spoke of the absolutely critical necessity of returning to a competitive environment.  As the Minister of State is aware, Ireland <Col N="721"/>has been losing competitiveness for approximately five years.  My worry is that there appears to be a lack of urgency on the part of the Government in respect of, for example, tackling the issue of electricity and gas prices.  The aforementioned company stated that this issue was of critical importance to it, as were the PRSI costs in respect of employment, about which I also seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Urgency certainly is needed in our responses.</P>
        <P>Energy costs are key to maintaining jobs.  We must consider what proactive steps can be taken to make a difference and to keep people in employment given the appalling scale of debt, the significant levels of unemployment and the consequent personal stress, especially among those who cannot see alternatives.  It is not nice to suggest that people could have gone away beforehand.  At least there was somewhere to go at the time.</P>
        <P>Dole queues should be dealt with urgently.  I have spoken to people who recently became unemployed.  They do not feel that anyone is reaching out to them, telling them that, in light of their particular skill sets, they will be offered training courses in X, Y or Z or going over their options with them.  We must invest more resources in reaching out to those who have become unemployed so that they have some hope of moving forward.  We must ask them whether they are interested in further education, developing certain skill sets or moving into other fields.  Given unemployed people&rsquo;s desperation, a more proactive engagement with them is necessary.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State respond to a number of Fine Gael initiatives, namely, the necessary acceleration of the schools building programme by fast tracking planning applications for new schools under the critical infrastructure Act, reversing the hike in VAT to give retailers some relief, providing PRSI relief for employers in distressed companies exposed to competitiveness problems and who retain a minimum number of employees this year, and providing a loan guarantee scheme for small businesses?  As the Minister of State is probably aware, these points were also made in the D&aacute;il.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Regarding social partnership, one can be in favour of social partnership and still show political leadership, which was Fine Gael&rsquo;s point when Deputy Kenny referred to the cloak of social partnership.  Only when the Taoiseach&rsquo;s back was to the wall did he make his announcement in the D&aacute;il.  In fact, it was the last place in which he did so, but it should have been the first.  There should have been detailed discussions on the options available to help people, but none was held.  Social partnership has bypassed the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  I urge the Government to consider the matter and, while possibly continuing with the social partnership process, to find ways to have meaningful engagement in the Houses during this economically and societally serious time.</P>

	<P>Every point has been raised repeatedly.  Unfortunately, I will go down the same track and make the same points that were contributed in a constructive manner by Members from all sides of the House in the past few hours.  Listening to this debate and the fine statements on how best to move forward has been great.  There is no doubt that sacrifices must be made.  If we are to pull ourselves out of the crisis, the days of bickering, points scoring and one-upmanship must end.  I want to work in any way possible to bring the economy back.</P>
        <P>Two years ago, everyone was cushily sitting without worries, money was flush and people were spending long weekends in Marbella to play golf.  People are now shocked and are asking themselves whether they will keep their jobs.  How many families are watching their television sets and wondering how they will get out of this situation?  This morning, I spoke to a young couple with two small children.  The husband works in consultancy and his wife told me that, <Col N="722"/>while she is lucky to be able to do so, she has no choice but to return to her teaching profession because her husband may shortly be without his job.</P>
        <P>The division between the public and private sectors has been mentioned.  The private sector has strongly argued that salaries in the public sector have pulled ahead of its own.  This was not always the case, but the public sector played catch-up for a while.  When I started teaching, I compared my salary with those working in the business world.  Like with like, there was no comparison.  In fairness to the unions, they pushed the matter and our salaries jumped quickly.  They moved ahead of those in private industry.  There must be a levelling off in both sectors.</P>
        <P>The majority of those in the public sector understand they must accept cutbacks.  This morning, I asked someone whether he or she wanted to be like the workers at Waterford Crystal who, after working in the industry for 40 years, have no hope of jobs, no pensions, are fighting to hold on to whatever is left and are trying to rebuild Waterford Crystal, or a worker in the public sector, be it a teacher, nurse, garda or those in the Civil Service.  I would prefer to take a cutback and hold on to my job for five days per week than to find myself, like those at Waterford Crystal and many other firms, worrying about whether I will have a job in one month&rsquo;s time.</P>
        <P>We must protect everyone.  We are Ireland and we want to ensure a return to a good standard of living.  We have started on that road and I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Cabinet on taking the lead.  I also congratulate the social partners who did their best and brought the negotiations to the wire.  Unfortunately, they could not step over it.  However, they are on side and are anxious to hold the country together.  Everyone has a responsibility to do the same.</P>
        <P>As a public representative, listening to the discussion and the many points raised and the constructive ideas has been rewarding.  I will repeat a number of points that struck me.  When I am out and about, the matter raised with me is a reduction in the VAT rate.  When I go to the ladies&rsquo; clothes shops where I am known, I am asked to reduce VAT.  I am not convinced, given the type of shop in question.  In recent years, the mark-up on clothes has been colossal, making a profit of 200% to 300% on any item of clothing.  Many would agree with me in this regard.  These figures can be reduced.  Even those shops where sales see items&rsquo; prices reduced by 70% are making profits.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn told the House that costs must be reduced.  Wages are automatically falling, but production costs must be considered.  We must play a role in this regard, given that retailers did well during the Celtic tiger years.  They made their profits and must now make a contribution.  I am not knowledgeable enough to know whether we should go about doing that via VAT or otherwise, but we must determine how to tell the public and shopping malls that they must help.  The day of the fast buck is over.</P>
        <P>I refer to small building projects that can be brought on stream quickly, such as school or house extensions.  I ask the Minister of State to work with local authorities to speed up the planning process because some are making a mess of it.  That would help to get projects off the ground.  There is not enough co-ordination.</P>
        <P>We must help the unemployed, who are vulnerable.  We need counsellors who will guide them to the best opportunities.  There are not enough people to help them whether they do a course and upskill, an educational programme or whether they collect their dole money and look for opportunities wherever they can get them.  The F&Aacute;S placement officers have been misplaced for a long time.  There is a golden opportunity to re-specify their jobs and how they do them.</P>
        <P>The economy is on the rocks.  We can make it work.  Let us all work together.  Our Taoiseach and the social partners started this process a few days ago.  I was pleased to be part of such a constructive debate this afternoon.</P>

	<P>I am glad to speak in this important debate and glad that the Seanad is discussing the enormous and grave financial crisis facing the country.  At a time when politics and the Seanad receive negative publicity, this House should engage in robust debate on matters pertaining to the economy, analysing why and how we are in our present difficulties and suggesting how we can advance.  I hope this is only the first of many regular debates on economic issues.</P>
        <P>Approximately 15,000 students turned up to protest outside the House yesterday about various matters, particularly the possible introduction of new fees for education.  I noted with a wry smile one group calling itself Free Education for Everybody, FEE.  That terminology represents the philosophy that has this country in its present state.  Cloud cuckoo land is the only place where free anything for anybody would exist.  Everything has a price that the taxpayer must pay.  The sad and brutal reality of our economic plight is that we have lived significantly beyond our means for many years.  &ldquo;Race to the bottom&rdquo; is the phrase tripping off many lips.  For the past five to ten years, however, there has been a grotesque rush to the top in which everybody wanted to maximise profits, wages, expenditure, borrowings and purchases, buying a second house, a second apartment, a foreign home and so on.  If one did not enter that league of decency, one was deemed to be a second-class citizen.  All has suddenly changed and a cold new dawn of reality surrounds us.  We must live within the rules of our new financial dispensation.  While the crisis has major international elements, it also has major national elements because many decisions taken by Governments of the past ten or 12 years proved ill-founded.  We have debated the onus placed on the property sector to bring in taxes and fuel the economy.  All the international agencies warned us that we were too dependent on property but the Government did not heed this advice.  We must try to work our way out of the resulting difficulty.</P>
        <P>The battle against inflation did not get the attention it deserved in the past five or six years when most people had a large disposable income and rarely sought value for money.  In the new economic circumstances we must try to tackle the cost of living because most people will be significantly worse off.  Hundreds of thousands will be unemployed.  We must attend to energy pricing, home heating oil prices, telephone charges, value added tax, VAT rates, transport and fuel.  The income of most families will move down a peg and we must try to ease their burden a little by tackling the costs.  That is worthy of another debate.</P>
        <P>I have been annoyed recently also by the phrase &ldquo;we did not cause the problem and therefore we should not be part of the solution&rdquo; coming from all sides of the House and society.  Virtually everybody has been part of the problem because most of us earned too much, spent too much and saved too little.  I appreciate that some people are more responsible than others but trying to wash our hands of the problem is the economics and politics of cloud cuckoo land.  We are all part of the solution.  While some practices within the banking industry have been despicable, grossly irresponsible and damaging, and must be addressed, we need a solid banking system.  It is imperative that we get our banking house in order and recognise that while the national debt is a serious problem, personal debt is at a record high too.  We have all contributed to some degree to the problem and must contribute to a solution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s solution is only the beginning.  We can debate it at length but decisions were urgently required.  The Minister of State is aware of the Fine Gael proposals.  The taxpayers&rsquo; money must be spent wisely and carefully to get maximum value.  Public sector pay must be controlled as much as possible because the taxpayer pays the bill.  It is not some invisible cheque written by Government.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Ironically, while public services in the area of health and education have reduced and their quality has disimproved, the number of providers of those services appears to have increased.  We must examine the numbers working in the public service and consider how to streamline the services and reduce the number of staff, apart from those in the frontline.  The man and woman who pay <Col N="724"/>tax cannot continue to fund the present level of public expenditure.  The reduction will be painful, difficult and must be approached in a fair and balanced way.</P>
        <P>The Government offered one analysis and Fine Gael offered a different one but the Government proposals are being enacted.  In the past 48 hours many public servants have expressed grave disquiet about the income levy.  It can be argued that it is an unfair and disproportionate levy across the board but it is Government policy and we must consider how to make the unfair measures more fair.  We are now facing the gravest economic and social crisis in the history of the State.  The Minister of State was a Government adviser in the 1980s when we thought that the era was the worst time for us since the Emergency.  This is truly the greatest challenge we have faced.</P>
        <P>At a time when projections show that 400,000 people will be out of work, those of us who have a guaranteed job must recognise that the first priority must be for those who have no such guarantee.  All policy decisions must be taken in such a fashion to protect taxpayers, provide value for money and make cuts and sacrifices in a fair and equitable fashion.  Otherwise, the country literally will go down the tubes.  If we believe we are unique in the world and that a situation that occurred in Iceland or South America could not happen here, then we are not dealing with reality.  I hope all of us in this House will play a part in having real economic debate so that realistic political choices can be put forward over the course of the next few crucial weeks and months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Brady.  I agree with the majority of what Senator Bradford had to say about the common responsibility we all share in the current economic situation.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate on the economy.  It is the key issue on the doorsteps, and this is the right place to debate those issues.</P>
        <P>Jobs are being lost all over country and it is forecast there will be a couple of hundred thousand job losses this year, and possibly up to 400,000 job losses.  There was a recent announcement in Donegal that 120 jobs will be lost to the county, albeit that they are being moved to Galway, following a decision by Boston Scientific yesterday.  Other difficulties are being faced by employers at the moment as they lose jobs, especially within the small and medium enterprises.  By these I mean hotels and small businesses that may not be part of IBEC but that employ locally.  Those businesses are experiencing cash flow difficulties at the moment.  I have discovered this from talking to employers and employees who are raising their concerns with me.  The lending agencies that allow the businesses have cash flow, be it through overdraft facilities or loans, are simply not doing that anymore.  They have withdrawn the overdraft facilities to small businesses, which is creating havoc.  The one key thing is to provide liquidity to the SME sector, be it those who want to establish small businesses or existing small businesses.  I am not sure how we can do that, whether it is through some Government fund or through the banks, but it is something we must do to bring liquidity back to those creating jobs.</P>
        <P>There is a company in my constituency that wants to create 60 jobs.  The State agency has provided funding to that particular company but it is having grave difficulty in liaising with the financial institutions because it cannot get its hands on a bridging loan.  It is disgraceful if the banks cannot support jobs.  If that is the case, then it will add to our unemployment figures.  We have a responsibility to work through this and provide a solution.</P>
        <P>There are advantages in the current climate.  Oil costs have fallen, as have interest rates, and that is advantageous to those with mortgages.  However, I hope that all the banks are passing on the European Central Bank interest rate reductions.  A number of Senators spoke about electricity prices and I hope we see a reduction in those prices.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is working on that.  It is imperative to bring down those prices because it would bring down the cost of living at home and the cost of doing business <Col N="725"/>here.  Capital investment by the Government is about &euro;8 billion this year, or 5.3% of gross national product.  That investment is important at this time because it will allow the Government to invest in infrastructure at a reduced cost while employing people as well.</P>
        <P>There are 50,000 people employed in the financial services sector in Ireland.  The majority of those do their utmost, but there is a small percentage who should bear some of the responsibility for the mess in which we find ourselves.  Those people gave the wrong advice to customers while they were totally negligent in the way they implemented their own professional responsibility.  Those individuals, and there may only be a handful, need to be taken to task.  The public is looking for them to be taken to task and it is time that was done.  The necessary information will have to be obtained but if individuals are shown to have done wrong, then those individuals in the banking sector should be brought before the courts and the judges can make decisions on how to deal with them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his useful statement, which puts everything in context.  I listened to Senator Harris who put it all in context in the most straightforward way I ever heard.  We all tend to talk about the public sector and the private sector but we are all in this together.  As other speakers have said, we must work together and we must work through this.  If we do not, we will never get out of it.  The fire is raging and we must put it out.</P>
        <P>As Senator Harris said this morning, somebody else is to blame.  We are all in this.  We all benefitted in some way or other from the Celtic tiger.  Nobody escaped that, although people will say that we got nothing from the Celtic tiger.  That is not true.  This is a lie, a misnomer, and not a fact.  Some might have benefitted more than others.  We hear continually that the construction industry did well.  The construction industry and anyone else in business is there to make a profit.  In making a profit, it enables them to provide jobs.  The construction industry provided many jobs and people bought houses from them.  If the people did not buy the houses, they would not be in business.  There seems to be a big emphasis on the construction industry.  If we did not have the construction industry at the time, we would not have had the Celtic tiger.  We might have had some part of it, but it would not be as good as it was.  We must be fair with people.</P>
        <P>The bankers are only one component of this.  They did not cause all of the problem.  However, they will have to be brought to account.  There is no doubt that if I was in a job and I behaved in the fashion they did, I am sure I would not be standing here speaking to you, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge the role of the trade union movement, especially David Begg, who is a former colleague of mine.  He performed the duties required of him in a very professional and dignified manner.  The involvement of the social partners was not an optional extra.  They contributed to industrial peace and they enabled the framing of the Celtic tiger.  Without them it would not have happened either.  We are all in this together and we all have to get out of it together.  We cannot start saying that some people are losing more than others, why should one person do this and another do that, that the builders were to blame for this and the banks were to blame for that, and that the public service is to blame for something else.  We cannot solve a problem in that manner.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I acknowledge that the Opposition Senators to whom I have listened have been very positive.  They have not taken political advantage of the situation, which is very good of them.  It is also wise because the public does not thank politicians who refuse to engage in constructive debate.  People can see through it from a mile away.  They prefer politicians to be honest with each other.  The day of tomfoolery is long over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened with interest to most of the debate.  I begin by making a technical point.  The Seanad is, of course, not being asked to vote on the measures introduced by the Government this week.  I understand the Seanad&rsquo;s constitutional position in respect of <Col N="726"/>financial matters.  It gives a slightly different focus to our debate.  We are responding to the statement made by the Minister of State at the beginning of the debate.  The advantage of that is that it gives us an opportunity to make more general remarks and give a more general account of where we are coming from on these issues.  It is important to remind ourselves that we are not being asked to vote for or against the Government&rsquo;s measures, which were passed by the other House a couple of hours ago.</P>
        <P>I do not disagree with Senator Brady&rsquo;s remarks, which are fresh in my mind, about the importance of not wallowing in a sense of blame.  I agree that we will not make much progress on the grave issues before the House by wallowing in the past or immersing ourselves in petty finger-pointing.  Having said that, it would be absurd to suggest that there is no room in this debate for an analysis or assessment of how we got here.  I often hear Senators on the Government side using the phrase, &ldquo;We are where we are.&rdquo;  I even heard Senator O&rsquo;Toole use it today.  That, and nothing more than that, is supposed to be the basis for discussion.  It is suggested that we should confine ourselves to proposing how we should get ourselves out of where we are.  I would amend the phrase slightly &mdash;  &ldquo;We are where the Government brought us.&rdquo;  That is where we are, and it should be the starting point.  If we do not honestly analyse what has occurred, I do not think we can hope to achieve the public or social solidarity that will be needed to address these issues in the future.  When one asks people to make sacrifices, one needs to have their support and confidence.  If one is entirely silent on what has happened, that is not possible.  People are not stupid.  They are discussing among themselves how we got to where we are.  The Government has to be clear on that.</P>
        <P>I noticed a marginal reference in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to mistakes having been made.  It is like the first cuckoo in that it is the first acknowledgment of mistakes I have spotted in a Government speech over recent weeks.  I may be wrong in that respect.  The Minister of State touched on the construction issue in that section of his speech.  The relevant section lasts just four or five words, but at least it is there.  It is necessary.  Perhaps the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, made some similar remarks in the other House last week.  I am not entirely sure.  The Government cannot expect people to come together in any serious way to support its decisions, or at least give it some space when making them, if it is not straight and honest about what has occurred.</P>
        <P>I was slightly amused by Senator Brady&rsquo;s defence of the construction industry.  He suggested that we would not have had a Celtic tiger if it had not been for the construction industry.  The problem, at least for the second half of the Celtic tiger&rsquo;s life, was that we had a construction industry and very little else.  We hear many jokes about the tent at the Galway Races &mdash; it is the subject of much teasing and slagging in these Houses &mdash; but it turns out that the tent may have been our economy for the last few years.  We had little else.  I do not suggest that other productive activities were not taking place.  In terms of real expansion, however, there was little to show for the years after 2001 or 2002 other than what was attributed to the construction sector.  That has to be analysed and assessed if we are honestly to consider our approach to this problem.</P>
        <P>Before I explain the nature of the difficulty I have with the measures that were announced this week, I wish to make it clear I absolutely accept that if there are gaping holes, and the boat is going down, those holes have to be plugged.  Unlike Senator Feeney, I do not think I would attribute courage to the Government for doing something it had no option but to do.  I would not say that somebody was courageous for doing something if they had no choice other than to do it.  If someone has to do something, how can he or she be said to be courageous when he or she does it?  If one sees a tsunami coming in one&rsquo;s direction, one will have to do something to block it.  I am mixing all kinds of metaphors, nautical and otherwise, but I am sure the Minister of State will understand what I mean.  Of course the Government has to do something, but what it has done this week is no more than one part of the picture.</P><Col N="727"/>
        <P>The difficulty I have with the measures announced this week is that they are being undertaken in isolation.  Before this week, the Government had done virtually nothing over the many weeks and months that had passed since last summer, when the storm clouds started to gather.  Other parties made many proposals to the Government during that time.  I am speaking only for my own party, obviously.  Senator Regan can deal with his party but I can say, without fear of genuine contradiction, that no party has proposed more positive ideas for dealing with the economic crisis than the Labour Party.  I have said this previously in the presence of the Minister.  I do not claim that every one of my party&rsquo;s policies or proposals stands up.  The Government might not agree with them all, or find them all acceptable.  However, I can assure Senators that they have been seriously thought through and tabled in the public domain by the Labour Party.  I invite the Government to consider them.</P>
        <P>While debates of this nature are very useful, they do not really give us an opportunity to scrutinise the detail of individual policies and proposals.  I wonder if a means of providing for such scrutiny can be agreed at some point.  If my colleagues on the other side of the House want to scrutinise or cross-examine the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals, I will have no difficulty with that.  However, I ask them not to claim, as some speakers did earlier, that the Labour Party has not introduced any proposals.  That is manifestly untrue.  It is simply not the case.  We have done so over and over again.  The Government has indicated that it agrees with many of our policy proposals, even if it has not adopted them.  We have proposed some constructive ideas.  For the past 18 months, we have been talking about the need to ensure that small high-tech Irish companies can access capital.  Deputy Gilmore made a speech on the issue in November 2007.</P>
        <P>In May 2008, the Labour Party called for the establishment of a programme of investment in schools.  As I recall it, a Senator on the other side of the House pooh-poohed the idea of providing for a schools expansion programme.  It is now one of the things the Government plans to do.  Last September, we made the case for a scheme to promote home insulation.  Once more, it was scoffed at in certain quarters.  The Government now appears to be moving in that direction, although as far as I am aware it has not yet made any specific proposals.  In September 2008, we were arguing in favour of a medium-term fiscal strategy.  I note that the Government adopted such an approach in January of this year.  Last September, before the Government&rsquo;s bank guarantee was introduced or the Anglo Irish Bank scandal emerged, we demanded a full review of the operations of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>In November of last year, we called for a home guarantee to be introduced.  At the same time, we proposed the introduction of an &ldquo;earn and learn&rdquo; scheme for people who have lost their jobs or have access to a limited amount of employment.  Retraining should be made available to people who have part-time or short-term working arrangements.  We are all big boys and girls in here and I have no difficulty in withstanding criticisms of the policy proposals put forward by the Labour Party.  We can deal with them in a robust fashion and sometimes our minds can be changed about matters we advocate, but I do not accept the suggestion thrown about that the Labour Party has come forward with no proposals when the opposite is the case.  This has been widely acknowledged, including in an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent </i>of 1 December last in which the leader of my party was described as a person who has shown imagination and originality in his approach to the economy and proposals on it.</P>
        <P>I would like to respond to a point made by Senator Boyle earlier in the debate.  As always, he is thoughtful and he made some interesting observations with which I agree.  He spoke about the involvement of politicians and the necessity for politicians to address a reduction of costs in our sector.  I am not sure if he mentioned Ministers of State but he indirectly mentioned the question of expenses and so on.  I agree with him on that.  A number of speakers raised this point.  I acknowledge that, of all his colleagues, the Minister of State present is the least culpable in this regard but he is here not on his own behalf but on behalf of the Government.</P><Col N="728"/>
        <P>It is clear there are too many Ministers of State and the number ought to be reduced.  It is not clear what some of them are expected to do in terms of the delineation of functions.  However, I am much more concerned about the veritable infrastructure surrounding Ministers and Ministers of State that deals with everyday constituency queries.  I have a problem with this not only from the point of view of the financial commitment the State has to make to it but from the perspective that it risks undermining our democracy.  We have what I would describe as an infrastructure of people around Ministers and Ministers of State whose function is to deal with constituency queries.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, used the extraordinary phrase, &ldquo;A&amp;E of the system&rdquo; to describe the role of Ministers.  Ministers&rsquo; armies of assistants in their offices deal with everyday queries and service individual constituency needs.</P>
        <P>What people ultimately expect from politicians is for those of us in the Opposition at the time of an election to put forward proposals and policies for consideration by the electorate, who either vote for us or they do not.  An outgoing Government similarly publishes a manifesto on how it will deal with this or that question of public concern, particularly the question of the economy, and people vote or do not vote for it on that basis.</P>
        <P>It is simply not acceptable for the kind of structure of patronage and clientelism that has grown up around Ministers and Ministers of State to be funded out of the public purse.  People are being asked to vote for people on the basis of the level of service they have given them in a constituency but the service they provide is funded out of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  I know many politicians and many of them are admirable.  We all deal with queries from our constituents and it is an important part of our work.  I do not denigrate that.  It is part of the way the system works, but it ought not to be funded in the way it is, particularly in the case of Ministers and Minister of State by large numbers of persons working in Ministers&rsquo; offices whose sole function is to deal with constituency inquiries.</P>
        <P>If I were Senator Boyle, that is the area I respectfully suggest we should start to address.  I wonder if he would be interested in bringing forward proposals on those issues, including the sheer number of Ministers of State currently in the system.  He decried a lack of willingness to change the way we behave in a political system.  That is one area we could quickly start to address.  If there were such a proposal from Senator Boyle or his party or any other Member on the other side of the House, I, and I believe my party, would support it.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the question of social partnership that has been raised by a number of speakers on the other side who are either labouring under a misapprehension as to the Labour Party&rsquo;s view on social partnership or else they are being somewhat mischievous.  I am sure it is not the latter, so it must be the former.  Social partnership is a crucial element to our system and the way in which issues, particularly but not only issues related to pay, are negotiated with the trade union movement.  I and other Members on this side have said it should not replace, supplant or be an alternative to the political system.  The social partnership process should not be where the Government goes almost exclusively with its proposals, as appeared to be the case last week and the week previously when documents expressing the Government&rsquo;s position were published for the social partners and put into the media but they were never tabled here.  That is wrong.  It does not constitute any criticism of social partnership for politicians to stand up in these Houses and say that we have a role to play, that we are elected Members of these Houses and our role should not be supplanted or replaced, in some sense, through a reliance on social partnership.</P>
        <P>I heard speakers on the other side laud social partnership and remind us how important it is.  It may just be a footnote but it is important to remind ourselves that the measures agreed in the other House today were rejected in the social partnership process.  If the other side is so committed to social partnership, is it not odd that they were in any event prepared a number <Col N="729"/>of hours later to go ahead with proposals that had been rejected in that system of which they proclaim themselves to be so supportive?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The difficulty with the measures announced this week is that they have been decided on by the Government, announced to the public, and agreed in the other House in circumstances where they are being dealt with in isolation.  They are not being tabled and brought forward as part of a broader plan and strategy to get the country back to work, which is what we all agree we need to do.  It is instructive to consider that the 120,000 people who joined the live register last year cost the Exchequer at least &euro;1.3 billion in direct payments and almost another billion in tax forgone, costs which effectively wipe out the &euro;2 billion savings announced this week.  The difficulty I have with these measures is that it appears that the Government, rather than focusing on creating jobs, is focusing on taking money out of the economy and scapegoating, in particular, nurses, teachers and garda&iacute; for the Government&rsquo;s mismanagement.  That is unfair.  It is unacceptable that people in the public service, particularly low and middle income workers, should be scapegoated in the manner in which they have been.</P>
        <P>Surely the key to this crisis is not how much the Government can take out of the economy but what it can create.  We have been waiting for a glimpse of a strategy from the Government on job creation, turning the economy around, moving money into the system and dealing with the banking crisis.  I believe it was Senator Daly I heard speak about the Labour Party balking in regard to the banks.  I gasped when I heard it.  The Government has now presented us with its fourth or fifth proposal for dealing with the banks but the situation remains unresolved.  This is the Government which said there was no need to recapitalise the banks before altering its position and taking the action that even the dogs on the street saw was necessary.  This is the Government which said the nationalisation of a bank would be a last resort.  That has now been done in the case of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party did not balk at anything.  We supported in principle the guarantee that was extended to the banks at the end of September 2008.  However, we introduced amendments to that legislation calling on the Government to deal with the issues of executive pay, funding for small businesses and the other issues pertaining to the financial institutions which urgently required to be addressed.  None of those actions has been taken.  Far from balking, the Labour Party was entirely prescient in its approach to the banking crisis.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on expenditure measures for the stabilisation of our public finances.  I listened with interest to what Senator Alex White had to say.  I am somewhat surprised at some of his comments.  He affords no recognition that the Government has worked hard to negotiate, discuss, seek advice and consult in order to devise a framework within which we can best ascertain policy direction, the priority being to stabilise the public finances.  These are precisely the actions for which Senator White has called.  The acid test in regard to criticisms of such issues as the numbers of Ministers of State, ministerial support staff and so on is what those making the criticisms did when they were in Government.</P>

	<P>The sad reality is that the world is going through an exceptionally difficult period and that the economic and financial global outlook is extremely challenging.  In anybody&rsquo;s language, Ireland is vulnerable to the global fallout.  Our public finances are spiralling out of control, with an estimated shortfall in 2009 of &euro;18 billion, which equates to a daily borrowing requirement of &euro;50 million.  This is simply not sustainable.</P>
        <P>Nobody believes we can ignore this level of shortfall or that we are cushioned from the global difficulties, as though the economic and financial difficulties gripping the world around us were of no concern to us and had no implications for this State.  Most people recognise the seriousness of the current difficulties and take a responsible view of the situation.  There is an appreciation and acceptance by all that an exceptional effort must be put forward at this time.</P>
        <P>The expenditure measures announced by the Taoiseach on Tuesday have provided everyone with an opportunity to take stock of the seriousness of the challenges we face.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Minister for Finance and colleagues have discharged their duties diligently, honestly and openly.  They have consulted widely and taken on board the best advice available.  I understand there has been careful assessment of the extent of our problems and of the exceptional efforts required to improve the situation.  This is not a party political issue but rather a national issue, one that warrants unity of purpose, firmness of resolve and belief in our ability to overcome.</P>
        <P>The measures to ensure savings in public expenditure of &euro;2 billion in 2009 present a framework to allow us to turn the tide of the present difficulties.  We can seek to put our economy back on a sound footing once the public finances are under control.  This is not a pleasant or popular package for any Government to implement.  However, this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration is determined with every beat of its heart to put in place this framework to resolve the acute difficulties confronting the State.</P>
        <P>I make a plea today to all members of society, including politicians, economists, trade unionists, journalists, civil and public servants, entrepreneurs, employers, employees, pensioners, young people and the elderly, for a universal commitment to drive ourselves out of the current difficulties.  We all have a stake in each other&rsquo;s commitment and success because the more each individual succeeds, the more Ireland succeeds.  Let us not underestimate our challenges or overstate our difficulties.  Most importantly, however, we should be positive about our future and the opportunities that present.</P>
        <P>There are those who will say, and some who are already saying, that we cannot succeed.  There are those selling us short as a nation by claiming we have limited resources.  There are those with a defeatist attitude, writing us off as a people and a nation, and claiming we are not capable of recovery.  I categorically reject all these suggestions.  I warn those putting forward these accusations that the public is sick and tired of their claims.  Several names are on the tip of my tongue but it is best not to mention them.</P>
        <P>I am asking people to have hope and confidence in our future.  It is no exaggeration to assert that we are now at a point in our history where we have never been able to see more clearly what we can achieve.  Ireland has undergone a transformation.  We are a small, open and pulsating economy, now energised by some of the most sophisticated industries and services in the world.  Our recent economic performance, especially during the period 1995 to 2005, consistently reflected our success.  We earned great dividends in that period in terms of employment and greater prosperity.  Ireland&rsquo;s performance in attracting foreign direct investment has been a great success.  We have the entrepreneurial capacity to drive projects and an established reputation for our ability to succeed.</P>
        <P>We are a friendly nation and the international community&rsquo;s view is that we are a positive and successful people.  Ireland was a leading light on the international stage for several years <Col N="731"/>in a row.  We were the leading OECD country in terms of growth and development.  We performed above the European Union average, attracted and won more foreign direct investment compared with other leading global destinations and enjoyed industry and services in every region.  We enjoyed the correct policies and capital investment programmes for success.</P>
        <P>Every Member who has been abroad in recent years has had the experience of being congratulated and questioned on our then economic success.  The essentials have not changed.  The ingredients for success remain.  The Irish &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude has characterised our success before and is all the more necessary now.  I regret that my time has run out as I wished to say more.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this thoughtful and high level debate.  As a former Member of this House, I deprecate some of the attacks made on its usefulness, usually by those who take no obvious interest of any type in its proceedings.  Among our commentators there is generally interest in the power play and in particular personalities, but there is often insufficient interest in serious policy debate such as took place in this House today.  The Seanad has always been characterised by a somewhat less partisan spirit than that which often reigns in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey questioned whether anybody acknowledged the role played by Mr. Alan Dukes in the Tallaght strategy.  I have done so.  If he cares to look at my contribution in this Chamber on 2 November 2005, he will find a reference in this regard.  I have made several other complimentary references to the commission on the future of agriculture which the then Deputy Dukes was asked to chair by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>Reference was made by way of differentiation to benchmarking.  It is worth bearing in mind that, as a former president of the University of Limerick has observed, if there were to be another benchmarking exercise today, any revisions would most likely be in a downward direction.  Decentralisation is another initiative that was castigated as a failure by Senator Twomey.  I am surprised to find this attitude in a Member from a provincial town.  Fine Gael is very much in favour of particular decentralisation projects at a local level and wishes to see them completed.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Twomey when he said the Opposition should not be expected to come up with a grand plan because such is not its role.  He said the Opposition would produce ideas, provide opinions and back the Government with some of its suggestions.  That is fair comment.  It is the job of Government to take the hard and necessary economic decisions and, as Senator White acknowledged, to be accountable to the D&aacute;il in that regard in matters strictly related to finance.</P>
        <P>In the exceptional and difficult economic times we now face, the budgetary choices before us are stark.  It is clear we must all help shoulder the economic burden.  I agree with Senator White that the Government does not expect plaudits, does not expect to be regarded as courageous for taking decisions on how that burden is to be distributed or taking other necessary measures.  It is simply our responsibility and our duty.  The approach we adopt seeks to share the burden as fairly as possible across all sectors of society and of the economy, public and private.  On a progressive basis, it asks the better off to do more in order that impositions on the less well off can be minimised.</P>
        <P>This was bound to be very difficult.  The most difficult matter to reach consensus upon is equity.  What is fair to some people seems very unfair to others.  I would prefer that somebody, even a relatively low-paid person, would complain about the unfairness of what has been decided rather than that he or she should be without a job.  The Government&rsquo;s approach emphasises supporting and maintaining jobs, rather than supporting and maintaining incomes.  This will be difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator White that it is important to have analysis of what went wrong and how we got into the present situation.  Equally, I agree with Senator Bradford that, to a very great <Col N="732"/>degree, all of us have been part of the problem and all of us, or nearly all of us, must be part of the solution.  That does not deny that some may have been more responsible than others.</P>
        <P>In both Houses, there was a critical undertone in some contributions with regard to social partnership.  I do not for a second suggest that social partnership should be regarded in an entirely uncritical manner.  It has served the country extremely well.  The social partners came a long way with the Government in agreeing a basic analysis of the situation and of what needed to be done, even if it was not possible for them to share the responsibility for the decisions that must be taken now.</P>
        <P>The Government has already declared it will prioritise school buildings.  There is an interesting paradox with regard to energy costs.  We all agree that electricity and gas costs are too high and must be reduced.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said as much at the end of a Private Members&rsquo; debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  However, another strand of thinking which comes from environmental concerns states that in order to create proper incentives energy costs should be higher.  We must think our way through those issues.</P>
        <P>Certain Senators suggested tax changes.  No changes will be made before the next budget.  With regard to the cross-Border situation, the British decisions are of a very temporary nature, to last a few months.  That, at least, is the theory.  However, the main pressures have been caused by the exchange rate rather than by the differences in VAT.</P>
        <P>With regard to social welfare offices, personnel have been transferred from other parts of the Civil Service to cope with the extra demand.  My office, the Office of Public Works, will also examine in which ways it may be necessary to expand accommodation.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the banks.  As a German economist put it in a German political magazine during the past week, it might not be particularly palatable to support private interests at this time and thereby prevent far worse damage to the common good.  However, it may be necessary.  Questions of appropriate rewards and how money can be channelled to meet the needs of small businesses lie within the capitalisation proposals being discussed with the banks.  All these issues must be at the top of the agenda.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is charged with scrutinising actual and alleged misdemeanours in the past.</P>
        <P>The question of professional fees must be addressed and is dealt with, to a limited degree, by the Government&rsquo;s programme.  For example, there is a gulf between the cost of private dental treatment in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland.  Court procedures often seem extraordinarily antiquated.  My consitutency colleague was involved in a case which was called on several different occasions, each time requiring barristers to be paid in full.  However, I acknowledge that recent entrants to the legal profession may find it very difficult to make a living.  That was always the case in the past.</P>
        <P>Senator Shane Ross suggested we should lower the level of corporation tax.  I do not believe that would be a wise move.  We must take into account a broader European and international context.  My argument would be to leave well alone.</P>
        <P>The issue of Ministers of State was raised.  I have made known my views on that subject.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the rationale for seeking an additional pension-related contribution from public servants.  This recession is affecting people across the private sector. Unemployment figures are now reaching an unprecedented level, perhaps not in percentage terms but in absolute numbers.  Against this background, it is not unreasonable to ask public servants, who enjoy norms of secure employment and guaranteed pensions, to share in the burden of economic adjustment that is borne generally across the economy.</P><Col N="733"/>
      
        <P>Some Senators criticised the fact that pension payments are tax-deductible and stated this is unfair to the lower paid.  We have sought consistently to ensure that, as far as possible, the lowest paid are kept outside the income tax net.  Of our workforce, 38% pay no tax and, in addition, many pay no employee PRSI.  The wealthiest 5% account for half of all income taxes paid.  Almost nobody working at a full-time job in the public service is paid as little as &euro;15,000, but I have not had time to check that.  A 3% levy would be the only imposition such a person would pay rather than in addition to other payments.  The money must be raised.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Quinn made the point that business is not always fair and, unfortunately, we cannot proceed on the basis that life is always fair.  However, we are protecting the livelihoods, jobs and living standards, with some reductions, of the entire population.  Even if not everything is perfectly fair, unless we take the necessary action now, rather than later, although further instalments have to follow, we will be in far more severe difficulties and services we take for granted will be seriously at risk.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that his door is still open to the social partners regarding details of how matters might be applied.  The legislation still has to come before both Houses.  To use his words, subject to tweaking of the details, the steps have to be taken to ensure our credit-worthiness.  Our credit-worthiness, when we are in a deficit on the scale we are, relates directly to our ability to pay for our day-to-day public services, not to mention investments.  The bottom line is that action must be taken.  It is unfortunate, and I have every sympathy with people.  This may apply to a very large number of people who will have to struggle to adjust to the new circumstances facing society.  However, unfortunately, we have to do it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to deal with this matter, which concerns a forgotten road in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire ward, Pottery Road.  It is in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire development plan to redesign and reconstruct that road and there has been a part 8 procedure and a recent public consultation.  It has been decided at local level in the council to proceed with the improvement scheme for that road.  It is important in the sense that there is a level of residential density and development in the area with new apartment blocks.  There is an industrial estate and the Pfizer plant expanded in the past number of years.  There are such estates as McIntosh Park and, most recently, the development of a Lidl supermarket.  Yet the road has all the features of a country road in the middle of the city.  The residential and commercial development generates an unsustainable level of traffic and this raises some important safety issues.  The road is frequently subject to flooding and was most recently featured as having widespread flooding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask that the Minister include this in the programme for local and regional roads.  The Minister recently announced the programme for 2009.  The allocation for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was the second lowest after Carlow County Council, but that is a general observation.  My specific point is that there should be provision for this scheme given its importance to the economic vitality of the area, the efficiency of the industrial and commercial operations in the vicinity of this road and adjoining it and the safety of through traffic and the residents in the area.  I would be grateful if the Minister could take on board these observations and give some indication of the status of the road in the Department&rsquo;s assessment and when it <Col N="734"/>may be included in the Department&rsquo;s roads programme.  Since it has not got into this programme I hope it would feature in the programme for 2010.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport thanks the Senator for raising the matter of the improvement of Pottery Road, D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  In response, the Minister would like me first to make a number of general points about the resourcing of regional and local roads.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a matter for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants.  Road grants for regional and local roads in 2009 were notified to all local authorities on 2 February.  The Minister is particularly pleased that, in a year when Exchequer funding is under enormous pressure, he was in a position to allocate more than &euro;600 million for the maintenance and improvement of the network.  This is a clear indication of this Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to improving our regional and local roads network, which is critical from economic and social perspectives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the total grant allocation from the Department in 2009 is &euro;8.711 million.  As part of its overall allocation, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was allocated funding under the Department&rsquo;s specific improvement grant scheme.  Under this scheme, local authorities are invited to submit applications to the Department for consideration and when submitting applications, councils are invited to prioritise them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council submitted five proposals for consideration under the specific improvement grant scheme in 2009, listed in order of priority.  Three schemes prioritised by the council received allocations, totalling &euro;3 million.  The council&rsquo;s application for funding its Pottery Road project, which was fifth on its priority list, did not, however, receive an allocation. All regional and local road grants for 2009 have been committed and there are no additional funds at the Minister&rsquo;s disposal from which further grant allocations could be made at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department will be seeking applications for 2010 under the specific improvement grant scheme later this year and it will be open to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to re-prioritise and submit an application for the Pottery Road proposal at that time.  Local authorities may also use their discretionary improvement grant allocations from the Department to fund eligible improvement schemes.  The 2009 discretionary improvement grant allocation to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is &euro;366,000.  The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is entirely a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, whom I meet regularly on the Adjournment about educational matters.</P>
        <P>St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Knockbeg, County Carlow, has been the victim of an ongoing, protracted dance with the Department of Education and Science over the past ten years about the drawing down of funding for a new school building.  The school has a long history of a couple of hundred years and has almost 400 students on the roll.  The problem, as with a number of other schools around the country, particularly in Knockbeg, is the condition of the school buildings themselves.  Most of them are quite old and have not been repaired for many years and, as a result, the accommodation in the school leaves a lot to be desired.  There has been contact between the Minister, the Department, the school and local TDs over the past couple of years and even in the past few months.  A whole school evaluation report was conducted on the college in <Col N="735"/>February 2005 which stated: &ldquo;There are few specialist rooms, there is a serious deficit of basic facilities and the standard of accommodation is cramped and unsuited to modern secondary school standards.&rdquo;  This is a damning statement, particularly in view of the fact that the efforts of the school and the board of management to seek funding have been going on since 1999.  It has dragged on for ten years and it is now four years since the damning whole school evaluation report, but we still have no progress.</P>
        <P>At the last meeting that took place between the Minister and the board of management, mention was made of the appointment of a conservation architect to examine the school buildings because of their architectural significance.  The board of management is anxious that this appointment be made as soon as possible, but I understand no appointment has been made despite the fact that the Minister gave what amounted to a commitment when the meeting, attended by a number of local TDs, took place on 8 January last.  I hope the Minister of State in his response will have something positive to say about that and on the bigger question of a new school building for St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Knockbeg.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this adjournment on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position with regard to the proposed school building project for St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Knockbeg, County Carlow.</P>
        <P>St. Mary&rsquo;s College is an all-boys&rsquo; post-primary school which had an enrolment of 388 pupils for the 2007-08 school year.  This represents an increase of 19% over the past five years.  It is the intention of the Department of Education and Science to provide an extension at this school to cater for the growing demand for pupil places.  In this regard, the long-term projected enrolment is 450 pupils.  An extensive refurbishment project will also be carried out to the existing building.  The project attracts a band 2 rating under the Department&rsquo;s published prioritisation for large-scale building projects.  This reflects the fact that a significant extension is needed and that extensive refurbishment is also required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The project was included in an announcement on 8 November 2006 about the start of architectural planning, but, unfortunately, the funding for this has not yet been available.  As part of the process of preparing the building project to move into architectural planning, it has emerged that part of the existing school building is listed on the national inventory of architectural heritage.  It will therefore be necessary to appoint a conservation architect to establish the scope of the works necessary to comply with the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The outcome of this will inform the Department on whether it will be economically viable to continue with the plans to develop the existing site.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently met the school authority and I am pleased to inform the Senator that at this meeting he agreed to make funding available for the appointment of a conservation architect so that this aspect of the proposed project could be dealt with.  When the outcome of this is known, a decision can be taken as to how best the school&rsquo;s accommodation needs can be met and consideration can then be given by the Department to the further progression of the project under the school building and modernisation programme in the context of competing priorities and the level of funding available.</P>
        <P>The Minister appreciates the disappointment of the school community that the project has not proceeded before now and he is aware it had been hoped the project would proceed prior to 2006.  Unfortunately, the level of demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital programme is enormous and projects can only be advanced based on the priority attaching to them and as funding is available.  Funding of almost &euro;180,000 has been given to St. Mary&rsquo;s College under the summer works scheme in the recent past to improve conditions while it is waiting for its large-scale project.  A band 2 rating is the second highest possible and this positions the project to move forward as soon as the requisite funding is available.</P><Col N="736"/>
        <P>Notwithstanding the current challenging economic environment, the overall increase in the budget of the Department of Education and Science reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritising investment in the education sector in very difficult economic circumstances.  An initial capital allocation of &euro;581 &mdash; sorry, &euro;581 million &mdash; in the budget for 2009 was boosted earlier this week by a further &euro;75 million.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>

        <P>This will allow the Department of Education and Science to continue to invest significant amounts in school buildings throughout the country, to provide additional school places and to refurbish existing schools such as St. Mary&rsquo;s College.  I thank the Senator again for raising this matter and assure him that the Minister for Education and Science is aware of conditions at this school and is committed to moving a building project forward as soon as the financial situation allows.</P>

	<P>The crucial point is that the Minister said the conservation architect would be appointed, but the point the school wants to get across is that the appointment should be made as quickly as possible as the process has dragged on for so long.  I understand the constraints under which the Minister is operating and I understand the reasoning behind the appointment of a conservation architect as we need to know whether the existing building is in a condition whereby it could be refurbished or whether the school will need to move to a new site.  The problem is trying to get an answer.  I will write directly to the Minister to find out when the appointment might be made.  I thank the Minister of State for his response.</P>

The Minister of State will be well aware of the purpose of EPV days, which is to give teachers the chance to attend courses in order to gain skills which can then be used for educational benefit.  Teachers can go back to school with an additional string to their bow or further education of some sort, which can then be of benefit to the pupils they teach.  It seems the priorities of the Government in terms of overseas aid or helping people overseas are being downgraded.  I will not comment, because I do not think it is appropriate in this debate, on the decision to reduce overseas aid in the package announced on Tuesday.  This decision to remove qualification for EPV days from teachers engaged in voluntary work abroad is consistent with the decision on overseas aid.  It means the Government has downgraded its commitment to those who are under-privileged and under-educated overseas.  That is deeply regrettable.  This country has a proud record not only in terms of overseas aid but also in acknowledging it in other ways, such as this system for teachers going overseas.  My understanding is that it has been removed from not just the approved list but also the unapproved list.</P>
        <P>The constituent to whom I spoke, who has been to Uganda and used the EPV days, said the experience was invaluable.  Several of her friends who are also teachers had also used the privilege of EPV days on their return to Ireland.  She said it had been invaluable to both her and her pupils.  It is a situation where both sides win.  The pupils in this country gain advantage from the extra knowledge the teacher has gained while pupils in Uganda gain some education and benefit from the teacher going to that country.</P><Col N="737"/>
        <P>I cannot understand why this item has been removed from the list.  It is a well trodden course by several teachers.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I understand that 200 teachers availed of EPV days in 2008 and 69 used them for voluntary work abroad.  This cut will affect the large number of people who used them in the past.  I appeal to the Minister to review this apparent withdrawal so all the parties involved can benefit.</P>

	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Department&rsquo;s position on extra personal vacation days.  EPV days are days in lieu granted to primary teachers for time spent attending an approved professional development course during the months of July and August.  The principal aim of the summer course programme is to provide quality professional development courses in curricular areas or other relevant aspects relating to primary education.</P>
        <P>Every summer up to 600 courses, catering for approximately 20,000 teachers, are organised in Ireland.  The majority of teachers are entitled to three EPV days during the following school year.  Substitute cover is not available for EPV days.  Since the early 1990s the parameters surrounding the current programme have been the subject of ongoing review to ensure its relevance to the work of primary schools and its effectiveness, given that absence from school on EPV days can result in considerable disruption to the day-to-day management of schools.  The most significant development has been the establishment of criteria and an applications process which is rigorously implemented.  Applications are assessed by primary inspectors who also monitor and report on up to 10% of courses each year.  Over the years, exceptions were made and EPV days were granted for other purposes, including attendance at language or professional development courses abroad and voluntary work, either teaching or working in hospitals or orphanages in Africa or India.</P>
        <P>With regard to the awarding of EPV for experience abroad during the summer months, a distinction has now been made between professional development courses and voluntary work.  The voluntary work which teachers engage in during the summer is, of course, to be lauded and the generosity of Irish teachers in giving of their time to such work is acknowledged.  While this work may contribute to the development of teachers&rsquo; knowledge, skills and cultural experiences, the nature of the work or experience can vary considerably.  For this reason, the decision was taken to discontinue the granting of EPV in all circumstances except those where the criteria obtaining for the approval of a course in Ireland can largely be met.</P>
        <P>The main aim of this realignment is to ensure that teachers who benefit from EPV days, which are granted without substitution cover, are actually involved in professional development courses which are organised in accordance with defined criteria.  An essential element of the current process is the degree to which the course is directly related to the teacher&rsquo;s work in the school.  While the changes to the granting of EPV days to teachers have just been published and will come into effect for 2009, it is intended to keep them under review.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am gobsmacked by the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  I do not understand the reason that this course has been discontinued.  The only reason given is that the &ldquo;nature of the work or experience can vary considerably&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  Does it mean some of it is good and some of it is bad?  Will the Minister expand on the reply?  What is the reason for it being discontinued?  The only reason given in the reply is the one I mentioned.  Does that mean some of the experiences are not as good as others?  If that is the case, let us retain the good ones and eliminate the bad ones.  There is no reason given in the speech for the discontinuation of the allowance of EPV days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister intends to keep this decision under review.  From my experience in the Department, the decision was also taken in the context of the need to cut back on expenditure across the board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That would have been a more honest answer.</P>

	<P>I will refer the Senator&rsquo;s more specific question to the Minister.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to send me a reply by letter?</P>

	<P>I will.</P>

	<P>No, but I am as happy as I can be.</P>
